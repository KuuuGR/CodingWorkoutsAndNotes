Yes, you can run these tests using Xcode, Apple's Integrated Development Environment (IDE), but unfortunately you can't directly run unit tests in Swift Playgrounds. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open Xcode and create a new project. You can select iOS Single View App, for example, and name it whatever you like.

2. After your project is created, Xcode should have automatically generated a test target for your project. You can find it in the project navigator on the left side. It will be named something like `YourProjectNameTests`.

3. In the test target, you'll see a file named `YourProjectNameTests.swift`. Open that file. Inside, you should see a class `YourProjectNameTests` that is a subclass of `XCTestCase`.

4. Inside this class, you can write your test methods. They should start with the word `test`.

5. Copy your `sleepIn` function and `SleepInTests` class into this file.

6. To run your tests, you can use the diamond-shaped play button next to your test method, or you can use the `Product > Test` menu item (or its keyboard shortcut: `Command + U`).

Remember, unit tests are an important part of software development, as they help verify that your code works as expected, and they can help prevent regressions when you make changes to your code.

I put all stuff in test class: 

Your code is almost correct. However, `sleepIn(_:_:)` function should not be inside the `XCTestCase` subclass. It should be a part of your main application's code or any Swift file in your main target, not in the test target. The reason is that you should be testing the functions as they are used in your application, not creating new ones in your test cases.

The function names in your test class starting with `test` are actually the test cases that the testing framework will execute. For instance, `testSleepIn()` is one of your test cases. It's a convention and requirement in XCTest that all test case methods begin with the word `test`. This way, the XCTest framework can identify which methods to run as tests.
