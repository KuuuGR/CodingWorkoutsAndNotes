notes: 360:
Based on the transcription, here are the key notes regarding handling a legacy project with zero tests:

1. **Approach to Legacy Code**:
    
    - Don't run away from legacy code; there's nothing inherently wrong with it.
    - Embrace legacy projects and work with them.
2. **Adding Tests**:
    
    - Start adding tests at the next point where the codebase needs to change.
    - For new features, use test-driven development (TDD) to ensure the feature is built with testing in mind.
    - When modifying an existing feature, add tests around the code that will change before making the actual changes.
    - Write tests that you trust and then make the changes with confidence.
3. **Handling Bugs**:
    
    - When fixing a bug, write a test that proves the bug exists, which also shows that you understand the problem.
    - After writing the test, fix the bug so that the test passes.
4. **Gradual Improvement**:
    
    - Add tests gradually as part of the ongoing development process.
    - Aim to improve the codebase incrementally with each change; strive for better, not worse.
    - Make small, manageable improvements rather than attempting large refactors at once.
5. **Refactoring Tips**:
    
    - Improvements should be minor and achievable in minutes, not hours.
    - Example given: Decoupling components (like using an HTTP client) for better testability, which can be done quickly.
6. **Business Alignment**:
    
    - Get buy-in from stakeholders by continuing to deliver value while improving the codebase.
    - Avoid halting development for extensive periods just for refactoring or adding tests.
    - Show progress through continuous delivery of product enhancements alongside code improvements.
7. **Long-Term Vision**:
    
    - Understand that cleaning up a legacy codebase is a long-term endeavor that can take months or even a year, but it's crucial to keep shipping value.
    - Ensure that the process of improvement is integrated into the daily workflow.
    - Aim for consistent, small improvements—1% better every day.
8. **Team Culture**:
    
    - Encourage every team member to join the mission of making the code a bit better with each contribution.
    - Foster a collaborative environment where code improvement is a collective responsibility.
    - With everyone working towards the same goal, the legacy codebase will improve more quickly.

The speaker emphasizes the importance of integrating testing and refactoring into the regular development cycle, making sure that business value is continually delivered while gradually improving the codebase.

Notes:
**Advantages:**

1. **Commitment to Learning:** The developer demonstrated a strong commitment to learning and improving their skills, as evidenced by their participation in the Essential Developer Academy and their effort to apply learned concepts in the project.
2. **Attention to Detail:** Attention to detail in certain parts of the project, such as cleaning up the AppDelegate and ensuring a smooth scrolling performance, was noted as a positive aspect.
3. **Clean Code and Architecture:** The project was recognized for its adherence to clean code principles and solid architecture, suggesting a thoughtful and deliberate approach to coding.

**Drawbacks:**

1. **Complexity in Certain Implementations:** Some implementations, such as the use of OperationQueue for image loading, added unnecessary complexity and were not fully understood or justified by the developer.
2. **Lack of Comprehensive Testing:** With a test coverage of 42%, certain functionalities and aspects of the project were not thoroughly tested. Notably, the lack of UI tests was pointed out as an area for improvement.
3. **Missed Opportunities for Efficiency:** There were missed opportunities to optimize the project, such as not canceling image requests when cells were reused, leading to potential inefficiencies and race conditions.

**Tips and Advice:**

1. **Explain Your Decisions:** When making architectural or design decisions, especially in a project for an interview, it's crucial to explain your reasoning. This helps reviewers understand your thought process and the trade-offs you considered.
2. **Opt for Simplicity When Appropriate:** While it's important to demonstrate your ability to write clean, architecturally sound code, it's equally important to avoid overengineering, especially for simple features or when the added complexity does not provide substantial benefits.
3. **Pay Attention to UI/UX Details:** Even small details like the aspect ratio of images or the initial presentation of a search screen can impact the user experience and the reviewers' perception of your attention to detail.

**Lecture Content:** The session involved a detailed review of an interview test project for a senior iOS developer position. The project requirements included creating an application using the Flickr API, with features such as a two-column scrollable view, image search functionality, pagination, and storing search history.

**Main Challenges:**

1. **Balancing Complexity and Requirements:** One of the main challenges was deciding how complex the solutions should be, given the project requirements, and whether certain implementations (like using Core Data for simple storage needs) were overkill.
2. **Ensuring Efficient Resource Management:** Properly managing resources, such as canceling image download requests when cells are reused, was identified as a critical aspect, especially for a senior developer position.
3. **Test Coverage and Quality Assurance:** Achieving comprehensive test coverage and ensuring that all parts of the application are properly tested (including handling async operations in tests) was a challenge noted during the review.

**Importance and Usefulness of the Topic:** The review session underscored the importance of clean code, efficient resource management, and comprehensive testing in software development. It highlighted how attention to detail, clear communication of decisions, and understanding the trade-offs in architectural choices are crucial, especially for senior developer roles.

**Accomplishments:** The developer successfully built a functioning application that met the basic requirements of the project. The application demonstrated good adherence to clean code principles and solid architectural practices. The developer's commitment to learning and applying best practices was evident throughout the session.

**Summary of the Content:** The mentoring session provided an in-depth code review of an interview test project, focusing on code quality, architectural decisions, resource management, and testing. It offered constructive feedback, highlighted areas for improvement, and emphasized the importance of explaining design decisions and avoiding unnecessary complexity.

**Interesting Quotes or Insightful Sentences:**

- "It's important to explain your reasoning behind certain architectural choices to avoid misunderstandings and demonstrate your thought process to reviewers."
- "Efficiency in resource management, such as canceling unnecessary requests, is crucial and can be a deciding factor, especially for senior-level positions."
- "While aiming for clean code and solid architecture is commendable, it's equally important to ensure that the added complexity is justified and serves a clear purpose."

hello everyone welcome to a live dev mentoring session in these sessions we help students of
the essential developer academy to solve any software development problems they're facing
today we're helping our student vitar hello hello hi thank you for joining us
also with us mike instructor in the academy and bogdan instructor in the academy as
well yeah hello everyone hello hello guys
so guitar for how long have you been a software developer well i started
since i was 13 started programming as a hobby
after that i went to high school studied computer science and after that
to college since 2010 so professionally i have
around seven years of working experience as a software engineer but
there's more years because i started as a hobby but in ios development around
four years four years ios nice since the led of 2018
started ios development awesome awesome and today we review an
interview test project that is sent to a company which position was the interview for
i was applying to senior position yeah okay
senior position okay let's look at the requirement first
and then we can discuss the project
so they ask you to create an application that uses the flickr image search api
and shows the results in a two column scrollable view okay
in swift users should be able to search images
okay so there's search element so if you open the app what should you see just a search screen
okay lace loading
only loads what's needed at the time so if you load the images only load the images that you need
on screen to save bandwidth nice
and it should automatically request more images so paginate right as you scroll it should paginate and load more pages
okay and if you have a history of past search terms
so if you search something you should store it right yes just just for it's uh
the search terms i i just i started this and aside the core data
okay so use code data here
okay feel free to use any technologies or third-party libraries that you are
comfortable with okay that's rare usually companies ask don't use third-party libraries
did you use any no no okay
cool so feel free to use any technologies
okay priorities deliver working application always always in an interview for everyone that is watching this video
your app should work a lot of people focus too long in trying to clean up the code and they get stuck
and you know with architectural decisions and they send a project that doesn't even compile like you're not going to pass the interview like this it
needs to work quick solutions are acceptable so they
are open to you know just quick and dirty solutions given the time constraints
just be ready to discuss your choices okay focus on clean code and architecture
okay quick solution is acceptable but yes okay it's a bit
contradicting here right yeah it's like you can do whatever you want
but focus on clean code and architecture
make good use of this text to demonstrate and show off your coding skills okay when companies
say show off it's pretty much like don't be afraid of over engineering to show your skills i think is it i don't know like show us
there's a bit you know there's some contradicting elements here okay
deliverables it should deliver the source code of the project and a set of instructions if there are any
project specific configurations if you have any dependencies you know it's always important if
your project has any specific configuration they need to do like it needs to be clearly defined
but ideally you should like the interviewer should be able to just download your project clone it from a
github repository press command r and it should run you know if they need to do too many like setups and configuration
and install dependencies maybe it's not going to be good for you
okay so we expect requirements to be delivered within four to six hours
okay that's a bit yeah it's not short
actually uh when i implemented this project i was on
holiday so i very i was too upset because i didn't
pass because i took some my holiday free time my my free time to work in
this project so yeah it took me three days actually to finish
it not six hours okay so would you say like working around eight hours a day three days
uh not eight hours exactly it's around four or five so okay because i was on
vacation so but for i deliver it in three days okay so let's say it took
between 12 to 15 hours to come yes yes okay around that it was an investment
you're wearing holidays but you're investing in your career right so just look at the positive
right so yeah four to six hours like a bit
short you would be using a bunch of libraries like sure if use kingfisher to load the images and
use a little fire to load some stuff and then you put everything together with a bunch of libraries probably with no tests you could
do something quick but i don't think that was the goal when you're trying to pass the interview show your skills just
by putting a bunch of libraries together but they were open for it right they were open to for you to use any
third-party dependencies so for me uh i don't like use any third
parties because if there is i don't do i don't want to depend on any
outsource libraries because it's will be deprecated or and
you know it's uh it's with a lot of issues yeah we recommend also to avoid
third-party libraries especially the ones that you don't need you know like things that are small they can become problematic in the future but there's
nothing wrong using libraries like they can really help you go faster but at least in your architecture you create a
boundary so your application doesn't depend on it too much if it depends the problem is if you depend too much on a
library and then it goes outdated or there's a problem or a bug or security issue then it's difficult to get rid of it or
replace it but if you create a good boundary it's okay to use libraries and get the extra
speed of getting a ready solution right so there's nothing wrong with using dependencies as long as you know
what you're doing and you're separating your application from it so i think there is a bit of a mismatch
here of what they were looking for the way they work it looks like they probably internally there is a lot of
libraries from what they write here they use a bunch of libraries and they expect things to be done very quickly with
although they say attention to detail like clean code and tests i it doesn't feel like that's what they do
in the day-to-day work from the interview so maybe it was a bit of a mismatch of what you're looking for how you like to work with them like there's
no wrong everyone works the way they like to work right you care more about things that maybe they don't care too
much about because if they're expecting four to six
hours okay so however please keep in mind that this is not a speed test take your time
okay so if they ask you to provide how much
time it took you to deliver so if you say i took 12 to 15 hours
maybe like oh no you should have used kingfisher and put a bunch of libraries together and
finish quickly no tests let's see crucial points write clean
production ready code okay write comments
okay i don't know if it's because they like to work like this or because they want you to explain your reasoning because in interviews sometimes they ask
you to write comments not because you should write comments because your code ideally should be as much as
possible you know like explaining itself it should be clean enough that you can understand it
but maybe they were asking you to write comments to just explain oh i did this decision here because of that but
it's unclear why they say write comments
yeah yeah right tess okay so they care about that's nice
avoid over engineering although they say go and show off your excuse
okay so try to avoid too many steps to make
the application compile nice as we said like we should open the project command r
should run the app yeah that's the best experience for the interviewer
so when finished send the github repository to your contact person okay did you send github repository
yeah make sure the link is accessible public okay or private and you give them
access also send the assignment as if we can also send as a zip file but make sure
you include a commit history okay and this is important a lot of people like you ask send please send a
your link to a git repository and someone sends a zip file with no commit history
you know like it's always good to read the instructions and send exactly what they asked
all right and what was the feedback you got
positive aspects so here's your project so anyone that is watching this session now we are live
here if you want to get the project you can find it here on this link
okay so they were happy solid principles implementation clean code sports landscape and dark mode no
third-party libraries okay so it was a positive so although they say you could use it they were happy that you didn't
yeah you wrote unit tests nice no pods so they see no pods as a benefit it's a
positive aspect nice very smooth scoring performance when scrolling on first go cool
now the improvement areas no ui tests
did you feel the requirement the need to write ui tasks or are you covered enough with unit tests that you uh
for me uh they didn't mention to write ui tests
uh so i didn't write even though i
i i think about it to write actually your eye test but as i told you i was in
during holidays so just facing rushing times to accomplish to finish
the project so maybe i in the past i should use
right ui test yeah even it's not too difficult to write ui
test i don't know i personally wouldn't if someone wears ui tests i would rather
have much more unit tests than ui tests because again we're going to be reviewing this code the way we would
reveal we're an essential developer right mike and bogdan as well so
would you guys be expecting ui tests in a project like this just loading a bunch of images what kind of ui tests do you
need there you can cover everything with unit tests there are some interactions in some applications that ui test is
pretty welcome but that's like very few cases and you can cover most of the
things with unit tests like you wouldn't need ui tests for a simple application like
this so i don't think that's an improvement area if you covered enough tests with unit tests
yeah yeah yeah i mean the other thing is like maybe they work you know only with ui tests in their everyday operations
you know and they they just don't don't do unit tests you know okay it's nice to submit unit
tests but you know let's get real and yeah okay yeah
if that's how they work then maybe it's already a mismatch like that's why i
tell everyone that sends a project like write the code the way you would like to work with them you know like if you
don't think the ui test is the way like we teach that there are better solutions and you only resort to ui tests when
there's the actual needs in cases that are really necessary that you cannot cover things
properly with unit tests then you write your code like that you know because then if they reject you at
least you're not going to get a job in a position in a place you will be unhappy you know because if they're writing a lot of
you ui tests probably their ci will take hours to complete you know it's very common to join teams and like
they have a very slow delivery pace although they finish features in three four hours it takes them 10 hours to
integrate because they take shortcuts in some places and you know i'm not saying that they do i don't know i don't even
know which company this is but just saying that yeah i i find it weird to this
the way i would look at projects like i wouldn't expect ui tests for a flickr
api simple app you know but they do so
there's a mismatch here as well the the thing is at least in in my experience that
some teams relying heavily on ui tests don't know don't think this is a problem
so unless somebody tells you that i don't know a one hour build plus tests is too much
you you don't know like you you think well how how else can i can i do the test
and it's a like it's not a point of debate it's just the
only thing they they know how to do and they say oh but it's much better than manual
testing and that's right like instead of having some manual qa do that you you
put your app through some ui tests but we've talked about this many times like
what the downsides of ui tests are and yeah
yeah we're like companies yeah go ahead i work in companies i just joined them
and they have like a four hours uh ci pipeline and
of course they were flaky tests and then it just rebranded or always which test failed and you say that oh this test
failed okay just ignore it if you know like and then start ignoring tests it takes too long and
you lose the benefits of having a test suite it gets in the way so people start ignoring everyone they start you know
stop running they start doing ci skip to do delivery faster
and and that's the problem and i remember they they didn't think it was a problem
you know and they bought new machines and maybe they brought it down to two hours and they were extremely happy it's not only takes
two hours and for me was like no it should take like minutes or seconds even
you know so it's a culture i think it's the word for it right it's like
exactly how they'd like to work and to your point imagine just imagine this
scenario like guitar is you're used to unit tests more than ui tests and you you go into that team like
you you probably won't fit at first because they expect you to write ui like they say okay
you're gonna write some unit tests but we don't have a good unit test coverage and everything we don't rely on
them so we expect you to do a ui test because that's how we like the culture
kyle's mentioning so the the i don't think this is a problem with
your project it's something that they care for in their culture and
of course they didn't say it in the requirements but they were expecting ui tests because that's probably how they
work so you see immediately it's like kyle said you you write the project in the way you would like to work and if it's
not a good match then no problem yes
now there's a lot of things that are not said in the test
like requirements they sent to you how to know them how to know they care
about ui tests so for everyone that is watching here this is important how to know what people want if they
don't tell you in the test project you will before when you join a company or even process of
interviewing you will research them you will check the website they usually have a tech blog you would see who works
there do they have blogs what are they blogging about what do they care about if they care about ui test their tech
blog will be full of how we optimize our ui tests to go from two hours to one hour
how we do fast ui tests and how we cover you know our code base with ui tests and then okay they care about ui tests
so that's how you you know the things they don't tell you research
and nowadays like most companies have tech blogs it's easy to to find
or if you if you yeah i was going to say that if you don't find that information publicly then you can just
ask during the interview process like okay can you tell me a bit about your dev process like how do you test how you
deliver like what's your maybe what does a regular development day look like
stuff like that so then you at least i i asked this uh i'd like to know up up front
how they work and again if it's a feat or not because
you want to avoid a situation where you're forced into some practices that you don't don't want to do
yes like for me yes if i read the top description and i gonna check their tech blog and i see
they're crazy about ui tests my interest in the company will drop a lot
unless in the interview they say that they need someone that can come there and help them improve their ci cd
process and speed up because they are having issues with ui tests and they need someone with expertise of replacing ui
tests with faster alternatives then i was like okay that's my skill i
can get a code base that is completely messy and have slow builds and i can make it better and they're looking for
it and then it matches my skill set and what i like to do right but if you said no they're happy with it
and that's how they work and they expect it to work like that and if you don't like it like it's all you're ready don't even waste your holidays doing a project
right yes yes
uh actually i've learned this i've learned by by in hard way this is listen actually
so it's the last month uh i also applied for
senior position for other companies and
i start reading their uh blog
you know on the website so uh after watching the monitoring session
for code interview inside the academy so i follow this
instructions to applying for a job
right yes yes yeah really recommend you do it it will save you time it will help you focus on
the the right companies for you so you can put more energy in the right direction you know
yeah so this one for me it's like that's not a problem at all for this kind of application you really
don't need ui tests if you covered enough with your unit tests then nibs instead of code which is not
the best choice for large teams again culture right inside the company they don't like nibs or storyboards they
prefer code if you check their blog maybe you're talking about these you know you see their maybe they have open source
projects that you can look at and you see that they never use nibs or storyboards so this is an indication
that they don't care about it but again like maybe if you use everything called
another company they would say oh you should have used storyboards you know that's why it's culture like because
it's subjective to the team image in collection cell is small
okay that's appearance wise i don't think that should disqualify you they wouldn't say oh we're not going to
hire him because he put an image in collection there's too small you know this is just a comment i don't think it's
just a question do you think because i didn't apply ui test and i used naps
instead of code it's enough to reject rejected me i mean if you just
make some other interview and discuss my solution in i2i you know face-to-face
maybe they they took that i have some skills and leadership skills because it's senior
position not genuine or with seniors
this position it's not depends just for coding skills you know for
behavioral skills so do you think this because i didn't
apply ui test or i didn't write
the ui in code it's enough reason i know
in my personal opinion no because i don't care about ui tests in this specific scenario right i don't think
it's necessary but maybe for them it's very necessary like that's how they work that's why
it's hard to say but i don't think so especially nibs like maybe white tess i
would have a higher like bigger weight in their decision but like instead of cold i think they just put
here as a comment hey we don't like nibs you know and they they made it very clear but maybe your
tests have had an impact in that but because you had unit tests it's not like if you had like zero tests i'll say
okay that that's that probably could disqualify you for a senior position
but you didn't do ui tests but use unit test at least as an alternative
did you unit test at least like a view controller for example to test like the interaction with
you know like cells and like how you create cells and things okay so like you covered at least some
parts but you need to look at the coverage what is the coverage in the project
uh i think it's 42 42. i know it's uh it's not fully tested at
the testable but slow it's low so
it's like if you have only 42 unit tests you probably should have written some ui tests to kind of you know cover some
from a higher level point if you cannot get that coverage with unit tests you know because there's a lag there's
like 58 there's no covert right yeah so i think that missing coverage
they maybe were expecting ui tests at least so there is a huge gap like more than half of your code is not
checked at all by any automation right i think that could be a problem yes
and that's even just the coverage number we don't know exactly the number of our certs so
there might be a test layer which is just executed but not asserted so
yeah it could be less than yeah depending on the test because like just having like 42 coverage just means that
those lines were exercised while running tests like but it doesn't mean that their assertions were good enough actually
checking for behavior so usually the number you see here the actual coverage is less than the number
you see it will depend really on the quality of your assertions the quality of your
stats setups you know the quality of your design to make sure that it's easy to test
it's i want to to add something like guitar i i feel like i i know how how it is to be
rejected in interviews and it's hard to it's hard to chew like you
you start to think about it what's the reason like but it i i don't think you
can pinpoint to to an exact reason and they you don't have any clue on how
these guys think like it might be they didn't like you in the live
interview and then they just i don't know sent you some feedback like there can be so many things i knew at
least once i screwed up an interview because i got into a fight with the interviewer about some
apple concept and i was right not really but we kind of got into a
contradiction and i was right i wouldn't i wouldn't write down
and what what did that do to to help me like they they rejected me
probably because of that that's the only explanation i could find
so yeah i'm saying i i know at least for me and probably for you as well it's hard to to
take the rejection but just like it's really hard to to
to know why they did it yes some companies would not give you any feedback those guys were
decent enough to provide you with some feedback which is in line with the project you sent so
it's not made up it's pretty pretty accurate so the best thing to do here is to i
don't know swallow up the the pride and just you know see what you can improve that's
that's it like it's hard but you got to do it yes definitely
what you learned from from this experience as well you know so it doesn't happen again next time because i agree
you know with pokedown like it's it's you cannot read minds here you know so
uh you need to be careful with what you learn because maybe you're going to say oh what i learned here is that i need to
write you a test what i learned here is that i should always use code and not nibs and maybe that's not correct for
that team yes but for others maybe it's not right so you need to be
very careful with what you learn with the interview if you start tailoring for the feedback you got in the interview maybe
you end up in a team that you're not happy with right yeah yeah and what i meant here was specifically you know like if you have
these questions ask them you know like okay if you're afraid oh perhaps it's going to be like the previous one and
should i use nibs you know it's like rolling the dice you know like what are you going to do nibs storyboards
programmatically so yeah just go ahead proactively and ask
them you know hey hey guys i can i can do everything you know like is there is there something specific that you're looking
for to see right this sort of thing or you know about
testing strategies and all that um yeah you usually have a call with them
right before the test project usually have a call with them maybe you can start asking as much questions as
possible before the test project like what is as bogdan said before like what is your
testing strategy like what is the development process all of this will start dictating if you want to work
there if it matches what you're looking for and also how to do the test project
more tailored to that company you know if you like that team like impress them
based on what they they care about and also like sometimes you did perfect
in the interviews your test was good but like the the position was dropped internally
because of some budget issues and they just need to provide feedback oh we decided to go with another candidate
it's like no it's just because they don't want to say hey we lost budget we are going down you know no one's going
to say that like this happens a lot sometimes they open positions just because they want to
promote someone internally and they you know by requirements of the company
they need to open a position to see if there's people in the market with better skills before they hire someone and they
have these fake interviews just to have on paper that they did it and you're just a mock there you know
like it happens but since they provide you feedback it looks like they really looked at it and
went a bit the extra mile but you actually never know what happened you never know the decision making behind it so
don't beat yourself with it like no let's move on exactly i think yes i think productive
comes from like oh what if i have used nibs instead you know like no don't go there
maybe you passed and then you were unhappy there for the next five years of your life you know
yes yes thank you you don't know so there's there's definitely a team that will
reject you because you write ui tests and you you you write all the
ui from code so you don't know like the guy said you have to
ask you can't make assumptions or like steer it in the other direction in your
next interview because they might be the opposite so yes
yes definitely if we impress them like they can even like things that they care about in
their culture just like okay we like this person so much that we can you know like we can ignore some things here so
focus well on the basics on the testing strategies like high coverage and you
you have like performance in your code and there are no bugs it runs well you
know it looks nice so image in collection sounds more like
like no one would ever discard a candidate because of that so this is just the beginner places yes
just pretend it's not here core data is pretty overkill for such a
small project so what are you storing in the core data search terms
search terms what strings yes strings array of strings
yes okay yeah so here i need to agree with them
that it's pretty overkill to store an array of strings in chord data because there is no like relationships of
objects it's not like an object graph right it's not a complex that you need to do querying you need to do any
advanced like paging with faulting to keep memory low no it's just a small list of strings
so what do you suggest to use
memory store in memory oh no in memory it would
not persist across application runs right so if you close the app open again it would not be there so you wouldn't
meet the requirement they asked so you can store an array of strings you know even like if it's a very small
array of strings like what like 10 strings could even be user default you know
actually i i thought about i i think about you
you you use user default not core data but i
thought maybe they want to show off yeah yeah yeah that's the contradicting part like okay
i can use user defaults no i want to impress them they told me to show off so yeah i'm gonna use car data so you
know like okay i see because i i thought about it actually to
use user default but yeah it's just not one of those areas you know because again like it's very
small amount of data very simple uh so
yeah like a simple solution uh it it needs to be a simple solution
right yeah but i get it you know no sensitive uh small
amounts of data user default like because user defaults is stored as
a plain text file like a dictionary so it's not encrypted so if it's no
sensitive like don't start passwords don't store access tokens in the user defaults but a list of strings for
caching that's that's okay it's not you're not gonna have thousands of strings or even thousands of strings should be fine but like you're never
gonna get there with search terms usually because you recycle you only keep the less 30 the less 10
because also showing a list of a thousand store search terms is not helpful to anyone right so
usually you store it just a few like 10 20. it's very small non-sensitive amounts of data user defaults
now restoring larger amount of data they don't need any complexity like
storage for example images can store images in the file system so larger amounts of data but simple like an image
is just a blob of no binary you just store it in the file system and that's it
it's easy to also delete it it's efficient it's not in memory so you can get it when needed
that's it even i used core data but my solution it
was replaceable so you should just use any kind of storing mechanism
because i i i applaud what i've what i've learned from you from you guys from the course
so the project built in modular ways so you can
use any kind of historic mechanism so i thought maybe if we made some kind
interview between me and them to discuss about
what i what i've done you know all right so maybe if you explain that
in the written message because you can see you have a readme here you don't explain well yes they ask you to describe like the decisions you made and
everything use comments so here it was a perfect place and say i decided to go with core data to show off my skills
but for a simple amount of data could even use user defaults and to make sure that i have a clean
architecture and my application is well designed i created a boundary that is not coupling my application with core
data which means i can easily replace it with a file system implementation or with user defaults without changing
anything in my application yeah now you explain the problem you avoided that they calling it over queue
but it didn't explain it so they opened a project like okay he needs to store an array of strings and he's using core data maybe he
doesn't know how to make decisions just because you didn't explain it you do know how to make decisions but you didn't explain it
so they made an assumption and their assumption was wrong to avoid the interviewers making wrong assumptions be
upfront about things always explain your reasoning because even if you're right but they don't understand what you did
you're wrong yes yes definitely
and you can explain if they ask like okay how would you decide user defaults no sensitive small amounts of data file system large larger
amounts of data but simple data no no queries like you can store maybe some json files csv files
now when you need a database like or data around sqlite it's when you have more complex
object graphs they have relationships and you want to do queries no complex queries
get all the objects the user id is to limit by 10 objects the top 10 you know
then you need a more robust solution you can query it has relationships
you know what else here you can do like paging with faulting
which is much more efficient when you paginate and only getting the daytime memory that you need
but this is very complex for just an array of strings so to show off no problem using core
data but you should have explained that that would be best
also explain you have a good architecture you can replace it easily you know you created a boundary there like what
user protocol right so yeah explain it that that would be best
unless no images are fetched offline i didn't see this in the requirement and what does it mean to fashion image
offline i think caching maybe apply some caching mechanism
but in memory not stored offline okay it's just a weird i would
like cached to show offline okay
yep here it could even be like a maybe an in-memory caching
not load the images every time you scroll right you could have an in-memory caching
that would work or fine but if you close the app and open again you would not be there but i find it weird to have
caching images in a flickr app because flickr api never returns the same results every time you query something
you get a completely different list so why would you cache something that is only going to be shown once the only reason is to prevent making too
many requests as you're scrolling in the same uh search term
and doing any memory caching in this case is just fine
in memory caching could be a solution here but i don't know if they meant like they actually wanted to cache in the file
system to be able to use it when we opened it i
i thought to store it in in core data actually
but i as you as you mentioned it's not a
flicker not doesn't return the same result of data every time so
i didn't store it uh in core data but i have this idea to store it in memory but i didn't
i did so this is important yes you said i thought about it everything you think
about during the session you're gonna write down and put in the readme you made a lot of decisions that they
don't know about they were good decisions based on informed you know for they were informed decisions
so everything you think about you will write down you're going to say i thought about caching the images on
car data as well but i noticed that the flicker api always
returns different images so there is no point in caching something that's going to be shown once
another solution would you just keep it in memory to avoid reloading the images as i scroll
but i didn't implement it because of the requirements and timing time constraints but i know that this is a possibility
and this is where i would do it in my architecture and you explain how you would do it so sometimes
you they say don't implement more than needed they didn't ask this so you shouldn't implement it but if you
think about it if you thought about it you should have written down a nice explanation how you would do it
some nice features i would like to see in this app you write you know things we could do going forward
it's always nice to show that your architecture accommodates change accommodates new requirements
you know in the future i i thought because uh after making uh submitting the code as a
subject they would say there are some coding interview to review my code so i thought maybe i would discuss my
solutions and why what my thought to them was they just rejected me and
by email so that's why but i i learned my lesson
so right in the readme so they cannot reject your readme yes
i just made some wrong assumptions oh i don't agree with these requests
they made here as like improvement areas because one was not a requested feature and they say do not implement more than
needed because of their requirements there are interviews that if implemented more than needed they will say
you didn't pass the interview because implemented more than needed because imagine you are at work and you are required to implement something
implement more than it is you wasted team time you wasted the company's time so it's a filter that you wasted time
doing something that was not needed so it this can be in the interview so it's very conflicting what what the
improvement areas they're saying with the requirements and the language they used before it's not aligned it looks
like the person who wrote the requirements is not the person that reviewed it or the reviewer didn't even read what was the requirement for the
projects and this happens as well you know this happens sometimes the who wrote the the requirements it was even the
developers like a recruiter copied from the internet paste it there and then they sent the
projects to the developers and they it doesn't match what the developers want how they work and what was in the
requirements so this can happen as well so i don't think it was a problem as
well because i don't think it was needed
but if you thought about it write it down so the main feedback was that your
current assignment is quite clear and simple apart from the usage of card data okay
caching is not working when offline so they were expecting offline caching
of the images although they didn't ask for it so yeah weird
all the images are not being shown anymore and the test coverage is quite low with 42 percent well
that's why they probably talked about the ui tests
okay cool so it was overall positive just some
improvements you could have made that would get to that position
but i still think that maybe there's a mismatch in how they work and how you would like to work so maybe
it was good not to pass but yes we never know maybe it would be a
good thing so let's look at the project now saying the github link there's the git
history 105 commits nice it's very common that people have one
commit you know yeah you get a project and say please send the commit history and they sent and
there is one commit initial commit with all the files
i've tried to work in tdd discipline so
nice yes you down small changes yeah awesome yeah if i'm revving this code
it's already a bonus you know see the process small commits no test by test very nice
you explained a little bit here i think you should have spent more time
yes in the read me here cool
so simple he has one project the source code production files and test
files that's it like i like it it's simple i like the commit history
nice so improve the instructions only
project is clean let's look at the setup
one application target one unit test target no ui test okay good if
you don't write ui tests delete that unnecessary target nice one
is the setup clean up delegate clean
no messy commented out code you know when you create a project you get get a bunch
of like methods with comments you clean it up that's nice it shows that you go the extra mile you
care okay is the composition
using core data okay do you have any unused files
unnecessary things i don't think so it looks pretty clean okay so folder structure and project
structure is clean very nice simple one app target one test target that's that's all you need for interviews
no warnings let me build no warnings run the tests command you no build
errors tests are passing okay
how long did it take to finish was quite fast look at this you never ever will have this speed with ui tests
even i i thought to use like you for a
framework to separate the api and domain layer but i
think it's it will be complicated and because you mentioned you always mention it to record
interview keep it simple so so just i wanted to in one project
yes it's very important keep it simple unless they ask for you to create like oh separate
modules show that you know if they ask sure if they don't keep it simple look how fast those tests are i really like
this what's yourself 42 42 yeah but even
let's say even if you have 100 coverage you actually tested everything with unit tests let's say it would be 0.1
you know if you have one ui test in your project it will take at least one to two
seconds yeah because it needs to create a boot a new application wait for the test even if
the test does nothing you know so that's why i prefer unit test is ko is
much better you have much more control of the environment that's the preferred choice that's the
base of the pyramid like most of your tests will be unit tests when really needed you're going to write ui
tests but only when needed in this application i don't believe it's needed because you can cover all these functionalities they asked with unit
tasks but you should have the coverage otherwise yes you know
yes definitely will not be good enough okay so it's fast no warnings no test failures
now the coverage 42 so it's missing some things
now are the tests well before we look at the test before i
look at the code what's important thing does the app work okay i can run it
okay as we said we have an empty list when we open
so if i'm reloading what am i reloading here if there's nothing on the screen
i think this is a bug okay yes and this is the
keywords like bookmark okay
okay did they send you the design or you just came up with it no no just anything you could think of
okay because i would expect like to click on search and see the
search results here rather than having to navigate somewhere to see the keywords
but it's about user experience here yes yes but yeah that that would i think that would be the expectation that you click
on search and you it already pre-fills the last 10 search terms right
so this is just a ux detail that could show that you you would implement like best
practices okay so if i search here for something what should i search cut
a life cut cat okay
cool it works yes but it's a bit stretch the image i think
you need to set the right aspect ratio right
yeah i think that wasn't one of the comments right the image is more yes
if i'm not wrong i think the flicker api returns you kind of the width and height
of the image so you could kind of use a flow layout to do like some nice like if
the image is longer than the other one it would take more space on the screen you know uh
i couldn't think about it actually but yes i think it's improving area
yeah so because i was upset because uh i like ui i
especially for any matching and working in a ui so when get comment in
to this the image is small or not big cell
for me it's i was a little bit upset about it because i consider myself
better in ui and animation stuff like that it was a lack of time i guess as well
right you're trying to rush a little bit yes on holidays excuse me yes but it's not
executes yeah yeah okay
yeah because sometimes like you know you like ux matters it's part of impressing them you know sometimes they open oh this app is so easy to use so they were
happy that the app was moved you know but this attention to detail can can add up
but sometimes you get so attached to attention to details that you don't finish the project you know you have like only three days to do it and you
you spend so much time on the ux that you never finish the project it's not building it doesn't have coverage i
would rather spend more time in the coverage than in the ux
so photos list listview controller it's a collection view controller
and you have cells do you reuse cells i think i start looking now you know in the code like
okay you're resting the cell where is the data source i think at the bottom
yeah right there okay you're using cells good and now if you're using cells i always like to check if it's reusing it
properly like if i'm loading an image and i reuse the cell
will we cancel the previous request or is there a chance that we will show the wrong image for split second i think
as i can remember i didn't apply cancer
okay this is critical for senior positions this is something that even for mid level sometimes even junior this
is critical yes the managing of the cells you know for senior there's no excuse
like you need to do that you need to to manage the the request life cycle like as you're
scrolling here you should cancel requests otherwise you can make too many requests also yes the requesting can
come in any order you're going to be showing the wrong image there so this is critical let's see if we can
simulate an issue yeah i can see it flickering yeah it changed it flicked here it showed the
wrong image and then the right i don't even know if it's the right image but like the image jumped
from one to the other and this is critical this is something that can eliminate like a
an interviewer from the process
so careful with this you can review that in the program it's in the program by the way yeah
we show you how to do exactly this yes when i when i did this project i think i was in the
middle of the program right now okay but yeah you definitely you are
right so as an exercise why don't you redo this project you know just for a personal
like you know yes and then you compare like is it better now
does it solve these problems like it'll be a nice exercise
and where do you make the requests to load the images the image cell i as i
i guess if you go to the photo collection
view cell
they're 139. i inject the
image loader okay yeah it doesn't even
it's impossible to cancel it yes you have to return a consolable for example
be able to cancel it right and then you store a reference that concealable and it before it when the cell is not on
screen anymore you cancel the request because then you stop requesting data
that you don't need anymore which was one of the requirements and for senior positions this is mandatory you know you need to manage
resources data plan you know network requests very very well
okay so yeah this should be cancelable and even not done in the cell i wouldn't do
this in the cell i rather do it in the controller like in the data source than in the cell right uh
last week uh also i made a home assignment for other company
i applied every i i i've learned from my mistakes and i applied everything
console uh make some uh cell controller to make the request
so okay since the project is uh three months ago
okay now i don't know i am better programmer right
you wouldn't do this mistake again but that's how we learned we all made these mistakes i did a mistake mike did
his mistake bogged on these mistakes you know actually guys you are the only mentor
for from me because i i plan ios development by myself i even in my company i am the only ios
engineer so so that's why i i have this silly mistake because no one tells me what
what's the right order just from you guys from the essential developer program
right yes nice guy to help and this is very common that it's very common for
developers it happened to me as well working alone a lot not having like that feedback from
someone more senior than you someone with more experience they know like an apprentice it's very like for me the best path for
developers being apprenticed have someone that knows what they're doing passing you the knowledge you know that's the
the easiest path the fastest path so we don't make like critical mistakes
okay so
you already know how to do it and it's in the program as well yes so we can move on
so let's look at the design here we have the photos list view controller
so we see any dependencies a view model
okay and then there's a view model and then we see uses the view model
and where is this service in the view model yes loader image loader
all the loaders are here okay yes we also show in the program how to decouple the view controller interview model from
loaders when yes sometimes it's helpful to do it
and since you're using also initialize an injection you can make those things private because can you actually replace them why
private and constant what's safer because it can lead to undefined behavior if you replace it
while there are some images still requests going on you will have to cancel them you know it just complicates
the design just hide it make it constant and that's it
okay so all the requests are managed in the view model so it has a bunch of services
let's do it like this
i think it was too complicated uh
yeah for this project it doesn't need it yeah even even for me for me it was too
complicated so i need to rewatch the presentation module again to
absolutely just to get yeah just be careful that there
we also we show very advanced uh solutions for cases where an extra
separation is interesting for a flicker amp maybe it's
too much you know but when you have a large application with hundreds of developers working on it then it becomes
interesting those more advanced solutions yes so that's why we also show simple solutions and more advanced solutions
and when you should use one or the other because if you go on an interview when you go to the most advanced solution we
show there it's going to be over engineering they're going to reject you know even though i i think mvvm also
too complex for this symbol up not needed yes
in vc it's fine it could be fine as well nvvm is also fine mvc
should be fine even if you use mvp it doesn't need to be the super decoupled mvp with adapters it could be just
a mod of you and a presenter you know yeah just be careful i remember another
mentoring session this week where we were reviewing another test project and one of the requirements was
where actually one of the acceptance criteria was not using mvc so some teams
are not fans of mvc not sure exactly why but it would be worth finding that out yeah
for sure maybe use mvc and it would be a point here right exactly
like used mvc
okay so you have operations okay and the cell talks to a service as well right directly
yes right
so one thing you need to fix but i already know is the aspect ratio
the canceling request as you scroll does it work the pagination yes it is
yes i applied the simplest one
okay cool it works nice and smooth as well so we're not
doing any complicated work in the main thread that's good as well that's common
that there'll be a lot of work in the main thread and you'll be laggy so bonus
points okay is there any specific area in the code
you want us to look at the uh i think we discussed the
the main stuff so everything's normal for phone i don't okay you want to see
i can see that it's using concrete types right directly maybe you should
to have protocols like don't expose details you don't need to yes i
you have a protocol use the protocol yes i would even call it flickers yeah maybe
flicker service is fine or you could call this on like photo service more generic because
the protocol is more generic and the implementation is the remote flickr
photo service right yeah because the implementation is flicker now but maybe you're going to use a different service later and this
is a way of decoupling your application from concrete unfortunately the result uses the
flicker model object 16. okay yeah
well for simplicity maybe that's okay but like you know if you say i'm creating an
architecture that will decouple from services maybe you would also the couple from flip flickr
yes just naming it's just because it's just
so flicker this is not actually flicker right this could be like a
page yeah page
yeah this is actually a page right this would be number like have a page number
number of pages per page total and then the photo so this is part of the pagination right so
you know where you are yeah just naming but maybe it's important right yes yes
yes attention to detail there you know there is like some inconsistency between how
flicker is spelled with the knee without you know yes
yeah so i mean this is important you know like especially for the senior positions
people pay attention to these things you know so yeah
okay and this is actually flicker like this
right yeah yes okay yeah attention to detail type polls
now this is a name right so i don't think it would help but you can activate the
automatic correction how's it called yeah the spelling autocorrect you know
on xcode it works pretty well it can show you like typos but it's important you know it looks
that it's tidy and the project is clean yes
i think that's why the main reasons that i want to move to other company because
i i work alone so i want to work with at least other guy to just to work in to
make some code review for for each other so that's some
main reason very important
so here you should use the services should probably be protocols to decouple from concrete
types then you have concrete implementations of those services and in the protocols try to decouple
from the specific implementations otherwise you can only have one implementation right if you say flickr then it's only
flickr if you're one day you say hey let's replace flickr with tumblr with whatever people are
using now then it's not going to work right yes
it's going to be hard and if you make these kind of decisions you explain them you explain them oh i
separated the view model with a service protocol there's no leaking
implementation details because i want my application to be decoupled from flickr as much as possible so we're not coupled
with a specific vendor we can easily replace it or if you decide to just go with a
concrete type for simplicity say for simplicity i decided to go with concrete
types with flickr but if at some point we need to use a different service i would create a
protocol to decouple it and then replace with any services we need you know you would explain your reasoning that's
important in interviews explain your decisions
because maybe some people are not going to like protocol no you shouldn't use a protocol it's a simple project just do a concrete type you know but some teams
would say like no you should use the protocol so regardless what you do 50 of the times you'll be wrong in their
eyes how do you protect against that explain your reasoning
with alternatives i did this but i could also have done that boom is 50 50 now 100
on your favor right
okay so i think that's fine if i explain your reasoning
whatever if you're using per cover concrete type that should be fine as long as testable as long as
you know you achieve that coverage as well closer to 100 they'll be better
uh the couple views from services you already have a view model man managing these so maybe
that shouldn't be necessary you know because otherwise every type depends on every type and
then you're not managing dependencies properly
we can start hiding dependencies at least from the ui
much simpler the ui without those dependencies
actually kyle if you can go back to the cell code i i really
uh i don't know it's not clear to me
what this does because we have an image service image data service that it's passed and we we discussed that
it's probably best not to do this or not to pass the service to the cell to make a request but ignoring that we we make
an asynchronous load image data on line 17 and then with the result we get which
is data wrapped in success then we do an add operation which
creates a image download operation so for for me this is a bit confusing
because i don't understand why we need two requests through different mechanisms
you maybe explain this better a bit uh
actually i couldn't remember because because i
read so i read some blog on meteor and implement
what i've read from the blog
i i can't remember actually
use operations to work in different threads
you know okay yeah so this is a part of the code base you cannot explain everything else you
were very good at explaining now imagine the interviewer would also find this weird
and then they would ask you why did you do this uh and you say i i write a blog post and i don't even remember why i did
it that that's bad for a senior position but especially right but for just to
work in different threads so that's the main reason yeah but but then you need to sketch again thread
here right i so i'm guess i'm wrong you're
downloading twice so the the line 17 will trigger a
network call that uses the http kind if we look at the code later maybe and downloads the
content of that url as a data and then online yeah just you if you
show that so that's that's sufficient um it's pretty standard and then with
that data on i think it's line 25 then we just create a ui image from it so
that's sufficient what i'm not getting it what does the other operation do that's also
downloading from the url and generating a result where we get the data again so
we unless there's something funky here we're kind of downloading the same image
twice to different mechanisms you see so it is
i mean it's not a bug in the ui but uh it's definitely wrong
to do this yes yes i rather see something like this
also if it fails maybe you should have a retry button but maybe for simplicity
yes yes but i would expect something like this right you load the image and the data is here you showing the ui that's it i
would also expect this call back maybe in the main queue already you can decorate it
like to show in the program and it should be concealable you know because
why we shouldn't be in this cell like okay kai why should i do requests in the cell
or efficiency yes it cancel a request when the cell is
out of screen for example you get these callbacks from usually from the delegate or data source
of your views so the cell doesn't have enough information to know when to store when
to cancel when to stop a request and it shouldn't have right because the cell can be reused it can be in the context
now it's very hard to keep track if the request is in the ui especially when you're using a view
so we're looking for efficiency here also this patching to the main queue can also lead to race conditions
because this is async maybe by the time this completes the cell was already used for another cell but then you're going to complete with the image you're going
to be showing the wrong image yes mixing threading
and operations and requests in the ui it's going to be very hard to get right
it's not simple so not just saying to move
requests from the cell you know because it's in the books no because there is a reason
it's important for simplicity and for the correct for getting the correct behavior
so eliminate threading as much as possible every time you have async call dispatch qa sync there will
be a thread hop and you can have data races you know race conditions
to move this outside in a way that you can cancel the requests
okay anything else here pogba no i think that that was the biggest one
and i think somebody reviewing this would notice the like it's it's some weird uh
implementation there and that's a bit unfortunate because you had everything you needed in the
uh what's it called image data service that that that's nice like decoupled from the http
client everything is is fine with that so you i really don't see a need for
for going to the operation actually i
faced some trust i struggled a lot in in this
operation so as i can remember so for me
the the most difficult stuff that in building this project it was this
so it's especially for operations a new topic from me so i
built uh i implemented for the first time so yeah
and it was not needed right so yes because that's the problem like i would tell people like be careful reading a
board of a lot of like random medium blog posts like you might be putting information in your head that you don't
need to be might be wasting time it might confuse you right because you were learning something in the academy and then you
write a blog post and try to mix them and and you got into a situation that was very complex you spent a lot of time
here you said it was the most complex part yes the application and you didn't get the results you wanted
you know and there was a lot of time there so that's why i say follow the steps
they try to avoid noise confusion you know
it's gonna help you focus and be more assertive
i was uh [Music] as how i can say it i was young
so now as i told you i last week i implemented
uh all the projects using console and handling the thread dispatching from
background to main trade writing the curator i uh by limiting
everything that i've learned from you guys so yeah so this is three months ago so
now i'm better problem also yes yeah i also like in the past got in a
lot of trouble with operation cues because i started using them before understanding them fully and yes you
know and it just got confused i i was afraid to to
to ask me or to explain just because i totally i i don't have experience in
operation so good couch
have used them blog then operation cues and services and
you can do very nice things with them i remember like the first time i i used
them like it was very hard to get it right with objective-c
right yeah so it's i think it's more of a an older
api it's still good for some use cases but i i think
some and i work on some open source project for downloading images and a bunch of other projects that are built
around that so for each image they download they create an operation like that's keeping a tread open and they do
all the networking on on that thread but that's a that's a pattern which is like
kyle said a bit older like maybe better suited for objective c code
nowadays with these new apis like you have a session you don't really need that like you don't need to to
keep a thread dedicated to an image download you just do what you do for any other
network operation like you did for i know hitting the the flickr service
you you open a url session data task and whenever that is done you
get the result like you you don't need to manage trading and synchronization of that resource like
there these new apis are so much uh easier to to use um
and yeah i i just don't think you need it um if you need to create something more
complex then yeah probably uh you might resort to to them like and
as operation queue is still valid but i don't think this is a this is a
use case for that unless we're trying to do something i don't know interesting with i know
like avoiding cancelling image downloads just you because you need to get all the
images or something like that like i'm trying to figure a scenario where you would use these downloads
even after the cell gets reused but for simplicity i think yes
so i i'm really glad because not a lot of people can say they've they've upgraded their coding skills in three
months so yeah what you're saying right now makes total sense and it's
it's cool to see like yourself looking back at the code you wrote two months ago and say okay
i'm better now now i know all these things and i don't need that and it's perfect like
this is the only only way to learn i think yes definitely congrats
awesome i think that's it that's probably if we look at
the call we could maybe
more things but i think it's very clear that the feedback they provided
simplifying a lot of things the core data maybe just url
user defaults will be better
in this case but you created a protocol right so yes where is the protocol
oh search queue okay another typo here
that's important here catch that for sure
okay so you you broke down this search
keyword store and you have a core data implementation
but the clients never use the core data directly right yes
which means you can easily replace it with a user default
keyword store or a file system keyword store that could all implement
this protocol so that's a point that is good in architecture but it didn't explain it
and they thought it was negative if you explained it that would be
resolved so the clients
however talk to the protocol only right
yes and everything composable and same delegates
cool
cool yeah so that's a good point you should
have explained and maybe you win more points with them
advancing version principle are depending directly on the concrete type we create a protocol inverted
dependence payment now the store depends on the client requirements rather than the client
depending on the store interface
so explaining your reasoning will help you a lot in the interviews
the domain try to decouple from a specific service if you think it's going to be beneficial
yes flickr could be just a page although it will still be make pretty much like the
flickr names here maybe think of a more generic way of you know you have two representations like the flicker
response yeah that they can transform into on generic app response
but maybe we'll over complicate for a simple interview project so
interview project it's fine but in a real world project you probably will not be coupled to a service that you don't
control right because they can increase the price or they can just stop existing
you don't want to depend on a service impact your
business also here since we're on this flickr
object or struct this is prob belongs better in the
api infrastructure because it's tied to the response you're going to get from the
flickr api so for your domain i don't think it's that important that
i know what the page number is and the page size and all these details like
you i think the the abstraction you created was a loader that
allows loading images and yeah you should that's what you should
be getting photos um yes so yes yes
yeah so the advice is like in this test project it's fine for simplicity to just couple maybe with a concrete type and
with the specific details of the api for simplicity but if you want to create a service
abstraction then it shouldn't leak implementation details if it doesn't implementation details and
you're creating models specifically what the app needs then you can create maybe a domain layer
if not you're coupling with specific service then you'll be in the service layer because it's a one-to-one mapping with the response
you get the json response you get from the api right yes okay
okay okay now just i think that's it for the code
i would just like to have a quick look at the tests of the coverage law i want to see if
it's testing interesting things in the application the configuration of the scene delegate
okay simple tests making sure that when you load the app it's loading the photo list view
controller that's why you don't need ui tests here very simple unit test that can assert that it's
loading the right initial configuration does if you have tests for the photo list
view controller you know that everything is wired correctly and the test runs in 0.071 seconds
the endpoint url parsing okay
here i wouldn't do it like this exactly because it's coupling with the order of parameters
right yes if you change the order you break this test yes but order doesn't matter in the
query here yes yes so to check one by one maybe yes we show
strategies there yes yes i remember that but i didn't
when i didn't finish it it's fine testing the mapping from jason to the
objects in the app okay testing for errors good a lot of people
keep their word testing so it's important to test your words
and success success as well yes okay
cool very simple easy to understand no magic perfect
hp client okay default
cool making sure hp client works core data
okay we're using a in memory or data which is pretty fast good
nice one
maybe nowadays that you have throwing tests you could use throw so it doesn't crash because this would crash if
there's a problem and stop the test execution you can just throw here
throw here if it throws it's not going to crash yes we just
got failure you know there'll be a normal pass failure so avoid for some wrapping in the test
target now it's not needed okay
so we have some helpers to perform their assertions
okay so you have an async api right retrieve you get the completion block
every time you're testing an async api and you have assertions inside of it you need to
create an expectation expectation
wait for result and you need to wait
for that expectation just short timeout here
and fulfill it here which means this will only return this method will only return after
you got a response and the assertions ran if you put a fulfill here like again
may not be ideal because you need to run the other sessions before returning this method
so every time there's an async api you need expectations to make sure it runs
otherwise it will not run because this will return immediately
this method will return immediately before this block is invoked
and then the test will return and will pass because nothing failed
let's see let's put an xct fail here
failed we also need to pass file in line in the
assertions helpers to get better feedback yes
okay so if this test fails it means that
it's working all the build failed now probably something that i changed
ah that type of okay yeah i shouldn't be reaching to the dependencies of the view model
i'm just gonna undo but that's another point we talked about
huh but if i run it in isolation as if i oh but it failed here not here
yes but even though it failed it still says it's successful because the test
returned before the assertion was executed yes which means there were
side effects running after the test finished and that's a test leak when your test finishes it
returns you shouldn't all the operations should have finished already everything should be clean otherwise it fails when
another test is running and then you have this inconsistent feedback it says passed but
no it didn't pass because the assertion was called after the test returned so this is
important to fix okay
always use an expectation
when running tests we facing kpis okay
yes definitely now we're facing a weight this is kind of solved because you need to wait a
weight you know in the test yes but when using completion blocks it's important to wait
all of them none of those are sessions that are being run and this is part of the coverage we're talking about even though
it's 42 coverage this was not actually being tested right because it was passing even with a
failure so even though there's coverage the lines were exercised this assertions
were not running okay
that's why i usually follow a pattern that we showed in the program where we capture the result and we assert outside
the block which is a way like if you have this uh habit of
only doing assertions outside completion blocks you never have this issue right it's
just a discipline way of forcing that you are not going to have issues avoid assertions inside
completion blocks it's a way of guaranteeing you don't have issues
okay
passing good in the least controller you are testing
the delegates cell okay you have a test this checks only
for the empty initial state there are no tests when there is a actual
result so yeah that's why they were expecting ui tests maybe because you don't have coverage in unit tests
you could have the coverage in unit tests if you're using your abstractions and maybe creating some stubs
but because you're using the concrete types in the view models you cannot replace them with stubs right
maybe you can sub class but i think they are final classes so you cannot subclass
and their final classes so since you have protocols you you pass the protocols and then you can pass
maybe stops i don't know why i didn't use a protocol
i think this is a mistake so yeah
because i follow the discipline follow the arctic catcher and i
i think this is mistakes this is [Music] shouldn't use here
yeah so there's a lot of behavior here yes in the foster photolistiocontroller layer including the cell loading the
cells like reusing and canceling the images you know you can write unit tests that says when a
cell is used they the image is cancelled to avoid that
race condition we shown you can find it all in the program as well so
yes do you feel like you could avoid these mistakes now otherwise i recommend you
[Music] re-watch the lectures now with this in mind with all the feedback we gave you now we can rewatch the lectures and you
know find the answers to all those yes in there
and then practice practice apply again and if you don't pass you practice more you get the feedback you bring us the
project and then you practice more and you get to the sino level you break through
right now your position is senior or mid for my current company i think
my friends call me senor consider me senior because uh
i'll let i learn by myself and uh you know but uh for me i don't think i
am a senior because i i work alone with no mentor and it's a small company
so yes senior needs some leadership skills
some communication skills that stuff that i don't have at the moment
right so another homework you will read
elite developer essentials book have you seen it yes
i planning to read it after finishing the mentoring session but
one of them [Music] ios unit testing
this book you have all the unit testing strategies in the program yes
focus you know exactly if you think that like this leadership is gonna help you as well
this is the next book follow the program you will if you have the time you can read other
books but like right now there are some specific skills that you need right yes so focus is important right now and
then you read the books i just if there is some uh
book uh it's uh not it's i think the essential book is
just for uh i need to read it in pdf if there is
some version comments that i can buy from there is there is pdf epub uh
yes i don't like to read it from using tablet or
you want a printed book yes i wanted printed work i i feel
i'm comfortable reading printed books on uh well make a sacrifice push through this
one and push come on
myself make a sacrifice that's it yes because i i am i i am this is my hope in
my second hobby uh i read a lot but uh all my all my reading it's a printed
version not uh you get chronicled version so i will push myself so if this book will
be helped me to to the next level yes i will
more than happy absolutely definitely but i think what will help
you most is is just maybe redoing the program re-watching the program exactly
yes um and you you already like you can see you learn many things from from there uh
just make sure you you grasp it all because i think that's what's going to get you the
the senior positions you you're looking for usually at least in my experience for
senior positions they don't expect that much leadership and since that's your case where you
don't like your one-man team there's no way you can practice these
skills in real projects so i would rather focus on being as
best i can with my technical skills of course reading the
the essentials so i'm not saying don't read the essential developer book
actually read it but i think the the focus should be on
on technical skills uh mostly so even the stuff you're gonna get there is
very very uh precise and uh easy to follow so
just just focus it's unlikely they would join a team with a lead position right now you're
still breaking through to that senior level and i don't think this leadership will
be that expected from a senior developer joining a larger team because they
probably already have a leadership there right so yes uh because uh
at the beginning of to this year i rejected from company because uh they i
don't have leadership skills just the the yep from one company right or or
like every company do you give you this feedback because you cannot optimize for every feedback you get you need to focus
if you get one feedback like you shouldn't use uh nibs and then it's like okay i should never use nibs and then someone say oh you should monitor okay i
need leadership like you need focus if only one company say leadership then it's like that's what that company was
looking for they're looking for a leader a lot of companies are not looking for leaders in senior developers they're looking for people that can get things
done correctly on time with quality you know
and you still need to build those skills at the senior level and still building them
so i don't think yeah i think pogba is right he shouldn't focus on the leadership part right now
yes unless you're trying to break into a more leadership position but
you guys think most companies would expect like strong leadership skills from senior developers
yeah i'm not sure you know but it can help definitely will help you
but it shouldn't eliminate you from a bunch of opportunities i don't think like it
would i don't think the majority of companies would be looking for like very strong leadership skills
yeah i i think at least in my experience is based on on what your cv is saying so if
you're they're looking for a leader like a team lead a technical
lead they are going to search for that in your past experience
just to make sure you can you can do the job so nobody will or at least
i think very few situations where they're gonna get you to an interview and you're gonna check out all your
leadership skills even though you haven't been a lead before you know like giving you the opportunity
to do it for them at first first job they hire you for so that's
pretty unlikely in my opinion so what's what's easier for your situation is just
to be as good as possible with your technical skills get into a senior
position with a company and when they see how you work and
everything there will be many opportunities probably after you get hired to to take
a leadership role if that is available with their structure so i i think that's like the
the way it usually goes like if you guys look back at your first
leadership roles i i don't think you you got hired for for them you got promoted
yes at least that was the case for me as well so
yes and that's hard like being being a good leader is super hard it's much harder than being a good developer
because there's so many things you need to to take into account like economics and team balance and the personality of
each team member you have so that's super complex like i i would only focus on that when i mastered like i have a
stable base of my technical skills and by technical i don't just
refer to coding but also like designing diagrams uh being proficient with
explaining a technical solution having experience with many many projects like all these things
fall into a i don't know into the portfolio of a senior developer and then from there when you were say okay i'm
i'm really good with this now i can help more people like i can coordinate more people doing this because i know how to
do it that's when you look into leadership at least that's how i sit and
take that with a grain of thought because not everybody is built to be a leader like you have to
have the right personality you have to have the some skills some charisma to to
work with with other people so it's like i've always wondered i don't want
to open this it's a big conversation on on what happens with i know people that are
senior developers that get promoted into leadership positions even though they don't have the skills
for it but that's a different maybe topic for another day
there's a name for this phenomenon that people are promoted until they get to a position where they're incompetent
i mean they get stuck right it's it happens a lot like you never not just developers but even like
c-level people and no and in every level that it's a it's a thing like a lot of developers get promoted to
manager eventually and they're terrible managers they're good developers you know yeah
it happens a lot they're completely different sets of
skills and i think right now we need more technical reinforcing the
the basics you know the more intermediary and the advanced but
again solid foundation with the basics then you build the intermediary in the advanced yes
if you try to jump steps and go to advanced like you still understand some basic concepts
will be harder you know you get stuck so we watch the program redo the program
practice yes
for some some videos i rewatch it a lot yeah it's good
more they're also like almost hundreds of mentoring sessions you can
go through about specific topics like interviews a bunch of interview sessions there
that will help you yes definitely thank you thank you what i would add
here is since you're working in a one-man team then just
rely let essential developer be your community like talk to people maybe more
often be more more involved in the in the communications on slack
ask more questions reply to questions if you think you have something valuable to add
that that can be your playground so because you don't have a team to i don't know bounce ideas off or
just i don't try out things ask opinions about things you you can do this in in
the community yes that's how i would do it like it has to suit you as well but i think
that this is a good a good place to to i know match up for for the fact that
you're the only developer in your team so
yes definitely i will i will do it
in the future for sure cool for sure you are on the right path like we can see in the code that you're you
know you're on the right path judging like what like almost less than
a year ago that we had our first mentoring session it's unbelievable the difference so yeah
and you said from three months right this part is three months old and from three months you already learned a lot like they wouldn't make a lot of the
mistakes there so fantastic keep improving this rate and very
quickly you will have like big changes in your career
yes definitely awesome all right thank you for joining me
long session yes thank you sorry for sorry for the
i made it to i i am still there no no no problem no problem with that
nice thank you all right first time guys awesome thank you see you next time
exactly bye take care bye take care hello
everyone in the chat hello number one okay not that i agree with making the
requests on the cell but can't we cancel requests and prepare to reuse
it may be too late because prepare to use is called when it's going to be reused not
before right so i don't know if it's enough to cancel the request on time to stop
using data plan when not needed anymore because the cell cannot be reused and the request will carry on
so there are more reliable apis for that like the prefetching apis and the delegate apis of will appear will
disappear i think that was your point during the the live that
from the cell level you don't have access to all these methods being called like you don't know
the state of the of the entire collection view pre-fetching reusing like whenever a
cell goes off screen that kind of thing you don't have access to that information so you either
move that logical child set to the view controller or you start
leaking all these details into the cell because now the view control has to inform cells
about different states you know it's like it's getting messy so that's why the cell is not a good place
to to do that like i i know some people try to squeeze that into the prepare for
use or the the other few methods from subfield yeah
you know like when a cell is removed from sub-view there's a call back there but like maybe it was removed for other reasons like because it's you know
there's an animation so you never know what's going on don't try to imply what's happening to the table wheel from
the cell point of view the cell doesn't even have a rinse a reference to the table view for a reason like you shouldn't be reaching up
to the logic above and trying to figure out what's going on you know you're gonna make her so much more complicated and
probably have bugs because you don't know the internals of ui keys you don't know when methods are called
that's why it provides delegates data sources and prefetching data sources to
tell you this is where you should at this point it's okay to do things you know
if you try to do at the cell level we don't have enough information so probably we have bugs there
yeah but that's the problem cause like if you if you search it on
stack overflow or medium articles you see a lot of solutions that tell you to
to do it at the cell level we prepare to use and that kind of things and kyo said if you don't understand the
domain of the problem fully then it might sound good but you're actually just
making it worse so it's important to doing prepared for
views like this card anything that can be reloaded like images
you know just adding an image view to new you can already save some memory you know instead of holding a reference to a
view to an image another one operations are good if you
want to cancel requests but you don't need operations to cancel requests for example url session already provided
data tasks that are concealable and they manage their own internal queue we don't need to be concerned about it
it's very efficient of preventing many requests at the same time
he knows a lot about the internals of the device resources cores and so on it can be much more
efficient in making those decisions yeah many of the newer apis have cans cancel
capabilities so even the the new task uh in the sync await also is cancelable
cancellable so that's no longer reason like we
we tried to explain earlier operations are good for long longer term
processing like maybe if you need to do a computation or i don't know transform
some data or process an image apply some filters to an image that kind of a thing that's
that's what an operation is good for like canceling is no longer a good reason
just to stick to to these operational operation queue apis because
all all the other alternatives also have cancelling
also operations were good when you had like dependencies between operations like only start this request when these
three operations finished and you could set this up it was much harder with other apis right you'd have to have a
bunch of state controlling everything yes good advice here you can turn on
spell checker to help catch spelling errors absolutely
you should what is the best approach to go about
investigating data race issues are the signs that look like smell yes
if you're a student in the program you will see all the
recommendations and how to identify smells in code but
if i already have a data race and it's hard to debug there are a bunch of tools like the
thread sanitizers you know zombie objects there's a bunch
of things you can do depending on the case to figure out what is the problem
so initially try maybe check the threat sanitizer documentation they have updated it with the new apple
docs it's quite good bye you

Summary:
- Kayo and Mike from essentialdeveloper.com are discussing refactoring tests.
- They want to get rid of duplication in the tests and create a makeSU function.
- The makeSU function takes a question as a string and options. They test the question and give a default value for the options.
- They can unify the tests and move the assertion to make it easier to read.
- They create a helper function extension on UITableView to make the test easier to read.
- They test to guarantee that they are dequeuing cells but don't see much value in it.
- They create a private function to dequeue a cell and return it if it exists, otherwise create a new one.
- They use the right API and a default style for the cell. They will fix the refactoring later.


In this video, Kayo and Mike from EssentialDeveloper.com continue their refactoring of a quiz app by eliminating duplication in the tests. They start by creating a "makeSUT" function that takes a question and options as input and returns a "QuestionViewController". They then refactor the tests to use this function and eliminate unnecessary code. They also create a helper function for dequeuing cells in the table view. Finally, they unify the tests and make them more readable by adding a title function for the cells and changing the test names to match the expected results.

Bullet Summary:
- Kayo and Mike continue refactoring a quiz app
- They create a "makeSUT" function to eliminate duplication in tests
- They refactor tests to use this function and eliminate unnecessary code
- They create a helper function for dequeuing cells in the table view
- They unify tests and make them more readable by adding a title function for cells and changing test names to match expected results.

I don't care about the question in the header test truth that was a good roof factoring and since beer here can probably unify those tests we can just say they load render options you can probably move this assertion in here and that's a pleasing line get rid of this test so the test is zero K is the one case you can even now add a second one second one and so far we need to give it a question let's make it a string and we need to press some options and this should be tired questionable controller that's pretty much creating our system the test loading the view one returning and here we need to test a question okay now we can ask the table view to the fuel cell let's use cell for now and this returns an optional because maybe there's nothing in the cache and if there is one we return it otherwise we create one and now we're gonna use the right API yes style the default and it needs to match the reuse identifier in here but actually we don't care about the questioning here so we can probably give it a default value for this as well let's say it's an empty string there Aquino meat I think more expressive like I don't care about the question here and just kind of all the options now you can probably have these yes what about this one so we could test to guarantee that we are dequeuing cells but then we have to probably mock a table view or use some clever squeeze li I don't see much value in that I want to test behavior so I think we can have an extension on a table view just for the tests let's see how it might look so if you have a UI tableview extension I hope this should be private if other tests needed Union struct extracted somewhere so something like so at index any returns okay what we don't need you create these anymore and the options here we don't care about options so maybe we could have a default Lanyon good work and let's run this yeah we can start from a test get rid of the duplication there maybe have a make has UT factor function like we did in the flow so let's have an make su T and then we can return so at row doors it's full no text label question mark text pretty much what we have there in our assertion so now I can say title at 0 and you can remove this I think that looks much better you can probably move this year as well I think this looks much much better so now let's refactor or do controlling as we said these tape of your cell here been greater with Ava's style and it's not being the cute then we need a we use it I didn't fire I can be private so even if I have one test I want to make this test easy to read for my colleagues or someone that's gonna maintain this code and I wanted to kill so it should return a table yourself shouldn't be optional and should probably pass the table view and I like to show the options here be very explicit about it because of the name of our test right so that's what it means you have no options it's an empty ring so in here we can also do the same so in my test I don't care about how these cells being created if I break something my test will go red so what I want to have is a the cube function it's a private one okay private function and then I want to be free to the cue cells if I want to or I want to be able to change that exactly yeah we don't care about the question here as well so I think I can get rid of this okay so now we can have more tests yeah and then we have a table view here there is a Yui missing at the end of yeah Hey to find the tile at one should be a two and we need to change the name of the tips also so now when Theo loads I just say renders options natural sticks well this is self in index path it's gonna be even in line I think yep something like title and row and these returns an optional string yeah in table view and I'd like to stop the kill string you might change these and forget to change this one I'm doing a refactoring yeah quite ugly and verbose good extract in a helper function also hey this is kayo and this is Mike from essential developer.com [Music] okay tomato six last time we stopped with these tests passing so yes so actually let's call this a row and that's a row yeah it still works so we can probably have a one-liner here okay we are almost getting there what if we have a method that returns the title I sell it over the silk so here we can just get cell at 0 that looks much better I think Amin the house urchin also okay you want to separate so we're gonna fix this later I just want to get why ... so we create our index path here and then we return well then it needs to be optional and yes please okay that's it and I think we need some refactoring I'd should pass down yes cool can we just please other a helper section and Mark helper yeah make sense okay yeah okay yeah yeah a - yeah okay okay

- The speakers are Kayo and Mike from essentialdeveloper.com
- They need to do some refactoring on their tests
- They create a makeSUT function to reduce duplication
- They add a default value for the question and options parameters
- They unify some tests and move an assertion
- They extract a helper function for a table view extension
- They create a private dequeue function for table view cells
- They use the correct API for cell styling and add a matching reuse identifier


The video features Kayo and Mike from EssentialDeveloper.com who discuss refactoring test code. They begin by removing duplication from their test code, creating a makeSuT function that takes a question and options. They then refactor further to make the code more efficient, using a one-liner to save time and effort. The duo moves on to extract helper functions and clean up the code, including creating a tableView extension and a private function for dequeuing cells. They discuss the importance of testing behavior rather than implementation details. By separating the dequeuing of cells, they ensure that the test code is more readable and maintainable. The video concludes with the pair testing the code to ensure that it is working correctly.

hey this is kayo and this is Mike from
essential developer.com
[Music]
okay tomato six last time we stopped
with these tests passing and I think we
need some refactoring yeah we can start
from a test get rid of the duplication
there maybe have a make has UT factor
function like we did in the flow so
let's have an make su T and so far we
need to give it a question let's make it
a string and we need to press some
options and this should be tired
questionable controller that's pretty
much creating our system the test
loading the view one returning and here
we need to test a question okay what we
don't need you create these anymore and
the options here we don't care about
options so maybe we could have a default
Lanyon good work and let's run this yeah
it still works so we can probably have a
one-liner here yep that's it so here you
can have make a city as well and I like
to show the options here be very
explicit about it because of the name of
our test right so that's what it means
you have no options it's an empty ring
so in here we can also do the same but
actually we don't care about the
questioning here so we can probably give
it a default value for this as well
let's say it's an empty string there
Aquino meat I think more expressive like
I don't care about the question here and
just kind of all the options now you can
probably have these yes what about this
one yeah we don't care about the
question here as well so I think I can
get rid of this I don't care about the
question in the header test truth that
was a good roof factoring and since beer
here can probably unify those tests we
can just say they load render options
you can probably move this assertion in
here and
that's a pleasing line get rid of this
test so the test is zero K is the one
case you can even now add a second one
second one okay
I'd should pass down yes
cool can we just please other a helper
section and Mark helper okay you want to
separate and yes please
okay that's it I don't like these yeah
quite ugly and verbose good extract in a
helper function also but since we're
using it just in one place it's very at
least hard to read
yeah so even if I have one test I want
to make this test easy to read for my
colleagues or someone that's gonna
maintain this code so I think we can
have an extension on a table view just
for the tests
let's see how it might look so if you
have a UI tableview extension I hope
this should be private if other tests
needed Union struct extracted somewhere
so something like so at index any
returns so yes so actually let's call
this a row and that's a row so we create
our index path here and then we return
well then it needs to be optional okay
well this is self in index path it's
gonna be even in line I think yep so
here we can just get cell at 0 that
looks much better
I think Amin the house urchin also okay
we are almost getting there
what if we have a method that returns
the title I sell it over the silk yeah
something like title and row and these
returns an optional string and then we
can return so at row doors it's full no
text label question mark text pretty
much what we have there in our assertion
so now I can say title at 0 and you can
remove this I think that looks much
better
you can probably move this year as well
yeah make sense okay so now we can have
more tests yeah
Hey to find the tile at one should be a
two and we need to change the name of
the tips also so now when Theo loads I
just say renders options natural sticks
yeah so I can probably just get these
and say that at zero it should be a one
that one should be a - yeah okay I think
this looks much much better
so now let's refactor or do controlling
as we said these tape of your cell here
been greater with Ava's style and it's
not being the cute then we need a we use
it I didn't fire I can be private so in
my test I don't care about how these
cells being created if I break something
my test will go red right so we could
test to guarantee that we are dequeuing
cells but then we have to probably mock
a table view or use some clever squeeze
li I don't see much value in that I want
to test behavior and then I want to be
free to the cue cells if I want to or I
want to be able to change that exactly
okay so what I want to have is a the
cube function it's a private one okay
private function and I wanted to kill so
it should return a table yourself
shouldn't be optional and should
probably pass the table view yeah in
table view and then we have a table view
here there is a Yui missing at the end
of yeah
DQ the cube okay
now we can ask the table view to the
fuel cell let's use cell for now and
this returns an optional because maybe
there's nothing in the cache and if
there is one we return it
otherwise we create one and now we're
gonna use the right API yes style the
default and it needs to match the reuse
identifier in here and I'd like to stop
the kill string you might change these
and forget to change this one I'm doing
a refactoring so we're gonna fix this
later
I just want to get why you kill cell in
table view and we're on the test then
we're gonna be good
oh yeah okay okay and let's think about
these I think we can have a private let
yeah it's a constant there right you use
identifier cell you know we can just use
the same here okay
I think another refactoring I just
notice here is that we don't need to
give it a type yep any here we can do
the same but then we need to initialize
it yeah I think that's oh I think it
looks better now let's run the test okay
what's next
if we select something what should
happen
we should delegate it somewhere I and
you need to be notified whoever is
interested okay so let's start with the
test options selected notifies and
delegate that's interesting it's only
some kind of delegate here it could be a
callback could be disclosure just a
closure I think it's gonna do it for now
or assertion is gonna be received answer
is a one okay and we cannot have a su
t-wave options take one we could inject
this function in the initializer and
call it in the selection a code so we
can have something like we see and it's
a string and we need to give it a
callback but it can capture right so we
need to take these to be whatever we got
yeah
yes and we need to select the cell and
to select a cell we need to get a table
view delegate and call table 0 as you
see the table view did select row that's
and we're gonna give you that index path
like we had before so index path because
in XPath row zero sections 0 that's
capitalized yeah so when we select when
we call this function with this lecture
yes the answer right yes I don't want
anyone outside this question the
controller to know about the table view
and I get callbacks that just sends the
model back the model so far is a string
yeah the answer okay one yeah okay cuz
if we decide at some point that table
views are not good enough for our UI
maybe we need a collection view yeah I
don't want to try to change anybody
outside this UI layer yeah so it
probably needs to give it a let's call
it selection ok
and this selection is a closure of type
string void yeah and we need to capture
this selection and private of our
selection string to void ah we need to
give a default value here I do want to
have a default closure you know there's
nothing so you know yeah and default is
you know okay let me move this here okay
what is problem here is it scaping yes
it is caping because we are holding yep
we need to change our make a city and
good thing we have this method otherwise
we'd have to change all the tests
through so we just change in one place
and everybody gets it for free
nobody else cares about this election
callback so we can just have a default
value as well so selection will be the
same string to void we can just give it
a closure that does nothing as default
and this is time to get ugly
so we might need to reflector this later
so far let's do this and then we have
selection selection what is wrong here
I'm trying to be up this you can see
what happens
well so this method is in the protocol
is an optional so we need you this
question mark here yeah what is the
problem here
we need to find is that escaping as well
okay let's run this test and hopefully
it will fail any does so the same thing
we did before we need to set the
delegate for the table though you can do
these in this interface builder go back
to the tests we now need to implement
that method key our Tomatoes down here
let me just finish this so let's make
this conform to table field delegate now
I can get Auto completion and it's like
row called our selection closure and
pass the model at index path so it's
options in this row let's run this okay
tomato done nice okay so we start this
tomato with refactoring and I think
that's very important the factor awesome
like I don't think we should wait to
refactor when I need to change things
otherwise it's gonna be too late we do
stuff with tests every factor that's the
TDT walk this is it is the third step of
the walls right yes factoring so it is
mandatory yes red green refactor so the
code is always clean it's always tested

Transcription:

00:00	hey this is kayo and this is Mike from essential developer.com okay so we have the flow working we now have a bunch of options we can start thinking about this car thinking about the moldos because I don't like the questions and answers being just strings in for the results a dictionary might not be suitable or what we want or we can implement some UI and get some feedback exactly more reviews from our clients from our friends if you have a client I think the way to go here would be to have some UI yeah so we have

00:40	a prototype they can play with but it's not the real game it's very mucked up hard-coded if you're in a team this development can continue independently a developer can continue working on the scoring as you said and another developer can work on the router implementation or the UI in parallel in parallel yeah yeah definitely as long as you have a contract between these modules as we do right now with a router for instance two separate entities can continue in parallel okay cool so we have a project already there is a

01:11	prototype but since everything's are coded I think we should just start a new project okay okay let's create a quiz app and we want unit tests okay new project a lot of things I don't want right now so I can just get rid of it okay seems good let's see if I can Randi's oh you need to remove the main interface yes so from here I don't have a starboard anymore let me run this again okay boom empty application okay I think we should start with the question view controller as we had in our prototype

01:50	where we show a header and a bunch of options you can select make sense let's start with the test yes so let's create a question view controller test no thank you we import actually tests and let's create our test case class and let's create our first tests well to test for controllers you need to load the view so it's in the red states you'll be rendered on screen and you need to start the view lifecycle exactly it's pretty much what would happen if they put on screen so we can start

02:27	saying when we load that's how simple we have a header so it renders header text so I assume that the header text is gonna be the question yes okay she would say when question header text question hazard okay so let's create our assertion what do we want to happen is we're gonna have a system under test that's gonna be the view controller and we want a question had their label I think it's too long I will just call it header label okay dot text needs to be whatever we pass to it so in this case

03:02	let's say q1 we need to load the view one way to do it is just to call the view here right why don't you just call viewdidload there well if you read the documentation of your controllers you shouldn't invoke viewdidload directly that's not the natural way of things happens to load of view there are some internal things that happens only when the views access the first time so should be a nice citizen it's better to just just follow a simulation right exactly so we need to create a suti and

03:32	give it a question q1 that's it so that's great one question your controller here in or main target let's import you like it and let's create our class and that's a view controller and it has a initializer that gets question strings and we need to capture just somehow so neither I'd want this be accessible so let's make this private and let's make it a string well you should probably be a let I don't this changing maybe needs to change but so far it doesn't and well I have a

04:18	compiler error here well it forces me to have the required initializer so maybe we should have a convenience initializer instead yeah this is UI kid madness here yeah the custom initializers but the convenience should do it convenience initializer so then I don't need this year but I need to call self-taught in it and then set my properties yes so what is happening here okay it needs to be a far I'm thinking to have default value also okay that's why and we need to have the label that we can add here I like to have these layout

05:01	separated from the view controller logic so we could have a different class that sets up they had a label for you and layouts it or just a need you don't need to do it programmatic me okay let's create a field and we've used the same name as the class when you call in each it's gonna do the loading for you couple of things we need to do when you have any you need to set the fire on their class and set the field to whatever it needs to be okay and or header level right now I don't want to care about how

05:41	it looks no layer is not part of the unit test maybe you're gonna have some UI tests for that but I think that's enough for now so control drag and we can create our header label week yes please boom there it is let's go back to our tests we have our header over class oh that's the phone in turn oh so our test tiger doesn't have access to it we can make it testable import squeeze up and that should do it so let's see the difference now that we're running the test with a simulator how long it's gonna take a lot well it

06:28	wasn't that bad but let's say three to five times slower I think it's a lot more Emma but yeah that's pretty slow but okay let's make this very test pass now let's have a viewdidload we just need to set the header table don't text you be the question that's it okay okay that's all we need a second test here let's say we need to also show the options for answers right so this can be in a table view if we follow a prototype it's a table here I think it's fine to do that

07:06	Princeton simple solution so start with 2-0 case okay with no option options renders zero options okay so now we need to give us some options let's say it's empty there are no options and we are going to load the view and we need to assert that table view number of rows is zero something like that yes so okay let's start with these options and it's an array of strings so far what else this is gonna break our first test so we need to add this here and let me comment this out and make sure it still works

08:01	okay it works so we need a table view now and we can follow the same process for the header we track a table view to our mains view and we control drag it to our code and table view now we connect them back to the test for a test on the right method name okay I think it's in section zero yes let me run this test any passes we have passing tests and we have no implementation there's no other but is good you have it there because as we progress we might break it so let's carry on to the one option test you just

08:57	copy and paste these so one option renders one option a one okay yeah and now this should be one let's run this should feel and it should fail and it does now we need to start thinking about this tape of your data source and who should be the tip of your data source isn't the view controller could be let's start with this then later source and we need to implement some methods now yes so table view number of rows is mandatory and we can return one to make the test pass but then we would break the know options

09:44	exactly so right now we can just say options dot count but we still don't have an option variable so now it's time to have a private or options just like we have for questions and it needs to be an array of strings and you need the default value and I think empty is a reasonable default value yeah and we need now you have the other required method cell for row let's just return cell for now that's we're gonna get there it's mandatory you need to implement it we cannot return you it's

10:26	not optional so we're gonna get there and it fails because our table view is not connected with the status verse yet we could do this in code or we could do it in the interface builder and since we are treating these I think it's fine to the interface builder less code it hides the annotation but yeah for now it's fine so I can get the tableview here and connect the data source to D files only I should let's run the test again hey and he does okay we could add a test to make sure that the table of your data source is

11:10	the question of your controller but doing so will make your test a bit fragile because if you decide to refactor and have a different data source class a different implementation then it's gonna break that test and you're gonna have to go there and fix it actually what we want to do is just say the table view has it like it doesn't matter how it has like 1 or 2 or 0 rows what matters that it has it so it's easier later to refactor this and put this data source in a different object without breaking the test the test is

11:42	still true it's you see yeah you guys the number of rows I want doesn't matter how doesn't matter who's providing that so write less tests in your test is more about what it does not how I think that's very important so let's carry on we could have the two options but I think we we're good here yeah same physical assertion there so that's finally think about this cell and the options is just a string rendered in a Cell so renders one option label yeah another thing we're not you

12:20	next as to follow our convention here sorry I don't think we need to create any custom cells right now yes we don't have a layout yet so I don't wanna be putting any layout concern in my production called Orion test so I think it's fine for us to just test these with normal tape of yourself it has a text label Adri ok so if you have this a1 I want to make sure that I get a cell and he has the a1 rendered in there yes so let's do that let's get the cell at index so say that table field data sirs and that's

12:58	optional we need to get table view you know we pass the su t dot table view cell or at index path put this in a variable let's call this cell and let's create an index path that's 0 in section 0 now we can test it or sell text label dot text is a 1 yeah it's exactly right what is wrong then that's an optional okay oh that's interesting it's optional because the data sources are talking you although this method returns a non-optional since there is an optional in the chain it's gonna return

13:49	an option yep interesting let's run this test and I expect you fail ok right now we could just hard code a 1 here like we did before in the flow and then have an a - well I don't to be hard coding stuff anymore yeah you will probably don't do that and yes I'll probably not do that so what we can do here now you can create our cell then I can get the text label and get my options at index path row that's it timer is done huh perfect timing let's just see if we pass well that's optional optional yeah and I don't think

14:38	that's gonna work because I need to give it a style let's see then my crash yeah it passes it's perfect timing for a tomato to end that's it about what we did so far so for me the interesting thing here is the separation of the layout it's one thing to test the behavior of the view controller and another thing how this view controller and it's up huge is gonna are gonna look like and final fascinating to be honest I know it looks stupid right now but I think it's gonna pay off later well if you look at the

15:19	feel it does look stupid right but how important is this like we don't care about the layout right now we are testing the behavior of this controller and implementation of the sale data source and we even enable this implementation to move somewhere else without breaking any tests and I think that's very very important I expected to have like a nice UI at some point they I'd want to be breaking this code because of this new UI okay let's move to the next one [Music] you

00:00	hey this is kaio and this is mike from essentialdeveloper.com [Music] okay starting tomato number four and now we need to think about how to route to the result so we need to think what is the result so for me the results can be a combination of the question and the answer no we should accumulate yes it accumulated i mean yes yeah right yes and pass the answers there something like route to result in a result type some sort of a type yeah yeah so do we need to create a data structure or should we use a foundation one yeah a

00:47	dictionary you mean yes what are the limitations of dictionary we cannot have duplicated questions yes if we use the question as the key we need to force the questions to be hashable right so we guarantee this uniqueness order we don't have order we lose the order yes right these are things that we don't know yet right if we need those i think actually that's the desired behavior why would you have duplicated questions in a quiz my main concern is the order well the order is not flow responsibility right it's not right

01:20	actually the result doesn't need order the questions has an order and the result is just a data structure where we accumulated the answers we can just ask this data structure what is the answer for this question it doesn't require order then it's just a key value pair yeah let's go with this and we change if we i'm like i'm pro yeah so so far since we're using strings i would say string to string string yeah now it's very clear that we need to fix this string side because one of the number one complaints when

01:51	people say well don't use raw types even if you need a string sometimes you should encapsulate this string in a struct like a question struct that holds a string just so we give more meaning to it right i also find it confusing when i'm reading code to see string string what is the meaning like it's quite hard to read but all of these i think is going to be solved later on i don't think we need this concern right now since we're doing tdd we just keep going right in our tests and checking our outputs and yes i agree

02:20	okay so that's our goal for this tomato get this route to result and you're gonna drive okay so i think if you have no questions then you start i think we should rule the result with an empty result yep you can duplicate this yes for now yeah now questions rise to result in the expected result route results could be 70 that is accurate yes and we need this dictionary here which is empty just routed the result [Music] whoops well this is introduced we should have deleted that i prefer to write the vertical first instead of this ply i see

03:18	this pie as a helper i don't like to write production like expectations in there first i want to see a failing test so why don't we make these nullable you're not accumulating anything there so let's make it optional and now when you route your result you capture that yes now we need to change the test area i would like to use assert equal and compare it to an empty dictionary because now we guarantee it's not new and if there is a value it is empty and i would expect this to fail and would one in here oh it's up the

04:00	bank and we are crashing also yes okay that's a failing task let's make this pass let me just get the failure because x4 just marked it as green okay the simplest thing i can do to make this thing pass is in the start we have a nose yes and make my router route to the result and it has an empty dictionary yes so now i should be good and i am so next test i would like to compare what i'm capturing well why don't we have a test with one question you answer the question and yeah you got the question and the

04:49	answer okay with one question route to result to result to result so start on answering i want routed result to be equal the dictionary with the question and answer is key value what's the problem here and i'm crashing because you're not calling that in the road next yes so if i don't have a current index plus one well if it's out of bounds if it's out of bounds it means you reach the limit yes so then i need to do the same yes and i think strong self here right unfortunately yes we're gonna have to

05:44	refactor this later this is a failing test here because i need to pass let's hide code for now just make it faster right yes so now add a test with two questions start an answer first and second second with two questions so i need q2 yes and you fire this a1 a2 okay and now we cannot cheat anymore yes not carry on hardcoding stuff that's the rule you can do it ohms the second test you need to write production code so we need to have some kind of dictionary that we can accumulate the state yeah okay i can have a property

06:50	say private for result for now this is going to be a string to string this is empty yes and it's private yes so every time i'm answering a question yeah so we are inside this block we get the answer and the answer right now is the underscore because we didn't need it let's call it answer now yes so we can capture the answer and after we are routing we can say strong self result question equals answer answer but is this the right place to do it i think it should be outside the if statement right there that's the place you have

07:43	the question and the answer okay you can run the test and let's see if it passes well i'm not using okay and it passes now so move that inside if statement again let's see if it fails and it does because if you are in the last question you're not gonna store it yeah that's why it needs to be outside the test helps you find an answer and guarantee that no one's gonna break this good cuts there and i think that's it we can change this also right result yes run the test also i don't need this test now yes

08:27	because you're testing these two questions yes i think that's it we are accumulating the result and we are passing it we have the questions and the answers okay can we factor anything in the test i don't like the force and wrapped there but i think it's necessary because we are checking it otherwise not new changes its behavior here yes we are done with the flow okay let's go meet and do some refactoring please yeah do you want to drive yeah cool okay we finished the float but we still have time on our tomatoes so

09:05	why don't we do some refactoring here i really don't like the strong self although it's necessary i think we can probably move these to a function so i think we can create another private function and we can call it well let's i don't know how to call it yet so let me keep this rock next and then you have a question and you have an answer so i don't need strong self anymore in here nowhere there yeah oh it's everywhere if only there was a refactoring tool well there is one search and replace

09:47	search and replace so primitive well i'm not gonna go there not yet not yet yes something here oh you can just roll next right yes or since it's just one line i would prefer to do an iflat strong self strong self taught route next question and the answer answer okay i think that looks a little bit better and it does still pass still passing so we didn't break anything what else can we do here maybe we don't need to capture next question here maybe we can have this in a variable as well instead of

10:31	doing twice yeah let's do that let's see next question index equals that replace this here and here and actually i would just do this in line okay you want to separate this a little bit let me run the test again uh-huh oh that's why i think we had it yeah let's put this back and we can put it here and we're back okay so it looks like we have duplicated code here but actually for different reasons these happen right and i don't like this being route next anymore maybe next call back the point of views i think it reads a

11:34	little bit better maybe we can get rid of this since we always use route next with the question and answer okay and just pass the question yeah please underscore here and say wrote next question answer okay it's a private small scope yep so i think it's fine okay normally what i do to see if i have all the behavior tested i start commenting outlines exactly so i can comment out this line of code i can run it and i get a failing test correct i'm covered there and if a community is lying out i have a failing test again so that's

12:23	tested if i move this line outside the if else logic my test still passes yep so we are not testing this so there is some missing behavior yeah when we were writing the test for days we knew this would happen so we just added the house without having a failing test before and that happened so what i'm gonna do now i'm gonna put this outside if statement and i'm gonna have a failing test we have one test that says well if you have no questions it should route to an empty result set what if i have one question

13:02	let's say if i have one question and i start i want this to be new i agree yeah so i can even have this in one line so when i start with one question does not route to result now i want to see a failing test there it is okay now let's make it pass everything is green and you can guarantee that this is tested you can comment this out as well and it is tested and we can do the same in here that is tested also comment this out this is tested but the same if i put this outside if statement boom the same same behavior the problem

14:04	is that if at some point we decided to do some refactoring we might break this and if we trust the test 100 and they are bad tests we're going to have bugs that might take a day to find out it could be deployed and then people are playing the quiz game when they answer one question like boom they go to the result page we don't want that to happen so we should probably add some safety here so i'm gonna duplicate this test because i want to see a failing test first so start and answer first question with two questions does not

14:35	route to result yep so we have two questions we answer only one i want the same assertion yeah and let's see a failing test yes okay now i can put this back on okay now it's covered and i'm happy with it yeah i think this is it okay everything is committed there's only one more refactoring i want to do here so what we can do is we can get rid of this if statement and say self question mark so it only gonna delegate a message if there is something there right and we don't need to call this answer

15:16	although it's nice yeah let's just show we can get rid of this and just use the dollar sign 0 and we can have this in one line this function is just creating a closure so it's pretty simple quick self and pass the value you got in the callback block yeah sounds good let me run the tests and it passes okay okay i think this class is pretty small i don't want it to do anything else right that's always responsibility it's going to coordinate question to question and send the result yeah there's no

15:53	other functionality in there all it does is just create the flow literally okay i think we are done are you happy well i still think we need to somehow get rid of these strings and give it some more meaning and i don't want to force my quiz to be only strings right i think already is you have images you have audio you have other media formats so we're gonna have to make this more generic at some point i'm happy with the result right now i think we can commit these and carry on or maybe we can make this

16:25	more generic i don't think you should be in the scope of this tomato right now i absolutely agree that we should be using something more generic like generics for instance but that's what we need right now okay [Music] can we take a last look on the test maybe we can refactor something there i think the methods are very small the names are very easy to read and understand and we start everywhere so potentially we could extract that in a setup we could probably move the start invocation to the make sut function

17:04	but i like how you can see in the test like the flow is only ready to be used when it started there's no way you can answer a question if you don't start it our interface is really nice because it just doesn't allow you to reply to a question if you don't start it the only way to answer to a question is to fire the callback we only give you a callback when you start the flow right you can start it over again and if you have a router that is like a navigation controller router that can go back we can handle that as well we can go

17:33	back and replace the questions if we use a dictionary to accumulate and send the result so at the end we don't have this limitation our flow is pretty flexible and we can have other kind of class that guarantees some policies if you can go back or not but it's not here yeah it doesn't live in this module most probably and as you said it's very flexible i don't think we have any dependencies living inside this class we can easily change things and the abstraction of the router i really like anyone

18:01	that is going to consume this api can implement it in any way they want yes i like the functional approach there with a recursion in swift it turns out that plays pretty nicely also yes and although this is a class most things here are let's alright we're not mutating a lot of state we are only accumulating the result i'm very happy with our tests being very confident i can just refactor this as much as i want i don't think that's the only implementation we can have and we are free to change it without

18:33	fear so anything we do in the code right now that breaks this contract that breaks these expectations we're gonna have a failing test you will be notified you're gonna be notified and very quickly exactly i can just run it again and it passes okay amazes me every time okay i think that's it that's it you

Transcription:

00:00	hey this is kaio and this is mike from essentialdeveloper.com [Music] okay we're back i'm driving again i have committed our changes so far we have all the passing tests and we can carry on i want to do some refactoring first of all the tests have a lot of duplicated code so i think we can get rid of all the routers the routers yeah and have only one let's run yeah oh good why don't you put it in the setup and instead you create a constant there well i don't need a setup so far every test has a different setup because i'm

01:01	creating my sut my system under test or my flow with different setups there are a couple techniques we can use here to get rid of some duplicated code i like to have a like a factory method because it's at some point we need any other dependency here we would break all the tests yeah if we refractory now we're going to be safe about this refractory with clean tests should we do it just to show okay just yeah for showcasing okay let's do it so we can create a function we can say make sut yeah something like

01:35	that that's simple uh and we pass questions that's an array of string and it returns a flow okay okay so we can just copy and paste this one you just pass the questions there we can just return actually we pass questions and and here we can just say make sct well you don't even need can be in in the same line as start right you don't use the sut well in this case yes i can just have a one liner like that yes it makes things very simpler and here we can say make surt with this question let's run the test

02:37	since it runs very fast i can just run the test every time i do refactoring the same in here but now it's q2 and now we have k1 and q2 okay but here i need to capture or i can call start yeah well not really because no because it's uh it doesn't return it's just flow right yeah yeah there's some patterns that say every time you execute an action you return itself so you can carry on right sending messages to it i don't want to use this right so okay let me run the test again it's all good

03:28	i also like to have the factory function in a helper area so we can have a mark there okay we can do that as well so at the end of the test yeah i think that's fine so create a mark like this helpers yeah usually yeah and at some point if you need to create this flow in a different test file you can probably just move this helper section to a file and you can reuse it and share it with other test files yeah yeah i agree so what ddgs gave us this refactoring what did it give us as i see it now we can change the

04:04	initializer here without breaking the tests it's just a simple technique that may save you some time everything that saves me time reduce the cost of what i'm doing it gives more value to what i'm doing so it's combined a lot of small techniques yeah you come up with like this huge improvement in time at the end of the project right it's all about consistency right yes exactly okay i would like to have another test because this test is very specific for first question which is the second question yeah

04:34	what if i have three questions now i have to say from second question to the question it doesn't scale yeah so i want to have a failing test okay and make it pass so i can guarantee that i can progress from any number of questions so if i start and answer first and second question with three questions three questions first two second and third question so if i answer one and then i answer another question and we need another cube yes okay so we need this i want to have q3 here yes and i hope this fails because we didn't

05:18	implement that okay okay there it is the failing test and now it's time this is not scaling at all i don't want to do a refactoring but to implement that i'm going to need probably another function and i will call it for now route next okay okay so i can pass the question and i can give it an answer so if i can move these in here i can code these recursively okay make sense so i don't need strong selfies no then you wouldn't insult there yes so here i could just say current yes question index

06:09	index of question right so the next question will be the current question index plus one then i call the router to route that question but i don't want to be calling this block i want to pass a function to it same function right answer callback should be grout next and here i can say route to question you have the first question and i want to use the same callback yeah that's it ah but this block only gets one parameter a string and this function needs a question and the answer we need a function that gets a question

07:09	and returns a function so we can have something like this and this is going to return a string to avoid closure so instead of we return closure right now and now we need to put back our weak reference to self there yeah yeah strong self equals itself well we need to say guard let yes else return don't do anything so far then we don't need the answer actually well and you pass the question here and we can make this optional and we can do the same here route next

08:18	next question okay strong self strong self again yeah okay okay now we made a test path now we can refactor this we have the recursion we need yes okay so how does this work so i get a question and i return back a closure that expects an answer for that question that's exactly what is happening here so i'm brought in next and i'm getting a question and i'm generating a closure that knows how to investigate the next right but we still have we have a bank there for some wrap here yes and we are not

09:01	checking the bound of the array here so we still have a bunch of problems we need to fix yeah i don't like this strong self i'm thinking about a way of getting rid of this but at least i don't like the name strong self i don't know it's very noisy yeah yeah feels also bigger than it should be yes okay so i think i need to write another test to get rid of those yes for some rat at least one okay yes before we continue i had an idea smaller factoring there we can type alias the answer callback

09:36	you know a string to void okay the closure type yes i think it will make it a little bit more clear okay so where should these type alias live not in the flow i would say in the in the router probably right now okay we can call this answer call back and he has this type yeah that's it that's it and we can just press it here and we can replace this here as well and here this needs to be router dot answer callback okay so we need to give it the namespace yep namespacing quite like it not sure okay let's see if that complies all

10:31	right that's fine yeah right let's let's try to get rid of the bank yes that's what i want to see here so if i start and i answer the first question but i have only one question i don't want it to route to anything else i don't want it to rot in the next question yeah there is no next question that's not route to another question or it doesn't crash so if i start with one question i answer this question i want to see only one rotate question yes so let me run this and okay he crashed when you're trying to

11:18	get the next question uh-huh because there's no next question forcing it to do it yes out of bounds we need is if the index of the next question right it's slower it's lower it's less than the account count yeah we're gonna do this yeah you have to say song so okay we're gonna refactor this yeah there we go passes now so we are safe there we still have a bang here but since like the only way to progress one question question here is internally on this class there's no way you're gonna call this with a wrong question

12:10	but i still don't like having a foursome wrap there so we can also make this if yes let's right okay i've noticed this sometimes in swift where i get to a point that well this behavior is internal to my class i can guarantee that these will never be nil but i i still don't want to force some rapid because maybe i'm going to change something in the class and i'm going to break it so and there's no way to write a test to force that since it's an internal behavior so i just let the compiler help me right

12:50	and just by using the z flat i got rid of that and now i don't have this undesired behavior a couple suggestions here this is a private function so let's make this private and i do want to test it exactly directly yeah i test it through my interface there is the start yes and when i fire the answer callback that's my public interface yeah so there it is i think we got to look for the questions now we need to think about the result okay since we start talking about private scope and public scope let's think about this now

13:30	should this be public i think this should be private i think both of them should be private no one should have access to it yeah there's no need an extra line here yeah and here i think it reads weird like brought next first question i would say from maybe so wrong next from first question and from next question that's on the test and yes it still passes let's have a look at those tests i think i can get rid of these since we have one that has three okay it's it's implied it works the two as well okay okay our tomato is

14:23	done let's just make sure and we see we have no questions it's empty and we have one question for another question a few questions it was the first question if we start twice okay i think that's it we have the loop for all the questions just run the test before we finish to make sure it's passing so we can commit and finish this tomato cool all good yeah okay i'm gonna reflect about this tomato yeah we finished the question to question progression and we need to think about result now that's the next

15:06	omega but this is done and we have everything tested i don't think we ever have to come back here and change anything well maybe the type question or answer yeah yeah but i don't think that would break any tests yeah probably not i'm not very happy with the private function implementation it's pretty ugly but the good thing is that it's private we have all the behavior tested we can refactor as much as we want yeah without breaking anything or at least if we break something that test is gonna tell us

15:36	so i'm inclined to just keep going yeah me too and with a factor when it's time i have 100 confidence in this code sounds no fear at all sounds good you happy to start thinking about the results next yes okay so let's have a break and come back to work on the result let's do it bye

It discusses the use of weak references to prevent retain cycles and the potential risks of not doing so. The script shows how to implement weak references in the code to ensure proper memory management. 3️⃣ The video script introduces the idea of using closures as callbacks to handle user actions and flow control in the application. It demonstrates how closures can be used to pass data between different parts of the code and how they can be stored and invoked at a later time. The script also mentions the benefits of using closures for asynchronous operations. 4️⃣ The script emphasizes the importance of following the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD) to ensure code quality and maintainability. It highlights the iterative process of writing tests, implementing code, and refactoring based on the test results. The script encourages gradual development and progressive growth of the codebase to avoid complexity and ensure a clean design. 5️⃣ The video script discusses the use of protocols and delegates to implement the routing functionality. It explains how protocols can define the required behavior for objects and how delegates can be used to handle specific tasks or actions. The script mentions the benefits of using protocols to decouple code and make it more modular and reusable. 6️⃣ The script introduces the concept of recursion as a possible solution for dynamically progressing to the next question in the routing functionality. It suggests using a recursive function to iterate through the questions and dynamically retrieve the next question based on the index of the current question. The script highlights the benefits of recursion for handling repetitive tasks in a concise and efficient manner. 7️⃣ The video script highlights the importance of code readability and simplicity. It encourages avoiding unnecessary complexity and using clear and concise code to enhance understandability and maintainability. The script mentions the use of descriptive variable and function names, as well as the removal of redundant code to improve code quality.

00:00	hey to the sky oh and this is Mike from essential developer.com okay so a couple of things before we start we took a five minutes break and we committed our changes so far and now we have a failing test and we switch now Mike is I'm driving and let's carry on okay so we have a failing test yeah can you explain what's going on there please sure we wanted to validate that we are routing to the correct question we implemented the routing to the question but we are providing a hard-coded value here so the simple

00:40	solution will be just to us to one that would make the test pass however we are hard coding yes so let's add another time let's add an artist let's call this in this culture is like a second scenario here right look you two yes and now artists okay yes so we can get the first question here the first item of the questions Gary okay and we can choose yeah and since it's an optional we need to force it and of course you're going to get rid of this Bank because of course it is going to crash at some

01:29	point in one time every time I see a bong in a class for me it's an indication that something is not hungry well maybe there's a test missing maybe there is a condition missing but it can lead to a crush and I'm rushed well I don't know but they took the easy yeah it's pretty easy to just put the exclamation point to everything and yeah and bypass the safety yes right but we don't want to do that now no okay so I think we can stop here and we factor that because we already know if it's not empty so the bank is not

02:09	necessary what we can do is you can get the first question right there is one question you use it okay so let me get this I can say here the fourth question I'll say first question question first all right yes first which it okay that looks much better there's no photon rapping we can continue with our test next test yes now I want to see if I have more than one question okay with two questions we'll see what's happen what happens with the two questions your votes your first question intervals - first question so we can

03:01	Oh q1 q2 and when we start I wanted to roll to q1 yes right and I think it does it already yes this does it already what happens if we call start wife so if we call star twice I think the behavior should be start again from from yeah let's say every try let me get this okay i factor our test later also so start why browse the first question twice yes so I get I have to start and start and I'm expecting q1 but yeah it's time now for us to reflect for

04:07	this test so again I would comment out this yes and I'll think about instead of getting the relative question I would like to accumulate and develop questions in on the rate yet so you can get the count also yes I can Shane here directly in my spy or do you prefer to change it in the test first the code I do want to break the test I want to do things progressively so let's just add another property there okay there should be question yes it's an array of strings this is an arat string starts with an in theory yes and

04:53	every time you wrote your question you append the question yes on to questions and question yes so now let's go test by test the first one checks the count to zero now we can check that these arrays empty is empty yes and I need to change my insertion did you get flat from this - [Music] yeah okay the one question growls - question yes so now just question it should be equal to q1 now right with only one item in that is q1 come on you that's two question and this is the same practically right now right yes so let's

05:52	make it past them they're not let's see it's passing first and then we can adjust your mocha okay okay which one should we keep I like the correct in the name so I think I can I can remove the first one okay I still think this one is important but we need to change it to the question okay with two questions throughout the first question so this is questions okay I don't have to account to use anymore so I can get rid of this and you can also get rid of the relative question yes it's actually much simpler it is in my

06:50	lighter okay and again people always ask me so who test the spine right for me so if you change that that is going to break so as you are doing TDD these PI is backing up the expectations so if you don't follow through the DTS I wouldn't have confidence on this pi but since it's this pi is also progressively growing with my code it is mainly that ever to use it is right and also if we get very complicated in it's important i sharing this pie I'll probably add test for it but I do want to have a very

07:27	complicated right it's smell I think if you end up with a with a complicated spy it means that your design should be it's probably doing too much yeah yeah you should look things over definitely so I can uncommon this town and when I'm starting twice with your questions I'm routing to first question twice what we need to test the captured questions and you should have q1 twice exactly what do you know yes it's green okay yeah that was expected okay so how do we go from q1 to q2 I would say since you tell them throughout

08:23	her to present a question we should have a way of getting back the answer right provided so maybe we can present a legate or we can pass just the closure closure employ just a block I think with the with the answer as a parameter yeah it sounds reasonable so I'll back I'm gonna I'm going to just spike here for a second so this is like the answer cold but right yes do you mean something like this yes you get a swing back well if we're going to use the answer as a string as well which for at least in this version and for our

09:03	purposes right now I think English thing to do yeah okay so let me adjust your British so my router would if we if we were to have a call back here right it would probably need to capture this codebook so we can fire it so we can fire it exactly yeah let's let's do it okay so I can have something like armchair whole block and it can be a if it will want the answer and return nothing is an actual thing and what we've done is add an optional for now because so far we don't need it I think that's a big difference if

09:45	you're testing object C or sweet note that C you always would test the new case but since here we're not going to make this optional the compiler is going to force that it's not gonna be optional you're not going to write these tests yeah exactly and now we can say something like on peer hooks aren't your code box equal on to your code box yeah if you have one here and we need one and this is a string and it's not optional to avoid and it is not optional okay but okay it's something else going

10:20	on here we need this to be escaping right yes what are you capturing it but now we have to think we make this escaping for our spy but it is going to have to leak in the protocol is it the behavior we want I think it is because when you have a game and you have a flow in you're passing a block you are allowing it not to reply straight away you say hey it's fine to hold this block you have any focus when you're ready to give me an answer yeah and I think that's fine I don't think that's a leak I think that's a

10:57	behavior a and switch really helped us to express this idea yes it's fine to hold this block for as long as you want and you invoke it yeah and we should say that this is just one of many options and possible ways to implement it you could play the type instead of just disclosure yeah happy carry on okay so the escaping should be close to the definition of the type that's it okay okay let's let this is a protocol now okay another compiler is forcing it to give a call back uh-huh well since it's the last one with you Oh

11:46	meet Disney yes can do this syntax right yeah since it's the last parameter of this function and now I complained about the years founder now builders okay let's create this - where are we going to start give it an answer okay so see test start well let's say start in and say first question first question with your relations clear questions it aroused the second question exactly so now we will start and the start becomes part of our given part and now their outer given each peasant answer yeah I just named it a one for now this

12:40	guy's something because because this is optional which is fine for my test yes it is fine but thinks this is not optional in our production code we can we can let's enforce it why don't we give it a default in default value right okay I can do this so I can give it value right here no no you can get rid of the bank yes so when I answer I want to be routed to q1 and q2 yes uh q1 was fired by the starts minted exact and I have a failing test hopefully and then yes for okay like it was well the easy thing to do here is to

13:28	route it again inside the block inside the book okay okay and that's the next question we need well but if we use q2 now yes we are cheating and that's not allowed in TDD roots so we can get the next question based on the index of the first one or some other way yes okay let me I'm just gonna have next question here okay okay and then again as I meet them I can do this the next question is questions let me get the index first it's a question and get the index directly right index off first question and this returns an

14:26	optional yes and that's the index of the first question yes okay so now questions first question index plus one okay so now this goes here perfect so the problem here I guess is the winning self right because we're capturing so inside the block yeah so now we need to think about memory yes and router the same yes yeah but now we need to think that we are capturing these self in there strongly and we have a reference to router so in router is holding this so we have a return cycle there we need to make these weak can we define or we can

15:23	call it unknown which creates an optional yes but if you make it unknown you're just telling the compiler I know what I'm doing again is never going to be executed yeah in the case that this was be a locked so yeah but it can crush that I never know my family if it's going to cross but the problem there but we can say since you have a reference to the router and you are passing this message there it means that the voter is never going to do not wireless slowly in memory the problem is if the router passed block to

15:53	someone else they may have a problem we prefer to have it as weak okay and have a guard so let's add a week for a French okay Chelsea return tomato zone okay you just penises on the strong feel here strong from here and a strong fourteen run the test so now if I run I should be passing and I am okay how to do a commit here yeah so we reach this point that we have to find a way to continue to the next question or the next part of the slope yes and I don't like where this code is going easily because it's ugly

16:47	first of all it's very ugly there's a lot of horsemen rough Nationals and also well it's something that's ko no or a bunch of question we write again you're going to have to copy and paste these for as many questions we have maybe some kind of recursion yeah yeah I'm sort of progressing to the next one recursively yes okay I think that's all go for next tomato let's grab a coffee okay come back okay yeah [Music] you

Key Insights

- 💡 Modularity and rapid feedback testing are crucial in creating a Swift framework for a game engine. By separating business logic from UI, the code can be easily deployed on different platforms. - 💡 The decision to use a class instead of a struct for the flow is based on the behavior of the flow being more important than the data it holds. The class allows for easier communication between components. - 💡 Creating a spy router helps in testing the routing of questions in the flow. The spy router captures the number of times a method is invoked, providing valuable information for testing and debugging. - 💡 The use of test-driven development (TDD) and pairing helps in reasoning about the problem and coming to an understanding faster. It allows for sharing knowledge and passing on expertise, resulting in more efficient development. - 💡 The approach of focusing on increments and clear communication during pairing sessions helps in avoiding time wastage and ensures that the project progresses smoothly. - 💡 The use of modular code and rapid feedback testing not only improves the speed of development but also makes it easier to maintain and update the code in the future. - 💡 The flexibility and generality of the models in the framework allow for data to be sourced from different platforms, making the code adaptable and scalable.


Transcription:

00:00	hey this is kaya and this is Mike from essentia developer.com [Music] so before we start I would like to set some rules here okay first of all we should stop every 30 minutes okay like a tomato yes right so we can rethink what we're doing and we can have a brainstorm reflect yes and also since we started as an iOS application in other ones you have this limitation I'll let you start a new project and I really think it's important for us to show ways where you can accelerate write make the rapid feedback testing faster and also

00:48	create modular code okay so we could start with the simple mac OS application yes I don't want to have the limitation on platforms I agree so I think this thing can running anything I would really like to see this game on the TV OS at some point yeah I think it makes sense okay so let's start as my classification have a said the alarm yes okay so let's create it as a framework and that's going to be the real game our game works right the engine yes exactly okay so it's how the game operates just

01:22	it logic with no UI no external world that's the modularization of our project right we can we can separate the business logic from the UI so now if you want to deploy it later on the Apple TV you just need to plug in the Apple TV UI same for the iPhone same for the iPad maybe for the watch for the watch yeah okay okay let's people so let's call the quiz engine switch let me test yes please okay okay it create some files for me I don't want any of this yeah we can get rid of those okay so think we're thinking about the game

02:17	using the first thing we can reason about right now about how your parade is this loop of questions until we reach the result right NSE lecture that's low right the game how the game flows from question to question until we reach the result I think can start that yeah sounds good definitely I don't want to start from creating assumptions for modules right because I really don't know how our models are going to fit there so it could probably add complexity that we don't need there so we know that we are going to need the

02:55	flow right so we can start from there yeah I think the models need to be very flexible generic because we can get data from so many different sources right okay let's see what we can create from here okay let's start with a simple test all right slow test okay we need to import exit tests and let's start with for flow test class okay let me create this test and you tell me what you think about it so I'd like to start the test with a case that I have no questions okay you might seem silly but it's a

03:48	possibility you don't want this to happen but if it happens if you want to have to crash let's say exactly you want to do with it deal with it yeah okay you need a way to start a flow to start the game right okay so we're probably going to need some kind of heart function given a scenario let's say no questions or let it with no questions what we want to happen go to results is yes okay so this flow since its decouple from any UI in any platform it needs to delegate the presentation to someone

04:37	else right like this is roofing like this way of presenting in a navigation controller or the model or any other any-any but find a specific way yeah so okay as I don't know how to name this yet but though I'm going to start which was assertion what I expect to happen let's say I have a router and I will be expected not to routes to any question let's start there okay I don't wanna think about results yet I don't know how the result looks like so routed question count whoops zero yeah yeah sorry so I have a broader

05:27	and I will make sure that when I start with no questions I don't Rob to any question yep - no up and then something I can't start and it's probably the flow but since this is the object under test or the system under tab I don't want to call it flow I agree every time I open a test case file a test file what I want to see is one in my testing here yes right and having consistency in naming I know people to call it object under test I know people call the assistant under test I prefer sitting on the test

06:13	yeah and I use sut I think it reads better and oh you T or I've seen many code bases oh you two look like out right it's like or they literally have object under test you know written there which is I think it's too big for the purposes okay so we need to create an su t + su t ease the flow yes system under test is the flow and it also matches the name of the test file right we have a class normally I normally called my test file the same name of the class under test or the short under test I mean seeing on the

06:56	test let's test it in yes but sometimes your test file is testing a bunch of classes together which is more like an integration test you would have a different name I worry about what it's doing the behavior and behavior of the system on the whole yes exactly and you neither alter their also yes so the phone is you know about the route there so it can communicate uh-huh okay I'm going to create a router here and I'll pass it to my flow and so far I can even compile it because none of those pipes

07:40	axes okay I can try unity fail of course okay Toto start creating the flow curve and think this is production code I'm going to add it to my my name folder yeah so I'm ready as flow as well then I'm going to show something here that I've learned with John Reid okay anybody change my life so if you if you hold shift alt and command and select a file you can open it in a different beginning please the window yeah pretty much so I like to have my unit test on the left and the production called on the

08:30	right but whatever works for you now can make space here and focus entire restrictions exactly okay exactly so finally you can create more class flow I think you are pairing and we are using this as a showcase I think we should reason about everything we do why do you select to create a class in order to strike here exactly why is this a class well it could be a stroke so far there's no need for the class yeah and I think the discussion a lot lately when people are talking well if he doesn't need to be a client it should

09:12	be a struct and people saying also it's not because it doesn't have to get class it should be a threat so there's at least like two schools of thought in right and how should handle it at first I would make everything stroke just to see how far I could go right but nowadays I probably thinking more about this when I said what I mean doesn't make anything for this flow to be handled like playing data something that you can pass around to invite you to copy you have it yeah or is this more like an I think it is more like a

09:45	behavior rather than data I definitely see it more as at the behavior and unjust playing values right I don't think it makes sense to copy this thing right if you really want to make this very very functional and the detail were you know yeah you could make this a stroke because you're going to make just few functions but I don't see any value right now to make this work I think these more s behavior rather than data so I'm inclined to make this a class maybe change it in the future it's just

10:16	how I feel about it right now and that's why I chose it I feel glad I think it's fine I think fine right now okay let's carry on yeah let's go so we need a Bluetooth here and what is this Reuter well I will terr is a type that we're going to communicate but we don't know this annotation yet because it can have many implementations depending on the platform it's running so it's pretty much a protocol right okay to contract it's a culture I like that it doesn't tie us down to any

10:54	implementations yes let's make this a protocol and we need to have initializers because that's a class if we bought this truck you would get to utilize it for free and this is one of the reasons people think it should be striped because you write less code maybe they're right like let's see what if we go okay so we're going to have to invite or initializer so we can capture the Reuter that's it what do you think of setting the router as private should start thinking about access control right now

11:33	well especially because this class now is internal and it's not accessible to our test target I want other modules talking to this module I don't need modular painting from other modules I don't need to make being a shall I sit public maybe we're gonna have some factory that's going to yeah give you a flow you ever start the game for you I don't know yet but it's a decision we don't need to make right now and yes I don't think we need so let's keep it internal or no okay open them you can make these

12:05	internal class accessible to our test target by making a testable import click import the crease engine so now we have access to all the internal types and functions anything right other thing we could do is to change the target memory nose file to the target test but then you had to manage these I don't like that I like that that's not the way to go okay we cannot compile yet because these relative or rooted or ruder how they say that I don't know I'm very confused okay someone tells us I would pronounce

12:48	be in the comments okay so this router or Rooter the protocol is not created like that so we're going to probably have a fake one right I think for our needs we can create the spy all right okay so let's go to our alters client here so being the flow test class yeah inner class it isn't to the public to anyone now we need to use it which we move it to a file exported yoga expert violet fine here needs to conform to the scene yes things to conform to not that is just an antiparticle so far and if a tactical

13:33	foil or going to work first of all my so don't have a start match it almost there okay let's create a strike method does nothing that's it one more now we need to add this question count here and let's make an integer and you can have a default value o zero okay we're not going to see a failing test but we had to build errors and it's pretty dumb so far yes okay so now we can name this test hearing start with no questions does not route to any girl two questions okay yeah I don't think that we didn't

14:34	see a failing test here but that they know what tests okay so okay let's see what happens if I have one question route the question uh-huh okay so we need a way to start this with question okay sounds like we can inject in we're okay it could be an array of question what is a type could be a swing no I think so ready we don't need anything else talking anymore so just a string yes okay so we need these in again at this here we're going to capture so now we're going to break our text like don't

15:40	compile anymore okay so what I want to do I want to comment out this one and make it the first one that was passing pass again okay right please compile so it's pretty easy to see that no question is just an empty array it's not new to mental ray exactly there are no questions it's ready declarative and I can do it again yes it passes okay no if I have what you always want to refactor from green right that's very important because if you don't your factor from green it's hard to keep

16:25	track your changes and you might you might break more things as you go right yes so it does on the complexity a lot it is low you down and you lose a lot of confidence right plus on when you're green you can commit so you can revert back then if you mess up in the future when you're facture follow a bunch of things we can do here we also every time we make a test pass we can commit right I think that's a little extreme low yeah or we can say every time you make like five tests pass or you get a behavior or

17:00	exactly you commit when you get to behave a chunk the ankh of the function I'd like to commit before I start factoring because I do something that I don't like I can just revert yeah easily correct I don't like to rely on undo in my ID don't think that's the way to go yes so far we have only two tests we didn't do any refactoring yet I think we are good okay so my expectation now is that this count should give one but how are we going to accumulate this count we need a way of capturing this so we need

17:34	the flow to send a message to the router this router again it's just a protocol now because you're going to have different segmentation for different up front on iOS you probably going to have a navigation controller routing or a storyboard route right the handles going on question to question and presenting the UI now we need to add a method here to our relative okay that just route to well question to question any questions I think okay so you can you know pass the string all right I think that's what

18:17	we need so far and our spy is going to have to implement it and what it's going to do is just accumulate the count the number of times this method was invoked that's the behavior one okay so if we run this we have a failing PAC nice okay so to make this pass a simpler thing yes we just invoke that to question and anything just a finger okay something but now we broke our first test and clear how the test helps you hate it comes very silly to have the zero count but now we have a bug if you didn't have the test exactly

19:15	to make this path you need to check if questions not is empty or not not empty very empty yeah then we're under now it has it why is it so fast by the way eugenicists well because I'm not when you simulated okay and running the microwave target I was blazing fast instant right innocent people may think I'm cutting the video whenever the really that does the yeah how fast is this cycle yeah rapid feedback so when you're dealing with business logic in a separate component it does any although you know that it

19:59	needs to be deployed on iOS let's say you can just make a new module for the mark and have this speed as a bonus yes definitely and every time we have code there is no I related more business rules or even sometimes a service or an API layer or have is a separate project where I can run the test in isolation right Dec had this product to the CI server so when I'm testing my app I don't have to test the API layer at the same time if we decelerate my process caching run being a test several times a

20:36	minute yeah every time I changes single line I rerun my entire project test no funds go I'm on you all the time so far is going out nothing okay me improve my test feedback and it makes my code modular and swing-wing yeah okay so we have this but now I don't like this hard-coded thing here from my next set I want to make sure that I'm getting the quasi question yep okay so I'm going to create with one question well to questioning but now instead of testing the count on a test the value passed to

21:22	them well exactly so routed question should be q1 q1 okay or tomatoes done okay should I just make this test pass yeah before stop yeah right quickly yeah 30 seconds so I'm going to create a relative question so now I can investigate the value yes and I think you need to give it a default value okay so I'm going to make it inaudible fine the main two rods your correct question let's run these and we have a penny test

22:28	and we can stop you okay okay okay so far how are you feeling involved is approach I think that's very important if I can actually think first the problem and it's just thirty minutes as you said right we don't lose a bunch of time most of the time we're talking Hank we are clearing right exactly no even writing code we are reasoning we are coming to an understanding and showing this approach so I'll say much much faster when we focus on inches let's get this done I think this conversation is so important

23:08	yeah because one thing about pairing is that you're passing the knowledge you are sharing your possibility and it thinks that you head to brain what's better than one and let's say one day I'm sick on more holidays can confirming you can pet acknowledge forward to another side most importantly we do not see the signature [Music] you Thanks

We kick off the season by discussing some of the features of the app such as question and answer formats and possible multiplayer options. We then jump to the creation of a prototype, which allows us to have a point of reference and eliminate any assumptions as we move forward and finally reflect if investing 15 minutes for creating it was worth it in the first place. Spoiler alert! Of course, it was!

hey this is kaya and this is Mike from
essential developer.com so I have this
idea about creating a quiz up but it
will have different formats for
questions and answers and I'll give an
example they say we have a narrative and
we can add the question such as where
was it hardest work and we would have
options with text but we could also add
something like which would be painting
or painted by the artist and then we
will just show images as options for
hunters okay so could you play me a song
and I have to get good bear it
yes definitely could be and I could play
against my friend yes so what do you
think abilities I like it it looks
simple I think you can get complicated
actually with services so my own
starting data would player but it will
be a great showcase here on business
yeah good we I guess so ok let's do it
[Music]
okay let's do this prototype can I Drive
here I think it's important for me to
show if I got your idea I think that
make sense okay
all right let's make these a single view
application call it quits for now Swift
unit test yeah it looks all right
it okay we can use the storyboard does
the prototyping tool here yeah it's
pretty easy to use and we're going to
now write code exactly let's say let's
see I see it as a navigation controller
while you can go from question to
question maybe go back and forth until
you get to the last one and you show the
result page yeah that sounds good
okay let's get rid of this let's have a
table view controller
where we can have a question and every
cell would be a potential answer yeah
okay and you can out your question of
the tableview header yeah
it doesn't have to be a cell right okay
let's make these the route
okay I like this idea so if I have a
label I can add it at the header like
that
and I can have static sales in
storyboard without any code I can put a
working table view yeah on the screen is
a kind of what you see is what you get
exactly I think three or options here is
enough let's set a question and I have
an idea
why is mics nice and everything okay
okay okay I think you look a bit
Canadian I first as before we have an
American accent so the things always but
I know where you were from that's how I
see the quiz right now yeah this'll
tableview a question some potential
answers as is selected you go to the
next question
yeah you progressed to the next question
okay so for this prototype we can
probably check it from one question can
copy and paste these and create another
question yes so if you select the right
one this is a better fit right or not
but for the prototype and that's fine
yeah what should we have here what skies
nationality okay let's go with that
okay what is my nationality but that's
tricky I know it can have a multiple
selection view exactly
okay so let's make this table view
multiple selection okay let's see what
these girls in my Portuguese American or
in my Brazilian
okay but if I have multiple questions I
cannot just select something and go to
the next question we will need a way for
progressing here and maybe a simple bar
button item could do it okay so I'm
going to have to add a navigation item
to module controller yeah probably the
right bar button
submit submit okay and from here I think
for the prototype we can just go to the
result page yeah - question pages right
now so I think the result they should
look like a table filled as well to be
present every cell can be the result
yeah I agree
and we will have to find a way for
showing the correct answer and the wrong
answer in case yes
so here the submit button will segue to
the result and not the cell okay so we
need some kind of summary something like
that
yeah yeah and every cell would be a
question and the answer should we repeat
a question here I think provide some
context okay let's make this a little
bit bigger maybe double the size okay
well what's that Creek it's a kind of
education that you got it right a caller
with green color probably green color
okay and that's what's my concern
yes thank you what is my X nationality
well what about mine let's say you got
it wrong how would you show that
we can show with read the user answer
and then underneath with green the
correct answer what do you think yeah so
maybe three lines three lines yeah okay
at least for now for the brilliant okay
that make sense so let's say you've got
it wrong push already in red then second
line or a third line with the right
answer yes okay come on separate it
consecrated and that's fine for now
suppose you can have a designer working
on this hopefully hopefully and let's
put this green okay
and we can get rid of this nice table
view we don't need it let's add some
titles or the view controller yeah okay
so we're going to have to add some
navigation bar or navigation
accommodation our engine result page so
result should we add it here why should
we add for the questions maybe just yeah
question something simple more one and
question number two okay I think that
looks correct
let's run the up sadly so okay let's run
the app come and see what happens
okay here it is the running prototype
and if I select Greek for my nationality
I go to the next question in here I can
select more than one but let's say for
the sake of the prototype right let's
like a Brazilian submit this is it this
is how I pictured it and I think we got
it right here
okay that looks nice it's native it can
run on my iPhone I can show it to my
friend yes I don't know about nice as
you said but it definitely communicates
the idea and that's the important thing
it shows intent exactly and actually we
didn't write any code that's what I want
to do say also no code at all how quick
was it to build it probably less than 15
minutes pretty happy of the result me
too
alright good job yeah cool so this
prototype thing was it worth it
we'll see but it took us less than 15
minutes and now we have a clear idea on
what to build so I will say yes it was
worth definitely and if you are lucky
enough to have a designer working with
you they could come up with images and
you can just leave it or if you have
fancy software you can do it for you but
a cost-effective solution as we saw our
take server so what should we do next
start coding finally but I'm going to
this from a developer exactly a
production code is everywhere
I don't think we need a spike we have
this total size and just carry on
watching code test we can charge with a
simple test and then get from there yeah
that's good you
Thanks
