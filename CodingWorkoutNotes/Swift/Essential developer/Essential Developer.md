Link: [# How to crack the Senior iOS Dev interview: Test project review & preparation | Live Dev Mentoring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooMGe2UUhEs)
Notes:
**Advantages:**

1. **Commitment to Learning:** The developer demonstrated a strong commitment to learning and improving their skills, as evidenced by their participation in the Essential Developer Academy and their effort to apply learned concepts in the project.
2. **Attention to Detail:** Attention to detail in certain parts of the project, such as cleaning up the AppDelegate and ensuring a smooth scrolling performance, was noted as a positive aspect.
3. **Clean Code and Architecture:** The project was recognized for its adherence to clean code principles and solid architecture, suggesting a thoughtful and deliberate approach to coding.

**Drawbacks:**

1. **Complexity in Certain Implementations:** Some implementations, such as the use of OperationQueue for image loading, added unnecessary complexity and were not fully understood or justified by the developer.
2. **Lack of Comprehensive Testing:** With a test coverage of 42%, certain functionalities and aspects of the project were not thoroughly tested. Notably, the lack of UI tests was pointed out as an area for improvement.
3. **Missed Opportunities for Efficiency:** There were missed opportunities to optimize the project, such as not canceling image requests when cells were reused, leading to potential inefficiencies and race conditions.

**Tips and Advice:**

1. **Explain Your Decisions:** When making architectural or design decisions, especially in a project for an interview, it's crucial to explain your reasoning. This helps reviewers understand your thought process and the trade-offs you considered.
2. **Opt for Simplicity When Appropriate:** While it's important to demonstrate your ability to write clean, architecturally sound code, it's equally important to avoid overengineering, especially for simple features or when the added complexity does not provide substantial benefits.
3. **Pay Attention to UI/UX Details:** Even small details like the aspect ratio of images or the initial presentation of a search screen can impact the user experience and the reviewers' perception of your attention to detail.

**Lecture Content:** The session involved a detailed review of an interview test project for a senior iOS developer position. The project requirements included creating an application using the Flickr API, with features such as a two-column scrollable view, image search functionality, pagination, and storing search history.

**Main Challenges:**

1. **Balancing Complexity and Requirements:** One of the main challenges was deciding how complex the solutions should be, given the project requirements, and whether certain implementations (like using Core Data for simple storage needs) were overkill.
2. **Ensuring Efficient Resource Management:** Properly managing resources, such as canceling image download requests when cells are reused, was identified as a critical aspect, especially for a senior developer position.
3. **Test Coverage and Quality Assurance:** Achieving comprehensive test coverage and ensuring that all parts of the application are properly tested (including handling async operations in tests) was a challenge noted during the review.

**Importance and Usefulness of the Topic:** The review session underscored the importance of clean code, efficient resource management, and comprehensive testing in software development. It highlighted how attention to detail, clear communication of decisions, and understanding the trade-offs in architectural choices are crucial, especially for senior developer roles.

**Accomplishments:** The developer successfully built a functioning application that met the basic requirements of the project. The application demonstrated good adherence to clean code principles and solid architectural practices. The developer's commitment to learning and applying best practices was evident throughout the session.

**Summary of the Content:** The mentoring session provided an in-depth code review of an interview test project, focusing on code quality, architectural decisions, resource management, and testing. It offered constructive feedback, highlighted areas for improvement, and emphasized the importance of explaining design decisions and avoiding unnecessary complexity.

**Interesting Quotes or Insightful Sentences:**

- "It's important to explain your reasoning behind certain architectural choices to avoid misunderstandings and demonstrate your thought process to reviewers."
- "Efficiency in resource management, such as canceling unnecessary requests, is crucial and can be a deciding factor, especially for senior-level positions."
- "While aiming for clean code and solid architecture is commendable, it's equally important to ensure that the added complexity is justified and serves a clear purpose."

hello everyone welcome to a live dev mentoring session in these sessions we help students of
the essential developer academy to solve any software development problems they're facing
today we're helping our student vitar hello hello hi thank you for joining us
also with us mike instructor in the academy and bogdan instructor in the academy as
well yeah hello everyone hello hello guys
so guitar for how long have you been a software developer well i started
since i was 13 started programming as a hobby
after that i went to high school studied computer science and after that
to college since 2010 so professionally i have
around seven years of working experience as a software engineer but
there's more years because i started as a hobby but in ios development around
four years four years ios nice since the led of 2018
started ios development awesome awesome and today we review an
interview test project that is sent to a company which position was the interview for
i was applying to senior position yeah okay
senior position okay let's look at the requirement first
and then we can discuss the project
so they ask you to create an application that uses the flickr image search api
and shows the results in a two column scrollable view okay
in swift users should be able to search images
okay so there's search element so if you open the app what should you see just a search screen
okay lace loading
only loads what's needed at the time so if you load the images only load the images that you need
on screen to save bandwidth nice
and it should automatically request more images so paginate right as you scroll it should paginate and load more pages
okay and if you have a history of past search terms
so if you search something you should store it right yes just just for it's uh
the search terms i i just i started this and aside the core data
okay so use code data here
okay feel free to use any technologies or third-party libraries that you are
comfortable with okay that's rare usually companies ask don't use third-party libraries
did you use any no no okay
cool so feel free to use any technologies
okay priorities deliver working application always always in an interview for everyone that is watching this video
your app should work a lot of people focus too long in trying to clean up the code and they get stuck
and you know with architectural decisions and they send a project that doesn't even compile like you're not going to pass the interview like this it
needs to work quick solutions are acceptable so they
are open to you know just quick and dirty solutions given the time constraints
just be ready to discuss your choices okay focus on clean code and architecture
okay quick solution is acceptable but yes okay it's a bit
contradicting here right yeah it's like you can do whatever you want
but focus on clean code and architecture
make good use of this text to demonstrate and show off your coding skills okay when companies
say show off it's pretty much like don't be afraid of over engineering to show your skills i think is it i don't know like show us
there's a bit you know there's some contradicting elements here okay
deliverables it should deliver the source code of the project and a set of instructions if there are any
project specific configurations if you have any dependencies you know it's always important if
your project has any specific configuration they need to do like it needs to be clearly defined
but ideally you should like the interviewer should be able to just download your project clone it from a
github repository press command r and it should run you know if they need to do too many like setups and configuration
and install dependencies maybe it's not going to be good for you
okay so we expect requirements to be delivered within four to six hours
okay that's a bit yeah it's not short
actually uh when i implemented this project i was on
holiday so i very i was too upset because i didn't
pass because i took some my holiday free time my my free time to work in
this project so yeah it took me three days actually to finish
it not six hours okay so would you say like working around eight hours a day three days
uh not eight hours exactly it's around four or five so okay because i was on
vacation so but for i deliver it in three days okay so let's say it took
between 12 to 15 hours to come yes yes okay around that it was an investment
you're wearing holidays but you're investing in your career right so just look at the positive
right so yeah four to six hours like a bit
short you would be using a bunch of libraries like sure if use kingfisher to load the images and
use a little fire to load some stuff and then you put everything together with a bunch of libraries probably with no tests you could
do something quick but i don't think that was the goal when you're trying to pass the interview show your skills just
by putting a bunch of libraries together but they were open for it right they were open to for you to use any
third-party dependencies so for me uh i don't like use any third
parties because if there is i don't do i don't want to depend on any
outsource libraries because it's will be deprecated or and
you know it's uh it's with a lot of issues yeah we recommend also to avoid
third-party libraries especially the ones that you don't need you know like things that are small they can become problematic in the future but there's
nothing wrong using libraries like they can really help you go faster but at least in your architecture you create a
boundary so your application doesn't depend on it too much if it depends the problem is if you depend too much on a
library and then it goes outdated or there's a problem or a bug or security issue then it's difficult to get rid of it or
replace it but if you create a good boundary it's okay to use libraries and get the extra
speed of getting a ready solution right so there's nothing wrong with using dependencies as long as you know
what you're doing and you're separating your application from it so i think there is a bit of a mismatch
here of what they were looking for the way they work it looks like they probably internally there is a lot of
libraries from what they write here they use a bunch of libraries and they expect things to be done very quickly with
although they say attention to detail like clean code and tests i it doesn't feel like that's what they do
in the day-to-day work from the interview so maybe it was a bit of a mismatch of what you're looking for how you like to work with them like there's
no wrong everyone works the way they like to work right you care more about things that maybe they don't care too
much about because if they're expecting four to six
hours okay so however please keep in mind that this is not a speed test take your time
okay so if they ask you to provide how much
time it took you to deliver so if you say i took 12 to 15 hours
maybe like oh no you should have used kingfisher and put a bunch of libraries together and
finish quickly no tests let's see crucial points write clean
production ready code okay write comments
okay i don't know if it's because they like to work like this or because they want you to explain your reasoning because in interviews sometimes they ask
you to write comments not because you should write comments because your code ideally should be as much as
possible you know like explaining itself it should be clean enough that you can understand it
but maybe they were asking you to write comments to just explain oh i did this decision here because of that but
it's unclear why they say write comments
yeah yeah right tess okay so they care about that's nice
avoid over engineering although they say go and show off your excuse
okay so try to avoid too many steps to make
the application compile nice as we said like we should open the project command r
should run the app yeah that's the best experience for the interviewer
so when finished send the github repository to your contact person okay did you send github repository
yeah make sure the link is accessible public okay or private and you give them
access also send the assignment as if we can also send as a zip file but make sure
you include a commit history okay and this is important a lot of people like you ask send please send a
your link to a git repository and someone sends a zip file with no commit history
you know like it's always good to read the instructions and send exactly what they asked
all right and what was the feedback you got
positive aspects so here's your project so anyone that is watching this session now we are live
here if you want to get the project you can find it here on this link
okay so they were happy solid principles implementation clean code sports landscape and dark mode no
third-party libraries okay so it was a positive so although they say you could use it they were happy that you didn't
yeah you wrote unit tests nice no pods so they see no pods as a benefit it's a
positive aspect nice very smooth scoring performance when scrolling on first go cool
now the improvement areas no ui tests
did you feel the requirement the need to write ui tasks or are you covered enough with unit tests that you uh
for me uh they didn't mention to write ui tests
uh so i didn't write even though i
i i think about it to write actually your eye test but as i told you i was in
during holidays so just facing rushing times to accomplish to finish
the project so maybe i in the past i should use
right ui test yeah even it's not too difficult to write ui
test i don't know i personally wouldn't if someone wears ui tests i would rather
have much more unit tests than ui tests because again we're going to be reviewing this code the way we would
reveal we're an essential developer right mike and bogdan as well so
would you guys be expecting ui tests in a project like this just loading a bunch of images what kind of ui tests do you
need there you can cover everything with unit tests there are some interactions in some applications that ui test is
pretty welcome but that's like very few cases and you can cover most of the
things with unit tests like you wouldn't need ui tests for a simple application like
this so i don't think that's an improvement area if you covered enough tests with unit tests
yeah yeah yeah i mean the other thing is like maybe they work you know only with ui tests in their everyday operations
you know and they they just don't don't do unit tests you know okay it's nice to submit unit
tests but you know let's get real and yeah okay yeah
if that's how they work then maybe it's already a mismatch like that's why i
tell everyone that sends a project like write the code the way you would like to work with them you know like if you
don't think the ui test is the way like we teach that there are better solutions and you only resort to ui tests when
there's the actual needs in cases that are really necessary that you cannot cover things
properly with unit tests then you write your code like that you know because then if they reject you at
least you're not going to get a job in a position in a place you will be unhappy you know because if they're writing a lot of
you ui tests probably their ci will take hours to complete you know it's very common to join teams and like
they have a very slow delivery pace although they finish features in three four hours it takes them 10 hours to
integrate because they take shortcuts in some places and you know i'm not saying that they do i don't know i don't even
know which company this is but just saying that yeah i i find it weird to this
the way i would look at projects like i wouldn't expect ui tests for a flickr
api simple app you know but they do so
there's a mismatch here as well the the thing is at least in in my experience that
some teams relying heavily on ui tests don't know don't think this is a problem
so unless somebody tells you that i don't know a one hour build plus tests is too much
you you don't know like you you think well how how else can i can i do the test
and it's a like it's not a point of debate it's just the
only thing they they know how to do and they say oh but it's much better than manual
testing and that's right like instead of having some manual qa do that you you
put your app through some ui tests but we've talked about this many times like
what the downsides of ui tests are and yeah
yeah we're like companies yeah go ahead i work in companies i just joined them
and they have like a four hours uh ci pipeline and
of course they were flaky tests and then it just rebranded or always which test failed and you say that oh this test
failed okay just ignore it if you know like and then start ignoring tests it takes too long and
you lose the benefits of having a test suite it gets in the way so people start ignoring everyone they start you know
stop running they start doing ci skip to do delivery faster
and and that's the problem and i remember they they didn't think it was a problem
you know and they bought new machines and maybe they brought it down to two hours and they were extremely happy it's not only takes
two hours and for me was like no it should take like minutes or seconds even
you know so it's a culture i think it's the word for it right it's like
exactly how they'd like to work and to your point imagine just imagine this
scenario like guitar is you're used to unit tests more than ui tests and you you go into that team like
you you probably won't fit at first because they expect you to write ui like they say okay
you're gonna write some unit tests but we don't have a good unit test coverage and everything we don't rely on
them so we expect you to do a ui test because that's how we like the culture
kyle's mentioning so the the i don't think this is a problem with
your project it's something that they care for in their culture and
of course they didn't say it in the requirements but they were expecting ui tests because that's probably how they
work so you see immediately it's like kyle said you you write the project in the way you would like to work and if it's
not a good match then no problem yes
now there's a lot of things that are not said in the test
like requirements they sent to you how to know them how to know they care
about ui tests so for everyone that is watching here this is important how to know what people want if they
don't tell you in the test project you will before when you join a company or even process of
interviewing you will research them you will check the website they usually have a tech blog you would see who works
there do they have blogs what are they blogging about what do they care about if they care about ui test their tech
blog will be full of how we optimize our ui tests to go from two hours to one hour
how we do fast ui tests and how we cover you know our code base with ui tests and then okay they care about ui tests
so that's how you you know the things they don't tell you research
and nowadays like most companies have tech blogs it's easy to to find
or if you if you yeah i was going to say that if you don't find that information publicly then you can just
ask during the interview process like okay can you tell me a bit about your dev process like how do you test how you
deliver like what's your maybe what does a regular development day look like
stuff like that so then you at least i i asked this uh i'd like to know up up front
how they work and again if it's a feat or not because
you want to avoid a situation where you're forced into some practices that you don't don't want to do
yes like for me yes if i read the top description and i gonna check their tech blog and i see
they're crazy about ui tests my interest in the company will drop a lot
unless in the interview they say that they need someone that can come there and help them improve their ci cd
process and speed up because they are having issues with ui tests and they need someone with expertise of replacing ui
tests with faster alternatives then i was like okay that's my skill i
can get a code base that is completely messy and have slow builds and i can make it better and they're looking for
it and then it matches my skill set and what i like to do right but if you said no they're happy with it
and that's how they work and they expect it to work like that and if you don't like it like it's all you're ready don't even waste your holidays doing a project
right yes yes
uh actually i've learned this i've learned by by in hard way this is listen actually
so it's the last month uh i also applied for
senior position for other companies and
i start reading their uh blog
you know on the website so uh after watching the monitoring session
for code interview inside the academy so i follow this
instructions to applying for a job
right yes yes yeah really recommend you do it it will save you time it will help you focus on
the the right companies for you so you can put more energy in the right direction you know
yeah so this one for me it's like that's not a problem at all for this kind of application you really
don't need ui tests if you covered enough with your unit tests then nibs instead of code which is not
the best choice for large teams again culture right inside the company they don't like nibs or storyboards they
prefer code if you check their blog maybe you're talking about these you know you see their maybe they have open source
projects that you can look at and you see that they never use nibs or storyboards so this is an indication
that they don't care about it but again like maybe if you use everything called
another company they would say oh you should have used storyboards you know that's why it's culture like because
it's subjective to the team image in collection cell is small
okay that's appearance wise i don't think that should disqualify you they wouldn't say oh we're not going to
hire him because he put an image in collection there's too small you know this is just a comment i don't think it's
just a question do you think because i didn't apply ui test and i used naps
instead of code it's enough to reject rejected me i mean if you just
make some other interview and discuss my solution in i2i you know face-to-face
maybe they they took that i have some skills and leadership skills because it's senior
position not genuine or with seniors
this position it's not depends just for coding skills you know for
behavioral skills so do you think this because i didn't
apply ui test or i didn't write
the ui in code it's enough reason i know
in my personal opinion no because i don't care about ui tests in this specific scenario right i don't think
it's necessary but maybe for them it's very necessary like that's how they work that's why
it's hard to say but i don't think so especially nibs like maybe white tess i
would have a higher like bigger weight in their decision but like instead of cold i think they just put
here as a comment hey we don't like nibs you know and they they made it very clear but maybe your
tests have had an impact in that but because you had unit tests it's not like if you had like zero tests i'll say
okay that that's that probably could disqualify you for a senior position
but you didn't do ui tests but use unit test at least as an alternative
did you unit test at least like a view controller for example to test like the interaction with
you know like cells and like how you create cells and things okay so like you covered at least some
parts but you need to look at the coverage what is the coverage in the project
uh i think it's 42 42. i know it's uh it's not fully tested at
the testable but slow it's low so
it's like if you have only 42 unit tests you probably should have written some ui tests to kind of you know cover some
from a higher level point if you cannot get that coverage with unit tests you know because there's a lag there's
like 58 there's no covert right yeah so i think that missing coverage
they maybe were expecting ui tests at least so there is a huge gap like more than half of your code is not
checked at all by any automation right i think that could be a problem yes
and that's even just the coverage number we don't know exactly the number of our certs so
there might be a test layer which is just executed but not asserted so
yeah it could be less than yeah depending on the test because like just having like 42 coverage just means that
those lines were exercised while running tests like but it doesn't mean that their assertions were good enough actually
checking for behavior so usually the number you see here the actual coverage is less than the number
you see it will depend really on the quality of your assertions the quality of your
stats setups you know the quality of your design to make sure that it's easy to test
it's i want to to add something like guitar i i feel like i i know how how it is to be
rejected in interviews and it's hard to it's hard to chew like you
you start to think about it what's the reason like but it i i don't think you
can pinpoint to to an exact reason and they you don't have any clue on how
these guys think like it might be they didn't like you in the live
interview and then they just i don't know sent you some feedback like there can be so many things i knew at
least once i screwed up an interview because i got into a fight with the interviewer about some
apple concept and i was right not really but we kind of got into a
contradiction and i was right i wouldn't i wouldn't write down
and what what did that do to to help me like they they rejected me
probably because of that that's the only explanation i could find
so yeah i'm saying i i know at least for me and probably for you as well it's hard to to
take the rejection but just like it's really hard to to
to know why they did it yes some companies would not give you any feedback those guys were
decent enough to provide you with some feedback which is in line with the project you sent so
it's not made up it's pretty pretty accurate so the best thing to do here is to i
don't know swallow up the the pride and just you know see what you can improve that's
that's it like it's hard but you got to do it yes definitely
what you learned from from this experience as well you know so it doesn't happen again next time because i agree
you know with pokedown like it's it's you cannot read minds here you know so
uh you need to be careful with what you learn because maybe you're going to say oh what i learned here is that i need to
write you a test what i learned here is that i should always use code and not nibs and maybe that's not correct for
that team yes but for others maybe it's not right so you need to be
very careful with what you learn with the interview if you start tailoring for the feedback you got in the interview maybe
you end up in a team that you're not happy with right yeah yeah and what i meant here was specifically you know like if you have
these questions ask them you know like okay if you're afraid oh perhaps it's going to be like the previous one and
should i use nibs you know it's like rolling the dice you know like what are you going to do nibs storyboards
programmatically so yeah just go ahead proactively and ask
them you know hey hey guys i can i can do everything you know like is there is there something specific that you're looking
for to see right this sort of thing or you know about
testing strategies and all that um yeah you usually have a call with them
right before the test project usually have a call with them maybe you can start asking as much questions as
possible before the test project like what is as bogdan said before like what is your
testing strategy like what is the development process all of this will start dictating if you want to work
there if it matches what you're looking for and also how to do the test project
more tailored to that company you know if you like that team like impress them
based on what they they care about and also like sometimes you did perfect
in the interviews your test was good but like the the position was dropped internally
because of some budget issues and they just need to provide feedback oh we decided to go with another candidate
it's like no it's just because they don't want to say hey we lost budget we are going down you know no one's going
to say that like this happens a lot sometimes they open positions just because they want to
promote someone internally and they you know by requirements of the company
they need to open a position to see if there's people in the market with better skills before they hire someone and they
have these fake interviews just to have on paper that they did it and you're just a mock there you know
like it happens but since they provide you feedback it looks like they really looked at it and
went a bit the extra mile but you actually never know what happened you never know the decision making behind it so
don't beat yourself with it like no let's move on exactly i think yes i think productive
comes from like oh what if i have used nibs instead you know like no don't go there
maybe you passed and then you were unhappy there for the next five years of your life you know
yes yes thank you you don't know so there's there's definitely a team that will
reject you because you write ui tests and you you you write all the
ui from code so you don't know like the guy said you have to
ask you can't make assumptions or like steer it in the other direction in your
next interview because they might be the opposite so yes
yes definitely if we impress them like they can even like things that they care about in
their culture just like okay we like this person so much that we can you know like we can ignore some things here so
focus well on the basics on the testing strategies like high coverage and you
you have like performance in your code and there are no bugs it runs well you
know it looks nice so image in collection sounds more like
like no one would ever discard a candidate because of that so this is just the beginner places yes
just pretend it's not here core data is pretty overkill for such a
small project so what are you storing in the core data search terms
search terms what strings yes strings array of strings
yes okay yeah so here i need to agree with them
that it's pretty overkill to store an array of strings in chord data because there is no like relationships of
objects it's not like an object graph right it's not a complex that you need to do querying you need to do any
advanced like paging with faulting to keep memory low no it's just a small list of strings
so what do you suggest to use
memory store in memory oh no in memory it would
not persist across application runs right so if you close the app open again it would not be there so you wouldn't
meet the requirement they asked so you can store an array of strings you know even like if it's a very small
array of strings like what like 10 strings could even be user default you know
actually i i thought about i i think about you
you you use user default not core data but i
thought maybe they want to show off yeah yeah yeah that's the contradicting part like okay
i can use user defaults no i want to impress them they told me to show off so yeah i'm gonna use car data so you
know like okay i see because i i thought about it actually to
use user default but yeah it's just not one of those areas you know because again like it's very
small amount of data very simple uh so
yeah like a simple solution uh it it needs to be a simple solution
right yeah but i get it you know no sensitive uh small
amounts of data user default like because user defaults is stored as
a plain text file like a dictionary so it's not encrypted so if it's no
sensitive like don't start passwords don't store access tokens in the user defaults but a list of strings for
caching that's that's okay it's not you're not gonna have thousands of strings or even thousands of strings should be fine but like you're never
gonna get there with search terms usually because you recycle you only keep the less 30 the less 10
because also showing a list of a thousand store search terms is not helpful to anyone right so
usually you store it just a few like 10 20. it's very small non-sensitive amounts of data user defaults
now restoring larger amount of data they don't need any complexity like
storage for example images can store images in the file system so larger amounts of data but simple like an image
is just a blob of no binary you just store it in the file system and that's it
it's easy to also delete it it's efficient it's not in memory so you can get it when needed
that's it even i used core data but my solution it
was replaceable so you should just use any kind of storing mechanism
because i i i applaud what i've what i've learned from you from you guys from the course
so the project built in modular ways so you can
use any kind of historic mechanism so i thought maybe if we made some kind
interview between me and them to discuss about
what i what i've done you know all right so maybe if you explain that
in the written message because you can see you have a readme here you don't explain well yes they ask you to describe like the decisions you made and
everything use comments so here it was a perfect place and say i decided to go with core data to show off my skills
but for a simple amount of data could even use user defaults and to make sure that i have a clean
architecture and my application is well designed i created a boundary that is not coupling my application with core
data which means i can easily replace it with a file system implementation or with user defaults without changing
anything in my application yeah now you explain the problem you avoided that they calling it over queue
but it didn't explain it so they opened a project like okay he needs to store an array of strings and he's using core data maybe he
doesn't know how to make decisions just because you didn't explain it you do know how to make decisions but you didn't explain it
so they made an assumption and their assumption was wrong to avoid the interviewers making wrong assumptions be
upfront about things always explain your reasoning because even if you're right but they don't understand what you did
you're wrong yes yes definitely
and you can explain if they ask like okay how would you decide user defaults no sensitive small amounts of data file system large larger
amounts of data but simple data no no queries like you can store maybe some json files csv files
now when you need a database like or data around sqlite it's when you have more complex
object graphs they have relationships and you want to do queries no complex queries
get all the objects the user id is to limit by 10 objects the top 10 you know
then you need a more robust solution you can query it has relationships
you know what else here you can do like paging with faulting
which is much more efficient when you paginate and only getting the daytime memory that you need
but this is very complex for just an array of strings so to show off no problem using core
data but you should have explained that that would be best
also explain you have a good architecture you can replace it easily you know you created a boundary there like what
user protocol right so yeah explain it that that would be best
unless no images are fetched offline i didn't see this in the requirement and what does it mean to fashion image
offline i think caching maybe apply some caching mechanism
but in memory not stored offline okay it's just a weird i would
like cached to show offline okay
yep here it could even be like a maybe an in-memory caching
not load the images every time you scroll right you could have an in-memory caching
that would work or fine but if you close the app and open again you would not be there but i find it weird to have
caching images in a flickr app because flickr api never returns the same results every time you query something
you get a completely different list so why would you cache something that is only going to be shown once the only reason is to prevent making too
many requests as you're scrolling in the same uh search term
and doing any memory caching in this case is just fine
in memory caching could be a solution here but i don't know if they meant like they actually wanted to cache in the file
system to be able to use it when we opened it i
i thought to store it in in core data actually
but i as you as you mentioned it's not a
flicker not doesn't return the same result of data every time so
i didn't store it uh in core data but i have this idea to store it in memory but i didn't
i did so this is important yes you said i thought about it everything you think
about during the session you're gonna write down and put in the readme you made a lot of decisions that they
don't know about they were good decisions based on informed you know for they were informed decisions
so everything you think about you will write down you're going to say i thought about caching the images on
car data as well but i noticed that the flicker api always
returns different images so there is no point in caching something that's going to be shown once
another solution would you just keep it in memory to avoid reloading the images as i scroll
but i didn't implement it because of the requirements and timing time constraints but i know that this is a possibility
and this is where i would do it in my architecture and you explain how you would do it so sometimes
you they say don't implement more than needed they didn't ask this so you shouldn't implement it but if you
think about it if you thought about it you should have written down a nice explanation how you would do it
some nice features i would like to see in this app you write you know things we could do going forward
it's always nice to show that your architecture accommodates change accommodates new requirements
you know in the future i i thought because uh after making uh submitting the code as a
subject they would say there are some coding interview to review my code so i thought maybe i would discuss my
solutions and why what my thought to them was they just rejected me and
by email so that's why but i i learned my lesson
so right in the readme so they cannot reject your readme yes
i just made some wrong assumptions oh i don't agree with these requests
they made here as like improvement areas because one was not a requested feature and they say do not implement more than
needed because of their requirements there are interviews that if implemented more than needed they will say
you didn't pass the interview because implemented more than needed because imagine you are at work and you are required to implement something
implement more than it is you wasted team time you wasted the company's time so it's a filter that you wasted time
doing something that was not needed so it this can be in the interview so it's very conflicting what what the
improvement areas they're saying with the requirements and the language they used before it's not aligned it looks
like the person who wrote the requirements is not the person that reviewed it or the reviewer didn't even read what was the requirement for the
projects and this happens as well you know this happens sometimes the who wrote the the requirements it was even the
developers like a recruiter copied from the internet paste it there and then they sent the
projects to the developers and they it doesn't match what the developers want how they work and what was in the
requirements so this can happen as well so i don't think it was a problem as
well because i don't think it was needed
but if you thought about it write it down so the main feedback was that your
current assignment is quite clear and simple apart from the usage of card data okay
caching is not working when offline so they were expecting offline caching
of the images although they didn't ask for it so yeah weird
all the images are not being shown anymore and the test coverage is quite low with 42 percent well
that's why they probably talked about the ui tests
okay cool so it was overall positive just some
improvements you could have made that would get to that position
but i still think that maybe there's a mismatch in how they work and how you would like to work so maybe
it was good not to pass but yes we never know maybe it would be a
good thing so let's look at the project now saying the github link there's the git
history 105 commits nice it's very common that people have one
commit you know yeah you get a project and say please send the commit history and they sent and
there is one commit initial commit with all the files
i've tried to work in tdd discipline so
nice yes you down small changes yeah awesome yeah if i'm revving this code
it's already a bonus you know see the process small commits no test by test very nice
you explained a little bit here i think you should have spent more time
yes in the read me here cool
so simple he has one project the source code production files and test
files that's it like i like it it's simple i like the commit history
nice so improve the instructions only
project is clean let's look at the setup
one application target one unit test target no ui test okay good if
you don't write ui tests delete that unnecessary target nice one
is the setup clean up delegate clean
no messy commented out code you know when you create a project you get get a bunch
of like methods with comments you clean it up that's nice it shows that you go the extra mile you
care okay is the composition
using core data okay do you have any unused files
unnecessary things i don't think so it looks pretty clean okay so folder structure and project
structure is clean very nice simple one app target one test target that's that's all you need for interviews
no warnings let me build no warnings run the tests command you no build
errors tests are passing okay
how long did it take to finish was quite fast look at this you never ever will have this speed with ui tests
even i i thought to use like you for a
framework to separate the api and domain layer but i
think it's it will be complicated and because you mentioned you always mention it to record
interview keep it simple so so just i wanted to in one project
yes it's very important keep it simple unless they ask for you to create like oh separate
modules show that you know if they ask sure if they don't keep it simple look how fast those tests are i really like
this what's yourself 42 42 yeah but even
let's say even if you have 100 coverage you actually tested everything with unit tests let's say it would be 0.1
you know if you have one ui test in your project it will take at least one to two
seconds yeah because it needs to create a boot a new application wait for the test even if
the test does nothing you know so that's why i prefer unit test is ko is
much better you have much more control of the environment that's the preferred choice that's the
base of the pyramid like most of your tests will be unit tests when really needed you're going to write ui
tests but only when needed in this application i don't believe it's needed because you can cover all these functionalities they asked with unit
tasks but you should have the coverage otherwise yes you know
yes definitely will not be good enough okay so it's fast no warnings no test failures
now the coverage 42 so it's missing some things
now are the tests well before we look at the test before i
look at the code what's important thing does the app work okay i can run it
okay as we said we have an empty list when we open
so if i'm reloading what am i reloading here if there's nothing on the screen
i think this is a bug okay yes and this is the
keywords like bookmark okay
okay did they send you the design or you just came up with it no no just anything you could think of
okay because i would expect like to click on search and see the
search results here rather than having to navigate somewhere to see the keywords
but it's about user experience here yes yes but yeah that that would i think that would be the expectation that you click
on search and you it already pre-fills the last 10 search terms right
so this is just a ux detail that could show that you you would implement like best
practices okay so if i search here for something what should i search cut
a life cut cat okay
cool it works yes but it's a bit stretch the image i think
you need to set the right aspect ratio right
yeah i think that wasn't one of the comments right the image is more yes
if i'm not wrong i think the flicker api returns you kind of the width and height
of the image so you could kind of use a flow layout to do like some nice like if
the image is longer than the other one it would take more space on the screen you know uh
i couldn't think about it actually but yes i think it's improving area
yeah so because i was upset because uh i like ui i
especially for any matching and working in a ui so when get comment in
to this the image is small or not big cell
for me it's i was a little bit upset about it because i consider myself
better in ui and animation stuff like that it was a lack of time i guess as well
right you're trying to rush a little bit yes on holidays excuse me yes but it's not
executes yeah yeah okay
yeah because sometimes like you know you like ux matters it's part of impressing them you know sometimes they open oh this app is so easy to use so they were
happy that the app was moved you know but this attention to detail can can add up
but sometimes you get so attached to attention to details that you don't finish the project you know you have like only three days to do it and you
you spend so much time on the ux that you never finish the project it's not building it doesn't have coverage i
would rather spend more time in the coverage than in the ux
so photos list listview controller it's a collection view controller
and you have cells do you reuse cells i think i start looking now you know in the code like
okay you're resting the cell where is the data source i think at the bottom
yeah right there okay you're using cells good and now if you're using cells i always like to check if it's reusing it
properly like if i'm loading an image and i reuse the cell
will we cancel the previous request or is there a chance that we will show the wrong image for split second i think
as i can remember i didn't apply cancer
okay this is critical for senior positions this is something that even for mid level sometimes even junior this
is critical yes the managing of the cells you know for senior there's no excuse
like you need to do that you need to to manage the the request life cycle like as you're
scrolling here you should cancel requests otherwise you can make too many requests also yes the requesting can
come in any order you're going to be showing the wrong image there so this is critical let's see if we can
simulate an issue yeah i can see it flickering yeah it changed it flicked here it showed the
wrong image and then the right i don't even know if it's the right image but like the image jumped
from one to the other and this is critical this is something that can eliminate like a
an interviewer from the process
so careful with this you can review that in the program it's in the program by the way yeah
we show you how to do exactly this yes when i when i did this project i think i was in the
middle of the program right now okay but yeah you definitely you are
right so as an exercise why don't you redo this project you know just for a personal
like you know yes and then you compare like is it better now
does it solve these problems like it'll be a nice exercise
and where do you make the requests to load the images the image cell i as i
i guess if you go to the photo collection
view cell
they're 139. i inject the
image loader okay yeah it doesn't even
it's impossible to cancel it yes you have to return a consolable for example
be able to cancel it right and then you store a reference that concealable and it before it when the cell is not on
screen anymore you cancel the request because then you stop requesting data
that you don't need anymore which was one of the requirements and for senior positions this is mandatory you know you need to manage
resources data plan you know network requests very very well
okay so yeah this should be cancelable and even not done in the cell i wouldn't do
this in the cell i rather do it in the controller like in the data source than in the cell right uh
last week uh also i made a home assignment for other company
i applied every i i i've learned from my mistakes and i applied everything
console uh make some uh cell controller to make the request
so okay since the project is uh three months ago
okay now i don't know i am better programmer right
you wouldn't do this mistake again but that's how we learned we all made these mistakes i did a mistake mike did
his mistake bogged on these mistakes you know actually guys you are the only mentor
for from me because i i plan ios development by myself i even in my company i am the only ios
engineer so so that's why i i have this silly mistake because no one tells me what
what's the right order just from you guys from the essential developer program
right yes nice guy to help and this is very common that it's very common for
developers it happened to me as well working alone a lot not having like that feedback from
someone more senior than you someone with more experience they know like an apprentice it's very like for me the best path for
developers being apprenticed have someone that knows what they're doing passing you the knowledge you know that's the
the easiest path the fastest path so we don't make like critical mistakes
okay so
you already know how to do it and it's in the program as well yes so we can move on
so let's look at the design here we have the photos list view controller
so we see any dependencies a view model
okay and then there's a view model and then we see uses the view model
and where is this service in the view model yes loader image loader
all the loaders are here okay yes we also show in the program how to decouple the view controller interview model from
loaders when yes sometimes it's helpful to do it
and since you're using also initialize an injection you can make those things private because can you actually replace them why
private and constant what's safer because it can lead to undefined behavior if you replace it
while there are some images still requests going on you will have to cancel them you know it just complicates
the design just hide it make it constant and that's it
okay so all the requests are managed in the view model so it has a bunch of services
let's do it like this
i think it was too complicated uh
yeah for this project it doesn't need it yeah even even for me for me it was too
complicated so i need to rewatch the presentation module again to
absolutely just to get yeah just be careful that there
we also we show very advanced uh solutions for cases where an extra
separation is interesting for a flicker amp maybe it's
too much you know but when you have a large application with hundreds of developers working on it then it becomes
interesting those more advanced solutions yes so that's why we also show simple solutions and more advanced solutions
and when you should use one or the other because if you go on an interview when you go to the most advanced solution we
show there it's going to be over engineering they're going to reject you know even though i i think mvvm also
too complex for this symbol up not needed yes
in vc it's fine it could be fine as well nvvm is also fine mvc
should be fine even if you use mvp it doesn't need to be the super decoupled mvp with adapters it could be just
a mod of you and a presenter you know yeah just be careful i remember another
mentoring session this week where we were reviewing another test project and one of the requirements was
where actually one of the acceptance criteria was not using mvc so some teams
are not fans of mvc not sure exactly why but it would be worth finding that out yeah
for sure maybe use mvc and it would be a point here right exactly
like used mvc
okay so you have operations okay and the cell talks to a service as well right directly
yes right
so one thing you need to fix but i already know is the aspect ratio
the canceling request as you scroll does it work the pagination yes it is
yes i applied the simplest one
okay cool it works nice and smooth as well so we're not
doing any complicated work in the main thread that's good as well that's common
that there'll be a lot of work in the main thread and you'll be laggy so bonus
points okay is there any specific area in the code
you want us to look at the uh i think we discussed the
the main stuff so everything's normal for phone i don't okay you want to see
i can see that it's using concrete types right directly maybe you should
to have protocols like don't expose details you don't need to yes i
you have a protocol use the protocol yes i would even call it flickers yeah maybe
flicker service is fine or you could call this on like photo service more generic because
the protocol is more generic and the implementation is the remote flickr
photo service right yeah because the implementation is flicker now but maybe you're going to use a different service later and this
is a way of decoupling your application from concrete unfortunately the result uses the
flicker model object 16. okay yeah
well for simplicity maybe that's okay but like you know if you say i'm creating an
architecture that will decouple from services maybe you would also the couple from flip flickr
yes just naming it's just because it's just
so flicker this is not actually flicker right this could be like a
page yeah page
yeah this is actually a page right this would be number like have a page number
number of pages per page total and then the photo so this is part of the pagination right so
you know where you are yeah just naming but maybe it's important right yes yes
yes attention to detail there you know there is like some inconsistency between how
flicker is spelled with the knee without you know yes
yeah so i mean this is important you know like especially for the senior positions
people pay attention to these things you know so yeah
okay and this is actually flicker like this
right yeah yes okay yeah attention to detail type polls
now this is a name right so i don't think it would help but you can activate the
automatic correction how's it called yeah the spelling autocorrect you know
on xcode it works pretty well it can show you like typos but it's important you know it looks
that it's tidy and the project is clean yes
i think that's why the main reasons that i want to move to other company because
i i work alone so i want to work with at least other guy to just to work in to
make some code review for for each other so that's some
main reason very important
so here you should use the services should probably be protocols to decouple from concrete
types then you have concrete implementations of those services and in the protocols try to decouple
from the specific implementations otherwise you can only have one implementation right if you say flickr then it's only
flickr if you're one day you say hey let's replace flickr with tumblr with whatever people are
using now then it's not going to work right yes
it's going to be hard and if you make these kind of decisions you explain them you explain them oh i
separated the view model with a service protocol there's no leaking
implementation details because i want my application to be decoupled from flickr as much as possible so we're not coupled
with a specific vendor we can easily replace it or if you decide to just go with a
concrete type for simplicity say for simplicity i decided to go with concrete
types with flickr but if at some point we need to use a different service i would create a
protocol to decouple it and then replace with any services we need you know you would explain your reasoning that's
important in interviews explain your decisions
because maybe some people are not going to like protocol no you shouldn't use a protocol it's a simple project just do a concrete type you know but some teams
would say like no you should use the protocol so regardless what you do 50 of the times you'll be wrong in their
eyes how do you protect against that explain your reasoning
with alternatives i did this but i could also have done that boom is 50 50 now 100
on your favor right
okay so i think that's fine if i explain your reasoning
whatever if you're using per cover concrete type that should be fine as long as testable as long as
you know you achieve that coverage as well closer to 100 they'll be better
uh the couple views from services you already have a view model man managing these so maybe
that shouldn't be necessary you know because otherwise every type depends on every type and
then you're not managing dependencies properly
we can start hiding dependencies at least from the ui
much simpler the ui without those dependencies
actually kyle if you can go back to the cell code i i really
uh i don't know it's not clear to me
what this does because we have an image service image data service that it's passed and we we discussed that
it's probably best not to do this or not to pass the service to the cell to make a request but ignoring that we we make
an asynchronous load image data on line 17 and then with the result we get which
is data wrapped in success then we do an add operation which
creates a image download operation so for for me this is a bit confusing
because i don't understand why we need two requests through different mechanisms
you maybe explain this better a bit uh
actually i couldn't remember because because i
read so i read some blog on meteor and implement
what i've read from the blog
i i can't remember actually
use operations to work in different threads
you know okay yeah so this is a part of the code base you cannot explain everything else you
were very good at explaining now imagine the interviewer would also find this weird
and then they would ask you why did you do this uh and you say i i write a blog post and i don't even remember why i did
it that that's bad for a senior position but especially right but for just to
work in different threads so that's the main reason yeah but but then you need to sketch again thread
here right i so i'm guess i'm wrong you're
downloading twice so the the line 17 will trigger a
network call that uses the http kind if we look at the code later maybe and downloads the
content of that url as a data and then online yeah just you if you
show that so that's that's sufficient um it's pretty standard and then with
that data on i think it's line 25 then we just create a ui image from it so
that's sufficient what i'm not getting it what does the other operation do that's also
downloading from the url and generating a result where we get the data again so
we unless there's something funky here we're kind of downloading the same image
twice to different mechanisms you see so it is
i mean it's not a bug in the ui but uh it's definitely wrong
to do this yes yes i rather see something like this
also if it fails maybe you should have a retry button but maybe for simplicity
yes yes but i would expect something like this right you load the image and the data is here you showing the ui that's it i
would also expect this call back maybe in the main queue already you can decorate it
like to show in the program and it should be concealable you know because
why we shouldn't be in this cell like okay kai why should i do requests in the cell
or efficiency yes it cancel a request when the cell is
out of screen for example you get these callbacks from usually from the delegate or data source
of your views so the cell doesn't have enough information to know when to store when
to cancel when to stop a request and it shouldn't have right because the cell can be reused it can be in the context
now it's very hard to keep track if the request is in the ui especially when you're using a view
so we're looking for efficiency here also this patching to the main queue can also lead to race conditions
because this is async maybe by the time this completes the cell was already used for another cell but then you're going to complete with the image you're going
to be showing the wrong image yes mixing threading
and operations and requests in the ui it's going to be very hard to get right
it's not simple so not just saying to move
requests from the cell you know because it's in the books no because there is a reason
it's important for simplicity and for the correct for getting the correct behavior
so eliminate threading as much as possible every time you have async call dispatch qa sync there will
be a thread hop and you can have data races you know race conditions
to move this outside in a way that you can cancel the requests
okay anything else here pogba no i think that that was the biggest one
and i think somebody reviewing this would notice the like it's it's some weird uh
implementation there and that's a bit unfortunate because you had everything you needed in the
uh what's it called image data service that that that's nice like decoupled from the http
client everything is is fine with that so you i really don't see a need for
for going to the operation actually i
faced some trust i struggled a lot in in this
operation so as i can remember so for me
the the most difficult stuff that in building this project it was this
so it's especially for operations a new topic from me so i
built uh i implemented for the first time so yeah
and it was not needed right so yes because that's the problem like i would tell people like be careful reading a
board of a lot of like random medium blog posts like you might be putting information in your head that you don't
need to be might be wasting time it might confuse you right because you were learning something in the academy and then you
write a blog post and try to mix them and and you got into a situation that was very complex you spent a lot of time
here you said it was the most complex part yes the application and you didn't get the results you wanted
you know and there was a lot of time there so that's why i say follow the steps
they try to avoid noise confusion you know
it's gonna help you focus and be more assertive
i was uh [Music] as how i can say it i was young
so now as i told you i last week i implemented
uh all the projects using console and handling the thread dispatching from
background to main trade writing the curator i uh by limiting
everything that i've learned from you guys so yeah so this is three months ago so
now i'm better problem also yes yeah i also like in the past got in a
lot of trouble with operation cues because i started using them before understanding them fully and yes you
know and it just got confused i i was afraid to to
to ask me or to explain just because i totally i i don't have experience in
operation so good couch
have used them blog then operation cues and services and
you can do very nice things with them i remember like the first time i i used
them like it was very hard to get it right with objective-c
right yeah so it's i think it's more of a an older
api it's still good for some use cases but i i think
some and i work on some open source project for downloading images and a bunch of other projects that are built
around that so for each image they download they create an operation like that's keeping a tread open and they do
all the networking on on that thread but that's a that's a pattern which is like
kyle said a bit older like maybe better suited for objective c code
nowadays with these new apis like you have a session you don't really need that like you don't need to to
keep a thread dedicated to an image download you just do what you do for any other
network operation like you did for i know hitting the the flickr service
you you open a url session data task and whenever that is done you
get the result like you you don't need to manage trading and synchronization of that resource like
there these new apis are so much uh easier to to use um
and yeah i i just don't think you need it um if you need to create something more
complex then yeah probably uh you might resort to to them like and
as operation queue is still valid but i don't think this is a this is a
use case for that unless we're trying to do something i don't know interesting with i know
like avoiding cancelling image downloads just you because you need to get all the
images or something like that like i'm trying to figure a scenario where you would use these downloads
even after the cell gets reused but for simplicity i think yes
so i i'm really glad because not a lot of people can say they've they've upgraded their coding skills in three
months so yeah what you're saying right now makes total sense and it's
it's cool to see like yourself looking back at the code you wrote two months ago and say okay
i'm better now now i know all these things and i don't need that and it's perfect like
this is the only only way to learn i think yes definitely congrats
awesome i think that's it that's probably if we look at
the call we could maybe
more things but i think it's very clear that the feedback they provided
simplifying a lot of things the core data maybe just url
user defaults will be better
in this case but you created a protocol right so yes where is the protocol
oh search queue okay another typo here
that's important here catch that for sure
okay so you you broke down this search
keyword store and you have a core data implementation
but the clients never use the core data directly right yes
which means you can easily replace it with a user default
keyword store or a file system keyword store that could all implement
this protocol so that's a point that is good in architecture but it didn't explain it
and they thought it was negative if you explained it that would be
resolved so the clients
however talk to the protocol only right
yes and everything composable and same delegates
cool
cool yeah so that's a good point you should
have explained and maybe you win more points with them
advancing version principle are depending directly on the concrete type we create a protocol inverted
dependence payment now the store depends on the client requirements rather than the client
depending on the store interface
so explaining your reasoning will help you a lot in the interviews
the domain try to decouple from a specific service if you think it's going to be beneficial
yes flickr could be just a page although it will still be make pretty much like the
flickr names here maybe think of a more generic way of you know you have two representations like the flicker
response yeah that they can transform into on generic app response
but maybe we'll over complicate for a simple interview project so
interview project it's fine but in a real world project you probably will not be coupled to a service that you don't
control right because they can increase the price or they can just stop existing
you don't want to depend on a service impact your
business also here since we're on this flickr
object or struct this is prob belongs better in the
api infrastructure because it's tied to the response you're going to get from the
flickr api so for your domain i don't think it's that important that
i know what the page number is and the page size and all these details like
you i think the the abstraction you created was a loader that
allows loading images and yeah you should that's what you should
be getting photos um yes so yes yes
yeah so the advice is like in this test project it's fine for simplicity to just couple maybe with a concrete type and
with the specific details of the api for simplicity but if you want to create a service
abstraction then it shouldn't leak implementation details if it doesn't implementation details and
you're creating models specifically what the app needs then you can create maybe a domain layer
if not you're coupling with specific service then you'll be in the service layer because it's a one-to-one mapping with the response
you get the json response you get from the api right yes okay
okay okay now just i think that's it for the code
i would just like to have a quick look at the tests of the coverage law i want to see if
it's testing interesting things in the application the configuration of the scene delegate
okay simple tests making sure that when you load the app it's loading the photo list view
controller that's why you don't need ui tests here very simple unit test that can assert that it's
loading the right initial configuration does if you have tests for the photo list
view controller you know that everything is wired correctly and the test runs in 0.071 seconds
the endpoint url parsing okay
here i wouldn't do it like this exactly because it's coupling with the order of parameters
right yes if you change the order you break this test yes but order doesn't matter in the
query here yes yes so to check one by one maybe yes we show
strategies there yes yes i remember that but i didn't
when i didn't finish it it's fine testing the mapping from jason to the
objects in the app okay testing for errors good a lot of people
keep their word testing so it's important to test your words
and success success as well yes okay
cool very simple easy to understand no magic perfect
hp client okay default
cool making sure hp client works core data
okay we're using a in memory or data which is pretty fast good
nice one
maybe nowadays that you have throwing tests you could use throw so it doesn't crash because this would crash if
there's a problem and stop the test execution you can just throw here
throw here if it throws it's not going to crash yes we just
got failure you know there'll be a normal pass failure so avoid for some wrapping in the test
target now it's not needed okay
so we have some helpers to perform their assertions
okay so you have an async api right retrieve you get the completion block
every time you're testing an async api and you have assertions inside of it you need to
create an expectation expectation
wait for result and you need to wait
for that expectation just short timeout here
and fulfill it here which means this will only return this method will only return after
you got a response and the assertions ran if you put a fulfill here like again
may not be ideal because you need to run the other sessions before returning this method
so every time there's an async api you need expectations to make sure it runs
otherwise it will not run because this will return immediately
this method will return immediately before this block is invoked
and then the test will return and will pass because nothing failed
let's see let's put an xct fail here
failed we also need to pass file in line in the
assertions helpers to get better feedback yes
okay so if this test fails it means that
it's working all the build failed now probably something that i changed
ah that type of okay yeah i shouldn't be reaching to the dependencies of the view model
i'm just gonna undo but that's another point we talked about
huh but if i run it in isolation as if i oh but it failed here not here
yes but even though it failed it still says it's successful because the test
returned before the assertion was executed yes which means there were
side effects running after the test finished and that's a test leak when your test finishes it
returns you shouldn't all the operations should have finished already everything should be clean otherwise it fails when
another test is running and then you have this inconsistent feedback it says passed but
no it didn't pass because the assertion was called after the test returned so this is
important to fix okay
always use an expectation
when running tests we facing kpis okay
yes definitely now we're facing a weight this is kind of solved because you need to wait a
weight you know in the test yes but when using completion blocks it's important to wait
all of them none of those are sessions that are being run and this is part of the coverage we're talking about even though
it's 42 coverage this was not actually being tested right because it was passing even with a
failure so even though there's coverage the lines were exercised this assertions
were not running okay
that's why i usually follow a pattern that we showed in the program where we capture the result and we assert outside
the block which is a way like if you have this uh habit of
only doing assertions outside completion blocks you never have this issue right it's
just a discipline way of forcing that you are not going to have issues avoid assertions inside
completion blocks it's a way of guaranteeing you don't have issues
okay
passing good in the least controller you are testing
the delegates cell okay you have a test this checks only
for the empty initial state there are no tests when there is a actual
result so yeah that's why they were expecting ui tests maybe because you don't have coverage in unit tests
you could have the coverage in unit tests if you're using your abstractions and maybe creating some stubs
but because you're using the concrete types in the view models you cannot replace them with stubs right
maybe you can sub class but i think they are final classes so you cannot subclass
and their final classes so since you have protocols you you pass the protocols and then you can pass
maybe stops i don't know why i didn't use a protocol
i think this is a mistake so yeah
because i follow the discipline follow the arctic catcher and i
i think this is mistakes this is [Music] shouldn't use here
yeah so there's a lot of behavior here yes in the foster photolistiocontroller layer including the cell loading the
cells like reusing and canceling the images you know you can write unit tests that says when a
cell is used they the image is cancelled to avoid that
race condition we shown you can find it all in the program as well so
yes do you feel like you could avoid these mistakes now otherwise i recommend you
[Music] re-watch the lectures now with this in mind with all the feedback we gave you now we can rewatch the lectures and you
know find the answers to all those yes in there
and then practice practice apply again and if you don't pass you practice more you get the feedback you bring us the
project and then you practice more and you get to the sino level you break through
right now your position is senior or mid for my current company i think
my friends call me senor consider me senior because uh
i'll let i learn by myself and uh you know but uh for me i don't think i
am a senior because i i work alone with no mentor and it's a small company
so yes senior needs some leadership skills
some communication skills that stuff that i don't have at the moment
right so another homework you will read
elite developer essentials book have you seen it yes
i planning to read it after finishing the mentoring session but
one of them [Music] ios unit testing
this book you have all the unit testing strategies in the program yes
focus you know exactly if you think that like this leadership is gonna help you as well
this is the next book follow the program you will if you have the time you can read other
books but like right now there are some specific skills that you need right yes so focus is important right now and
then you read the books i just if there is some uh
book uh it's uh not it's i think the essential book is
just for uh i need to read it in pdf if there is
some version comments that i can buy from there is there is pdf epub uh
yes i don't like to read it from using tablet or
you want a printed book yes i wanted printed work i i feel
i'm comfortable reading printed books on uh well make a sacrifice push through this
one and push come on
myself make a sacrifice that's it yes because i i am i i am this is my hope in
my second hobby uh i read a lot but uh all my all my reading it's a printed
version not uh you get chronicled version so i will push myself so if this book will
be helped me to to the next level yes i will
more than happy absolutely definitely but i think what will help
you most is is just maybe redoing the program re-watching the program exactly
yes um and you you already like you can see you learn many things from from there uh
just make sure you you grasp it all because i think that's what's going to get you the
the senior positions you you're looking for usually at least in my experience for
senior positions they don't expect that much leadership and since that's your case where you
don't like your one-man team there's no way you can practice these
skills in real projects so i would rather focus on being as
best i can with my technical skills of course reading the
the essentials so i'm not saying don't read the essential developer book
actually read it but i think the the focus should be on
on technical skills uh mostly so even the stuff you're gonna get there is
very very uh precise and uh easy to follow so
just just focus it's unlikely they would join a team with a lead position right now you're
still breaking through to that senior level and i don't think this leadership will
be that expected from a senior developer joining a larger team because they
probably already have a leadership there right so yes uh because uh
at the beginning of to this year i rejected from company because uh they i
don't have leadership skills just the the yep from one company right or or
like every company do you give you this feedback because you cannot optimize for every feedback you get you need to focus
if you get one feedback like you shouldn't use uh nibs and then it's like okay i should never use nibs and then someone say oh you should monitor okay i
need leadership like you need focus if only one company say leadership then it's like that's what that company was
looking for they're looking for a leader a lot of companies are not looking for leaders in senior developers they're looking for people that can get things
done correctly on time with quality you know
and you still need to build those skills at the senior level and still building them
so i don't think yeah i think pogba is right he shouldn't focus on the leadership part right now
yes unless you're trying to break into a more leadership position but
you guys think most companies would expect like strong leadership skills from senior developers
yeah i'm not sure you know but it can help definitely will help you
but it shouldn't eliminate you from a bunch of opportunities i don't think like it
would i don't think the majority of companies would be looking for like very strong leadership skills
yeah i i think at least in my experience is based on on what your cv is saying so if
you're they're looking for a leader like a team lead a technical
lead they are going to search for that in your past experience
just to make sure you can you can do the job so nobody will or at least
i think very few situations where they're gonna get you to an interview and you're gonna check out all your
leadership skills even though you haven't been a lead before you know like giving you the opportunity
to do it for them at first first job they hire you for so that's
pretty unlikely in my opinion so what's what's easier for your situation is just
to be as good as possible with your technical skills get into a senior
position with a company and when they see how you work and
everything there will be many opportunities probably after you get hired to to take
a leadership role if that is available with their structure so i i think that's like the
the way it usually goes like if you guys look back at your first
leadership roles i i don't think you you got hired for for them you got promoted
yes at least that was the case for me as well so
yes and that's hard like being being a good leader is super hard it's much harder than being a good developer
because there's so many things you need to to take into account like economics and team balance and the personality of
each team member you have so that's super complex like i i would only focus on that when i mastered like i have a
stable base of my technical skills and by technical i don't just
refer to coding but also like designing diagrams uh being proficient with
explaining a technical solution having experience with many many projects like all these things
fall into a i don't know into the portfolio of a senior developer and then from there when you were say okay i'm
i'm really good with this now i can help more people like i can coordinate more people doing this because i know how to
do it that's when you look into leadership at least that's how i sit and
take that with a grain of thought because not everybody is built to be a leader like you have to
have the right personality you have to have the some skills some charisma to to
work with with other people so it's like i've always wondered i don't want
to open this it's a big conversation on on what happens with i know people that are
senior developers that get promoted into leadership positions even though they don't have the skills
for it but that's a different maybe topic for another day
there's a name for this phenomenon that people are promoted until they get to a position where they're incompetent
i mean they get stuck right it's it happens a lot like you never not just developers but even like
c-level people and no and in every level that it's a it's a thing like a lot of developers get promoted to
manager eventually and they're terrible managers they're good developers you know yeah
it happens a lot they're completely different sets of
skills and i think right now we need more technical reinforcing the
the basics you know the more intermediary and the advanced but
again solid foundation with the basics then you build the intermediary in the advanced yes
if you try to jump steps and go to advanced like you still understand some basic concepts
will be harder you know you get stuck so we watch the program redo the program
practice yes
for some some videos i rewatch it a lot yeah it's good
more they're also like almost hundreds of mentoring sessions you can
go through about specific topics like interviews a bunch of interview sessions there
that will help you yes definitely thank you thank you what i would add
here is since you're working in a one-man team then just
rely let essential developer be your community like talk to people maybe more
often be more more involved in the in the communications on slack
ask more questions reply to questions if you think you have something valuable to add
that that can be your playground so because you don't have a team to i don't know bounce ideas off or
just i don't try out things ask opinions about things you you can do this in in
the community yes that's how i would do it like it has to suit you as well but i think
that this is a good a good place to to i know match up for for the fact that
you're the only developer in your team so
yes definitely i will i will do it
in the future for sure cool for sure you are on the right path like we can see in the code that you're you
know you're on the right path judging like what like almost less than
a year ago that we had our first mentoring session it's unbelievable the difference so yeah
and you said from three months right this part is three months old and from three months you already learned a lot like they wouldn't make a lot of the
mistakes there so fantastic keep improving this rate and very
quickly you will have like big changes in your career
yes definitely awesome all right thank you for joining me
long session yes thank you sorry for sorry for the
i made it to i i am still there no no no problem no problem with that
nice thank you all right first time guys awesome thank you see you next time
exactly bye take care bye take care hello
everyone in the chat hello number one okay not that i agree with making the
requests on the cell but can't we cancel requests and prepare to reuse
it may be too late because prepare to use is called when it's going to be reused not
before right so i don't know if it's enough to cancel the request on time to stop
using data plan when not needed anymore because the cell cannot be reused and the request will carry on
so there are more reliable apis for that like the prefetching apis and the delegate apis of will appear will
disappear i think that was your point during the the live that
from the cell level you don't have access to all these methods being called like you don't know
the state of the of the entire collection view pre-fetching reusing like whenever a
cell goes off screen that kind of thing you don't have access to that information so you either
move that logical child set to the view controller or you start
leaking all these details into the cell because now the view control has to inform cells
about different states you know it's like it's getting messy so that's why the cell is not a good place
to to do that like i i know some people try to squeeze that into the prepare for
use or the the other few methods from subfield yeah
you know like when a cell is removed from sub-view there's a call back there but like maybe it was removed for other reasons like because it's you know
there's an animation so you never know what's going on don't try to imply what's happening to the table wheel from
the cell point of view the cell doesn't even have a rinse a reference to the table view for a reason like you shouldn't be reaching up
to the logic above and trying to figure out what's going on you know you're gonna make her so much more complicated and
probably have bugs because you don't know the internals of ui keys you don't know when methods are called
that's why it provides delegates data sources and prefetching data sources to
tell you this is where you should at this point it's okay to do things you know
if you try to do at the cell level we don't have enough information so probably we have bugs there
yeah but that's the problem cause like if you if you search it on
stack overflow or medium articles you see a lot of solutions that tell you to
to do it at the cell level we prepare to use and that kind of things and kyo said if you don't understand the
domain of the problem fully then it might sound good but you're actually just
making it worse so it's important to doing prepared for
views like this card anything that can be reloaded like images
you know just adding an image view to new you can already save some memory you know instead of holding a reference to a
view to an image another one operations are good if you
want to cancel requests but you don't need operations to cancel requests for example url session already provided
data tasks that are concealable and they manage their own internal queue we don't need to be concerned about it
it's very efficient of preventing many requests at the same time
he knows a lot about the internals of the device resources cores and so on it can be much more
efficient in making those decisions yeah many of the newer apis have cans cancel
capabilities so even the the new task uh in the sync await also is cancelable
cancellable so that's no longer reason like we
we tried to explain earlier operations are good for long longer term
processing like maybe if you need to do a computation or i don't know transform
some data or process an image apply some filters to an image that kind of a thing that's
that's what an operation is good for like canceling is no longer a good reason
just to stick to to these operational operation queue apis because
all all the other alternatives also have cancelling
also operations were good when you had like dependencies between operations like only start this request when these
three operations finished and you could set this up it was much harder with other apis right you'd have to have a
bunch of state controlling everything yes good advice here you can turn on
spell checker to help catch spelling errors absolutely
you should what is the best approach to go about
investigating data race issues are the signs that look like smell yes
if you're a student in the program you will see all the
recommendations and how to identify smells in code but
if i already have a data race and it's hard to debug there are a bunch of tools like the
