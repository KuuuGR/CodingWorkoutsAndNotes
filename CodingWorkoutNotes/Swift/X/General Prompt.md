# Final Prompt:

### Updated General Prompt for Creating Programming Puzzles:


I have a piece of code in a specific programming language (mention the language). My goal is to convert this code into a Swift version that serves the same intellectual entertainment purpose. I'd like to compose a suitable Twitter description for the puzzle without revealing that this is a direct language conversion. Additionally, I require a clear solution to the puzzle, along with a side-by-side comparison of the original code and its Swift counterpart. For the puzzle itself, please include a comment indicating the expected output in the Swift code and provide four possible answers: one correct and three intended to mislead.

**Details to Include:**
1. **Original Code:** Provide the code snippet in the original language.
2. **Swift Code:** Provide the corresponding or similar code in Swift.
3. **Explanation and Solution:** Detail why the Swift code behaves as it does compared to the original code.
4. **Difficulty Ratings:** Assess the complexity of the puzzle in both the original language and the Swift version (e.g., ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ - easy).
5. **Multiple-Choice Answers:** Include four answers (one correct, three incorrect) for participants to choose from.

**Example Puzzle Request:**

"I have some code in Python designed to be intellectually stimulating by demonstrating specific language behaviors. I need this translated into Swift, along with a description suitable for a Twitter audience that encourages engagement without specifying the puzzle's origins. Also, provide the solution, explain the differences in behavior between the Python and Swift versions, and rate the difficulty of each version. The provided Python code might contain intentional tricks to challenge the solver."

**Python Code:**
```python
lst1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
lst2 = lst1
lst1[0] = 7
print(lst2[0])  # What is the output?
```

**Corresponding Swift Code:**
```swift
var lst1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
var lst2 = lst1
lst1[0] = 7
print(lst2[0])  // Output: 1
```

**Explanation:** In Python, `lst2` would show `7` as the output because `lst2` is just another reference to the same list `lst1` points to, demonstrating how Python handles list assignments. In Swift, arrays are copied when assigned, so `lst2` retains the original array's value, resulting in an output of `1`.

**Difficulty Ratings:**
- **Python Difficulty:** ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ - Moderate (Understanding reference vs. value)
- **Swift Difficulty:** ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ - Easy (Understanding value copying in Swift)

**Multiple-Choice Answers:**
- A) 1
- B) 7
- C) 2
- D) 0

**Correct Answer:** A) 1

This enhanced template now provides a more comprehensive view of the task, addressing both the original and the Swift versions' difficulty, which can help in understanding and anticipating the challenge level for different audiences.
