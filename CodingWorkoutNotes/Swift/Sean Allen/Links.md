- **Adapting to Interview Formats:** Understanding the format and expectations of different interview stages (phone screen, on-site, take-home projects) can significantly improve a candidate's performance.
- **Continuous Learning:** The job interview process itself is a learning journey, offering insights into industry standards and expectations in iOS development.

Based on the video transcription provided, here are several ANKI flashcards in the form of question-answer that can be made:

1. **Question:** What is Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) in iOS development? **Answer:** ARC is a memory management feature in iOS that automatically keeps track of an object's strong references and deallocates it once the reference count reaches zero.
    
2. **Question:** How can you fix a retain cycle in Swift? **Answer:** A retain cycle can be fixed by making one of the strong references a weak reference, thus preventing an extra-strong reference from being created.
    
3. **Question:** What is the difference between delegates and notifications in Swift? **Answer:** Delegates allow one-to-one communication between objects, whereas notifications (observers) enable one-to-many communication, allowing multiple objects to respond to an event.
    
4. **Question:** Describe the view lifecycle in iOS development. **Answer:** The view lifecycle includes methods like `viewDidLoad`, `viewWillAppear`, `viewWillLayoutSubviews`, `viewDidLayoutSubviews`, `viewDidAppear`, `viewWillDisappear`, and `viewDidDisappear`, each indicating a stage in the view's life from creation to destruction.
    
5. **Question:** What are some common memory leaks scenarios in closures in Swift? **Answer:** Memory leaks in closures occur when there is a strong reference cycle between the closure and the class instance. Using `weak self` or `unowned self` in closures can prevent these leaks.
    
6. **Question:** What is the importance of understanding communication patterns like delegates and observers in Swift? **Answer:** Knowing when to use delegates (one-to-one communication) versus observers (one-to-many communication) is crucial for effective app architecture and managing data flow between components.
    
7. **Question:** Explain the use of `filter`, `map`, and `reduce` in Swift. **Answer:** `Filter` is used to exclude items from a collection, `map` applies a transformation to each item, and `reduce` combines all items into a single value based on a provided operation.
    
8. **Question:** Why is familiarity with testing important in iOS development? **Answer:** Experience with testing is essential for ensuring code quality, functionality, and reliability, and it's a highly valued skill during the hiring process.
    
9. **Question:** What are the pros and cons of using third-party libraries in iOS projects? **Answer:** Third-party libraries can save development time and add functionality, but they also introduce dependencies and potential maintenance issues as Swift evolves.
    
10. **Question:** How do gesture recognizers work in iOS development? **Answer:** Gesture recognizers are used to detect and respond to user interactions like tap, pinch, and swipe gestures in an iOS app.
    

These flashcards cover a range of topics from the video transcription, including Swift programming concepts, iOS development best practices, and interview preparation tips.

Introduction
what's up guys I'm Sean and I'm an iOS
developer here in San Francisco
I just recently left my first developer
job and now I'm in the market for my
second one it's not the end of April in
2017 and I've made the rounds all over
town large companies small companies all
in all I've done about 15 to 20
interviews that made it to the phone
screen or later stage real quick what
those stages are typical technical
interviews if you're not from New York
you'll get a recruiter call which is
typically a 1530 minute phone call just
Recruiter Call
to get a feel for you make sure you're
not crazy and the second step is a phone
screen which is a one-hour call we're
going to do some live coding with
someone you make it past that then you
go on to the big long five to six hour
all day on-site interview so backing up
I've done about 15 to 20 interviews here
around town that have made it to the
phone screen stage or later so I feel
like I have a pretty good grasp on the
type of iOS questions that are being
asked at this time so I decided to make
a video series sharing this information
with you guys now this first video is
going to be an overview intro video I'm
going to talk about all the subjects but
I'm going to stay at a very high level
so far looking for is the general idea
of what's being asked and then a summary
of an answer this video is for you
however if you want to deep dive in each
one of these topics I'm going to be
putting out videos over the next couple
weeks they'll dive deeper into these
topics so if you're interested in that
stay tuned subscribe keep an eye out for
more videos coming alright the first
topic we're going to discuss is
something that was asked in 100% of the
interview so make sure you know this and
that is automatic reference counting
ARC & RETAIN CYCLES
retained cycles memory leaks they're all
kind of in the same genre so the gist of
automatic reference counting is it keeps
track of your strong references to an
object and when that count gets to zero
it'll automatically deallocate it from
memory for you however if you have a
retain cycle or two objects have a
strong reference to each other it's kind
of a never-ending loop and that count
will never get to zero that's a call to
retain cycle or memory leak and a
general quick fix for this is to make
one of those strong references a weak
reference I'm sure you've seen this in
Kosovo versus weak VAR you know whatever
the name is so that's what that's doing
that's preventing an extra-strong
reference from being made so yeah just a
quick overview of automatic reference
counting retained cycles memory leaks
know this cold again it was asked 100%
of the time I'll link to a great Apple
doc that explains automatic reference
counting it's pretty long but if you
read through that and you fully
understand that you'll be good to go and
one last tip if you nail that basic
retain cycle memory leak question
they're most likely going to ask you the
follow-up question which is to explain
memory leaks enclosures now that's where
weak self and unknown self comes in so
make sure you research those as well now
the next question that was asking I
would say about
80% of the interviews is communication
COMMUNICATION PATTERNS
patterns between views and in Swift what
they're mainly talking about is
delegates versus observers and
notifications now the main thing to know
here is that delegates is a one-to-one
communication like one view is
communicating with another view where as
observers notifications you can have one
observer and then have ten different
areas notify that observer throughout
your code so it's a one-to-many
communication pattern so it's good to
know when to use which communication
pattern and the pros and cons of each so
for example one of the downsides to the
observer notification pattern which
again is the one-to-many pattern is
theoretically you could have 10 to 20
notifications spread out all throughout
your code all pointing back to one
observer so again you can imagine in a
complicated code base you know there
could be timing issues it's just it's
just hard to keep track of and it can
get out of control so just one example
the downsides again know the pros and
cons of both and when to use each one
delegates versus notifications and
observers next up we have a pretty basic
one and that is what is the lifecycle
overview I got asked this about five or
VIEW LIFECYCLE
six times throughout all the interviews
so it's a pretty common question it's
good to know so what we're talking about
here is viewdidload viewwillappear view
will lie out subviews if you did layout
subviews and view did appear that's
creating the view now getting rid of the
view is view will disappear and then
view did disappear let's run through
each one of those real quick again high
level overview viewdidload gets called
the very first time the view is loaded
into memory and it only gets called once
the reason I bring that up is because
view will appear which is the next step
gets called every time the view appears
now an example of this is say you're in
a navigation controller a master-detail
view and you keep going you know to the
detail back to the master back and forth
buted low is not going to keep getting
called but viewwillappear will keep
getting called so if you have something
you need to do every time the view
appears such as an animation or anything
like that you need to do it in
viewwillappear
not be too low because if you de
lausanne unit called once so next is
view will out sub views and view did
layout sub views now these two are where
the view is actually laying out all the
sub views the constraints the sizing and
everything and finally a view did appear
which means the view is completely
loaded now on the back side we have view
will disappear which you can do stuff
right before the view disappears and
then finally if you did disappear to let
you know the view is gone that's just a
quick and dirty overview of the view
lifecycle definitely research it some
more so the next question is something I
got asked a couple times and apparently
I didn't learn from the first time I got
asked it because I never had a good
answer for it and that is what is your
favorite Apple framework to work with
FAVORITE FRAMEWORK
and what they're asking here is you know
D like core location
like you I kid you like mapkit in if you
do why give specific reasons why you
like that API again I never had a good
answer for this question so I can't
really help you out that much but figure
out an API that you like to work with
and have good reasons why I got asked
this next question a couple times it's a
pretty basic one and that's the classic
classes versus trucks question when
CLASSES VS. STRUCTS
would you use one versus the other
explain that classes are a reference
type that if you change a property on
that class you're actually going to
change the reference whereas a struct is
a value type what essentially creates a
copy of that objects are not overwriting
other properties and then there's other
issues that if you subclass something
you're inheriting everything from that
parent class which might be some bloat
that you don't necessarily need whereas
structure lightweight and clean so make
sure you know when to use a class versus
Wendi's destruct and the pros and cons
between the two I only got asked about
this next topic twice so it's not super
common but it's still very useful to
know and that is filter map and reduce
FILTER, MAP, REDUCE
on collections and Swift so filter well
for example filter array if you want to
filter out all the even numbers in an
array you can do that map is if you want
to apply like a transform to every
object in the array so again the an
array of numbers if you want to multiply
every number by three you would use map
and then reduce the classic example of
reduce is summing up the numbers in an
array now it's kind of hard to get much
deeper than that in a talking example
without actually showing you code so
I'll save that for when I do a separate
video on filter map and reduce later in
the series but make sure you study up on
this so next up we have testing in it's
TESTING
a big one I got us pretty much every
interview if I had experience with
testing in fortunately I didn't and I
know for a fact that cost me one job and
certainly didn't help with any of the
others so if you're early in your career
you're jr. you've probably skimmed over
testing to learn basically Swift in
general but it's absolutely something
you should focus on and that's actually
what I'm doing right now in my downtime
doing tutorials trying to figure out how
to build testing Suites and some of my
existing projects don't overlook this
guys it's an easy topic to skim over
please don't and the final non coding
topic I want to talk about is
third-party libraries I got us pretty
3RD PARTY LIBRARIES
much all the time
what experience I had with third-party
libraries like cocoa pods or Carthage or
Swift package manager what they're
looking for in this question is to see
if you have experience using third-party
libraries and if you understand the pros
and cons to using them at the end of the
day that's what a dependency is you're
depending on somebody else's code in
your project so especially in a language
like Swift where it's constantly
changing
you got to hope the manager of that
library is keeping up to date with Swift
to keep your project going I mean that's
just one example but know the pros
cons of third-party libraries and know
how to use them alright shifting gears a
little bit let's talk about some of the
actual coding exercises I had to do now
obviously I can't say what company asked
what question and these are going to be
generalized principles so it's not the
exact question I got asked but this
should give you some idea of what to
expect first up was the most common
coding path I got asked to do and that
was gesture recognizers which kind of
GESTURE RECOGNIZERS
common by surprised because they aren't
something I typically use in projects so
what we're talking about here is the the
tap gesture recognizer the pain and
gesture recognizer or the pinch and zoom
now in four different phone screens or
on-site interviews I got asked to do
something with gesture recognizers an
example this would be you know on the
screen grabbing a file and dragging it
to a trash bin just manipulating objects
on the screen using a gesture recognizer
so don't sleep on this topic
there's tons of tutorials out there get
some practice from my experience if you
interview at a few companies you're
almost certainly going to be asked to
demonstrate your ability to use gesture
recognizers in a UI next is something I
surprisingly only got asked to do twice
I thought I was going to get asked to do
this at basically every interview and
that's networking an example of this was
NETWORKING
I had to authenticate on a server they
gave me all the API information the
endpoint I needed but essentially I had
to build the URL with the proper headers
with authorization and make sure the
body of the request was complete with
the username password etc and had to
authenticate on the server and return a
token like I said I was very surprised I
only had to do this twice because this
is a very fundamental cast to iOS
development so definitely make sure you
practice this make sure you know it I
think I just got lucky I only had to do
it twice I imagine this is a very common
question in interviews some other
smaller and common questions I got asked
was I got asked to do merge sort and
Swift I also got asked to shuffle an
array and Swift and then debugging is
also another big one I got asked this
DEBUGGING
about three or four times well they'll
actually put code in front of you and
you have to debug it just by looking at
it I mean you can't like run the project
and let Xcode yell at you with all the
errors you have to find the errors
yourself and it's typically the usual
suspects look for optionals being forced
and wrapped and appropriately look for
race conditions in the network calls
look for retained cycles memory leaks
like we talked about earlier and then
look for like UI not being updated on
the main thread etc etc it's usually
kind of the same thing so if you get a
debugging question look for those common
issues another type of coding question I
got asked more than once was to take a
large unit and break it down into
smaller units so what I mean by that is
let's say you have a hundred thousand
seconds and you need to break that down
into days hours minutes
seconds now the key to these types of
questions is the modulo operator that's
the percent sign what modulo does is it
gives you the remainder left so just for
example two modulo five is going to be
one
because two goes into five evenly twice
MODULO
four and then there's one remainder so
one so again 2 modulo 5 is 1 now how you
would use this in this time example is
let's say you had 64 seconds so you
would do 64 modulo 60 because there's 60
seconds in a minute and that will give
you a ranger of 4 so you'd have 1 minute
and four seconds so that's kind of like
the tail end of breaking it down into
days hours minutes seconds you would
just do that all the way down so the
mobile story is no the modulo operator
learn it love it do some practice
problems I got asked about it a few
times and just to kind of wrap up this
coding problem section just be really
familiar with iterating through for
loops and while loops cetera almost
every problem has something to do with
that and finally I just wanted to
mention the take home project now I love
TAKE HOME PROJECTS
these so when you're doing the typical
phone screen or on-site coding interview
you have somebody looking over your
shoulder you have typically a half hour
to 45 minutes to do it it's a lot of
pressure and it's not how you typically
work however the take home project you
know you can sit at your desk for a
couple hours knock it out do your
typical researching that you do I feel
like I excel in those so that being said
let me just talk real quick about a
couple that I had to do so one was
basically a mini version of their app I
mean it at everything from networking to
building a table view to building the UI
to a design spec I got handed a sketch
file that had the design spec and I had
to build exactly to that spec
persistence it's an animation even that
kid so it just touched on a lot of the
core fundamentals that iOS developers
have to use I just really enjoyed the
project it took me about six hours to do
but I learned a lot it was fun so like I
said I love these take on projects
another one I did that was not so easy
and not so fun but a good learning
experience was I had to build a basic
login flow but it was a 100 percent
programmatic UI no storyboards no
nothing for auto layout I had to do Auto
layout completely encode for me was the
first time I had done that because I
basically grown up on storyboards so
that was challenging and I don't know if
I'm a fan of it yet I definitely saw how
the other side lives a little bit now a
lot of people scoff at the idea of a
take home project but I actually love
them like I said I feel like I excel at
them I look at as a learning experience
whether I get the job or not I built
something and it's a lot different when
you're building something knowing
somebody's going to evaluate every line
of code you definitely take extra care
to make sure everything is perfect about
that codebase so that's good practice as
well alright so there you have it like I
said I've done about 15 to 20 phone
screens or on sites in the past two
months I've been through the wringer in
this whole interview process so I'm
sharing my information this is just the
overview video I'm going to be releasing
new videos in the coming weeks that
dives deep into each one of these topics
doing some of the coding examples etc so
if you think you're going to find those
useful go and hit subscribe and keep an
eye out in the coming weeks
