Example 01 
What is 3% of 105? 
Answer: To calculate this, we take the percentage figure (3) and multiply it by the first digit of the number we want to find the percentage of (1). This results in 3 times 1, which is 3. Next, we take the first digit of the percentage (3) and multiply it by the last two digits of the number (05). So, we have 3 times 05, which is the same as 3 times 5, giving us 15. This number will be after the decimal point. Therefore, the result is 3.15.

Example 02 What is 9% of 307?

Note: The method described in your note is seems not to be a standard mathematical approach for calculating percentages. But is only shortcut when you split the nominator of the fraction
There's no reason to continue this exercise because it clearly stems from the properties of fractions.
