Introduction


Section 1: Typing
Goes over basic typing concepts and why they are relevant for alternative keyboard layouts


Section 2: Angle mod
Explains “angle mod” in detail.


Section 3: Typing practice
A suggested method is given on how to learn a new layout. Afterwards, there is info on how to continue typing practice after that initial phase.


Section 4: Layout stats
Defines the different stats used to evaluate keyboard layouts, and explains how the stats relate to one another. These are the stats that will be later given for each layout.


Section 5: English data
We look at English letter, bigram and trigram frequency, as it is a crucial aspect of layout design. We will expand on this further in the following sections.


Section 6: Layout subgroups
Separates layouts in subgroups, in order to make the huge amount of keyboard layouts more manageable. We then go over the characteristics of layouts in each group, so we can more easily decide from which group to choose a layout from.


Section 7: SFBs, SFSs and Qwerty’s shortcomings
SFB stands for same finger bigram, and refers to having to press two keys in succession with the same finger. SFS stands for same finger skipgram, and refers to pressing two keys with the same finger, but separated by X letters. These two stats are crucial for layout design, as they will tell us how much our fingers have to move in a particular layout.






Section 8: Inward rolls optimization
Explains how to optimize layouts so that they favor inward rolls (i.e. rolls that go from your outer to your inner fingers). First we look at how to arrange the vowels to maximize in-rolls, and then we do the same with the consonants.


Section 9: High roll - low redirect optimization
Explains how to optimize layouts to maximize rolls (pressing 2 keys with one hand, the changing hands) while minimizing redirects (one-handed trigram in which the direction changes). A roll would be DF on qwerty, and a redirect DFS on qwerty.


Section 10: Vowels and punctuation
Explores the different ways in which vowels and punctuation can be arranged, as vowels are quite versatile and play a critical role in keyboard layouts.


Section 11: The layout list
Lists the stats for all the layouts. The layouts are sorted (not ranked) by same finger bigram % to make the list easier to use. For example, after deciding how low SFB% should be, you can then go to that point on the list, and compare the layouts below that threshold. To compare the layouts use all the stats that are given (and that Section 2 explains how to interpret) rather than just the SFB%.

Section 1: Typing
Touch typing
 
This refers to developing the necessary muscle memory for your fingers, so you are able to type without looking at the keyboard and without consciously thinking about it.


The home row


Touch typing is better learned in steps. The first step would be learning the home row, which refers to the 8 keys that act as the resting position for your fingers:


  



The image above shows the home row on a standard Qwerty keyboard. You should be able to place your hands in this position without looking at the keyboard, by feeling with your index fingers the 2 small bumps in the F and J keys.


Right away we find an inconvenience with the Qwerty layout: not many words can be written on the home row! Learning qwerty can be very tedious, since many typing tutors will have you type stuff like fkf, kjk, jkj or ;l;


Thankfully, alternative keyboard layouts move the most common letters in the English language to the home row, allowing us to type full words from the beginning.


Learning the home row before anything else will be very useful, since it will allow us to learn the muscle memory for the rest of the keyboard in relation to the home row.


Space bar


As for which thumb to use for the space bar, it’s a matter of preference. So, feel free to use either your right thumb or your left thumb depending on what feels natural to you.
Shift


For shift however, when the letter you want to capitalize is on the left side of the keyboard, use the right shift. If the letter is on the right side instead, use the left shift.


Standard typing technique


The row of keys directly above the home row would be the top row, while the one below it would be the bottom row:


  

Each color indicates the keys assigned to each finger. For the left hand: green for pinky, light blue for ring, pink for middle, and orange for index. Same applies to the right hand, only that the right index appears in yellow.


When learning touch typing, at first you will have to make a conscious effort to use the proper finger for each key. Many people have learned how to type by themselves without following the model above, and therefore have developed their own style.


However, most layouts were developed assuming the user would be utilizing the traditional finger technique. So, following said technique is necessary in order to get the benefit of the layout.


In fact, arguably one of the best reasons for learning a new layout is to take it as an opportunity to learn proper typing technique. If you currently do not use all your fingers when typing, you could learn a new layout to change that.






Section 2: Angle mod
Angle mod technique


When using standard fingering, the left bottom row of the keyboard is noticeably less comfortable than the right one. There is a popular alternative typing technique referred to as “angle mod” that aims to fix this:


  

With angle mod, there are three keys that change fingers:
* Qwerty Z → ring finger
* Qwerty X → middle finger
* Qwerty C → index finger


This setup makes those keys as comfortable as their right side counterparts. Furthermore, the left pinky lost 1 key (now has 2 total), while the left index gained 1 (now 7 total). In the case of alternative layouts, this additional index key can allow for a few index letter arrangements that wouldn’t work otherwise.


It should be noted that while angle mod does equalize the stagger on the bottom row, the top row stagger still differs a bit from one hand to the other. For example, try typing Qwerty I → N, really fast. If we now do the same with its left side counterpart (Qwerty E → V) we will see that the latter is a larger stretch.


So, even with angle mod, traditional keyboards are not entirely symmetrical. Regardless, angle mod is highly recommended as it makes typing more comfortable once you get used to it.








ANSI and ISO standards


The physical layout of your keyboard will vary a bit depending on where you live. In the images below, the differences appear in blue:


ANSI (American):


  



This was the keyboard utilized when we looked at angle mod in the previous section. We can refer to that one as ANSI angle mod. However, there is another common keyboard standard:


ISO (International):


  



On ISO, the left shift key is split into two. This is relevant for angle mod, as now it becomes possible to have three keys on the left pinky (rather than two). That angle mod variant would be referred to as ISO angle mod.


Below we will give examples for both ANSI and ISO. Having said that, the version utilized throughout this document will be ANSI angle mod, as any person can use it regardless of which keyboard standard they have. On the other hand, ISO angle mod relies on the additional left pinky key, meaning it is exclusive to ISO keyboards.




JIS standard


Technically, there is also the JIS standard (japanese). It splits the right shift key into two keys, the space bar into four, and the backspace key (not shown) into two:


  

The left shift key is not split. Therefore, angle mod would be the same as on ANSI.






Example of angle modding a layout


Now we will give examples of how to modify a layout that follows standard fingering, into one that uses angle mod instead. How this is done will vary a bit, depending if we want ANSI or ISO angle mod.


Note: SFB stands for same finger bigram. It means pressing two keys in succession with the same finger (e.g. ED on qwerty). Optimized layouts will minimize SFBs.






























ANSI angle mod example


The following would be Colemak DH with traditional technique:


q w f p b  j l u y ;
a r s t g  m n e i o '
z x c d v  k h , . /


  



To angle mod Colemak DH on ANSI, we shift the letters X, C and D one position to the left (making them more comfortable to press) while Z is moved to the left index:


q w f p b  j l u y ;
a r s t g  m n e i o '
 x c d v z  k h , . /


  



When angle modding a layout on ANSI, the letters assigned to each finger shouldn’t change with the exception of the left pinky bottom row key (Z in this case) which will go from Qwerty Z to Qwerty B. This change leads to one requirement for a layout to be easily “angle moddable'' on ANSI: said bottom pinky key should be a rare letter (X, J, Q, Z).


Since that letter will be moved to the left index, it should be an uncommon one, as to not cause SFBs with the other six letters already on the index. Another reason for wanting a rare letter is that it will be in one of the worst positions on the keyboard (Qwerty B).


Note that after angling the layout, the original columns are still intact: a WRX column on the left ring, a FSC column on the left middle, and a PTD column on the left index. This way we avoid introducing unintended SFBs.


ISO angle mod example


Colemak DH with standard technique:


q w f p b  j l u y ;
a r s t g  m n e i o '
z x c d v  k h , . /


  



To angle mod Colemak DH on ISO, we shift the letters Z, X, C and D one position to the left:


 q w f p b  j l u y ;
 a r s t g  m n e i o '
z x c d v   k h , . /


  



On ISO, thanks to the additional left pinky key, we don’t need to move the bottom pinky letter (Z in our case) to Qwerty B. That was necessary on ANSI, but not here. In fact, as seen above, the Qwerty B position ends up vacant on ISO.


Technically, on ISO it’s possible to use ANSI angle mod if you want.


















Errors to avoid with angle mod
Learning a standard layout with angle mod technique (angle cheat)


This is Colemak DH with standard technique:


q w f p b  j l u y ;
a r s t g  m n e i o '
z x c d v  k h , . /


  



And the following is Colemak DH with “angle cheat”:


  



Basically, angle cheat consists of using angle mod fingering, but without actually angle modding the layout. This results in the layout’s columns changing, which can introduce unintended SFBs (CT is this case).


So, angle cheating is a half step. The correct way to do it is fully angle modding the layout, as shown in the examples section. On some layouts, angle cheating might be mostly fine (barely causing SFBs) while in other layouts it would be terrible.




















Learning a angled modded layout with standard technique


Take Octa8, which was designed for angle mod only:


y o u k x  g w d l ,
i a e n f  b s t r c ;
 / z h ' q  v p m j .


  



Imagine someone mistakenly learns this layout with traditional fingering. As follows:


  



Here we have effectively ruined the layout, as now we have a UEH column. This results in the second most common bigram in the English language (HE) being a SFB. While the first layout only had 1.285% SFB (on the Colemak mods analyzer) the second layout has 4.758%! Technically, one could un-angle mod the layout to fix the SFBs. Like this:


y o u k x  g w d l , 
i a e n f  b s t r c ;
q / z h '  v p m j .


  



However, this wouldn’t be ideal either, as H (a very common letter) would now be in a worse position than before (on Qwerty V, rather than Qwerty C). So, the one correct version is the one at the top of this section, which is what the layout is intended for.


Section 3: Typing practice
How to learn a new layout


A useful tool for this is a word filter, which allows us to generate lists of words that can be typed with just certain letters. This way we can learn a layout in steps:


1. Practice the home row (8 keys).
2. Add the two center column keys (10 keys).
3. Add the top row (20 keys).
4. Add the bottom row (30 keys).


Please note that the steps above are just an example. You can do it in more or less steps, depending on what feels best to you.


MonkeyType already has a word filter built in. To use it, on the top right corner, click custom → change → Words filter:


  

	  

	  



By default, MonkeyType only uses the 200 most common English words to generate its tests. If you click on language, you can (and should) change to an expanded set (1000 most common words = English 1k, or 5k, 10k, etc..), you can also change the language.


By adding the 8 home row keys of your layout of choice in the include box, and putting all the remaining letters in exclude, you can generate a word list that uses only your home row. Afterwards click set, and you will return to the previous screen:
  

As you can see, now the text box has a list of all the words in English 10k that can be written with just the letters we specified. Here we select random to randomize the words, and we input a word count or time (in seconds) depending on how long we want the test to last. Finally press ok.


Once you are comfortable with the home row, you would go back to the word filter and progressively move more keys from exclude to include, until you have learned all 26 letters.


Note: English 10k has words with capital letters, while English 5k does not. If you have just begun learning to touch type, you might prefer not having to use the shift key at first, in which case you can use English 5k.




















Word tests


If you have already learned all the letters in your layout, then you wouldn’t need the word filter anymore. Now you can use the time or words settings on MonkeyType:


  

	  

	

You can select how long the test will last (either the time in seconds, or how many words it will contain). There is also the option of choosing a custom length.


By clicking on punctuation, you can add basic punctuation to the test: comma (,), period (.), apostrophe (‘), colon (:), semicolon (;), hyphen (-), slash (/), question mark (?), exclamation point (!), quotation marks (“”) and parentheses ().


Quotes


Once you are comfortable with punctuation you can start using the quote setting to practice whole sentences, rather than individual words as we had been doing until now:


  



You can select how long you want the quotes to be. By default it will give you quotes of medium length. There is also the option of searching for specific quotes.


While you can still use the time and words settings, a significant amount of your typing practice should be spent in quotes. For speed typing, generally time 60 or 120 is used.


Lastly, if you want to practice texts of your own choice, you can click on custom → change, paste the desired text in the input box, and then click ok.












MonkeyType Settings


To go to settings, click on the gear icon (top left corner). These are some of the things you can customize (going from the top of the settings page to the bottom):


  



Makes it so you can restart a test simply by tapping the tab key. It also allows you to jump straight into a typing test from anywhere on the site.


  



To ensure you are not just trying to get faster while disregarding accuracy, you could set a min accuracy and progressively set it higher as you improve. The sky's the limit (up to 98% or even 99% accuracy).


  



The default English setting should only be used for speed typing, as it includes just the 200 most common English words. For general practice you should use a much bigger word set, like English 10k for example.


  



This mode will ensure you learn how to capitalize letters correctly (i.e. using the shift key of the hand opposite to the letter you want to capitalize).










  



I wouldn’t recommend letter mode, as it is not representative of actual typing. However, word mode will ingrain in you the habit of correcting your mistakes before continuing.


  



Normally, the backspace key sits quite far from your right pinky. This option turns caps lock into backspace, as caps lock is in a much better position and is a rarely used key.


Naturally, this change would only be in effect while you are on MonkeyType. However, if you end up liking it, I will tell you how to change it on a system wide level in a bit.


  



The caret is a mark that shows where you are in the typing test at any given moment. You can find an example in the image below (the caret appears as a vertical line):


  



The following are some of the ways in which we can customize it:


  

  



The pace caret can act as a challenge. You can progressively set it to higher speeds as you improve. Its speed can be that of your pb, your last test, your average, or you can set it manually.


Lastly, MonkeyType also allows you to customize aesthetics. In the appearance tab you can set things like the font family, while In the theme tab you can change the color of the background and the letters, or even use a custom background. You can also do stuff like selecting if the typed text should be brighter than the future text or vice versa.
Rebind Caps lock to Backspace or Control on Windows


Note: Credit goes to Ze_or, as he was the one who made it.


Click here and you will find a zip file. After you download and unzip it, you should see the following:


  



Now, just run the .reg file of your choice and reboot your computer for it to take effect:


* Caps2BS.reg - Rebind Caps to Backspace
* SwapCapsBS.reg - Swap Caps and Backspace
* Caps2Ctrl.reg - Rebind Caps to Control
* SwapCapsCtrl.reg - Swap Caps and Control
* Unbind.reg - Undo All Rebinds


If you want to get used to utilizing Caps Lock as Backspace, I would recommend using the second option. This is because, with SwapCapsBS, you won’t be able to delete characters with Backspace anymore, which will force you to use Caps Lock instead.




























Section 4: Layout stats
Info given for each layout


Further down in this document you will find an extensive keyboard layout list. The following is how each layout will appear. For example, this would be colemak dh:


Colemak dh


q w f p b  j l u y ;
a r s t g  m n e i o '
z x c d v  k h , . /


  



  

	

Rolls
	49.41%
	Alternates
	31.08%
	Onehands
	2.85%
	Redirects
	10.39%
	

	SFB: 1.645% | 1.065%   SFS: 7.903%   LSB: 1.66%   In-roll ratio: 1.04




For each layout, you can find a link to its source by clicking on the layout’s name in blue. Next we have the layout in text format in case you want to copy and paste it elsewhere (for either sharing the layout, or running it through an analyzer). Afterwards we go over all the layout stats. The stats are described in the following section.










What do each of the stats mean?


* Heatmap: a color scale is utilized to show where the most common letters are placed in a particular layout. High frequency letters appear in red, while low frequency ones appear in gray.


* Finger frequency: shows how much each finger is utilized in a layout. Each number corresponds to a finger, as follows:
finger 0 → left pinky                finger 9 → right pinky
finger 1 → left ring                finger 8 → right ring
finger 2 → left middle        finger 7 → right middle
finger 3 → left index                finger 6 → right index


* Hand balance: how much one hand is used in relation to the other. “Total L” shows the left hand use, while “Total R” is the right hand. 50-50 would be a perfect split.


* Same finger bigram (SFB): pressing two keys in succession with the same finger (e.g. ED on qwerty). The SFB% is given for two different corpus, as follows: SFB = 1.645% | 1.065%. The first corpus includes punctuation, the second does not.


Aside from minimizing the SFB%, layouts should also reduce SFB distance. Ideally, we want the 2 letters that form a SFB to be on adjacent keys (1U SFB) and we should avoid SFBs that involve having to jump over the home row (2U SFB) like Qwerty CE.


* Same finger skipgram (SFS) or disjointed SFB (DSFB): pressing two keys with the same finger, but separated by X letters. For example, typing MAY on qwerty involves a same finger skip-1-gram (M_Y). Moreover, it’s a 2U one. After pressing M on the bottom row, your right index then has to jump to the top row for Y.


By comparison, layouts that minimize SFS will give your fingers more time to come back to their resting position before they are needed on another key. And when you do have to use a finger almost consecutively (i.e. a skip-1-gram) the distance between the two keys will be minimal most of the time.


* Lateral Stretch bigram (LSB): a bigram typed with adjacent fingers, but that requires a lateral stretch since the two letters forming the bigram are far apart. An example would be pressing a key on the index finger’s outer column, followed by a second key with the middle finger of that same hand (e.g. BE on qwerty).


To reduce lsb, avoid placing common consonants on the center column if you already have vowels on that same hand. Otherwise, pressing said consonant on the center column followed by a vowel (or vice versa) would be a frequent lsb.
Trigram stats


There are also four additional stats that highlight what hand motions are most common in a particular layout. These are calculated based on trigrams (3 key sequences):


* Alternate: pressing one key with one hand, then one with the other, then back to the first (1, 1, 1). In other words, a pure alternating trigram.


* Roll: pressing two (not same finger) keys with one hand, and a third key with the other (2, 1 or 1, 2). In other words, a 2 key roll following or preceding a hand change.


We distinguish between inward or outward rolls depending on which direction the two keys on the same hand follow. An inward roll moves from outer to inner fingers (i.e. pinky  → ring  → middle  → index) while an outward roll is the opposite. So for example, DF on qwerty would be inward, while FD would be outward.


Some people prefer inward rolls over outward rolls. The in-roll ratio stat tells us how much a layout favors the former over the later. Keep in mind that optimizing a layout for a particular stat, will prevent us from fully optimizing a different stat. For example, maximizing inward rolls and minimizing SFBs are mutually exclusive.


* Onehand: a one-handed trigram where all keys go in the same direction. In other words, a trigram roll. For example, sdf on qwerty.


* Redirect: a one-handed trigram in which the direction changes. For example, dfs would be a redirect on qwerty, since df is inward, while fs is outward. Generally, redirects are considered the less comfortable hand sequence to input a trigram.


The stats above are based on trigrams to avoid redirects being counted as rolls. For example, if we used bigrams to calculate the stats instead, sequences like dfdfdf could be labeled as multiple rolls, when it's really just a long one-handed sequence.




















The relation between alternates, rolls, onehands and redirects


A layout can have a similar amount of rolls and alternates up to a certain point. However, if we want to increase rolling further, then alternation must decrease. Conversely, higher alternation would mean lower rolling.


Similarly, onehands and redirects are affected as well. High alternation leads to low onehands and low redirects, while high rolling will inevitably bring more onehands and redirects with it.


Think of a scale that has max alternation on one end and max rolling on the other. What we want to do is determine where on the scale we want our layout to be. In other words, finding our sweet spot.


Neither extreme of the scale would feel balanced. Max rolling + max onehands would cause alternation to plummet, meaning redirects and long same hand sequences would skyrocket. Meanwhile, absolute max alternation would result in minimal rolling.


So, we want a bit of both. Which of the two to favor (rolls vs alternation) is subjective. It could be said that alternation is more consistent, as it feels rhythmic and minimizes awkward sequences. Meanwhile, rolling has higher highs (words that feel very smooth) but lower lows (potential long same hand sequences).


































Section 5: English data


To understand where the stats for a layout are coming from, first we need to be familiar with the letter, bigram and trigram frequency of the language the layout is for. Most layouts were designed for English, so that's what we will be looking at.


Note: the bigram and trigram tables in the following sections were created using Norvig’s English data, which can be found here and here.


English letter frequency


  



As one would expect, the vowels E, A, O, I are very frequent, while the most common consonants are T, N, S, R. These 8 would be the most important letters. Afterwards we would have the letter H, followed by L, D, C, and then the vowel U.






Top 50 bigrams


Two-letter sequences are known as bigrams. The following is the top 50 (with the top 25 being highlighted):


1-10
	th
	he
	in
	er
	an
	re
	on
	at
	en
	nd
	

	

11-20
	ti
	es
	or
	te
	of
	ed
	is
	it
	al
	ar
	

	

21-30
	st

41-50
	ra
	ce
	li
	ch
	ll
	be
	ma
	si
	om
	ur
	

	Common bigrams should feel comfortable in your layout of choice. We can see that most bigrams involve a consonant + a vowel. Therefore, putting all vowels on one hand and most important consonants on the other will lead to high alternation, while mixing vowels and consonants will lead to high rolling.






























Top 50 trigrams


Three-letter sequences are known as "trigrams''. The following is the top 50 (with the top 25 being highlighted):


1-10
	the
	and
	ing
	ion
	tio
	ent
	ati
	for
	her
	ter

41-50
	sta
	cti
	ica
	ist
	ear
	ain
	one
	our
	iti
	rat
	

	Common trigrams should feel comfortable in your layout of choice. If you remember, we classify trigrams in four categories: alternate (1-1-1), roll (2-1 or 1-2), onehand (3 key roll) or redirect (2 keys rolling in one direction, followed by 1 key in the opposite direction).


Depending on the layout, how many trigrams fall into either of those categories will vary. Naturally, trigrams that appear higher on the table will have a bigger effect on how a layout feels. For example, to maximize the onehand stat, we would need trigrams like the, and, ing and ion as onehands.


Since common trigrams involve both consonants and vowels, keeping most consonants away from the vowels would minimize one-handed trigrams (i.e. redirects and onehands).
















Extended bigram tables


Now we will take a deeper look into bigram stuff. However, in order to make the information easy to digest, we will separate bigrams into different tables:


* Vowel + vowel bigrams
* Consonant + consonant bigrams
* Consonant + vowel bigrams
* Double letters


For a given table, bigrams are sorted from most to least frequent. The number next to each bigram indicates its frequency in percent (e.g. OU amounts to 0.870% of bigrams).


While the aforementioned tables are the most relevant ones, at the end of this section you will also find others tables that show more niche stuff:


* Consonant only trigrams
* Consonant only trigrams (excluding Y)
* Top words with apostrophe
* Top trigrams with apostrophe

	Consonant bigrams amount to 21.406% of bigrams.
Similarly to vowels, consonant only bigrams would be rolls on the consonant hand.
Consonant + vowel bigrams


Bigrams under 0.175% frequency are omitted. As expected, less common consonants have fewer bigrams that make the cut. In fact, Q, J and Z have none. The top 50 are highlighted:

Any layout will have some consonants on the vowel side. Those consonants, when combining with the vowels, will result in rolls in the layout. For example, if we had N with the vowels, then bigrams like IN, EN, AN, ON would be rolls. If we wanted to see how common those bigrams are, we would just have to check the N + vowels table.

Section 6: Layout subgroups
Which consonants lead to alternation or rolling


The following table shows how much each consonant combines with vowels vs with consonants. For example, B + vowels = 1.75% of bigrams. We are interested in T, N, S, R, H:




	vowels

	b

	z

The point is understanding what effect it would have to place each of these consonants on the vowel hand. For example, moving N to the vowel side would lead to a rolling layout, as N is the consonant that combines most with vowels (9.946% of bigrams).


Having said that, we need to look at both columns on the table to get the full picture. To see how much a consonant favors the vowels, we will do the following: vowel column minus consonant column (v - c). The more a consonant favors the vowels, the bigger this difference will be, and the higher said consonant will appear on the following table:




	vowels
	cons
	 v-c
	r
	9.38
	4.19

We see that R and N easily make it to the top of the list. Therefore, R, followed by N, would increase rolling the most when placed on the same hand as the vowels.


As we descend through the table, we find consonants that favor the vowels less strongly (like S), or even consonants that do not favor the vowels at all (like H and T). Thus, T, followed by H, would increase alternation the most when placed with the vowels.


Lastly, we can see Y favors consonants over vowels as well. This is because Y is a semivowel, and (just like a vowel) will mainly combine with consonants. So, putting Y with the vowels increases alternation, while placing it with consonants helps with rolling.
Which consonants lead to more or less redirects


The first rule for minimizing redirects is having all vowels on the same hand. This is because vowels on one side ensures alternation, which minimizes redirects.


Next we need to determine which common consonants can go on the vowel side. We are looking for consonants that roll in one direction with the vowels, as that too will minimize redirects. After all, redirects are a change in direction.


The table below shows us how much each of the following consonants favor one direction: consonant → vowel vs vowel → consonant. We are interested in letters that score high on one column (i.e. one direction), but low on the other, leading to a high ratio. The most common letters are highlighted, as these will have the biggest effect:




	c→v
	v→c
	ratio
	h
	5.322
	0.064
	83.2
	n
	1.921
	8.025
	4.18
	s
	2.409
	4.083
	1.69
	r
	4.123
	5.258
	1.28
	m
	2.127
	1.661
	1.28
	c
	2.428
	1.978
	1.23
	d
	1.746
	2.118
	1.21
	t
	4.374
	3.87
	1.13
	l
	2.503
	2.761
	1.10
	

While there are other factors that affect the final redirect number (for example, we are omitting consonant only bigrams) consonant + vowel bigrams already add up to around 70% of bigrams. So, this alone should give us a good idea.


From the table, we can see that any layout that aims to minimize redirects will naturally place the letter H with the vowels, as H only combines with them in the direction H → vowel (83 ratio!). On the other side of the spectrum, placing T with the vowels will noticeably increase redirects, as T combines with vowels in both directions about equally (1.13 ratio).












How to read the layout format


In the following sections, you will find layouts that are angle modded and ones that are not. We can easily tell what the intended fingering for a given layout is, by checking how it is formatted:


Standard fingering:
	Angle mod fingering:
	Gallium (Bryson)
b l d c v  z y o u ,
n r t s g  p h a e i
q x m w j  k f ' ; .
	Isrt (Whorf)
y c l m k  z f u , '
i s r t g  p n e a o ;
 v w d j q  b h / . x
	

For standard fingering, we can read the columns strictly vertically. For example, the left hand on Gallium would be: BNQ pinky, LRX ring, DTM middle and CSWVGJ index.


With angle mod, we only have two keys on the left pinky (the key that used to be on bottom row pinky is moved to Qwerty B on the left index). Furthermore, the bottom row is shifted. The left hand on Isrt would be: YI pinky, CSV ring, LRW middle and MTDKGJQ index.










































Layout categories (by stacks)


In order to make the huge amount of keyboard layouts more manageable, we will divide layouts into a few categories. Layouts in the same category will share more similarities.


To classify a layout, we will look at where it places the high frequency letters. These are E, A O, I for the vowels (which we will highlight in green) and T, N, S, R, H for the consonants (which will be highlighted in red).


The aforementioned letters are the main ones competing for the 8 home row spots in a layout. Since there are 9 high frequency letters for 8 home row spots, one of these letters will inevitably be pushed off the home row. The result is that there will always be at least 2 high frequency letters sharing a column/finger. This is referred to as a “stack”. The viable stacks are NH, RH, NR for the consonants, and EO, AO for the vowels:
1 consonant stack:
Isrt (Whorf)
y c l m k  z f u , '
i s r t g  p n e a o ;
 v w d j q  b h / . x
	1 vowel stack:
Graphite (StronglyTyped)
b l d w z  ' f o u j ;
n r t s g  y h a e i ,
q x m c v  k p . - /
	

	Additionally, the letter C plays a key role in layout structure despite not being that common. The unique thing about C is that it can not share a column with T, N, R or H (high SFBs). Therefore, on 1 stack layouts, C will always be on a SC column (see above).


However, there are certain aspects of layout design (SFBs, for example) that can only be fully optimized if we break the SC pair and give the letter C its own column. And for that, we need 2 stacks (a consonant stack + a vowel stack):
2 stacks with C on index:
Noctum (Oxey)
b g d l z  j f o u ,
n s t r k  y c a e i
 v m h x q  p w ' ; .
	2 stacks with C on pinky:
Pine (ClemenPine)
y l r m k  q f o u ,
c s n t g  b h a e i
j x z w v  p d ' / .
	Note that layouts with such an index finger won’t always give C the home row spot. For example, it may be given to D instead, or even Y (in order to minimize SFB distance):
Semimak JQ (Semi)
f l h v z  ' w u o y
s r n t k  c d e a i
x j b m q  p g , . /
	Whorf (Whorf)
f l n d m  v w o u .
s r h t q  g y a e i
 j b k x z  p c ' ; ,
	1 consonant stack


Layouts that have two of the top consonants on the same column (e.g. a NH column):
Colemak DH (SteveP)
q w f p b  j l u y ;
a r s t g  m n e i o '
 x c d v z  k h , . /
	Colemak Qi;x (Nyfee)
; l c m k  j f u y q
a r s t g  p n e i o '
 x w d v z  b h / . ,
	Arts (ClemenPine)
q l d g v  j f u y '
a r t s w  p n e i o
z x m c b  k h ; , .
	Isrt (Whorf)
y c l m k  z f u , '
i s r t g  p n e a o ;
 v w d j q  b h / . x
	Irst (Ec0vid)
y l c m k  z f u , '
i r s t g  b n e a o
 x w d v j  p h " . q
	Boo (kathy)
, . u c v  q f d l y
a o e s g  b n t r i
; x ' w z  p h m k j
	These layouts have the highest home row use, as the letter O (the 4th most common English letter) is on the home row. To make room for O, H is pushed off the home row.


Note that, since one of the main vowels (usually A or I) is moved to the consonant hand, alternation will noticeably decrease. Therefore, rolls, and especially redirects, will increase. This is because some trigrams like vowel → consonant → vowel, or consonant → vowel → consonant will turn into a redirect (e.g. WAS on Colemak).


As seen above, Colemak’s LNHMK right index tends to be replaced by a FNHPB index on modern layouts. This is because the original index has very high movement (i.e. SFB + SFS distance) while a FNHPB index fixes that. All the layouts that apply this change also have LR and DTM columns. Lastly, on this layout subgroup, the SC, EU and IY pairings are a lock.




























1 vowel stack


Layouts that have two of the top vowels on the same column (e.g. an EO or AO column). The letter O is relegated to the top row. Therefore, home row use will be a bit lower.


There are multiple ways of arranging the vowels. For example, the first “vowel block” below favors high middle finger use (EO) while the other two favor SFS optimization instead (AO):
* * * * *  * * o u '
* * * * *  * * e i a
 * * * * *  * * " , .
	* * * * *  * * o u .
* * * * *  * * a e i
 * * * * *  * * ' ; ,
	* * * * *  * * u o y
* * * * *  , * e a i
 * * * * *  . * * ' *
	We subdivide these layouts based on which consonants go on the vowel side, as that determines where the layout will fall on the alternation-rolling scale:


H + vowels:
Gallium (Bryson)
b l d c v  z y o u ,
n r t s g  p h a e i
q x m w j  k f ' ; .
	Graphite (StronglyTyped)
b l d w z  ' f o u j ;
n r t s g  y h a e i ,
q x m c v  k p . - /
	Maya (Adi.lela)
b l d g q  j f o u ,
n r t s v  k h a e i
 x m c w z  p y ' / .
	Noctum (Oxey)
b c d l z  j f o u ,
n s t r v  y h a e i
 w g m x q  k p ' ; .
	Nrstmak (ClemenPine)
q w y p b  j k o u ,
n r s t d  l h a e i
z x c f g  v m ' ; .
	Ctgap (Colby)
q p l c j  x f o u /
r n t s g  y h e i a
z b m w v  k d ' , .
	Other examples would be Nerps, Nerts, Nila or Gallaya. As can be seen above, H + vowels layouts like making a HYFKP/D right index, and a SCWGV left index. 


N + vowels:
Mtgap (Michael Dickens)
y p o u j  k d l c w
i n e a ,  m h t s r '
q z / . :  b f g v x
	APT (Apsu)
w g d f b  z l u o y
r s t h k  j n e a i ;
 c m p v q  x , . ' /
	Rollla (Tanamr & Heart)
y o u b .  x k c l v
i a e n ,  m h s r t
 ' / p w z  f d g j q
	Some similarities shared by all the layouts above: the SC pair; D being either with T or H (same for M in most cases); N being with P/B or L; the letter R being with L or W…


Anyway, the vowels taking just three home row spots means we can have all vowels on one side, while still being able to fit consonants on that same hand. This way we can have good rolling (from consonants + vowels) plus low redirects (from one side vowels).
2 stacks (1 vowel + 1 consonant)


Layouts that have a vowel column (either EO or AO) plus a consonant column (usually NH, or RH, or NR). Double stack layouts have the lowest home row use. Despite that, they offer multiple benefits in return. We can subdivide this group based on C’s location.


With C on index


Giving C its own column gets rid of the SC SFB (0.178%). Furthermore, C and D happen to cause negligible SFBs and SFSs with plenty of moderately common letters. We can take advantage of this by placing C/D on an index finger with five other letters.


NH + vowels:
Sturdy (Oxey)
v m l c p  x f o u j
s t r d y  . n a e i
 k q g w z  b h ' ; ,
	Gemini (KayOS)
x l m g w  q f o u ,

	Semimak JQ (Semi)
f l h v z  ' w u o y
s r n t k  c d e a i
x j b m q  p g , . /
	

	S + vowels:                                                                        2-3 vowel split:
Trendy (StronglyTyped)
k l h w z  j f o u ,
t r n d b  y s a e i
 x m c p q  g v . ' ;
	Trendei (Ec0vid)
k l h w b  z f o u '

	Seht Drai (Tanamr)
f u l v b  q g n o j
s e h t k  ' d r a i .
 ; m p w z  y c x / ,
	Double stack layouts with a C index have the least SFBs. There are a few variations of C/D indexes: a CYWPGZ index or similar (e.g. Whorf, Dhorf, Flow, Sertain), DCWGBP (e.g. Trendei, Trendy, Semimak), DCYWGP (e.g. Sturdy, Gemini), or CMWGBV (e.g. Snug).
These layouts usually have a SV or SF pinky, a LR ring, and NH either on index or middle.
With C on pinky


Double stack layouts with a C index have the drawback of said index finger having pretty low use (ranging from 11 to 14%). If instead one prefers a more standard index, the letter C can be moved to the pinky, leaving that index for letters such as T.


NH + vowels:
Canary (Apsu)
w l y p k  z x o u ;

	Megamak (Smudge)

	H + vowels:                                   LRH + vowels:
Pine (ClemenPine)
y l r m k  q f o u ,
c s n t g  b h a e i

	Rollly2 (Ec0vid)
y o u l q  k m w p ,

	C + vowels:
Uciea (Ian Douglas)
p y u o -  k d h f x q
c i e a '  g t n s r v
z " , . ;  w m l b j
	Engram (Arno Klein)
b y o u '  " l d w v z
c i e a ,  . h t s n q
g x j k -  ? r m f p
	

	Compared to C index layouts, moving C to the pinky sacrifices some SFB and SFS optimization, in favor of higher index finger usage. As seen on the layout examples, the C pinky can be paired with letters such as W or Y. We can even pair C with punctuation.


On the layout list above we can find examples of the three viable consonant stacks: NH (on most of them), RH (on Rollly2 and Engram) and NR (on Pine). Additionally, the letter L may be added to these columns as well (i.e. HNL on Uciea).


Many of these layouts have an index like DTMKG/V, while the other is a variant of FNHPB. Interestingly, M and PB can swap indexes in such a setup, making DTPBKG and FNHM (e.g. Canary). Also, Pine has a FHDPB index (which is just a N/D swap away from FNHPB).
With a U column


Most of the time, the letter U will be either on a EU, AU or IU column (just as in all the earlier subgroups). However, there are a few layouts that give U its own column. For U to get a home row spot, the layout needs two stacks, plus S and C sharing a column again:


With U on the vowel hand:
Hands Down (Alan reiser)
q c h p v  k y o j /
r s n t g  w u e i a
x m l d b  z f ' , .
	

	

	With U on the consonant hand:
Poqtea (Ian Douglas)
y w f l m  k p o q - /
u r s n h  d t e a i '
z x c v j  b g , . ;
	Ev29 (Ev)
y , o f b  j v r k m
i a e h p  g s n u t
 . ' d z ;  w c l x q
	

	Note that placing Y and U on the same column causes tons of SFSs in any corpus where the word YOU is common (Y and U would be typed with the same finger, only that with O in between). Examples of such corpus are MonkeyType quotes or Typeracer.


Despite it being poor for SFSs, Hands Down and Poqtea have a YU column. This is because they were designed without accounting for SFSs. The Y_U SFS is more of an issue in Poqtea, as it is on a weaker finger. Ideally, we aim to minimize SFS/SFBs on the pinkies in particular.




























Summary table


This table summarizes the characteristics of the different layout categories. To see the pros and cons of a particular category, go through a row of the table. To compare how the different categories perform on a particular aspect, read a column instead. In any case, note that these are generalizations, so they won’t apply in all cases:

* 2 stack layouts with an U column were omitted, as they are very niche.
* The redirect estimations are for the vowel hands given above only.
* Higher index use appears as a positive, as most people are used to that.


Additionally, here are some patterns we can identify from the table:


* Low index finger use correlates with lower SFBs. This is because minimal SFBs require an index in the style of CYWPFJ (e.g. Dhorf) which only has around 11% use. Other similar index variations like DCWBPZ (e.g. Trendy) or DCYWGZ (e.g. Gemini) don’t get past 14% use either.


While C/D indexes have the least SFBs, there are other alternatives with decently low SFBs if one prefers higher index finger usage. As seen on the table, for higher index use we would look at 1 consonant stack layouts (e.g. Isrt, which has low SFBs) or 2 stack layouts with a C pinky (e.g. Rollly 1/2, Pine or Lela have low SFBs as well).


* Low index finger use also correlates with lower SFSs. The reason for this is straightforward. Since index fingers have six keys assigned to them, there are many more letter interactions on the indexes, all of which can cause SFSs. At the end of the day, the purpose of SFS optimization is for words to spread across more fingers. Naturally, this means concentrating less relevant letters on one particular finger.
* Minimal SFSs requires an AO column. This explains why 1 consonant stack layouts can’t reduce SFSs past a certain point (with both A and O on the home row, we don’t have an AO column). The vowel setups with the least SFS are EU AO IY and AO EU I.




From the three points above, we can see that minimizing SFBs and SFSs does not come without its trade offs. Namely, index finger use might end up being lower than we want it to be. Also, prioritizing SFSs means having either an AO or EU column on the ring finger. However, some people may prefer a vowel block that places higher use on the middle finger instead, like EO IU A or AU EO IY, or not having a vowel block at all (i.e. 1 consonant stack layouts).


























































On what finger should the consonants on the vowel hand be?


Where the consonants are placed in relation to the vowels will have a very significant effect on how a layout feels. We are particularly talking about layouts that have all the vowels on one hand. In such layouts, the consonants can be found on that hand’s index finger, on the pinky, or even ring. Let’s see the differences.


Consonant index


Usually, the vowels are placed on pinky, ring and middle, while we reserve the vowel’s side index for consonants. The following are reasons in favor of this approach:
Sturdy (Oxey)
v m l c p  x f o u j
s t r d y  . n a e i
 k q g w z  b h ' ; ,
	Rollla (Tanamr & Heart)
y o u b .  x k c l v
i a e n ,  m h s r t
 ' / p w z  f d g j q
	Canary (Apsu)
w l y p k  z x o u ;
c r s t b  f n e i a '
 j v d g q  m h / , .
	* If we plan to use any of the three vowel blocks right above (AO EU I, or EU AO IY, or EO IU A), they are all normally paired with a consonant index.


* Using the vowel’s side index finger for consonants allows for many setups that wouldn’t work otherwise. For example, we wouldn’t do NH + vowels with a consonant pinky, as that would relegate the letter H to top/bottom row pinky.


* Index fingers play a key role on keyboard layouts, as they are assigned six keys each (rather than 3). If we want to minimize SFBs and SFSs, it is ideal to reserve both indexes for consonants, as there are many useful six-consonant combinations.


* Compare these two redirects: pinky → index → middle vs pinky → middle → ring. The former involves the index finger, while the latter does not. Most people favor redirects that rely on the index, and will therefore use a consonant index.


Trigrams with three vowels are very rare. So, if we want to minimize redirects involving pinky, ring and middle, all we have to do is place the vowels on our last three fingers. In doing so, we ensure that the index (where the consonants are) is involved in most redirects. See the layouts above for examples.


* By placing more consonants on the index fingers, we are able to place less relevant letters or punctuation on the pinky corners. This way we reduce how often our pinky finger has to reach to the top and bottom row pinky keys.


As we can see, placing the consonants on the index finger has multiple advantages.
Consonant pinky/ring


The vowel’s side consonants could also go on pinky or ring:
Engram (Arno Klein)
b y o u '  " l d w v z
c i e a ,  . h t s n q
g x j k -  ? r m f p
	Nstr (Apsu)
v g d l q  z u o y b
n s t r k  , a e i h '
p c m w x  ; . / j f
	Mtgap (Michael Dickens)
y p o u j  k d l c w
i n e a ,  m h t s r '
q z / . :  b f g v x
	This setup is normally used in order to accommodate the AU EO IY vowel block. Despite this vowel arrangement doing worse at SFB and SFS optimization, it is still decently popular, as it has two defining attributes: max in-rolls and low center column use.


The drawback of minimizing center column use too much is that more letters will be pushed towards the pinky corners. This can be seen on Engram and Nstr, as they need to place relevant letters both on the top and bottom row pinky keys.


As for inward rotation, the idea is maximizing rolling toward the index, while minimizing rolling toward the pinky. The AU EO IY vowel block is best at this. Note that the AU column should be closer to the inside of the keyboard than the EO column, in order to make the OU and EA bigrams inward. So, with EO on middle, AU must go on index. The IY column can be on ring (e.g. Engram, Nstr) or on pinky (e.g. Mtgap) making the IO, IE and IA inward.


Whether one cares about favoring in-rolls or not is entirely subjective. Doing so is not without its flaws, as it inevitably limits other aspects of layout design. Regardless, more info on this subject can be found on Section 8.


Finally, the following is the other setup in which we would see a consonant pinky:
Uciea (Ian Douglas)
p y u o -  k d h f x q
c i e a '  g t n s r v
z " , . ;  w m l b j
	

Recap


Generally, it is recommended to place the vowel’s side consonants on the index finger. With that setup we would use one of three vowel blocks: EO IU A, or AO EU I, or EU AO IY. However, if we want to maximize in-rolls or absolutely minimize center column use, then we would use a consonant pinky/ring, in order to fit the AU EO IY vowel block.
Section 7: SFBs, SFSs and Qwerty’s shortcomings


Same finger bigrams (SFBs)


A SFB consists of pressing two keys in succession with the same finger. An example of a SFB would be typing DE on the standard Qwerty layout. SFBs should be minimized.


As a reference, Qwerty has 6.6% SFB. Of the 3 mainstream alternative keyboard layouts, Workman has 3.1%, Dvorak 2.6% and Colemak around 1.6% (although just 1% if we exclude punctuation). More optimized layouts can minimize SFBs even further.


SFBs depend on which letters are sharing a column. For example, an ECD column (i.e. qwerty's left middle finger) adds 2.7% SFB. Note that, for SFB purposes, the six letters on an index finger count as one column (as all are pressed with the same finger).


Lastly, keep in mind that when we say that a layout has a certain SFB percent, that is assuming the layout is being used with its intended finger technique (either standard or angle mod technique, depending on the layout). However, if we do otherwise, we are likely to introduce SFBs that the layout was not intended for.








































SFB percent by finger


Until now, we have simply looked at the total SFB percent for a given layout. However, one should also check how that total is distributed across the fingers. We can do so with the colemak mods analyzer:


  



Each number corresponds to a finger, as follows:


finger 0 → left pinky                finger 9 → right pinky
finger 1 → left ring                finger 8 → right ring
finger 2 → left middle        finger 7 → right middle
finger 3 → left index                finger 6 → right index
                total                                total%


So, the stats above are for a layout that has, for example, 0.040% SFB on the left pinky.


To a certain point, we want to spread SFBs across the fingers. However, since our middle and index fingers have more strength and dexterity than our ring or pinky, it’s preferable to have higher SFB on the former two. The pinky is the one finger where one may want to remove SFBs almost entirely.


























Calculating the distance between two keys


Let’s say we want to know the distance for Qwerty RG (the red line):


  

We can obtain the length of the red line by using Pythagoras' theorem. All we need to know is the vertical distance between the two keys (the green line) and the horizontal distance (the blue line).


On a regular staggered keyboard, the top row is horizontally shifted 0.25 units in relation to the home row, and the bottom row is shifted 0.5 units. This makes the horizontal distance between the top row and bottom row to be 0.75 units. As for vertical distance, the top and the bottom row are each 1 unit away from the home row.


In our Qwerty RG example, the vertical distance is 1U and the horizontal distance is 1.25U (1U from G to F, and 0.25U from home to top row). Knowing this, we can use Pythagoras to determine the distance between the two keys. We have to square both the horizontal and vertical distances, and then square root the sum:



	Qwerty RG is a 1.6U SFB
	Another example, Qwerty MY. The vertical distance is 2U and the horizontal one 1.75U (1U from M to N, 0.5U from bottom to home row, and 0.25U more to the top row). Thus:



	Qwerty MY is a 2.66U SFB
	One final example, Qwerty VT. The vertical distance is 2U and the horizontal one 0.25U (from V to G it would be 0.5U, but then we subtract 0.25U going from G to T). Thus:



	Qwerty VT is a 2.02U SFB
	1U and 2U SFB


Using the method explained above, we now list the distance for the different SFB. In this section we look at either 1U or 2U ones. In the following section we check the rest.


If the two keys that form a SFB are on adjacent keys, then it will be around 1U. In the image below, the purple line is exactly 1U (Qwerty FG), the blue line is 1.03U (Qwerty FR), and the green line 1.12U (Qwerty FV):


  

If one of the keys is on the bottom row and the other on the top row, then the SFB will be around 2U. In this case, our finger has to jump over the home row to go from one key to the other. Below, the blue lines are 2.02U (Qwerty VT, NU), the green lines are 2.14U (Qwerty VR, NY):


  

Naturally, the SFBs we do have on a layout should mostly be 1U, rather than 2U.












Diagonals


Traditional keyboards are not symmetrical. The distance between the left index’s resting position and its bottom diagonal is larger than the distance to its top diagonal. Below, the blue line is 1.25U (Qwerty FT), the green line is 1.8U (Qwerty FB):


  

However, on the right side it is the opposite. Now it is the top diagonal that is further. Below, the blue line is 1.12U (Qwerty JN), the green line is 1.6U (Qwerty JY):


  

If we ranked the center column’s corner keys from best to worst (i.e. from closest to furthest) it would be: qwerty N → T → Y → B. The absolute longest diagonals are Qwerty RB and MY (the green lines below) which are 2.66U, MH (purple) is 1.8U, RG (blue) is 1.6U:




















  

With angle mod, we add two other diagonals: Qwerty CT (the green line) which is 2.36U and CG (the blue line) which is 1.8U:


  

Lastly, there’s the pinky diagonals: Qwerty ;[ (the blue line) which is 1.25U and ;] (the green line) which is 2.02U:


  

Anyway, the bigger the distance, the higher priority not to have that sequence as a SFB in a layout.




Same finger Skipgrams (SFSs)


A SFS consists of pressing two keys with the same finger, but separated by X letters. An example would be typing may on Qwerty (M and Y are both typed with the right index).


There are two aspects to SFSs: distance, and how many keys there are of separation. For example, the aforementioned M_Y SFS is 2.66U, and it is a skip-1-gram (i.e. in between M and Y, there is only one key, A, being pressed by a different finger).


The M_Y SFS is the worst of both worlds. Firstly, our right index finger must make a huge jump to go from M to Y. Secondly, this is done almost consecutively, as there is a single letter, A, of separation. Having more keys in between, before a particular finger is needed again, is better, as it gives our finger more time to go back to its resting position (J in this case). An ideal word would be one where each finger is utilized once.


Qwerty is actually full of words that are typed with only a few fingers. For example, the word burn is typed by alternating both index fingers. In the image below, the orange line shows letters pressed by the left index. Yellow for right index:
  

	So, this word contains two SFSs. Not only that, but the B_R SFS on the left index is 2.66U, and U_N on the right index is 2.02U. Try typing it.
	Another example would be thought on Qwerty. Same color/finger pairings as above:
  

	Here, T_G is a SF skip-3-gram (i.e. there are three letters separating T and G). Therefore, that SFS will be barely noticeable, especially when compared to H_U, U_H or G_T, all of which are SF skip-1-grams.
At least they are all only 1U, though. Try typing it.
	Anyway, Qwerty performs terribly at SFSs. The benefit of optimizing SFSs is that words will be spread across more fingers. Moreover, when we do have to use a particular finger almost consecutively, the distance between the two keys will be minimal.


















Distance on a layout


For the longest time, distance used to be measured as “distance off the home row”. In other words, it was assumed that pressing keys on the home row required no movement, while pressing keys outside the home row did. However, this is a great oversimplification. Take the word refer on Qwerty for example:
  

	If you quickly type this word, you will find that pressing the second E requires no movement (despite E being on the top row) as our left middle finger is already over it. Meanwhile, even though F is on the home row, pressing it implicates moving our left index downward.
	This goes to show that, to accurately measure the distance it will take to press a key, we need to keep track of which key that finger had pressed beforehand. This does not only apply within a given word, but also to the connection between words. For example:
  

	The yellow line shows letters pressed by the right index on Qwerty. The letter N in when is followed by a space, and right after our right index has to jump over the home row to press Y. Therefore, N_Y is an inter-word (i.e. in between words) SFS, while H_N or Y_U are intra-word (i.e. within a word) SFSs.
	Modern analyzers calculate distance based on SFBs and SFSs. Naturally, since consecutive finger usage is worse than semi consecutive, the former is punished harder than the latter. For example, we could weight SFB distance by 1, SF skip-1-gram distance by 0.5, and then drop off exponentially (e.g. skip-2-grams by 0.25, skip-3-grams by 0.125, etc). Also, lateral distance (i.e. involving letters like Qwerty B, Y, H, N) can be punished harder.


Analyzers that calculate distance in this way include Genkey and Oxeylyzer. Technically, rather than distance you will find the term “finger speed”, which shows the speed at which each finger has to move to maintain a constant wpm (words per minute). The lower the speed, the better. Regardless, it can be read as “distance” or “movement”.


















How should movement be distributed across the fingers?


Let’s use Oxeylyzer to obtain the “finger speed” (i.e. distance/movement) for two layouts:
Aptv3:
w g d f b  q l u o y
r s t h k  j n e a i
x c m p v  z , . ' /
	Canary
w l y p k  z f o u '
c r s t b  x n e i a
q j v d g  m h / , .
	



	Pinky
	Ring
	Middle
	Index
	Index
	Middle
	Ring
	Pinky
	Aptv3
	0.767
	1.083
	0.775
	0.570
	0.958
	1.197
	0.787
	0.633
	Canary
	0.104
	0.481
	0.545
	1.643
	1.166
	0.968
	0.785
	0.624
	

While both layouts have a similar amount of movement, it is spread differently:


* Aptv3 aims to minimize center column use. Therefore, index finger movement is quite low, with some of that movement going to the pinky and ring fingers instead.


* On the other hand, Canary has minimal pinky movement and less ring movement, in exchange for having higher index movement and more center column use.


When looking at decently optimized layouts, no particular approach is superior. It is subjective. However, if a layout is designed poorly, then some fingers can end up having too much movement. As a matter of fact, this is the case for Qwerty.


Weights for each finger


On analyzers like Genkey and Oxeylyzer, distance is weighted based on each finger's strength/dexterity level. The following are the default weights on Oxeylyzer:


Index:  5.5
Middle: 4.8
Ring:   3.6
Pinky:  1.4


Oxeylyzer has yet to add the ability of customizing these weights. Still, the idea would be to use your preferred ones, to incentivize the analyzer to output layouts that align with your preferences. For example, with the weights above, the analyzer would generate layouts with minimal pinky movement (as the pinky weight is very low).

The following would be Qwerty’s distance/movement using Oxeylyzer with default weights:

	0.369
	9.580
	5.814
	6.466
	0.792
	2.870
	0.040
	There are three fingers that have extremely high movement on Qwerty:


* The left middle’s high distance is explained by the common ED and DE SFB/SFSs, and even more so by EC and CE (these last two are 2U SFBs/SFSs).


* On the left index, the letter R causes lots of SFBs: TR, RT, FR, also GR (1.6U) and BR (2.66U). There are plenty of SFSs as well: TR, FR, RT, BT and VR (the last two are 2U).


* The right index does poorly at distance, as all its SFBs are 2U or more: UN, NY, UM, MU and MY. As for SFSs, the main ones are MN, HN and YU, all of which are 1U. However, there are 2U SFSs as well: UH, UN and NY.


* Also, the right ring is poor, as it has the common LO and OL (1U) SFBs and SFSs.


As we can see, Qwerty was not optimized with SFB and SFS distance in mind. As a reference, a modern layout actually optimized for this could be Sturdy (angle modded):


v m l c p  x f o u j
s t r d y  . n a e i
 k q g w z  b h ' ; ,


Total: 5.397
	

	Left hand: 2.488
	Right hand: 2.909
	Pinky
	Ring
	Middle
	Index
	Index
	Middle
	Ring
	Pinky
	0.271
	0.508
	0.364
	1.345
	1.137
	0.590
	0.792
	0.390
	There are other modern layouts we could show instead. The point is that Qwerty’s high movement in all the highlighted fingers can be massively reduced. Note how much lower the total distance is (!!), and how movement is better distributed across both hands.
Examples of bad words on Qwerty


In the following sections we list words that are tricky to type, as they involve Qwerty’s problematic fingers: left middle, left index, right index (and to a lesser extent right ring).


For a given word example, colored lines will indicate the keys pressed by each finger. This aims to accomplish two things. Firstly, it allows us to easily visualize SFBs and SFSs, to ensure the concept is understood well. Secondly, it makes Qwerty’s flaws very apparent.


For example, take the word decided on Qwerty:
  

	A single colored line points to most of the letters, indicating they are all pressed by the same finger. So, this would be a heavy SFB word.
	Now take the word amendment instead:
  

	Here there are two lines, for two fingers. Furthermore, we can see there is always a one letter gap before a finger is utilized again, indicating SFSs. So, this would be a heavy SFS word.
	The color code for the different fingers is as follows:
  

	- Yellow indicates keys pressed by the right index finger. So, in this example NUM would be a SF trigram (NU being 2U and UM 2.1U).
- Orange for the left index finger. So, B_R is a 2.66U SFS.
- Green for the left middle finger. E_E is a SFS followed by a SFB (ED).
- Blue for the right ring finger (does not appear in this example).
- Grey for the remaining fingers
	Note that if a finger only presses a single letter in a word, no line is shown, as SFB and SFS distance for that finger would be zero. Furthermore, there won’t be a line either for SFSs bigger than a skip-3-gram, as they are not really relevant.






















Heavy SFS words on Qwerty


Note: SFSs that involve pressing the same key twice require no movement, as our finger is already over said letter after the first press. An example of such a SFS would be E_E.


* Words typed mostly by alternating two fingers:

Section 8: Inward rolls optimization


Note: Inward rolls go towards your index finger, while outward rolls go towards the pinky. The in-roll ratio tells us how much a layout favors the former over the later.


Before going deeper into this subject, it should be noted that whether inward rotation should be taken into account or not for layout design is subjective. It’s up to you, really.


The other thing to keep in mind is that prioritizing inward rotation will force us to arrange the letters a certain way. So, it will act as a constraint, preventing us from fully optimizing some aspects of layouts (SFBs for example).


In-roll layouts basics


As mentioned in the English data section, consonant + vowel bigrams amount to 71.686% of bigrams. Turns out, we can split this subgroup exactly in half:
* consonant → vowel bigrams (e.g. NE) amount to 35.537%
* vowel → consonant bigrams (e.g. EN) amount to 36.149%


In other words, as a whole, consonants roll in both directions about equally! However, in-roll layouts must only place on the vowel side the few consonants that actually roll (mostly) in one direction. The rest of the consonants, since they roll in both directions, should be kept away from the vowels.


So, now we have a good idea of how inward rotation layouts will look like. On one hand we will have the vowels plus very specific consonants, while all other consonants will be on the opposite hand.


In the following sections, first we look at how to arrange the vowels to maximize inward rolls, and then we will do the same for the consonants. Lastly, we put those two together to find out which are the main in-roll layout arrangements.














How to arrange the vowels for in-rolls


The first option would be AU + EO + IY columns. For example, take Balance 12:


  



These columns must be placed on index, middle and ring respectively, in order to make the OU, IO, EA, IE and IA bigrams inward. Therefore, consonants on the vowel side (in this case H) must go pinky. So, this vowel arrangement is ideal for consonants that roll as consonant → vowel since, by placing them on pinky, their bigrams will be inward.


The AU column goes on index, because it must be closer to the inside of the keyboard than the EO column. Otherwise, the OU and EA bigrams would turn into outward rolls.


Furthermore, moving the whole vowel block an unit to the right (i.e to middle, ring and pinky) is not a good option either, as that would put the EO column (with 20% use!) on ring.


The other option would be EU + AO + IY columns. For example, take APTv3:


  



By placing these columns on middle, ring and pinky respectively, we leave the index free for consonants (N/L in this case). So, this vowel arrangement is ideal for consonants that roll as vowel → consonant since, by placing them on index, their bigrams will be inward.


This arrangement has two key differences compared to the previous one. First, it does not require a vowel column to go on index. Second, while it does lose a bit of inward rotation (either the OU or EA bigrams will be outward) it allows for more flexibility.


We can either leave the vowel block exactly as in the pic, in which case the OU bigram will be inward and the EA bigram will be outward. Or we could swap the EU and AO columns, which would reverse this. One last variation with this vowel block is that the letter Y may appear on index (rather than on an IY column) depending on the layout.
How to arrange the consonants for in-rolls


To find out we will use the two tables below. The table on the left shows the direction each consonant favors when combining with vowels (consonant → vowel vs vowel → consonant). For example, B → vowels amount to 1.209% of bigrams.


Meanwhile, the table on the right shows the direction each consonant favors when combining with the rest of the consonants (consonant → rest vs rest → consonant).
For example, B → consonants amount to 0.634% of bigrams.

	As expected, most consonants do not heavily favor one direction over the other on either table. However, there are two outliers: H and N. These two are the letters that, depending on where we place them, will have the most effect on inward rolls.
As seen on the tables above, H and N roll as follows:
H → vowel
	consonant → H
	vowel → N
	N → consonant
	

With this information, we can establish the optimal location for H and N (in regards to in-rolls). This will vary depending if we have H/N on the vowel or the consonant sides.


On the vowel hand, we want H on pinky to make the HE, HA, HI, HO bigrams inward. 
However, we would want N on index to make the IN, AN, ON, EN bigrams inward.


Naturally, H is paired with the AU + EO + IY vowel block as that block frees the pinky (to put H there) whereas N is paired with the EU + AO + IY vowel block as this block frees the index finger instead.


On the consonant hand, N and H swap locations. Thus, H would go on index to ensure the TH, CH, WH, SH, GH bigrams are inward, while N would go on pinky (sometimes ring) for the ND, NT, NG, NS, NC bigrams.


As for other consonants, T would appear right before H to make the TH bigram inward. Similarly, S would come before T so that the ST bigram is inward as well. Other consonant bigrams we would want as inward if possible are PR, CT, TR, RS, PL, LD…






































Layout arrangements for in-rolls


Combining what we have learned in the vowels and consonant sections, the following would be the notable arrangements for in-roll layouts:


* NRST + AEIH home row. H is with the vowels and N with consonants (both on pinky). This arrangement has by far the highest inward rotation. Swapping the R and S columns wouldn’t lose much in-rolls, as only the RS bigram would turn outward.


* RSTH + NEAI home row. N is with the vowels and H with consonants (both on index). Swapping the E and A columns would make the OU brigram outward, but the EA bigram inward.


By placing N on one hand and H on the other, the two arrangements above ensure in-rolls are evenly split across hands. So, N/H + vowels are balanced in that sense.


However, placing both N and H on the same hand, as in the arrangements below, would heavily skew the balance in favor of the consonant hand. The issue is that we would no longer have a letter which rolls in a single direction (H or N) to place on the vowel side.


Therefore, the consonants we pair with the vowels would cause a similar amount of inward and outward rolls, which would cancel each other. At that point, the one thing helping the in-roll ratio on the vowel side would be just the vowel + vowel bigrams. Anyway:


* RNTH + SEAI home row. Both N and H now appear on the consonant hand (the former on ring, and the later on index).


R/N are swapped compared to the arrangement at the top. The difference is that on NRST, the letter L had to go on a LR column. However, here we have H on index, meaning L can go there instead. This relegates R to a WR column, ideal for pinky.


* SNTH + _EAI home row. The blank is for a not too common letter (e.g. C). Since there is no room for the letter R on the home row, it will go on a RN column. Naturally, such a column is better placed on ring, rather than pinky.


We could have AEI_ on the vowel side instead. However, this would mean moving keys we hand on index to the pinky, which would lead to high pinky movement.


* NSTH + AEI_ home row. The blank can be for C or similar. This time R ends up on a LHR column on index (not the best). An alternative is moving R with the vowels to make REAI, although doing this would noticeably decrease alternation.


Section 9: high roll - low redirect optimization


Note: A roll is pressing 2 keys with one hand, and 1 with the other (e.g. DF on qwerty).
A redirect is a one-handed trigram in which the direction changes (e.g. DFS on qwerty).


Generally, rolls are considered the most comfortable hand sequence, while redirects are seen as worse. So, a desirable aspect in layouts is having high rolls, yet low redirects.


The issue is that increasing the former will do the same to the later. Having said that, while a certain amount of redirects is unavoidable, we can greatly minimize them by designing the layout adequately.


Similarly to in-roll layouts, optimizing for high roll/low redirect will force us to arrange the letters a certain way. Over the following sections we will learn what those arrangements are, and give layout examples for each.


Keep in mind that a layout doing better at rolls/redirects doesn’t necessarily make it a better layout, as there are other things to consider (how movement is spread across the fingers, etc…). At the end of the day, it’s subjective.










































Basics


The first rule for minimizing redirects is having all vowels on the same hand. This is because vowels on one side ensures alternation, which minimizes redirects.


Next we need to determine which common consonants can go on the vowel side without causing many redirects. We want consonants that roll in one direction with the vowels, as that too will minimize redirects. After all, redirects are a change in direction.


The table below shows us how much each of the following consonants favor one direction: consonant → vowel vs vowel → consonant. We want letters that score high on one column (i.e. one direction), but low on the other.




	c→v
	v→c
	h
	5.322
	0.064
	n
	1.921
	8.025
	r
	4.123
	5.258
	s
	2.409
	4.083
	t
	4.374
	3.87
	

We can see H only rolls in one direction (H → vowel). In fact, it favors that direction 83 to 1! Therefore, on high roll/low redirect layouts, H will always be with the vowels.


Now, H by itself won’t give us enough rolling (H + vowels ~ 5.5% of bigrams). In order to increase rolling further, we must add a few more consonants to the vowel side.


The following table shows which letters can be paired with H while causing less than 0.1% SFB (X, J, Q and Z are excluded). For example, H + N = 0.037% SFB:


h + v
	0.0
	h + f
	0.002
	h + k
	0.003
	h + b
	0.005
	h + d
	0.008
	

	

h + m
	0.013
	h + l
	0.014
	h + n
	0.037
	h + y
	0.051
	h + p
	0.095
	

	The letters highlighted are the ones we will see sharing an index finger with H on high roll/low redirect layouts. For example, a NHFB index on the vowel side. The pairings to avoid are: LY (0.44% sfb), PL (0.282%), MP (0.255%), BL (0.24%) and BY (0.181%).


Note: If you don’t care about space thumb optimization, you can skip to the “Roll/redirect ratio” section and continue from there.
Taking the space thumb into account for layout stats


It turns out which thumb is used for space has a significant effect on the alternate, roll, onehand and redirect stats. However, this is a relatively new observation, and most layouts have not been specifically designed with the space key in mind.


To understand this phenomenon we will use a list of all the trigrams that include space, sorted by frequency. The list will include trigrams starting with space (e.g. [ th]), with space in the middle (e.g. [e t]), or ending with space (e.g. [he ]).


Here’s the full list, made using the MonkeyType quotes corpus. Regardless, you don’t really need to check it. The following are the top 30 space trigrams. The number next to each trigram indicates its frequency in percent (e.g. [ th] amounts to 1.780% of all trigrams):


1-10
	[ th]
	1.780
	[he ]
	1.028
	[nd ]

	* data taken as of October 3rd 2022. The MonkeyType corpus is constantly being updated.


It shouldn’t be surprising that space trigrams are very frequent, as space is easily the most common character. In fact, trigrams involving space amount to about half of all trigrams (55.6% on the MonkeyType quotes corpus to be exact).


For this reason, layout stats will be wildly different depending if we account for space or not. When sharing stats for keyboard layouts, people usually give the stats disregarding space. Otherwise, the stats should be given twice (for right vs left thumb).
How rolls and redirects involving space work


Rolls with or without space are fundamentally different. A sequence that is a roll when disregarding space, may not be a roll anymore one space is included. Take APTv3:


  



Without space, the TH bigram is a roll. However, if we use left thumb space for analysis, typing space → TH would be a redirect instead! (space → T is outward, T → H is inward).


We could make space → TH a roll, by using the right thumb for space. However, using the thumb on the vowel side typically reduces rolls, as it leads to a lot of space trigrams being alternates or redirects instead. This can be seen on APTv3’s stats:


Left thumb space
	Rolls
	53.51%
	Alternates
	23.31%
	Onehands
	2.94%
	Redirects
	8.39%
	

	

Right thumb space
	Rolls
	44.03%
	Alternates
	30.49%
	Onehands
	4.84%
	Redirects
	8.79%
	

	Additionally, on APTv3 we can't get the redirects down regardless of the thumb. This is partly because the consonant thumb makes space → TH (by far the most common space trigram) a redirect, while the vowel thumb is no good as already mentioned.


The takeaway here is that we want the consonant thumb for space, but without space → TH being a redirect. For that we would place space + T on one hand (2 key roll), and H on the other. This is yet another reason for why H will be with the vowels on high roll/low redirect layouts.


Alternatively, if T and H are on the same hand, we can avoid space → TH being a redirect by making the TH bigram an outward roll. For example, placing T on index and H on middle. That way space → T→ H would be a one-handed trigram in the same direction.


Note: The stats for left vs right thumb were taken using the a200 analyzer.
Example of analyzing space trigrams in a layout


The layouts that have the biggest variance on the stats depending on which thumb is being used for space are NH + vowel layouts. For example, Canary (angle modded):
  



Let's go through the top 30 trigrams that include space, and see how they would be typed on Canary depending if we use the consonant or the vowel thumb for space:

	We can see that the space thumb makes a way bigger difference than we could have imagined. With the consonant thumb we get mostly rolls. Meanwhile, rolls plummet with the vowel thumb, as we get way more alternates and redirects instead:


Left thumb space
	Rolls
	58.17%
	Alternates
	20.79%
	Onehands
	2.74%
	Redirects
	5.34%
	

	

Right thumb space
	Rolls
	41.51%
	Alternates
	29.89%
	Onehands
	5.71%
	Redirects
	9.92%
	

	a200 analyzer


As a rule of thumb (;p), using space on the consonant side will lead to way higher rolls. However, this does not mean one shouldn’t check. To see the thumb stats for a given layout, we can use the a200 analyzer.


Hand balance and space


Generally, the vowel hand tends to have a bit higher use than the consonant hand. This is because vowel + punctuation already add up to around 40% use. Then adding a few consonants on top can easily make it 55% or even higher.


A good example is the layout in the previous section. Disregarding space, the hand split on Canary would be around 42% - 58% (for the left and right hand, respectively). Since the space key has around 18.5% use, to get the hand split for a particular thumb, we would add 9.25% use to the thumb hand, and subtract 9.25% from the other hand. Doing that, Canary has a 33-67 split with right thumb space, and 51-49 with left thumb.


Canary is an extreme example, but most layouts do indeed have higher use on the vowel hand. So, typing space with that same hand will make the hand split more unbalanced. Using the consonant thumb for space instead helps with balance.


Keeping your current space thumb


Many layouts have their vowels on the right hand in order to keep punctuation near the QWERTY positions (punctuation usually goes with the vowels, to avoid SFBs). With vowels on the right, the left thumb would be the “ideal” one for space.


Now, most people don’t want to change the thumb they have always used for space. For example, if someone wants to learn a layout where the left thumb is optimal but they already use their right thumb for space, they are unlikely to change it.


A workaround is choosing a layout that has the vowels opposite to your current space thumb. This way you will already be using the “ideal” thumb. Alternatively, you could mirror the layout (swap the vowel and consonant hands) to achieve that same effect.


Regardless, choosing a layout based on space is a rather unreasonable proposition. So, if the thumb you have always used happens to be the “correct” one for the layout you want to learn, that’s great. If not, this aspect of layout design is often just ignored.
Roll/redirect ratio


This refers to how many rolls per redirect there are in a layout.  For example, if a layout has 48% rolls and 6% redirects, the ratio would be 48/6 = 8.


Technically, low rolling layouts (least redirects) would have the highest ratio, as the divisor would be smaller. However, we are interested in layouts that have both high rolls and a high roll/redirect ratio on top of that, rather than layouts that do good in ratio alone.


Colemak DH


This is the mainstream rolling layout. In the following sections, we will see layouts that optimize rolls/redirects further than Colemak DH (angle modded). Still, since there is a lot more to layouts other than rolls/redirects, liking any of the following layouts over Colemak DH or not is subjective.


Note: Pressing space with the thumb opposite to the vowels is beneficial for rolls. This is why left thumb space stats are given. Regardless, non thumb stats are given as well.

	High roll - low redirects arrangements


The amount of rolls and redirects on a layout mainly depends on which consonants we place on the vowel hand’s index finger.


After that, the next thing affecting redirects is the arrangement on the consonant side. Still, since the consonant hand has a lesser impact on redirects, we will be able to arrange it in multiple ways depending on our preference.


So, to classify high roll/low redirect layouts we will do the following: First we will specify a vowel hand, and then we will look at the different consonant hands we can pair it with.


We will mainly look into FNH + vowels layouts. These are generally considered to have comfortable finger patterns, on top of good rolls with only moderate redirects. They offer multiple consonant arrangements to choose from (CRST, STRD, SRTD, SRTC) all of which have minimal scissors (i.e. an uncomfortable bigram where one key is pressed on the bottom row and the other on the home row, like Qwerty XQ or CR). One drawback of these layouts is that the vowel hand (usually the right one) will have higher use.


Technically, there is another set of high roll - low redirect arrangements, that being FMH + vowels layouts. However, this latter group is much less popular than the earlier one.






































FNH + vowels


There are two aspects that affect how we arrange the letters we have on an index finger. Firstly, we aim to minimize the movement (i.e. SFB + SFS distance) on the index. Secondly, we also need to account for how the index letters interact with those on the middle finger, as we want to avoid middle - index bigrams being lateral stretches or scissor.


Each column on the table below shows a setup for the vowel hand’s index finger (e.g. FNHM column 1). Each row shows a home row for the consonant hand (e.g CRST row 1).

	* * * * *  * * o u .
* * * * *  * * a e i
 * * * * *  * * ' ; ,
	The letters on the vowel hand’s index finger that change from one variation to another appear in red (m, b, p, y). Placing m with vowels increases rolls (but also redirects) the most, b gives less rolls with fewer redirects, p and y increase alternation.


Which consonant home row to use is a matter of preference. The most obvious difference between them is that they will spread effort differently across the fingers. For example, if we ranked the index finger use it would be: CRST > STRD = SRTD > SRTC.
Note: Pressing space with the thumb opposite to the vowels is beneficial for rolls.

FMH + vowels


Most people heavily favor the FNH + vowels setup over this one. You can consider FMH + vowels to be a proof of concept. Anyway, we have three consonant home rows: NRTS, RNTS and STND. They are all intended for angle mod:
Fire like
p l d g v  z f * * *
n r t s y  j h * * *
 x k c w q  b m * * *
	Flame like
x p d w v  q f * * *
r n t s g  j l * * *
 b k c y z  m h * * *
	Flare like
v b r c p  z f * * *
s t n d y  j l * * *
 k x g w q  m h * * *
	The asterisks are for the vowel (+ punctuation) setup of your choice. For example:
* * * * *  * * o u '
* * * * *  * * e i a
 * * * * *  * * " , .
	* * * * *  * * o u .
* * * * *  * * a e i
 * * * * *  * * ' ; ,
	The letters on the vowel hand’s index that change from one variation to another appear in red (l, b). Placing l with the vowels maximizes rolls (but increases redirects as well), while b results in less rolls but noticeably lower redirects.


The reason these layouts are not popular is that, despite having a fantastic roll/redirect ratio (Fire has a 12.4 ratio!) they require awkward index arrangements. You don’t need to know the details but, if you want to, it’s explained below.


Take the left index on either Fire or Flame. If the letter Y wasn’t there it would have been fine, but with C, Y, W and G all on the S column, around half of the SFBs in the layout end up on the left index finger (SC, SY, SW, SG) leading to high movement on that finger.


Furthermore, minimizing movement on the right index on either Flame or Flare leads to giving the letter L the home row spot over H, as all the SFBs on that index involve L (FL 0.07%, LF 0.05%, LM 0.02%). By surrounding L with the other letters, we reduce the distance between them and L. However, this is problematic as it places H off the home row.
















Section 10: Vowels and punctuation
Vowel columns


Vowels can’t share a column with most consonants, as that would lead to high SFB. A common practice is to place two vowels on the same column, as there are multiple vowel combinations with very low SFB.


The table below lists all vowel columns and gives the SFB% for each (keep in mind low frequency is what we want). The 5 viable ones are highlighted. Additionally, since Y and W are semivowels, they are shown as well:


a + o
	0.062
	e + o
	0.112
	i + u
	0.118
	e + u
	0.178
	a + u
	0.255
	e + i
	0.568
	a + i
	0.602
	e + a
	0.7
	o + u
	0.881
	o + i
	0.923
	

	

u + y
	0.006
	i + y
	0.029
	o + y
	0.186
	a + y
	0.233
	e + y
	0.237
	

	

u + w
	0.001
	y + w
	0.005
	i + w
	0.375
	a + w
	0.445
	e + w
	0.478
	

	Generally, there will be multiple vowel columns on a given layout. Over the next few sections we will look at the popular column combinations and the reasoning behind them. Identifying what vowel columns you prefer can help in choosing a layout.


The letter Y


Something I want to highlight, as it is relevant for the next sections, is that the letter Y appears almost exclusively on two locations on keyboard layouts: on a IY column on either the ring or pinky finger, or on an index finger coupled with moderately common letters.


au + eo + iy


For example, take Hyperroll:


  



Finger load: AU (+ punctuation) ~14%, EO ~20%, IY ~9%


The point of this vowel arrangement is to maximize inward rotation. In other words, rolling your fingers from the outside of the keyboard to the inside (e.g. “sdf” on qwerty).


This arrangement is rigid in the sense that each column has to go on that specific finger. The EO column must be placed on your strongest and longest finger (i.e. the middle finger) as that column has around 20% use and requires you to often reach the top row for O.


The AU column must be placed closer to the inside of the keyboard than EO, which necessarily means putting it on the index finger. This is done so that EA bigram (on home row) and the OU bigram (on top row) are both inward rolls.


Lastly, putting the IY column on the ring finger (pinky works too) guarantees that the IO, IE, and IA bigrams are inward rolls. Notice that the word YOU is an inward roll as well.


Anyway, layouts that share this vowel arrangement were optimized for inward rotation. Examples: CTGAP 3.0, engram, Oneproduct, Balance 12, Hieamtsrn, Beakl 19 bis, Mtgap, NSTR, Hyperroll and Hands Up.
























Placing consonants on index


The index fingers play a key role on keyboard layouts, as they are assigned six keys each (rather than 3). If you want to minimize SFBs (and specifically SFSs) it is ideal to reserve them for putting consonants there, as there are many useful six-consonant combinations.


Thing is, we can’t really take advantage of this if we have an AU column on the index finger. The moment you have vowels on an index, you can only complete the finger with punctuation (period, comma) and rare letters.


The solution would be utilizing different vowel columns, ones that allow us to free the index finger for consonants. You can find examples of this below. Still, keep in mind that if you want to maximize inward rotation, then au + eo + iy is the way to go.
eo + iu + a


For example, take Trendei:


  



Finger load: EO ~20%, IU (+ comma)  ~11%, A (+ period) ~9%


This arrangement maintains the EO column on the middle finger, but changes the AU column (0.255 SFB%) for an IU column (0.118 SFB%). Furthermore, since IU goes on ring, the index finger is now free to place consonants there, which helps further reduce SFB/SFS.


The downside is that some of the bigrams that were inwards rolls before like OU or EA, are now outward rolls. Basically, we are trading outwards rolls in favor of reducing SFBs.


Examples: ARTS, Nerps, CTGAP, Nerts, Sertain, Dvarf, Trendei and Dwarf.














eu + ao + iy


For example, take APTv3:


  



Finger load: EU ~15%-, AO ~15%, IY ~9%


An EU column and AO column are best at minimizing same finger skipgrams (SFS). This refers to having to press two keys with the same finger, but with a letter in between. Let’s look at an example.


With these columns, since E and O are on different fingers, typing “before” would not involve SFS. However, if we were using an EO column instead, soon after pressing E we would have to move our middle finger up to O, and then back to E again. While that’s an extreme example, those are the type of sequences EU and AO keep to a minimum.


The one potential issue with EU/AO is that one of them usually goes on the ring finger, which means said finger will have around 15% use. That’s above average when compared to layouts with a more traditional finger spread (e.g. colemak).


Examples: Roll, APTv3, Octa8, Semimak, Phonkie






























ao + eu + i


For example, take Whorf:


  



Finger load: AO ~15%, EU ~15%, I (+ punctuation) ~10%


This arrangement is a variation of the previous one. Since an AO column requires commonly reaching to the top row for O, some people may prefer having it on the middle finger (rather than having EU there).


Generally, this change is coupled with moving Y to the index finger. This second tweak makes room for punctuation on the pinky and ensures the word YOU continues to be a three key roll just as it was on the previous arrangement (only that now it goes outwards).


Examples: Pine, Flaw, Optimal trigram, Trendy, Whorf


This vowel block can also sometimes appear on the ring, middle and index fingers. For example, take Uciea (note that the one below mirrors the original layout):


  



Finger load: AO (+ punctuation) ~18%, EU ~15%, IY ~9%


On one hand, this variation has the apparent advantage of having a lower load on the ring finger (as neither EU or AO go there anymore). On the other hand, consonants can’t go on index anymore, as AO + punctuation goes there instead.


Examples: Uciea, dvormax, Optimal digram, ADNW english bigram






Summary on vowel options


* For max inward rotation: au + eo + iy
* For lower SFB (and if you like EO): eo + iu + a
* For lower SFS (or if you don’t like EO): eu + ao + iy
* If you prefer AO on middle finger (or don’t like IY): ao + eu + i


Note: If you plan on sometimes using your layout for languages other than English, you should check how each vowel column performs in your language.


For example, while an EU column does well in English it does terrible in Spanish or French (it adds over 1% SFB). To verify how a layout performs in different languages you can use the colemak mods analyzer. If you scroll to the bottom of that page, you can change the corpus to that of another language).
























































Frequency of the last letter within a word (punctuation SFBs)


The following table shows how common each character is as an ending letter, and sorts them from most to least frequent (e.g. E’s frequency as an ending letter is 20.134%):


1-10

	Since punctuation (period and comma) always comes at the end of a word, we can ensure punctuation does not cause SFBs by placing it on the same column as rare ending letters.


Punctuation usually goes with the vowels. This is the result of a process of elimination:  vowels can’t really share their column with consonants (high SFB), which leaves us with punctuation and other vowels to complete the column.


We can see placing punctuation on the same finger as E would lead to SFBs, as E is the most common ending letter. The letter U usually appears on the same column as E, A, I, rather than having its own separate column, as U only has around 3% frequency.


The ideal location for punctuation would be with I. If I is not sharing its column with anything, then we could make a period + I + comma column. If we have a IU column (usually on ring), then we can add comma or period there as well. However, if we have a IY column, then we can not place punctuation there, as Y → punctuation would be a 2U SFB.


The next best place for punctuation would be with A. Again, if A is not sharing its column, then we could make a period + A + comma column. If we have an AU column on an index finger (which has access to six keys) we can also place both period and comma there. An AO column can work as well.
Section 11: The layout list
How were the stats obtained?


The heatmap, finger frequency percents and SFB percent were obtained using the colemak mods analyzer, while the rolls, alternates, onehands, redirects, and SFS percent were obtained using the genkey analyzer.


How to use the colemak mods analyzer


Open the analyzer in your internet browser. Assuming you follow the traditional finger technique, the first step would be selecting the Traditional setting in Configuration.


Now click on Edit, the following window will open:


  



In that box you should paste a layout in text format. You can find the text you need in each layout’s section in this document. As we are only concerned with the letters and basic punctuation, the number row is omitted.


Finally press Save → Analyze.




















Focus on individual stats, not an overall score


While individual stats are objective, aggregating those stats into an overall score is subjective, as the scoring model will inevitably have to value some things over others.


In fact, if we sorted all the layouts in this document by the score they get on the colemak mods analyzer, and then we did the same with the genkey analyzer score, we would get two completely different lists.


Therefore, I will be omitting the overall scores, as we shouldn’t put too much weight into them. Instead, we will look at a layout’s stats to get a picture of how said layout would feel.


The layouts are NOT ranked by SFB, only sorted


The layouts are sorted by SFB%* (from higher to lower) simply to make the list easier to use


For example, let’s say you want to look at layouts below 1.5% SFB. All you would have to do is go to that point on the list, and compare the layouts below that threshold. To compare the layouts use all the stats that are given (and that Section 2 explains how to interpret) rather than just the SFB%.


In regards to how low SFB% should be, that’s up to you. Generally, above 2% is considered a bit high, while closer to 1% would be ideal (although not necessary). There’s layouts that go even below 1%.


* SFB% refers to how often you have to press two keys in succession with the same finger.




















The SFB number is given with and without punctuation


Multiple layouts perform really well on SFB when excluding punctuation, but do worse once punctuation is included. To highlight this, I will be giving the SFB% for each layout in the following format:


SFB  =  1.759%  |  0.952%


The first number is the SFB% for the default corpus in the colemak mods analyzer, while the second is the SFB% for the norvig corpus. The main difference between the two is that the first includes punctuation, while the second does not.


Ideally, there should be a small difference between the two (some discrepancy is expected, as the corpus is different). However, if a layout has significantly lower SFB% without punctuation (i.e. the second number), that tells us punctuation is an issue on that layout.


If you want to change the default corpus in the colemak mods analyzer, just scroll to the bottom of the page and you will see the option.


A note about layouts that give quotation marks (") its own key


Let’s say we try to run the following layout through the Colemak mods analyzer:


b y o u '  " l d w v z
c i e a ,  . h t s n q
g x j k -  ? r m f p


That would result in the following error: “Symbol " has duplicate mapping”.


This happens because, by default, shifted apostrophe is already quotation marks. To avoid getting the error, we can simply place a symbol like \ right next to apostrophe (e.g. '\) so that shifted apostrophe is no longer ". Like this:


b y o u '\  " l d w v z
c i e a ,  . h t s n q
g x j k -  ? r m f p


Now the layout will run properly.

06/05/2022 - Added Colemak-DHv.


19/05/2022 - Added Hands Down Neu. Also, until now there used to be a few layouts in the doc that included shifted characters. In order to avoid issues with analyzers that may not support them, shifted characters have been removed.


24/08/2022 - As requested by the creator, CTGAP 2.0, CTGAP 3.0 and CTGAP 4.0 were removed.  The final version (simply referred to as CTGAP) was added in their place.


13/10/2022 - Fixed Niro and Soul, as they were incorrect. Additionally, updated the following layouts to their angle modded versions: Niro, Soul, Colemak DH, Colemak Qi, Octa8, Nerps, ColemaQ-f, Snug, Nerts, ColemaQ, Colemak Qi;x, Sertain, ISRT, Trendei.


14/10/2022 - Added Canary, Megamak, Sturdy, Rollla, Ints and Seht Drai.


17/10/2022 - Added SFB% thresholds to make the layout list easier to navigate. Anything below 1.5% SFB is probably fine. Still, how low SFBs should be is subjective.


As a reminder, the SFB numbers are given in the following format:
SFB: 1.645% | 1.065%
With the first number including punctuation, and the second one excluding it.


18/10/2022 - Added Fire, Flame, Flare, Blaze and Rhea.

Below 1.5% SFB


Once you get to this threshold the SFBs are probably fine. Of course, we can go lower, but at that point it’s mostly preference. How low SFBs should be is subjective.


Note that the SFB% for many layouts drops significantly if we exclude punctuation. For example, the following are the SFB numbers for Colemak (a couple pages above):


SFB: 1.645% | 1.065%


The first number is for a corpus that includes punctuation, while the second corpus does not. So, Colemak drops to the 1% range once punctuation is excluded. The same applies to many of the layouts below.

The purpose of FMHL + vowel layouts is maximizing rolls while minimizing redirects. They are mostly a proof of concept. Instead, FNH + vowel layouts are recommended, as they do well at roll/redirects, while having more natural arrangements on the indexes. You can find more info on this subject in the following section.

The IY AO EU vowel block is ideal for SFSs optimization. However, it normally leads to punctuation causing SFBs. To avoid that, all punctuation has been placed on a C pinky.


Usually, having high index finger use and minimizing SFSs are mutually exclusive, but Rollly manages to do both (relevant if you favor index use being on the higher side). The layout does NH + vowels as that gives good rolls + onehands, without too many redirects. Having said that, the drawback is that hand balance is uneven.


There is an alternate version of the layout. The color green indicates the letters or symbols that retain the same spot in both. Meanwhile, red is used for the letters that change:

This layout combines Isrt and Colemak Qi;x. In green we show the keys taken from Isrt and in pink the ones taken from Colemak Qi;x. All three layouts are angle modded:
Isrt (Whorf)
y c l m k  z f u , '
i s r t g  p n e a o
 v w d j q  b h / . x
	Irst (Ec0vid)
y l c m k  z f u , '

 x w d v j  p h " . q
	Colemak Qi;x (Nyfee)
; l c m k  j f u y q
a r s t g  p n e i o '
 x w d v z  b h / . ,
	Compared to Isrt, the main change done in Irst (as the name suggests) is swapping the S and R columns. The reasoning for the change is that the LRW column on the original has high movement (i.e. SFB + SFS distance).  The other minor changes are swapping B and P (in order to reduce the distance of the PH SFB) and placing Q (rather than X) with O.


The drawback is that the LY and RY rolls are now ring → pinky. However, the mod does noticeably reduce the pinky → ring → pinky and ring → pinky → ring trills (i.e. redirects).

The quotation marks symbol (") is moved to the middle finger (rather than being shifted apostrophe) in order to avoid the end of a quote (. → shift → ") being a 2U pinky SFS.


When typing the CH bigram on a standard keyboard, I suggest pressing H with the ring finger, rather than with the middle finger. This way we eliminate the main lateral stretch in the layout. Typing CH this way won’t cause secondary SFBs, as CH is never followed by either L or R (only ~10 such words in the top 10k words). Note that on MonkeyType quotes and TypeRacer, the WH bigram is noticeably more common than CH.

Note that Flow only has the XT SFB because on ANSI angle mod there is no room for the letter X on the left pinky. However, either on ISO angle mod or on a matrix keyboard, since we have 3 left pinky keys (rather than 2) we can now place X back on pinky:

	If you favor bottom row pinky over top row pinky, like I do, then we now have the option of placing V on the bottom row. Doing this also prevents the XP bigram from being a scissor.

This last one is an experimental layout, not really meant to be used. Its purpose was simply to calculate the lowest SFB% for the default corpus on the colemak mods analyzer. If you used a different corpus, the lowest SFB% layout would be different..
