QWERTY (/ˈkwɜːrti/ KWUR-tee) is a keyboard layout for Latin-script alphabets. The name comes from the order of the first six keys on the top letter row of the keyboard: QWERTY. The QWERTY design is based on a layout included in the Sholes and Glidden typewriter sold via E. Remington and Sons from 1874. QWERTY became popular with the success of the Remington No. 2 of 1878 and remains in ubiquitous use.
History
Main articles: Typewriter and Sholes and Glidden typewriter
Keys are arranged on diagonal columns to give space for the levers.

The QWERTY layout was devised and created in the early 1870s by Christopher Latham Sholes, a newspaper editor and printer who lived in Kenosha, Wisconsin. In October 1867, Sholes filed a patent application for his early writing machine he developed with the assistance of his friends Carlos Glidden and Samuel W. Soulé.[1]

The first model constructed by Sholes used a piano-like keyboard with two rows of characters arranged alphabetically as shown below:[1]

- 3 5 7 9 N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
2 4 6 8 . A B C D E F G H I J K L M

Sholes struggled for the next five years to perfect his invention, making many trial-and-error rearrangements of the original machine's alphabetical key arrangement. The study of bigram (letter-pair) frequency by educator Amos Densmore, brother of the financial backer James Densmore, is believed to have influenced the array of letters, although this contribution has been called into question.[2]: 170  Others suggest instead that the letter groupings evolved from telegraph operators' feedback.[2]: 163 

In November 1868 he changed the arrangement of the latter half of the alphabet, N to Z, right-to-left.[3]: 12–20  In April 1870 he arrived at a four-row, upper case keyboard approaching the modern QWERTY standard, moving six vowel letters, A, E, I, O, U, and Y, to the upper row as follows:[3]: 24–25 

2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 -
A E I . ? Y U O ,
B C D F G H J K L M
Z X W V T S R Q P N

In 1873 Sholes's backer, James Densmore, successfully sold the manufacturing rights for the Sholes & Glidden Type-Writer to E. Remington and Sons. The keyboard layout was finalized within a few months by Remington's mechanics and was ultimately presented:[2]: 161–174 

2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 - ,
Q W E . T Y I U O P
Z S D F G H J K L M
A X & C V B N ? ; R

After they purchased the device, Remington made several adjustments, creating a keyboard with essentially the modern QWERTY layout. These adjustments included placing the "R" key in the place previously allotted to the period key. Apocryphal claims that this change was made to let salesmen impress customers by pecking out the brand name "TYPE WRITER QUOTE" from one keyboard row is not formally substantiated.[2] Vestiges of the original alphabetical layout remained in the "home row" sequence DFGHJKL.[4]

The modern ANSI layout is:

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 - =
Q W E R T Y U I O P [ ] \
A S D F G H J K L ; '
Z X C V B N M , . /

Remington 2 typewriter, 1878 - First typewriter with a shift key for upper and lower case characters

The QWERTY layout became popular with the success of the Remington No. 2 of 1878, the first typewriter to include both upper and lower case letters, using a ⇧ Shift key.

One popular but possibly apocryphal[2]: 162  explanation for the QWERTY arrangement is that it was designed to reduce the likelihood of internal clashing of typebars by placing commonly used combinations of letters farther from each other inside the machine.[5]
Differences from modern layout
Substituting characters
Christopher Latham Sholes's 1878 QWERTY keyboard layout

The QWERTY layout depicted in Sholes's 1878 patent is slightly different from the modern layout, most notably in the absence of the numerals 0 and 1, with each of the remaining numerals shifted one position to the left of their modern counterparts. The letter M is located at the end of the third row to the right of the letter L rather than on the fourth row to the right of the N, the letters X and C are reversed, and most punctuation marks are in different positions or are missing entirely.[6] 0 and 1 were omitted to simplify the design and reduce the manufacturing and maintenance costs; they were chosen specifically because they were "redundant" and could be recreated using other keys. Typists who learned on these machines learned the habit of using the uppercase letter I (or lowercase letter L) for the digit one, and the uppercase O for the zero.[7]

The 0 key was added and standardized in its modern position early in the history of the typewriter, but the 1 and exclamation point were left off some typewriter keyboards into the 1970s.[8]
Combined characters
See also: Dead keys

In early designs, some characters were produced by printing two symbols with the carriage in the same position. For instance, the exclamation point, which shares a key with the numeral 1 on post-mechanical keyboards, could be reproduced by using a three-stroke combination of an apostrophe, a backspace, and a period. A semicolon (;) was produced by printing a comma (,) over a colon (:). As the backspace key is slow in simple mechanical typewriters (the carriage was heavy and optimized to move in the opposite direction), a more professional approach was to block the carriage by pressing and holding the space bar while printing all characters that needed to be in a shared position. To make this possible, the carriage was designed to advance only after releasing the space bar.

In the era of mechanical typewriters, combined characters such as é and õ were created by the use of dead keys for the diacritics (′, ~), which did not move the paper forward. Thus the ′ and e would be printed at the same location on the paper, creating é.
Contemporaneous alternatives
Crandall 1, 1883

There were no particular technological requirements for the QWERTY layout,[2] since at the time there were ways to make a typewriter without the "up-stroke" typebar mechanism that had required it to be devised. Not only were there rival machines with "down-stroke" and "front stroke" positions that gave a visible printing point, the problem of typebar clashes could be circumvented completely: examples include Thomas Edison's 1872 electric print-wheel device which later became the basis for Teletype machines; Lucien Stephen Crandall's typewriter (the second to come onto the American market in 1883) whose type was arranged on a cylindrical sleeve; the Hammond typewriter of 1885 which used a semi-circular "type-shuttle" of hardened rubber (later light metal); and the Blickensderfer typewriter of 1893 which used a type wheel. The early Blickensderfer's "Ideal" keyboard was also non-QWERTY, instead having the sequence "DHIATENSOR" in the home row, these 10 letters being capable of composing 70% of the words in the English language.[9]
Properties

Alternating hands while typing is a desirable trait in a keyboard design. While one hand types a letter, the other hand can prepare to type the next letter, making the process faster and more efficient. In the QWERTY layout many more words can be spelled using only the left hand than the right hand. Thousands of English words can be spelled using only the left hand, while only a couple of hundred words can be typed using only the right hand[10] (the three most frequent letters in the English language, ETA, are all typed with the left hand). In addition, more typing strokes are done with the left hand in the QWERTY layout. This is helpful for left-handed people but disadvantageous for right-handed people.

Contrary to popular belief, the QWERTY layout was not designed to slow the typist down,[2]: 162  but rather to speed up typing. Indeed, there is evidence that, aside from the issue of jamming, placing often-used keys farther apart increases typing speed, because it encourages alternation between the hands.[11] (On the other hand, in the German keyboard the Z has been moved between the T and the U to help type the frequent digraphs TZ and ZU in that language.) Almost every word in the English language contains at least one vowel letter, but on the QWERTY keyboard only the vowel letter A is on the home row, which requires the typist's fingers to leave the home row for most words.

A feature much less commented on than the order of the keys is that the keys do not form a rectangular grid, but rather each column slants diagonally. This is because of the mechanical linkages – each key is attached to a lever, and hence the offset prevents the levers from running into each other – and has been retained in most electronic keyboards. Some keyboards, such as the Kinesis or TypeMatrix, retain the QWERTY layout but arrange the keys in vertical columns, to reduce unnecessary lateral finger motion.[12][13]
Computer keyboards
A QWERTY keyboard layout variant that is used in the US. Some countries, such as the UK and Canada, use a slightly different QWERTY (the @ and " are switched in the UK and both have an AltGr ("alternate graphic") key rather than a right-hand Alt key  – as do most non-English language keyboards; see keyboard layout).

The first computer terminals such as the Teletype were typewriters that could produce and be controlled by various computer codes. These used the QWERTY layouts and added keys such as escape Esc which had special meanings to computers. Later keyboards added function keys and arrow keys. Since the standardization of personal computers and Windows after the 1980s, most full-sized computer keyboards have followed this standard (see drawing at right). This layout has a separate numeric keypad for data entry at the right, 12 function keys across the top, and a cursor section to the right and center with keys for Insert, Delete, Home, End, Page Up, and Page Down with cursor arrows in an inverted-T shape.[14]
Diacritical marks

QWERTY was designed for English, a language with accents ('diacritics') appearing only in a few words of foreign origin. The standard US keyboard has no provision for these at all; the need was later met by the so-called "US-International" keyboard mapping, which uses "dead keys" to type accents without having to add more physical keys. (The same principle is used in the standard US keyboard layout for macOS, but in a different way). Most European (including UK) keyboards for PCs have an AltGr key ('Alternative Graphics' key,[a] replaces the right Alt key) that enables easy access to the most common diacritics used in the territory where sold. For example, default keyboard mapping for the UK/Ireland keyboard has the diacritics used in Irish but these are rarely printed on the keys; but to type the accents used in Welsh and Scots Gaelic requires the use of a "UK Extended" keyboard mapping and the dead key or compose key method. This arrangement applies to Windows, ChromeOS and Linux; macOS computers have different techniques. The US International and UK Extended mappings provide many of the diacritics needed for students of other European languages.

This article or section may need to be cleaned up or summarized because it has been split from/to List of QWERTY keyboard language variants.

Minor changes to the arrangement are made for other languages. There are a large number of different keyboard layouts used for different languages written in Latin script. They can be divided into three main families according to where the Q, A, Z, M, and Y keys are placed on the keyboard. These are usually named after the first six letters, for example this QWERTY layout and the AZERTY layout.

In this section you will also find keyboard layouts that include some additional symbols of other languages. But they are different from layouts that were designed with the goal to be usable for multiple languages (see Multilingual variants).

The following sections give general descriptions of QWERTY keyboard variants along with details specific to certain operating systems. The emphasis is on Microsoft Windows.
English
Canada
A keyboard with the CSA layout

English-speaking Canadians have traditionally used the same keyboard layout as in the United States, unless they are in a position where they have to write French on a regular basis. French-speaking Canadians respectively have favoured the Canadian French keyboard layout (see French (Canada), below).

The CSA keyboard is the official multilingual keyboard layout of Canada.[15][16]
United Kingdom
Further information: British and American keyboards
United Kingdom and Ireland (except Mac) keyboard layout
United Kingdom Keyboard layout for Linux

The United Kingdom and Ireland[b] use a keyboard layout based on the 48-key version defined in the (now withdrawn) British Standard BS 4822.[17] It is very similar to that of the United States, but has an AltGr key and a larger ↵ Enter key, includes £ and € signs and some rarely used EBCDIC symbols (¬, ¦), and uses different positions for the characters @, ", #, ~, \, and |.

The BS 4822:1994 standard did not make any use of the AltGr key and lacked support for any non-ASCII characters other than ¬ and £. It also assigned a key for the non-ASCII character broken bar ¦, but lacked one for the far more commonly used ASCII character vertical bar |. It also lacked support for various diacritics used in the Welsh alphabet, and the Scots Gaelic alphabet; and also is missing the letter yogh, ȝ, used very rarely in the Scots language. Therefore, various manufacturers have modified or extended the BS 4822 standard:

    The B00 key (left of Z), shifted, results in vertical bar | on some systems (e.g. Windows UK/Ireland keyboard layout and Linux/X11 UK/Ireland keyboard layout), rather than the broken bar ¦ assigned by BS 4822 and provided in some systems (e.g. IBM OS/2 UK166 keyboard layout)
    The E00 key (left of 1) with AltGr provides either vertical bar | (OS/2's UK166 keyboard layout, Linux/X11 UK keyboard layout) or broken bar ¦ (Microsoft Windows UK/Ireland keyboard layout)

Support for the diacritics needed for Scots Gaelic and Welsh was added to Windows and ChromeOS using a "UK-extended" setting (see below); Linux and X11 systems have an explicit or reassigned Compose key for this purpose.
UK Apple keyboard
United Kingdom version of Apple keyboard

The British version of the Apple Keyboard does not use the standard UK layout. Instead, some older versions have the US layout (see below) with a few differences: the £ sign is reached by ⇧ Shift+3 and the # sign by ⌥ Option+3, the opposite to the US layout. The € is also present and is typed with ⌥ Option+2. Umlauts are reached by typing ⌥ Option+U and then the vowel, and ß is reached by typing ⌥ Option+S.

Newer Apple "British" keyboards use a layout that is relatively unlike either the US or traditional UK keyboard. It uses an elongated return key, a shortened left ⇧ Shift with ` and ~ in the newly created position, and in the upper left of the keyboard are § and ± instead of the traditional EBCDIC codes. The middle-row key that fits inside the return key has \ and Pipe symbol.
United States
Further information: British and American keyboards
United States keyboard layout

The arrangement of the character input keys and the ⇧ Shift keys contained in this layout is specified in the US national standard ANSI-INCITS 154-1988 (R1999) (formerly ANSI X3.154-1988 (R1999)),[18] where this layout is called "ASCII keyboard". The complete US keyboard layout, as it is usually found, also contains the usual function keys in accordance with the international standard ISO/IEC 9995-2, although this is not explicitly required by the US American national standard.

US keyboards are used not only in the United States, but also in many other English-speaking places, (except UK and Ireland), including India, Australia, Anglophone Canada, Hong Kong, New Zealand, South Africa, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, and Indonesia that uses the same 26-letter alphabets as English. In many other English-speaking jurisdictions (e.g., Canada, Australia, the Caribbean nations, Hong Kong, Malaysia, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Singapore, New Zealand, and South Africa), local spelling sometimes conforms more closely to British English usage, although these nations decided to use a US English keyboard layout. Until Windows 8 and later versions, when Microsoft separated the settings, this had the undesirable side effect of also setting the language to US English, rather than the local orthography.

The US keyboard layout has a second Alt instead of the AltGr key and does not use any dead keys; this makes it inefficient for all but a handful of languages. On the other hand, the US keyboard layout (or the similar UK layout) is occasionally used by programmers in countries where the keys for [{ are located in less convenient positions on the locally customary layout.[19]

On some keyboards the ↵ Enter is bigger than traditionally and takes up also a part of the line above, more or less the area of the traditional location of the \ key. In these cases the backslash is located in alternative places.[20] It can be situated one line above the default location, on the right of the = key .[21][22] Sometimes it is placed one line below its traditional situation, on the right of the ' (in these cases the ↵ Enter key is narrower than usual on the line of its default location).[23] It may also be two lines below its default situation on the right of a narrower than traditionally right ⇧ Shift key.[24]
Arabic

Two keyboard layouts that are based on Qwerty are used in Arabic-speaking countries. Microsoft designate them as Arabic (101) and Arabic (102). In both the number line is identical to the American layout, beside ( ) being mirrored, and not including the key to the left of 1. The \ key on the right side of the keyboard is also the same. | could also be produced by shifting the key on the left side of the keyboard. "? are produced by shifting the same keys, but ? is mirrored to ؟. In Arabic (102) it's true also for {} which are again mirrored. Finally, , instead of being the normal output of their keys, are produced by shifting the same keys. [25]
Czech
Czech QWERTY keyboard layout

The typewriter came to the Czech-speaking area in the late 19th century, when it was part of Austria-Hungary where German was the dominant language of administration. Therefore, Czech typewriters have the QWERTZ layout.

However, with the introduction of imported computers, especially since the 1990s, the QWERTY keyboard layout is frequently used for computer keyboards. The Czech QWERTY layout differs from QWERTZ in that the characters (e.g. @$& and others) missing from the Czech keyboard are accessible with AltGr on the same keys where they are located on an American keyboard. In Czech QWERTZ keyboards the positions of these characters accessed through AltGr differs.
Danish
Danish keyboard layout

Both the Danish and Norwegian keyboards include dedicated keys for the letters Å/å, Æ/æ and Ø/ø, but the placement is a little different, as the Æ and Ø keys are swapped on the Norwegian layout. (The Finnish–Swedish keyboard is also largely similar to the Norwegian layout, but the Ø and Æ are replaced with Ö and Ä. On some systems, the Danish keyboard may allow typing Ö/ö and Ä/ä by holding the AltGr or ⌥ Option key while striking Ø and Æ, respectively.) Computers with Windows are commonly sold with ÖØÆ and ÄÆØ printed on the two keys, allowing same computer hardware to be sold in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden, with different operating system settings.
Dutch (Netherlands)
Dutch (Netherlands) keyboard layout

Though it is seldom used (most Dutch keyboards use US International layout),[26] the Dutch layout uses QWERTY but has additions for the € sign, the diaresis (¨), and the braces ({ }) as well as different locations for other symbols. An older version contained a single-stroke key for the Dutch character IJ/ij, which is usually typed by the combination of I and J. In the 1990s, there was a version with the now-obsolete florin sign (Dutch: guldenteken) for IBM PCs.

In Flanders (the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium), "AZERTY" keyboards are used instead, due to influence from the French-speaking part of Belgium.

See also #US-International in the Netherlands below.
Estonian
Estonian keyboard layout

The keyboard layout used in Estonia is virtually the same as the Swedish layout. The main difference is that the Å and ¨ keys (to the right of P) are replaced with Ü and Õ respectively (the latter letter being the most distinguishing feature of the Estonian alphabet). Some special symbols and dead keys are also moved around.
Faroese
Faroese keyboard layout

The same as the Danish layout with added Đ (Eth), since the Faroe Islands are a self-governed part of the Kingdom of Denmark.
French (Canada)
For other French keyboard layouts, see AZERTY.
A simplified Canadian French keyboard layout. A fully standard keyboard has significantly more symbols.[27]

This keyboard layout is commonly used in Canada by French-speaking Canadians. It is the most common layout for laptops and stand-alone keyboards aimed at the Francophone market. Unlike the AZERTY layout used in France and Belgium, it is a QWERTY layout and as such is also relatively commonly used by English speakers in the US and Canada (accustomed to using US standard QWERTY keyboards) for easy access to the accented letters found in some French loanwords. It can be used to type all accented French characters, as well as some from other languages, and serves all English functions as well. It is popular mainly because of its close similarity to the basic US keyboard commonly used by English-speaking Canadians and Americans and historical use of US-made typewriters by French-Canadians.[27] It can also easily 'map' to or from a standard US QWERTY keyboard with the sole loss the guillemet/degree sign key. Its significant difference from the US standard is that the right Alt key is reconfigured as an AltGr key that gives easy access to a further range of characters (marked in blue and red on the keyboard image. Blue indicates an alternative character that will display as typed. Red indicates a dead key: the diacritic will be applied to the next vowel typed.)

In some variants, the key names are translated to French:

    ⇪ Caps Lock is Fix Maj or Verr Maj (short for Fixer/Verrouiller Majuscule, meaning Lock Uppercase).
    ↵ Enter is ↵ Entrée.[28]
    Esc is Échap.

Greek
Modern Greek keyboard layout

    The stress accents, indicated in red, are produced by pressing that key (or shifted key) followed by an appropriate vowel.
    Use of the AltGr key may produce the characters shown in blue.

German
Main article: QWERTZ

Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and Luxembourg use QWERTZ layouts, where the letter Z is to the right of T.
Icelandic
Main article: Icelandic keyboard layout
Icelandic keyboard layout

The Icelandic keyboard layout is different from the standard QWERTY keyboard because the Icelandic alphabet has some special letters, most of which it shares with the other Nordic countries: Þ/þ, Ð/ð, Æ/æ, and Ö/ö. (Æ/æ also occurs in Norwegian, Danish and Faroese, Ð/ð in Faroese, and Ö/ö in Swedish, Finnish and Estonian. In Norwegian Ö/ö could be substituted for Ø/Ø which is the same sound/letter and is widely understood).

The letters Á/á, Ý/ý, Ú/ú, Í/í, and É/é are produced by first pressing the ´ dead key and then the corresponding letter. The Nordic letters Å/å and Ä/ä can be produced by first pressing °, located below the Esc key, and ⇧ Shift+° (for ¨, two dots) which also works for the non-Nordic ÿ, Ü/ü, Ï/ï, and Ë/ë. These letters are not used natively in Icelandic, but may have been implemented for ease of communication in other Nordic languages.[citation needed] Additional diacritics may be found behind the AltGr key: AltGr++ for ˋ (freestanding grave accent, "backtick") and AltGr+´ for ˆ (freestanding circumflex).
Irish
Microsoft Windows Irish layout

Microsoft Windows includes an Irish layout which supports acute accents with AltGr for the Irish language and grave accents with the ` dead key for Scots Gaelic. The other Insular Celtic languages have their own layout. The default UK/Irish layout supports acute accents as standard and is thus more commonly used.
Italian
Italian keyboard layout

    Braces (right above square brackets and shown in purple) are given with both AltGr+⇧ Shift pressed.
    The tilde (~) and backquote (`) characters are not present on the Italian keyboard layout (with Linux, they are available by pressing AltGr+Shif+ì, and AltGr+⇧ Shift+'; Windows might not recognise these keybindings).
    When using Microsoft Windows, the standard Italian keyboard layout does not allow one to write 100% correct Italian language, since it lacks capital accented vowels, and in particular the È key. The common workaround is writing E' (E followed by an apostrophe) instead, or relying on the auto-correction feature of several word processors when available. It is possible to obtain the È symbol in MS Windows by typing Alt+0200. Mac users, however, can write the correct accented character by pressing ⇧ Shift+⌥ Option+E or, in the usual Mac way, by pressing the correct key for the accent (in this case Alt+9) and subsequently pressing the wanted letter (in this case ⇧ Shift+E). Linux users can also write it by pressing the è key with ⇪ Caps Lock enabled.

There is an alternate layout, which differs only in disposition of characters accessible through AltGr, and includes the tilde and the curly brackets. It is commonly used in IBM keyboards.

Italian typewriters often[citation needed] have the QZERTY layout instead.

The Italian-speaking part of Switzerland uses the QWERTZ keyboard.
Latvian

Although rarely used, a keyboard layout specifically designed for the Latvian language called ŪGJRMV exists. The Latvian QWERTY keyboard layout is most commonly used; its layout is the same as Latin ones, but with a dead key, which allows entering special characters (āčēģīķļņõŗšūž). The most common dead key is the apostrophe ', which is followed by AltGr (Windows default for Latvian layout). Some prefer using the tick `.
Lithuanian

Where in standard QWERTY the number row is located, you find in Lithuanian QWERTY: Ą, Č,Ę, Ė, Į, Š, Ų, Ū, Ž, instead of their counterparts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, =. If you still want to use the numbers, you can create them in combination with the AltGr key. Aside from these changes the keyboard is standard QWERTY. Besides QWERTY, the ĄŽERTY layout without the adjustment of the number row is used.
Maltese

The Maltese language uses Unicode (UTF-8) to display the Maltese diacritics: ċ Ċ; ġ Ġ; ħ Ħ; ż Ż (together with à À; è È; ì Ì; ò Ò; ù Ù). There are two standard keyboard layouts Archived 8 December 2015 at the Wayback Machine for Maltese, according to "MSA 100:2002 Maltese Keyboard Standard"; one of 47 keys and one of 48 keys. The 48-key layout is the most popular.
Norwegian
Norwegian keyboard layout
Norwegian with Sámi

The Norwegian languages use the same letters as Danish, but the Norwegian keyboard differs from the Danish layout regarding the placement of the Ø, Æ and \ (backslash) keys. On the Danish keyboard, the Ø and Æ are swapped. The Swedish keyboard is also similar to the Norwegian layout, but Ø and Æ are replaced with Ö and Ä. On some systems, the Norwegian keyboard may allow typing Ö/ö and Ä/ä by holding the AltGr or ⌥ Option key while striking Ø and Æ, respectively.

There is also an alternative keyboard layout called Norwegian with Sámi, which allows for easier input of the characters required to write various Sámi languages. All the Sámi characters are accessed through the AltGr key.

On Macintosh computers, the Norwegian and Norwegian extended keyboard layouts have a slightly different placement for some of the symbols obtained with the help of the ⇧ Shift or ⌥ Option keys. Notably, the $ sign is accessed with ⇧ Shift+4 and ¢ with ⇧ Shift+⌥ Option+4. Furthermore, the frequently used @ is placed between Æ and Return.
Polish
Polish typist's keyboard (QWERTZ PN-87)
Polish programmer's keyboard

Most typewriters use a QWERTZ keyboard with Polish letters (with diacritical marks) accessed directly (officially approved as "Typist's keyboard", Polish: klawiatura maszynistki, Polish Standard PN-87), which is mainly ignored in Poland as impractical (custom-made keyboards, e.g., those in the public sector as well as some Apple computers, present an exception to this paradigm); the "Polish programmer's" (Polish: polski programisty) layout has become the de facto standard, used on virtually all computers sold on the Polish market.

Most computer keyboards in Poland are laid out according to the standard US visual and functional layout. Polish diacritics are accessed by using the AltGr key with a corresponding similar letter from the base Latin alphabet. Normal capitalization rules apply with respect to Shift and Caps Lock keys. For example, to enter "Ź", one can type ⇧ Shift+AltGr+X with Caps Lock off, or turn on Caps Lock and type AltGr+X.

Both ANSI[29] and ISO[30] mechanical layouts are common sights, and even some non-standard[31] mechanical layouts are in use. ANSI is often preferred, as the additional key provides no additional function, at least in Microsoft Windows where it duplicates the backslash key, while taking space from the Shift key. Many keyboards do not label AltGr as such, leaving the Alt marking as in the US layout - the right Alt key nevertheless functions as AltGr in this layout, causing possible confusion when keyboard shortcuts with the Alt key are required (these usually work only with the left Alt) and causing the key to be commonly referred to as right Alt (Polish: prawy Alt).[32] However, keyboards with AltGr marking are available and it is also officially used by Microsoft when depicting the layout.[33]
Key combinations to obtain Polish characters (Windows) Caps Lock state 	In combination with 	Keystroke
A 	C 	E 	L 	N 	O 	S 	Z 	X 	U
Off 	right Alt 	ą 	ć 	ę 	ł 	ń 	ó 	ś 	ż 	ź 	€

On 	right Alt 	Ą 	Ć 	Ę 	Ł 	Ń 	Ó 	Ś 	Ż 	Ź 	€
Shift & right Alt 	ą 	ć 	ę 	ł 	ń 	ó 	ś 	ż 	ź 	
Note: On Polish programmer keyboard, right Alt plays the role of AltGr

Also, on MS Windows, the tilde character "~" (⇧ Shift+`) acts as a dead key to type Polish letters (with diacritical marks) thus, to obtain an "Ł", one may press ⇧ Shift+`L. The tilde character is obtained with ⇧ Shift+`Space.

In Linux-based systems, the euro symbol is typically mapped to Alt+5 instead of Alt+U, the tilde acts as a normal key, and several accented letters from other European languages are accessible through combinations with left Alt. Polish letters are also accessible by using the Compose key.

Software keyboards on touchscreen devices usually make the Polish diacritics available as one of the alternatives which show up after long-pressing the corresponding Latin letter.[34][35] However, modern predictive text and autocorrection algorithms largely mitigate the need to type them directly on such devices.
Portuguese

Brazil
Portuguese (Brazil) keyboard layout

The Brazilian computer keyboard layout is specified in the ABNT NBR 10346 variant 2 (alphanumeric portion) and 10347 (numeric portion) standards.

Essentially, the Brazilian keyboard contains dead keys for five variants of diacritics in use in the language; the letter Ç, the only application of the cedilla in Portuguese, has its own key. In some keyboard layouts the AltGr+C combination produces the ₢ character (Unicode 0x20A2), symbol for the old currency cruzeiro, a symbol that is not used in practice (the common abbreviation in the eighties and nineties used to be Cr$). The cent sign ¢, is accessible via AltGr+5, but is not commonly used for the centavo, subunit of previous currencies as well as the current real, which itself is represented by R$. The Euro sign € is not standardized in this layout. The masculine and feminine ordinals ª and º are accessible via AltGr combinations. The section sign § (Unicode U+00A7), in Portuguese called parágrafo, is nowadays practically only used to denote sections of laws.

Variant 2 of the Brazilian keyboard, the only which gained general acceptance (MS Windows treats both variants as the same layout),[36] has a unique mechanical layout, combining some features of the ISO 9995-3 and the JIS keyboards in order to fit 12 keys between the left and right Shift (compared to the American standard of 10 and the international of 11). Its modern, IBM PS/2-based variations, are thus known as 107-keys keyboards, and the original PS/2 variation was 104-key. Variant 1, never widely adopted, was based on the ISO 9995-2 keyboards. To make this layout usable with keyboards with only 11 keys in the last row, the rightmost key (/?°) has its functions replicated across the AltGr+Q, AltGr+W, and AltGr+E combinations.
Portugal
Portuguese (Portugal) keyboard layout

Essentially, the Portuguese keyboard contains dead keys for five variants of diacritics; the letter Ç, the only application of the cedilla in Portuguese, has its own key, but there are also a dedicated key for the ordinal indicators and a dedicated key for quotation marks. The AltGr+E combination for producing the euro sign € (Unicode 0x20AC) has become standard. On some QWERTY keyboards the key labels are translated, but the majority are labelled in English.

During the 20th century, a different keyboard layout, HCESAR, was in widespread use in Portugal.
Romanian (in Romania and Moldova)
See also: Romanian keyboard layout
Romanian keyboard layout

The current Romanian National Standard SR 13392:2004 establishes two layouts for Romanian keyboards: a "primary"[37] one and a "secondary"[38] one.

The "primary" layout is intended for traditional users who have learned how to type with older, Microsoft-style implementations of the Romanian keyboard. The "secondary" layout is mainly used by programmers as it does not contradict the physical arrangement of keys on a US-style keyboard. The "secondary" arrangement is used as the default Romanian layout by Linux distributions, as defined in the "X Keyboard Configuration Database".[39]

There are four Romanian-specific characters that are incorrectly implemented in versions of Microsoft Windows until Vista came out:

    Ș (U+0218, S with comma), incorrectly implemented as Ş (U+015E, S with cedilla)
    ș (U+0219, s with comma), incorrectly implemented as ş (U+015F, s with cedilla)
    Ț (U+021A, T with comma), incorrectly implemented as Ţ (U+0162, T with cedilla)
    ț (U+021B, t with comma), incorrectly implemented as ţ (U+0163, t with cedilla)

The cedilla-versions of the characters do not exist in the Romanian language (they came to be used due to a historic bug).[40] The UCS now says that encoding this was a mistake because it messed up Romanian data and the letters with cedilla and the letters with comma are the same letter with a different style.[41]

Since Romanian hardware keyboards are not widely available, Cristian Secară has created a driver that allows Romanian characters to be generated with a US-style keyboard in all versions of Windows prior to Vista through the use of the AltGr key modifier.[42]

Windows Vista and newer versions include the correct diacritical signs in the default Romanian Keyboard layout.

This layout has the Z and Y keys mapped like in English layouts and also includes characters like the 'at' (@) and dollar ($) signs, among others. The older cedilla-version layout is still included albeit as the 'Legacy' layout.
Slovak
Slovak QWERTY/Z keyboard layout

In Slovakia, similarly to the Czech Republic, both QWERTZ and QWERTY keyboard layouts are used. QWERTZ is the default keyboard layout for Slovak in Microsoft Windows.
Spanish
Spain

Spanish keyboard layout

The Spanish keyboard layout is used to write in Spanish and in other languages of Spain such as Catalan, Basque, Galician, Aragonese, Asturian and Occitan. It includes Ñ for Spanish, Asturian and Galician, the acute accent, the diaeresis, the inverted question and exclamation marks (¿, ¡), the superscripted o and a (º, ª) for writing abbreviated ordinal numbers in masculine and feminine in Spanish and Galician, and finally, some characters required only for typing Catalan and Occitan, namely Ç, the grave accent and the interpunct (punt volat / punt interior, used in l·l, n·h, s·h; located at Shift-3). It can also be used to write other international characters, such as those using a circumflex accent (used in French and Portuguese among others) or a tilde (used in both Spanish and Portuguese), which are available as dead keys. However, it lacks two characters used in Asturian: Ḥ and Ḷ (historically, general support for these two has been poor – they aren't present in the ISO 8859-1 character encoding standard, or any other ISO/IEC 8859 standard). Several alternative distributions, based on this one or created from scratch, have been created to address this issue (see the Other original layouts and layout design software section for more information).

On most keyboards, € is marked as Alt Gr + E and not Alt Gr + 5 as shown in the image. However, in some keyboards, € is found marked twice. An alternative version exists, supporting all of ISO 8859-1.[25]

Spanish keyboards are usually labelled in Spanish instead of English, its abbreviations being:
Spanish label 	English equivalent
Insertar (Ins) 	Insert (Ins)
Suprimir (Supr) 	Delete (Del)
Retroceder página (Re Pág) 	Page up (PgUp)
Avanzar página (Av Pág) 	Page down (PgDn)
Inicio 	Home
Fin 	End
Imprimir pantalla / Petición de sistema (Impr Pant/PetSis) 	Print Screen / System request (PrtScn/SysRq)
Bloqueo de mayúsculas (Bloq Mayús) 	Caps Lock
Bloqueo numérico (Bloq Num) 	Num Lock
Bloqueo de desplazamiento (Bloq Despl) 	Scroll Lock
Pausa / Interrumpir (Pausa/Inter) 	Pause/Break
Intro 	Enter

On some keyboards, the c-cedilla key (Ç) is located one or two lines above, rather than on the right of, the acute accent key (´). In some cases it is placed on the right of the plus sign key (+),[43][44] while in other keyboards it is situated on the right of the inverted exclamation mark key (¡).[45][circular reference][46]
Latin America, officially known as Spanish Latinamerican sort
Latin American Spanish keyboard layout

The Latin American Spanish keyboard layout is used throughout Mexico, Central and South America. Before its design, Latin American vendors had been selling the Spanish (Spain) layout as default.

Its most obvious difference from the Spanish (Spain) layout is the lack of a Ç key; on Microsoft Windows, it lacks a tilde (~) dead key, whereas on Linux systems the dead tilde can be optionally enabled. This is not a problem when typing in Spanish, but it is rather problematic when typing in Portuguese, which can be an issue in countries with large commercial ties to Brazil (Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay).

Normally "Bloq Mayús" is used instead of "Caps Lock", and "Intro" instead of "Enter".
Swedish
Swedish Windows keyboard layout

The central characteristics of the Swedish keyboard are the three additional letters Å/å, Ä/ä, and Ö/ö. The same visual layout is also in use in Finland and Estonia, as the letters Ä/ä and Ö/ö are shared with the Swedish language, and even Å/å is needed by Swedish-speaking Finns. However, the Finnish multilingual keyboard adds new letters and punctuation to the functional layout.

The Norwegian keyboard largely resembles the Swedish layout, but the Ö and Ä are replaced with Ø and Æ. The Danish keyboard is also similar, but it has the Ø and Æ swapped. On some systems, the Swedish or Finnish keyboard may allow typing Ø/ø and Æ/æ by holding the AltGr or ⌥ Option key while striking Ö and Ä, respectively.

The Swedish with Sámi keyboard allows typing not only Ø/ø and Æ/æ, but even the letters required to write various Sámi languages. This keyboard has the same function for all the keys engraved on the regular Swedish keyboard, and the additional letters are available through the AltGr key.

On Macintosh computers, the Swedish and Swedish Pro keyboards differ somewhat from the image shown above, especially as regards the characters available using the ⇧ Shift or ⌥ Option keys. ⇧ Shift+§ (on the upper row) produces the ° sign, and ⇧ Shift+4 produces the € sign. The digit keys produce ©@£$∞§ with ⌥ Option and ¡"¥¢‰¶\{}≠ with ⌥ Option+⇧ Shift.

On Linux systems, the Swedish keyboard may also give access to additional characters as follows:

    first row: AltGr ¶¡@£$€¥{[]}\± and AltGr+⇧ Shift ¾¹²³¼¢⅝÷«»°¿¬
    second row: AltGr @ł€®þ←↓→œþ"~ and AltGr+⇧ Shift ΩŁ¢®Þ¥↑ıŒÞ°ˇ
    third row: AltGr ªßðđŋħjĸłøæ´ and AltGr+⇧ Shift º§ÐªŊĦJ&ŁØÆ×
    fourth row: AltGr |«»©""nµ¸·̣ and AltGr+⇧ Shift ¦<>©‘’Nº˛˙˙

Several of these characters function as dead keys.
Turkish
Turkish Q-keyboard layout

Today the majority of Turkish keyboards are based on QWERTY (the so-called Q-keyboard layout), although there is also the older F-keyboard layout specifically designed for the language.
Vietnamese
Main article: Vietnamese language and computers
Vietnamese keyboard layout

The Vietnamese keyboard layout is an extended Latin QWERTY layout. The letters Ă, Â, Ê, and Ô are found on what would be the number keys 1–4 on the US English keyboard, with 5–9 producing the tonal marks (grave accent, hook, tilde, acute accent and dot below, in that order), 0 producing Đ, = producing the đồng sign (₫) when not shifted, and brackets ([]) producing Ư and Ơ.[47]
Multilingual variants
	
It has been suggested that this section be split out into another article. (Discuss) (October 2021)

Multilingual keyboard layouts, unlike the default layouts supplied for one language and market, try to make it possible for the user to type in any of several languages using the same number of keys. Mostly this is done by adding a further virtual layer in addition to the ⇧ Shift-key by means of AltGr (or 'right Alt' reused as such), which contains a further repertoire of symbols and diacritics used by the desired languages.

This section also tries to arrange the layouts in ascending order by the number of possible languages and not chronologically according to the Latin alphabet as usual.
United Kingdom (Extended) Layout

United Kingdom Extended Keyboard Layout for Linux
United Kingdom International Keyboard Layout for Linux


Windows

From Windows XP SP2 onwards, Microsoft has included a variant of the British QWERTY keyboard (the "United Kingdom Extended" keyboard layout) that can additionally generate several diacritical marks. This supports input on a standard physical UK keyboard for many languages without changing positions of frequently used keys, which is useful when working with text in Welsh, Scots Gaelic and Irish — languages native to parts of the UK (Wales, parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland respectively).

In this layout, the grave accent key (`¦) becomes, as it also does in the US International layout, a dead key modifying the character generated by the next key pressed. The apostrophe, double-quote, tilde and circumflex (caret) keys are not changed, becoming dead keys only when 'shifted' with AltGr. Additional precomposed characters are also obtained by shifting the 'normal' key using the AltGr key. The extended keyboard is software installed from the Windows control panel, and the extended characters are not normally engraved on keyboards.

The UK Extended keyboard uses mostly the AltGr key to add diacritics to the letters a, e, i, n, o, u, w and y (the last two being used in Welsh) as appropriate for each character, as well as to their capitals. Pressing the key and then a character that does not take the specific diacritic produces the behaviour of a standard keyboard. The key presses followed by spacebar generate a stand-alone mark.:

    grave accents (e.g. à, è, etc.) needed for Scots Gaelic are generated by pressing the grave accent (or 'backtick') key `, which is a dead key, then the letter. Thus `+a produces à.
    acute accents (e.g. á) needed for Irish are generated by pressing the AltGr key together with the letter.[c] Thus AltGr+a produces á; AltGr+⇧ Shift+a produces Á.
    the circumflex diacritic needed for Welsh may be added by AltGr+6, acting as a dead key combination, followed by the letter. Thus AltGr+6 then a produces â, AltGr+6 then w produces the letter ŵ.

Some other languages commonly studied in the UK and Ireland are also supported to some extent:

    diaeresis or umlaut (e.g. ä, ë, ö, etc.) is generated by a dead key combination AltGr+2, then the letter. Thus AltGr+2a produces ä.
    tilde (e.g. ã, ñ, õ, etc., as used in Spanish and Portuguese) is generated by dead key combination AltGr+#, then the letter. Thus AltGr+#a produces ã.
    cedilla (e.g. ç) under c is generated by AltGr+C, and the capital letter (Ç) is produced by AltGr+⇧ Shift+C

The AltGr and letter method used for acutes and cedillas does not work for applications which assign shortcut menu functions to these key combinations.

These combinations are intended to be mnemonic and designed to be easy to remember: the circumflex accent (e.g. â) is similar to the free-standing circumflex (caret) (^), printed above the 6 key; the diaeresis/umlaut (e.g. ö) is visually similar to the double-quote (") above 2 on the UK keyboard; the tilde (~) is printed on the same key as the #.

The UK Extended layout is almost entirely transparent to users familiar with the UK layout. A machine with the extended layout behaves exactly as with the standard UK, except for the rarely used grave accent key. This makes this layout suitable for a machine for shared or public use by a user population in which some use the extended functions.

Despite being created for multilingual users, UK-Extended in Windows does have some gaps — there are many languages that it cannot cope with, including Romanian and Turkish, and all languages with different character sets, such as Greek and Russian. It also does not cater for thorn (þ, Þ) in Old English, the ß in German, the œ in French, nor for the å, æ, ø, ð, þ in Nordic languages.
ChromeOS

The UK Extended layout (a ChromeOS extension[d]) provides all the same combinations as with Windows, but adds many more symbols and dead keys via AltGr.

AltGr+⇧ Shift+0 (°) is a degree sign; AltGr+⇧ Shift+M (º) is a masculine ordinal indicator

    Dead keys
        `+letter produces grave accents (e.g., à/À) (`+` produces a standalone backtick).

        AltGr+6(release)letter produces circumflex accents (e.g., â/Â)
        AltGr+= (release) letter produces (mainly) comma diacritic or cedilla below the letter (e.g., ş/Ş) [In addition, AltGr+c produces ç]

        AltGr+[ same as AltGr+2
        AltGr+] same as AltGr+#
        AltGr+{(release)letter produces overrings (e.g., å/Å)

        AltGr+;(release)letter produces acute accents (e.g., ź/Ź)
        AltGr+⇧ Shift+;(release)letter produces double acute accents on some letters (e.g., Ő/ő) that exist in Unicode as pre-composed characters
        AltGr+'(release)letter produces acute accents (e.g., á/Á)
        AltGr+⇧ Shift+'(release)letter produces caron (haček) diacritics (e.g., ǎ/Ǎ)
        AltGr+#(release)letter produces tilde diacritics (e.g., ã/Ã)
        AltGr+⇧ Shift+#(release)letter produces inverted breve diacritics (e.g., ă/Ă)
        AltGr+/(release)letter produces mainly underdots (e.g., ạ/Ạ)
        AltGr+⇧ Shift+/(release)letter produces mainly overdots (e.g., ȧ/Ȧ)

Finally, any arbitrary Unicode glyph can be produced given its hexadecimal code point: ctrl+⇧ Shift+u, release, then the hex value, then space bar or ↩ Return. For example ctrl+⇧ Shift+u (release) 1234space produces the Ethiopic syllable SEE, ሴ.
US-International
US-International keyboard layout (Windows)

Windows provides an alternative layout for a US keyboard to type diacritics, called the US-International layout. Linux and ChromeOS (which calls it the International/Extended keyboard[citation needed]) also provide this layout with slight modifications such as many more AltGr combinations.

The layout is installed from the settings panel.[48] The additional functions (shown in blue) may or may not be engraved on the keyboard, but are always functional. It can be used to type most major languages from Western Europe: Afrikaans, Danish, Dutch, English, Faroese, Finnish, German, Icelandic, Irish, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Scots Gaelic, Spanish, and Swedish. It is not sufficient for French because it lacks the grapheme “œ/Œ” (as does every keyboard layout provided by Windows except the Canadian multilingual standard keyboard). Some less common western and central European languages (such as Welsh, Maltese, Czech and Hungarian), are not fully supported. If they keyboard does not have an AltGr key, the right-hand Alt is used. If that key does not exist (which is true of many laptops) the combination Ctrl+Alt works as well.

This layout uses keys ', `, ", ^ and ~ as dead keys to generate characters with diacritics by pressing the appropriate key, then the letter on the keyboard. Only certain letters such as vowels and "n", work, otherwise the symbol is produced followed by the typed letter. To get only the symbol ', `, ", ^ and ~, press the Spacebar after the key.

    ' + vowel → vowel with acute accent, e.g., '+e → é
    ` + vowel → vowel with grave accent, e.g., `+e → è
    " + vowel → vowel with diaeresis (or umlaut), e.g., "+e → ë
    ^ + vowel → vowel with circumflex accent, e.g., ^+e → ê
    ~ + a, n or o → letter with tilde, e.g. ~+n → ñ, ~+o → õ
    ' + c → ç (Windows) or ć (X11)

The layout is not entirely transparent to users familiar with the conventional US layout as the dead keys act different (they don't appear immediately and produce accented letters depending on what letter is typed next). This could be disconcerting on a machine for shared or public use. There are alternatives, such as requiring AltGr to be held down to get the dead-key function.
US-International in the Netherlands
Closeup of Dutch laptop keyboard with an engraved euro sign €

The Dutch layout is historical, and keyboards with this layout are rarely used. Instead, the standard keyboard layout in the Netherlands is US-International, as the Dutch language heavily relies on diacritics and the US-International keyboard provides easy access to diacritics using dead keys. While many US keyboards do not have AltGr or extra US-International characters engraved on them, Dutch keyboards typically have the AltGr engraved at the location of the right Alt key, and have the euro sign € engraved next to the 5 key.
Apple International English Keyboard
International English version of Apple keyboard

There are three kinds of Apple Keyboards for English: the United States, the United Kingdom and International English. The International English version features the same changes as the United Kingdom version, only without substituting # for the £ symbol on ⇧ Shift+3, and as well lacking visual indication for the € symbol on ⌥ Option+2 (although this shortcut is present with all Apple QWERTY layouts).

Differences from the US layout are:

    The ~
    ` key is located on the left of the Z key, and the |
    \ key is located on the right of the "
    ' key.
    The ±
    § key is added on the left of the !
    1 key.
    The left ⇧ Shift key is shortened and the Return key has the shape of inverted L.

Canadian Multilingual Standard

Main article: CSA keyboard
See also: Languages of Canada

The Canadian Multilingual Standard keyboard layout is used by some Canadians. Though the caret (^) is missing, it is easily inserted by typing the circumflex accent followed by a space.
Finnish multilingual
Finnish multilingual keyboard layout

The visual layout used in Finland is basically the same as the Swedish layout. This is practical, as Finnish and Swedish share the special characters Ä/ä and Ö/ö, and while the Swedish Å/å is unnecessary for writing Finnish, it is needed by Swedish-speaking Finns and to write Swedish family names which are common.

As of 2008, there is a new standard for the Finnish multilingual keyboard layout, developed as part of a localization project by CSC. All the engravings of the traditional Finnish–Swedish visual layout have been retained, so there is no need to change the hardware, but the functionality has been extended considerably, as additional characters (e.g., Æ/æ, Ə/ə, Ʒ/ʒ) are available through the AltGr key, as well as dead keys, which allow typing a wide variety of letters with diacritics (e.g., Ç/ç, Ǥ/ǥ, Ǯ/ǯ).[49][50]

Based on the Latin letter repertory included in the Multilingual European Subset No. 2 (MES-2) of the Unicode standard, the layout has three main objectives. First, it provides for easy entering of text in both Finnish and Swedish, the two official languages of Finland, using the familiar keyboard layout but adding some advanced punctuation options, such as dashes, typographical quotation marks, and the non-breaking space (NBSP).

Second, it is designed to offer an indirect but intuitive way to enter the special letters and diacritics needed by the other three Nordic national languages (Danish, Norwegian and Icelandic) as well as the regional and minority languages (Northern Sámi, Southern Sámi, Lule Sámi, Inari Sámi, Skolt Sámi, Romani language as spoken in Finland, Faroese, Kalaallisut also known as Greenlandic, and German).

As a third objective, it allows for relatively easy entering of particularly names (of persons, places or products) in a variety of European languages using a more or less extended Latin alphabet, such as the official languages of the European Union (excluding Bulgarian and Greek). Some letters, like Ł/ł needed for Slavic languages, are accessed by a special "overstrike" key combination acting like a dead key.[51] Initially the Romanian letters Ș/ș and Ț/ț (S/s and T/t with comma below) were not supported (the presumption was that Ş/ş and Ţ/ţ (with cedilla) would suffice as surrogates), however the layout was updated in 2019 to include the letters with the commas as well.[52]
EurKEY
Main article: EurKEY
EurKEY keyboard layout

EurKEY, a multilingual keyboard layout intended for Europeans, programmers and translators which uses the US-standard QWERTY layout as base and adds a third and fourth layer available through the AltGr key and AltGr+⇧ Shift. These additional layers provide support for many Western European languages, special characters, the Greek alphabet (via dead keys), and many common mathematical symbols.

Unlike most of the other QWERTY layouts, which are formal standards for a country or region, EurKEY is not an EU, EFTA or any national standard.

To address the ergonomics issue of QWERTY, EurKEY Colemak-DH was also developed a Colmak-DH version with the EurKEY design principles.
Alternatives
See also: Latin-script non-QWERTY keyboards

Several alternatives to QWERTY have been developed over the years, claimed by their designers and users to be more efficient, intuitive, and ergonomic. Nevertheless, none have seen widespread adoption, partly due to the sheer dominance of available keyboards and training.[53] Although some studies have suggested that some of these may allow for faster typing speeds,[54] many other studies have failed to do so, and many of the studies claiming improved typing speeds were severely methodologically flawed or deliberately biased, such as the studies administered by August Dvorak himself before and after World War II.[citation needed] Economists Stan Liebowitz and Stephen Margolis have noted that rigorous studies are inconclusive as to whether they actually offer any real benefits,[55] and some studies on keyboard layout have suggested that, for a skilled typist, layout is largely irrelevant – even randomized and alphabetical keyboards allow for similar typing speeds to QWERTY and Dvorak keyboards – and that switching costs always outweigh the benefits of further training with a keyboard layout a person has already learned.[citation needed]

The most widely used such alternative is the Dvorak keyboard layout; another alternative is Colemak, which is based partly on QWERTY and is claimed to be easier for an existing QWERTY typist to learn while offering several supposed optimisations.[56] Most modern computer operating systems support these and other alternative mappings with appropriate special mode settings, with some modern operating systems allowing the user to map their keyboard in any way they like, but few keyboards are made with keys labeled according to any other standard.
Comparison to other keyboard input systems

Comparisons have been made between Dvorak, Colemak, QWERTY, and other keyboard input systems, namely stenotype or its electronic implementations. However, stenotype is a fundamentally different system, which relies on phonetics and simultaneous key presses or chords. Although Shorthand (or 'stenography') has long been known as a faster and more accurate typing system,[citation needed] adoption has been limited, possibly due to the historically high cost of equipment, steeper initial learning curve, and low awareness of the benefits within primary education and in the general public.[citation needed]

The first typed shorthand machines appeared around 1830, with English versions gaining popularity in the early 1900s.[citation needed] Modern electronic stenotype machines or programs produce output in written language,[citation needed] which provides an experience similar to other keyboard setups that immediately produce legible work.
Half QWERTY
The Nokia E55 uses a half QWERTY keyboard layout.

A half QWERTY keyboard is a combination of an alpha-numeric keypad and a QWERTY keypad, designed for mobile phones.[57] In a half QWERTY keyboard, two characters share the same key, which reduces the number of keys and increases the surface area of each key, useful for mobile phones that have little space for keys.[57] It means that 'Q' and 'W' share the same key and the user must press the key once to type 'Q' and twice to type 'W'.

Graphite Keyboard Layout
Introduction

Graphite is a highly optimized, well balanced, general purpose keyboard layout designed to accommodate the real world needs of typists looking for a great “out-of-the-box” experience. Its design incorporates many contemporary theories about layouts to find a balance between comfort and speed. In addition to its impressive performance in metrics, Graphite has also been extensively tested and validated through real-world usage.

Design Goals

Graphite was generated through an algorithm which automated the process of analyzing and comparing a multitude of layouts. The layout was generated using Oxey’s layout analyzer, which is very aptly named Oxeylyzer.

I was most interested in finding a layout with the following properties:

    High alternation
    High rolls
    Balanced heatmap
    Low finger speed
    Low scissors
    Low lateral stretches
    Low redirects

(NOTE: For information on those terms, I highly recommend reading through the layout doc.)

In its default configuration, Oxeylyzer generates the Sturdy layout. While the Sturdy layout is quite good, I had a few nitpicks I wanted to address. So, I forked the repo and tweaked the source code to try to filter out a few bigrams I felt were problematic, and after several attempts I found the precursor to Graphite. I was quite surprised by haw good the layout felt to my fingers in general, but I wasn’t sure how it would work in practice. Prior to this, I had created other keyboard layouts, and learned a handful of others’ layouts as well, all of which I abandoned in favor of MTGAP for one reason or another. I decided to learn the layout myself first (i.e. eating my own dog food) in order to work out any issues before promoting it.

The layout was generated using an English corpus which did an excellent job in finding a suitable placement for all the letters and the basic layer of punctuation. I spent the next few months learning the layout and experimenting with a handful of swaps in order to see whether Oxeylyzer’s decisions were justified. In the end, I concluded that I was not smarter than Oxeylyzer, and ended up reverting nearly all my swaps. However, there was a class of swaps that I knew I could do better.
Punctuation

Despite being a great analyzer, Oxeylyzer does has a couple of limitations:

    it does not consider punctuation layers,
    it does not consider the impact of modifier keys such as shift, which are quite common pinky keys on standard keyboards.

An example to motivate this problem concerns the placement of the punctuation keys. The precursor to Graphite had ’ and ” on the same finger (on index), and . under middle finger. In the beginning, this configuration did not cause any problems. However, when I got to around 70wpm, I started to notice that .” was a pretty common bigram, particularly for writers/authors/journalists (okay, let’s be honest, I was practicing on typelit.io). Since Oxeylyzer doesn’t consider shift layers, it never found that .” was a pretty bad bigram. So, I tried to fix this by moving . to pinky, since I and J almost never come at the end of words.

However, after a few days of retraining, I started to realize that . on pinky was also problematic, particularly for me as a programmer. I personally like to press shift on the opposite hand for ergonomic reasons, but what I found was that . (unlike ,) is frequently in close proximity with capitalized letters. In normal prose they tend to be separated by a space, but in programming I was discovering that capital letters aren’t always followed by a space. For example, I found myself typing things like Belt.List.Set.fromArray over and over, and the transition from . to right shift was really causing my right pinky (which already suffers from RSI) a lot of discomfort. Since Oxeylyzer doesn’t consider the impact of modifiers like shift, it never found that . should probably not go on a pinky key (unless you do something non-standard, like remap shift to a thumb key).

So, I begrudgingly moved . back to middle finger. Around this time, I was chatting with ec0vid on Discord, and just trying to get some ideas, and he had a great suggestion to separate ’ and ”. Since the problem was that .” was more common than .’, I could fix the bigram scissor by moving ” closer to .. So, I swapped ” and _, which completely solved the problem.

In addition to those punctuation swaps, I also made a few more more swaps to the punctuation which I think greatly improve the experience for programmers. In programming, I found that I often had to type the following bigrams:

    ->
    =>
    |>
    ./
    :=
    ): (for example: def foo():)

Putting > on middle finger makes all those arrow symbols quite comfortable to type. Flipping < and > may be bit strange at first, but if you are touch typing (which you should be doing anyways!), eventually your muscle memory will kick in, and you won’t even think about it.

When modifying the punctuation, I did, however, impose some constraints on myself to try to avoid some technical limitations. Previously, I had experienced problems when learning a version of MTGAP with fully optimized punctuation. In particular, the problems I encountered had to do with keyboard shortcuts. For example, in the fully optimized MTGAP, the { key was under the number 3. The shortcut I had long ago learned to switch tabs on Firefox was Cmd + {, but since { was under 3, I typed Cmd + Shift + 3 and to my surprise ended up taking a screenshot instead of moving tabs (on MacOS Cmd + Shift + 3 takes screenshots). This was not the only case, and it quickly turned into a game of whack-a-mole trying to fix all my keyboard shortcuts. Since I wanted a great out-of-the-box experience for people learning Graphite, I decided to limit moving the punctuation as much as possible. In particular, I avoided changing the layer each symbol was on; if the punctuation symbol requires shift in qwerty, then it requires shift in Graphite. I think this greatly helps reduce confusion, and potential for conflicts.

While the punctuation may seem a bit wacky at first, I hope I’ve provided some well thought out justification for my choices. The punctuation changes help improve the typing experience for both writers and programmers. I do recognize that not all programmers and writers will have the same needs, so I do think that perhaps there is some wiggle room here. For me, however, these changes to Graphite have greatly improved how I feel about the layout, to the extent that I feel that Graphite provides one of the most comfortable typing experiences without having to go down a rabbit hole of redefining all your application shortcuts, or depend on non-standard ergonomic keyboards (for things like extra thumb keys).
Design Features of Graphite
Promoting a more natural typing posture

Graphite encourages a more natural typing posture by placing letters in a way that kind of force the hands to be at an angle. Typing with your hands at a slight angle has a couple of benefits:

    It reduces ulnar deviation. This happens when your wrists are twisted outwards and tension is applied to the side of the wrist closest to your pinky finger.
    On the right hand, a slight angle arguably makes it easier to reach backspace.
    For vim users, it makes jk easier to press as well.

On Alternation, Rolls, and Redirects

High alternation frequency is good for comfort and balance, while high roll frequency is also good for comfort and speed. With Graphite you get both. While I don't want to explain too much about this topic here, (the layout doc covers a lot of this in much greater detail), I do want to point out some observations, namely:

    The letter H is somewhat unique in English in that it exhibits the strong tendency to come after consonants and before vowels.
    The letter N exhibits the opposite property, in that it’s much more likely to appear before a consonant, and after a vowel.

With this in mind, you can look at where N and H are on Graphite and get as sense for how the layout works. Consonant hand pinky N promotes inward rolls, and vowel hand index H promotes outward rolls. You may get the sense that everything moves in a left->right direction on Graphite. While it's true that rolls tend to move left->right, in practice I find that the asymmetry actually doesn’t cause as much grief as I thought it would.

The reason is that there is truly a huge variety of letter patterns in English, and the left->right tendency ends up being nothing more than a tendency. It does not overwhelmingly dominate the feel of the layout. Furthermore, at higher speeds, I find that what really starts to stand out more is the “interleaved” rolls. These are the rolls that you’re effectively setting up while you’re in the process of performing an alternation.

For a motivating example, consider the word with in Graphite. It can be divided into a left hand w_t_ and right hand _i_h. Here, you’ll notice that in effect, each hand is individually performing right->left rolls. While I currently don’t have any metrics on these kinds of “interleaved” rolls, in my experience, they really do tend to balance out the left->right tendency of normal rolls.

Furthermore, the left->right tendency does have an additional benefit which is that it helps to reduce redirects. In fact, Graphite falls into a class of keyboard layouts occasionally described as ultralow redirect layouts.

Lastly, I want to add one more interesting observation about Graphite, which is the placement of the letter S. I have to say, S on index is very nice. While S is generally a very flexible letter, it does have a pretty strong tendency to come at the end of words (see English Letter Frequency Counts: Mayzner Revisited for more on this). Because of this, a lot of words will end as inward rolls on a strong finger. (Though, I should also point out that N is also a common ending letter, but S still dominates in this regard over N). Also, to a much lesser degree, Y also has a habit of appearing at the end of words, which is a nice benefit of having Y on index.
On Scissors

A big component of layout design involves the reduction of excessive “bad” stretches. Oxeylyzer includes some heuristics to reduce a class of bad stretches which are nebulously described as "scissors". Scissors are loosely defined as row changes which don't follow the natural curvature of the fingers. For example, on Qwerty, CR is considered a scissor because it's a row skip in which you curl your middle finger and stretch your index finger. However, things aren't so clear cut because Qwerty EX is also very uncomfortable to type, even though it does follow the natural curvature of the fingers; and Qwerty MP is comfortable to type despite going against the natural curvature of the fingers. If anyone knows of some good ways to classify these bigrams more rigorously, feel free to suggest it in the Alternative Keyboard Layouts discord server!
Shortcomings and Mitigations

No layout is perfect, and that includes Graphite. There are a few bad finger patterns that you should look out for.
BR / PH / MB

I've grouped these three bigrams together because they all kind of affect each other. In an ideal world, B would replace P on the right hand in order to eliminate the PH sfb (and subsequent PHY trigram, for all you physicists out there). However, if you put P on pinky, then you end up in a worse scenario because both PR/RP and MP are more common than BR/RB and MB. This is the reason why I wouldn't recommend moving those letters around on Graphite.

Some mitigations which I would recommend:

    BR: There isn't much you can do here. If you find it too difficult to roll BR, you can always insert a tiny pause after B to give your ring finger time to set up the R keypress.
    MB: On a standard row-stagger keyboard, you can press M with left index whenever you see MB.
    PH: If PH is really bad, you might be able to get away with swapping P and K:
        If you swap PK then PH can be done with index-middle (and PHY with index-middle-index), but P will be further away from the vowels. This is probably ok on a row stagger keyboard because the bottom row is staggered to the right anyways, so swapping P will probably not have a major impact. On ortholinear or column-stagger keyboards, this may be more of a problem. (NOTE: Swapping PK does also help with PY for all the happy Python programmers out there).
        I don't really recommend swapping PF to try to get a PH slide because it breaks apart OF/FO which is much more common.

Example hard words with these bigrams:

    brown, embryo (extremely rare mbr trigram), tumblr
    physics, hyphen

SC / SW / GS

In almost all cases, these can be easily mitigated with alternate fingerings.

    SC: middle-index (school, script, discord, electronics)
    SW: index-middle (switch, sword, aws)
    GS: index-middle (things, sings, brings)

RM

On row-stagger keyboards, this bigram can often be alted with M on index. However, sometimes, it is followed by S, and in those cases, you'll have to decide to either tank through the MS sfb, or deal with an awkward RMS trigram.

Examples:

    army, murmur, farmer, farms, arms

About Me

I've been experimenting with keyboard layouts for a few years and have learned about one or two dozen layouts in my quest for an endgame layout. I switched to Dvorak in 2005 and used it for 15 years. During the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns, I found myself suddenly afflicted by painful repetitive strain injury which affected the ring and pinky fingers of my right hand. Thinking it might be due to Dvorak's placement of L and S, I began experimenting with other layouts, and got sucked into the world of alternative keyboard layouts (turns out, the problem was desk height, not keyboard layout, which was greatly affecting my RSI). I have a YouTube channel where I've posted videos with handcams of me typing in a variety of layouts.

Colemak Mod-DH

Colemak Mod-DH introduces a minor modification to the Colemak keyboard layout, designed to make typing more comfortable. The resulting layout is commonly known as Colemak-DH.
Colemak Mod-DH main keys for an ISO keyboard, known as Colemak-DH.
Keys are colored according to the finger that should be used. The 10 most common English letters are assigned to the 10 easiest keys (highlighted in red).

Colemak is a great layout, but that doesn't mean it's impossible to improve on! The idea behind Mod‑DH is that by making an adjustment to the placement of a small number of keys, it is possible to gain a significant improvement in ergonomics and comfort. See this comparison of Mod-DH with other layouts.

There are separate implementations optimized for ISO, ANSI and matrix keyboards.
Highlights:

    Places the heavily used D and H keys in more comfortable and easier-to-reach positions.
    Moves G to a slightly easier position also, reverting to its placement in Qwerty.
    Reduces usage of the difficult-to-reach centre column by about half.
    Utilizes the "Angle Mod" (see below) to promote a more comfortable, symmetrical typing posture on standard keyboards.
    Retains Colemak's many other strengths, such as its home key placement and low rate of same-finger bigrams.
    No keys change fingers from standard Colemak, making it easy to adopt for existing Colemak users.

The Colemak forum has threads containing some background information to the creation of this mod, and also a more detailed discussion of it.
» Changes From Colemak

The mod consists of two parts, the left-hand "D" change, and the right-hand "H" change.
Changed keys relative to standard Colemak. Note that none of the changes move keys to a new finger. This makes the mod easy to learn and also retains Colemak's excellent stats on same-finger bigrams.
Left Hand Changes

The primary change is to the left hand:
1. The "Angle Mod" is applied to keys Z, X, C. This moves these keys one space to the left but maintains the conventional finger assignment.
2. Three keys are relocated: D, G, B. This makes the D key much easier to type, using your index finger. The position of G is also improves, and reverts to its Qwerty placement. The B key moves from the hard-to-reach position at the bottom-middle to the new location on the top row.
Right Hand Changes

There is a minor change to the right hand:
The H and M keys exchange places. This makes H easier to type, being a more common character than M. Since HE is the second most common bigram in English, it also makes it more comfortable to type several very common words such as "the", "then", "where", etc.
» Changes From Qwerty
Changed keys relative to Qwerty. In total, 19 keys are changed, plus the application of the Angle Mod to an additional 3. Of these, only 12 keys change fingers, same as Colemak.

If you are currently using Qwerty and looking for a better layout, then both standard Colemak and Mod-DH are excellent choices. The change from Qwerty is not easy and can take some time, but is worthwhile in the end. If you start with Colemak but find the frequent reaching for D, H and G unsatisfactory, or find the common HE bigram uncomfortable, then Mod-DH is for you!
» The Angle Mod
The Angle Mod makes it possible to adopt a more comfortable typing posture by introducing a degree of symmetry on a standard, staggered keyboard. The keys along the bottom-left are moved one space to the left, but you should continue to type these keys using the conventional finger assignment, i.e. Z=pinky, X=ring, C=middle, V=index.

The Angle Mod on an ISO keyboard. ANSI keyboards are also supported with a slight variation. Keys are colored by finger assignment.

See also: Guide to the Angle Mod.

The Angle Mod is a good innovation, and has been popular in the Colemak community for almost as long as Colemak itself. But, in its default implementation (affecting all five bottom-left keys), it results in the rare V moving to one of best locations on the keyboard. Mod-DH fixes this by assigning D to that key instead, and utilizes the Angle Mod for Z,X,C only. An important feature of Mod-DH is that on standard keyboards, use of the Angle Mod is intrinsic to the layout design.
» What's wrong with standard Colemak anyway?

For many people, nothing! But others who have tried Colemak have identified flaws, and have found the transition from Qwerty frustrating. Some have even given up on Colemak as a result. I believe that those who experience problems with Colemak need not give up on it. Mod-DH was created to fix the most common complaints, and to give a more comfortable Colemak experience for those who want it.

The most commonly identified flaw is Colemak's placement of the D and H keys. As the 8th and 10th most common letters in English, they should ideally be in easy-to-reach positions. Colemak places them in the centre columns, which means a lateral motion of the hand is required to access them. If you try this motion frequently, you'll probably find it is somewhat less comfortable than moving the index finger downward to where Mod-DH places those keys. The H-E combination is often cited as a common English bigram that is unduly awkward with Colemak. If you find it easier for the index finger to curl inward to access the bottom row than stretching for the centre column, then you'll find Mod-DH more comfortable to use.
	left 	right 	total
Colemak 	7.76% 	7.02% 	14.78%
Colemak Mod-DH 	4.49% 	3.31% 	7.80%
Usage of the centre-column keys for standard Colemak and Mod-DH

My own experience is that I used standard Colemak for several months, but was unsatisfied with the frequent reaching for the middle of the keyboard to type D and H, and to some extent G. I initially stuck with it, being reluctant to change an established layout and thinking Colemak's other benefits would outweigh its drawbacks. And to be fair, for the most part they do. But I eventually came to realize that in fact there is no need to compromise: By applying Mod-DH, it is possible to keep all Colemak's best features, while placing some common letters in easier-to-access locations and reducing the need to reach for the centre column. Within a couple of days using the left-hand "D" mod, I found it to be a noticeable, significant improvement over standard Colemak. And when applying the right-hand "H" mod, common English words containing HE (the, then, where…) became almost effortless.
» Curl Technique
The recommended typing technique for Mod-DH users is to have the hands approach the keyboard at an angle, symmetrically, and with wrists straight. The natural home position for the index fingers will tend to hover over the lower part of the T and N keys. It is comfortable to access the D and H keys with a inward curling motion of the index finger. For this reason, Mod-DH is sometimes described as a type of Curl Mod. There is further information in this Guide to Curl.
The Colemak D and H keys (indicated by crosses) are moved to the more comfortable positions for the index finger on the bottom row (indicated with ticks).
» Revision History

The original Mod-DH was developed and launched by SteveP in October 2014. Following feedback, a minor revision was made in May 2017, switching the original M and K key positions for standard staggered keyboards. This mapping, with K in the middle row, is now known as Colemak-DHk. The original mapping, with M in the middle row, continued to be supported for ortholinear and other ergo boards, and became known as Colemak-DHm.

Due to the increasing popularity of ergonomic boards and to ease migration between keyboard types, as well as to simplify the Mod-DH offering, the M-K switch for standard staggered boards was reverted in October 2020.

It is now recommended to use the original release (a.k.a Colemak-DHm) on all keyboard types.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
The modern Dvorak layout (U.S. layout)

Dvorak /ˈdvɔːræk/ ⓘ[1] is a keyboard layout for English patented in 1936 by August Dvorak and his brother-in-law, William Dealey, as a faster and more ergonomic alternative to the QWERTY layout (the de facto standard keyboard layout). Dvorak proponents claim that it requires less finger motion[2] and as a result reduces errors, increases typing speed, reduces repetitive strain injuries,[3] or is simply more comfortable than QWERTY.[4][5][6]

Dvorak has failed to replace QWERTY as the most common keyboard layout, with the most pointed-to reasons being that QWERTY was popularized 60 years prior to Dvorak's creation, and that Dvorak's advantages are debated and relatively small.[7][8] However, most major modern operating systems (such as Windows,[9] macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, ChromeOS, and BSD) allow a user to switch to the Dvorak layout. The layout can be chosen for use with any hardware keyboard, regardless of any characters printed on the key caps.

Several modifications were designed by the team directed by Dvorak or by ANSI. These variations have been collectively or individually termed the Dvorak Simplified Keyboard, the American Simplified Keyboard or simply the Simplified Keyboard, but they all have come to be known commonly as the Dvorak keyboard or Dvorak layout.
Overview

Dvorak was designed with the belief that it would significantly increase typing speeds with respect to the QWERTY layout by alleviating some of its perceived shortcomings, such as:[10]

    Many common letter combinations require awkward finger motions.
    Some common letter combinations are typed with the same finger. (e.g. "ed" and "de")
    Many common letter combinations require a finger to jump over the home row.
    Many common letter combinations are typed with one hand while the other sits idle (e.g. was, were).
    Most typing is done with the left hand, which for most people is not the dominant hand.
    About 16% of typing is done on the lower row, 52% on the top row and only 32% on the home row.

August Dvorak studied letter frequencies and the physiology of the hand and created a new layout to alleviate the above problems, based on the following principles:[10]

    Letters should be typed by alternating between hands (which makes typing more rhythmic, increases speed, reduces error, and reduces fatigue). On a Dvorak keyboard, vowels and the most used symbol characters are on the left (with the vowels on the home row), while the most used consonants are on the right.
    For maximum speed and efficiency, the most common letters and bigrams should be typed on the home row, where the fingers rest, and under the strongest fingers. (About 70% of letter keyboard strokes on Dvorak are done on the home row and only 22% and 8% on the top and bottom rows respectively.)
    The least common letters should be on the bottom row which is the hardest row to reach.
    The right hand should do more of the typing because most people are right-handed.
    Bigrams should not be typed with adjacent fingers.
    Stroking should generally move from the edges of the board to the middle. An observation of this principle is that, for many people, when tapping fingers on a table, it is easier going from little finger to index than vice versa. This motion on a keyboard is called inboard stroke flow.[11]

The Dvorak layout is intended for the English language. For other European languages, letter frequencies, letter sequences, and bigrams differ from those of English. Also, many languages have letters that do not occur in English. For non-English use, these differences lessen the alleged advantages of the original Dvorak keyboard. However, the Dvorak principles have been applied to the design of keyboards for other languages, though the primary keyboards used by most countries are based on the QWERTY design.

The layout was completed in 1932 and granted U.S. patent 2,040,248 in 1936.[12] The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) designated the Dvorak keyboard as an alternative standard keyboard layout in 1982 (INCITS 207-1991 R2007; previously X4.22-1983, X3.207:1991),[13] "Alternate Keyboard Arrangement for Alphanumeric Machines". The original ANSI Dvorak layout was available as a factory-supplied option on the original IBM Selectric typewriter.[specify]
History

August Dvorak was an educational psychologist and professor of education at the University of Washington in Seattle.[14] Touch typing had come into wide use by that time and Dvorak became interested in the layout while serving as an advisor to Gertrude Ford, who was writing her master's thesis on typing errors. He quickly concluded that the QWERTY layout needed to be replaced, as QWERTY had been laid out not with the pure intention of ease and speed, but heavily including the intention of sequentially distant keyboard strokes so that the mechanical typewriter arms did not jam. Dvorak was joined by his brother-in-law William Dealey, a professor of education at the then North Texas State Teacher's College in Denton, Texas.

Dvorak and Dealey's objective was to scientifically design a keyboard to decrease typing errors, speed up typing, and lessen typist fatigue. They engaged in extensive research while designing their keyboard layout. In 1914 and 1915, Dealey attended seminars on the science of motion and later reviewed slow-motion films of typists with Dvorak. Dvorak and Dealey meticulously studied the English language, researching the most used letters and letter combinations. They also studied the physiology of the hand. The result in 1932 was the Dvorak Simplified Keyboard.[15]

In 1893, George Blickensderfer had developed a keyboard layout for the Blickensderfer typewriter model 5 that used the letters DHIATENSOR for the home row. Blickensderfer had determined that 85% of English words contained these letters. The Dvorak keyboard uses the same letters in its home row, apart from replacing R with U, and even keeps the consonants in the same order, but moves the vowels to the left: AOEUIDHTNS.

In 1933, Dvorak started entering typists trained on his keyboard into the International Commercial Schools Contest, which was a typing contest sponsored by typewriter manufacturers consisting of a series of professional and amateur contests. The professional contests had typists sponsored by typewriter companies to advertise their machines.

In the 1930s, the Tacoma, Washington, school district ran an experimental program in typing designed by Dvorak to determine whether to hold Dvorak layout classes. The experiment put 2,700 highschool students through Dvorak typing classes and found that students learned Dvorak in one-third the time it took to learn QWERTY. When a new school board was elected, however, it chose to terminate the Dvorak classes.[16] During World War II, while in the Navy, Dvorak conducted experiments which he claimed showed that typists could be retrained to Dvorak in a mere 10 days, though he discarded at least two previous studies which were conducted and whose results are unknown.[17]

With such great apparent gains, interest in the Dvorak keyboard layout increased by the early 1950s. Numerous businesses and government organizations began to consider retraining their typists on Dvorak keyboards. In this environment, the General Services Administration commissioned Earle Strong to determine whether the switch from QWERTY to Dvorak should be made. After retraining a selection of typists from QWERTY to Dvorak, once the Dvorak group had regained their previous typing speed (which took 100 hours of training, more than was claimed in Dvorak's Navy test), Strong took a second group of QWERTY typists chosen for equal ability to the Dvorak group and retrained them in QWERTY in order to improve their speed at the same time the Dvorak typists were training.

The carefully controlled study failed to show any benefit to the Dvorak keyboard layout in typing or training speed. Strong recommended speed training with QWERTY rather than switching keyboards, and attributed the previous apparent benefits of Dvorak to improper experimental design and outright bias on the part of Dvorak, who had designed and directed the previous studies. However, Strong had a personal grudge against Dvorak and had made public statements before his study opposing new keyboard designs.[18] After this study, interest in the Dvorak keyboard waned.[17] Later experiments have shown that many keyboard designs, including some alphabetical ones, allow very similar typing speeds to QWERTY and Dvorak when typists have been trained for them, suggesting that Dvorak's careful design principles may have had little effect because keyboard layout is only a small part of the complicated physical activity of typing.[19]

The work of Dvorak paved the way for other optimized keyboard layouts for English such as Colemak, but also for other languages such as the German Neo and the French BÉPO.[20]
Original layout
The typewriter keyboard layout that Dvorak and Dealey patented
The Dvorak typewriter keyboard layout that was publicly promulgated

Over the decades, symbol keys were shifted around the keyboard resulting in variations of the Dvorak design. In 1982, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) implemented a standard for the Dvorak layout known as ANSI X4.22-1983. This standard gave the Dvorak layout official recognition as an alternative to the QWERTY keyboard.[21]

The layout standardized by the ANSI differs from the original or "classic" layout devised and promulgated by Dvorak. Indeed, the layout promulgated publicly by Dvorak differed slightly from the layout for which Dvorak & Dealey applied for a patent in 1932 – most notably in the placement of Z. Today's keyboards have more keys than the original typewriter did, and other significant differences existed:

    The numeric keys of the classic Dvorak layout are ordered: 7531902468 (an order used today in the "Programmer Dvorak" layout[22])
    In the classic Dvorak layout, the question mark key ? is in the leftmost position of the upper row, while the slash key / is in the rightmost position of the upper row
    For the classic Dvorak layout, the following symbols share keys (the second symbol being printed when the [shift] key is pressed):
        colon : and question mark ?
        ampersand & and slash /

Modern U.S. Dvorak layouts almost always place ; and : together on a single key, and / and ? together on a single key. Thus, if the keycaps of a modern keyboard are rearranged so that the unshifted symbol characters match the classic Dvorak layout then the result is the ANSI Dvorak layout.
Availability in operating systems

Dvorak is included with all major operating systems (such as Windows, macOS, Linux and BSD). Since the introduction of iOS 8 in 2014, Apple iPhone and iPad users have been able to install third party keyboards on their touchscreen devices which allow for alternative keyboard layouts such as Dvorak on a system wide basis. Starting with iOS 16, the Dvorak keyboard became available as an included system wide keyboard.
Early PCs

Although some word processors could simulate alternative keyboard layouts by software, this was application specific; if more than one program was commonly used (e.g., a word processor and a spreadsheet), the user could be forced to switch layouts depending on the application. Occasionally, stickers were provided to place over the keys for these layouts.

However, IBM-compatible PCs used an active, "smart" keyboard. Striking a key generated a key "code", which was sent to the computer. Thus, changing to an alternative keyboard layout was accomplished most easily by simply buying a keyboard with the new layout. Because the key codes were generated by the keyboard itself, all software would respond accordingly. In the mid to late 1980s, a small industry for replacement PC keyboards developed; although most of these were concerned with keyboard "feel" and/or programmable macros, there were several with alternative layouts, such as Dvorak.
Amiga

Amiga operating systems from the 1986 version 1.2 onward allow the user to modify the keyboard layout by using the setmap command line utility with "usa2" as an argument, or later in 3.x systems by opening the keyboard input preference widget and selecting "Dvorak". Amiga systems versions 1.2 and 1.3 came with the Dvorak keymap on the Workbench disk. Versions 2.x came with the keymaps available on the "Extras" disk. In 3.0 and 3.1 systems, the keymaps were on the "Storage" disk. By copying the respective keymap to the Workbench disk or installing the system to a hard drive, Dvorak was usable for Workbench application programs.
Microsoft Windows

Versions of Microsoft Windows including Windows 95, Windows NT 3.51 and later have shipped with U.S. Dvorak layout capability.[9] Free updates to use the layout on earlier Windows versions are available for download from Microsoft.

Earlier versions, such as DOS 6.2/Windows 3.1, included four keyboard layouts: QWERTY, two-handed Dvorak, right-hand Dvorak, and left-hand Dvorak.

In May 2004, Microsoft published an improved version of its Keyboard Layout Creator (MSKLC version 1.3[23] – current version is 1.4[24]) that allows anyone to easily create any keyboard layout desired, thus allowing the creation and installation of any international Dvorak keyboard layout such as Dvorak Type II (for German), Svorak (for Swedish) etc.

Another advantage of the Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator with respect to third-party programs for installing an international Dvorak layout is that it allows creation of a keyboard layout that automatically switches to standard (QWERTY) after pressing the two hotkeys (SHIFT and CTRL).
Unix-based systems

Many operating systems based on UNIX, including OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenSolaris, Plan 9, and most Linux distributions, can be configured to use the U.S. Dvorak layout and a handful of variants. Furthermore, all current Unix-like systems with X.Org and appropriate keymaps installed (and virtually all systems meant for desktop use include them) are able to use any QWERTY-labeled keyboard as a Dvorak one without any problems or additional configuration. This eliminates the burden of producing additional keymaps for every variant of QWERTY provided. Runtime layout switching is also possible.
ChromeOS

ChromeOS and ChromiumOS offer Dvorak, and there are three different ways to switch the keyboard to the Dvorak layout.[25] ChromeOS includes the US Dvorak and UK Dvorak layouts.
Apple computers

Apple had Dvorak advocates since the company's early (pre-IPO) days. Several engineers devised hardware and software to remap the keyboard, which were used inside the company and even sold commercially.[citation needed]
Apple II

The Apple IIe had a keyboard ROM that translated keystrokes into characters. The ROM contained both QWERTY and Dvorak layouts, but the QWERTY layout was enabled by default. A modification could be made and was reversible and did no damage. By flipping a switch, the user could switch from one layout to the other. This modification was entirely unofficial but was inadvertently demonstrated at the 1984 Comdex show, in Las Vegas, by an Apple employee whose mission was to demonstrate Apple Logo II. The employee had become accustomed to the Dvorak layout and brought the necessary parts to the show, installed them in a demo machine, then did his Logo demo. Viewers, curious that he always reached behind the machine before and after allowing other people to type, asked him about the modification. He spent as much time explaining the Dvorak keyboard as explaining Logo.[citation needed]

Apple brought new interest to the Dvorak layout with the Apple IIc, which had a mechanical switch above the keyboard whereby the user could switch back and forth between the QWERTY and Dvorak.[26] The IIc Dvorak layout was even mentioned by 1984 advertisements, which stated that the world's fastest typist, Barbara Blackburn, had set a record on an Apple IIc with the Dvorak layout.

Dvorak was also selectable using the built-in control panel applet on the Apple IIGS.
Apple III

The Apple III used a keyboard-layout file loaded from a floppy disk: the standard system-software package included QWERTY and Dvorak layout files. Changing layouts required restarting the machine. [citation needed]
Apple Lisa

The Apple Lisa did not offer the Dvorak keyboard mapping, though it was purportedly available through undocumented interfaces.[27]
macOS
iBook with alpha and punctuation keys manually rearranged to the Dvorak layout

In the early days, Macintosh users could only use the Dvorak layout by editing the "System" file using Apple's "RESource EDITor" ResEdit – which allowed users to create and edit keyboard layouts, icons, and other interface components.

By 1994, a package named 'Electric Dvorak' by John Rethorst provided an easily user-installable "implementation [that] was particularly good on pre-system 7 Macs" as freeware, and especially useful for Mac+ and Mac SE machines running MacOS 6 and 7.

Another third-party developer offered a utility program called MacKeymeleon, which put a menu on the menu bar that allowed on-the-fly switching of keyboard layouts. Eventually, Apple Macintosh engineers built the functionality of this utility into the standard system software, along with a few layouts: QWERTY, Dvorak, French (AZERTY), and other foreign-language layouts.
2010 Apple Wireless Keyboard rearranged to the Dvorak layout

Since about 1998, beginning with Mac OS 8.6, Apple has included the Dvorak layout. It can be activated with the Keyboard Control Panel and selecting "Dvorak". The setting is applied once the Control Panel is closed out. Apple also includes a Dvorak variant they call "Dvorak – Qwerty ⌘". With this layout, the keyboard temporarily becomes QWERTY when the Command (⌘/Apple) key is held down. By keeping familiar keyboard shortcuts like "close" or "copy" on the same keys as ordinary QWERTY, this lets some people use their well-practiced muscle memory and may make the transition easier. Mac OS and subsequently Mac OS X allow additional "on-the-fly" switching between layouts: a menu-bar icon (by default, a national flag that matches the current language, a 'DV' represents Dvorak and a 'DQ' represents Dvorak – Qwerty ⌘) brings up a drop-down menu, allowing the user to choose the desired layout. Subsequent keystrokes will reflect the choice, which can be reversed the same way.

Mac OS X 10.5 "Leopard" and later offer a keyboard identifier program that asks users to press a few keys on their keyboards. Dvorak, QWERTY and many national variations of those designs are available. If multiple keyboards are connected to the same Mac computer, they can be configured to different layouts and use simultaneously. However should the computer shut down (lack of battery, etc.) the computer will revert to QWERTY for reboot, regardless of what layout the Admin was using.
Mobile phones and PDAs

Most mobile phones have software implementations of keyboards on a touch screen. Sometimes the keyboard layout can be changed by means of a freeware third-party utility, such as Hacker's Keyboard for Android, AE Keyboard Mapper for Windows Mobile, or KeybLayout for Symbian OS.

The RIM BlackBerry lines offer only QWERTY and its localized variants AZERTY and QWERTZ.
iOS

Apple iOS 4.0 and later supported external Dvorak keyboards. iOS 8.0 and later had the option to install onscreen keyboards from the App Store, which includes several free and paid Dvorak layouts. Apple added native support for the Dvorak keyboard with the release of iOS 16 in September 2022.[28]
Android

Google's Android OS touchscreen keyboard can use Dvorak and other nonstandard layouts natively as of version 4.1.[29]
Comparison of the QWERTY and Dvorak layouts
Keyboard strokes
Diagram of English letter frequencies on QWERTY (top) and Dvorak (bottom); darker shade indicates higher rate of occurrence.

The traditional method for touch typing requires typists to rest their fingers in home position (on QWERTY, the "ASDF" and "JKL;" keys). The row containing said keys is called the home row. The more strokes there are in the home row, the less movement the fingers must do, thus allowing a typist to type faster, more accurately, and with less strain to the hand and fingers.

According to letter frequency analysis, the majority of the Dvorak layout's key strokes (70%) are done in the home row, claimed to be the easiest row to type because the fingers rest there. Additionally, the Dvorak layout requires the fewest strokes on the bottom row (the most difficult row to type). By contrast, QWERTY requires typists to move their fingers to the top row for a majority of strokes and has only 32% of the strokes done in the home row.[30]

Because the Dvorak layout concentrates the vast majority of key strokes to the home row, the Dvorak layout uses about 63% of the finger motion required by QWERTY, which is claimed to make the keyboard more ergonomic.[31] Because the Dvorak layout requires less finger motion from the typist compared to QWERTY, some users with repetitive strain injuries have reported that switching from QWERTY to Dvorak alleviated or even eliminated their repetitive strain injuries;[32][33] however, no scientific study has been conducted verifying this.[34]

The typing loads between hands differs for each of the keyboard layouts. On QWERTY keyboards, 56% of the typing strokes are done by the left hand. As the right hand is dominant for the majority of people, the Dvorak keyboard puts the more often used keys on the right hand side, thereby having 56% of the typing strokes done by the right hand.[30]
Awkward strokes

Awkward strokes are undesirable because they slow down typing, increase typing errors, and increase finger strain. The term hurdling refers to an awkward stroke requiring a single finger to jump directly from one row, over the home row to another row (e.g., typing "minimum" [which often comes out as "minimun" or "mimimum"] on the QWERTY keyboard).[35] In the English language, there are about 1,200 words that require a hurdle on the QWERTY layout. In contrast, there are only a few words requiring a hurdle on the Dvorak layout (e.g. "spiky", where the "piky" is typed entirely on the left pointer finger; it corresponds to ";rgvt" on QWERTY).[35][36]
Hand alternation and finger repetition

It is claimed that words involving both hands can be typed faster than words involving only one hand, and with more hand alternation there is, the faster it can be typed. This improvement comes from splitting the workload more evenly between the two hands.[37]

The QWERTY layout has more than 3,000 words that are typed on the left hand alone and about 300 words that are typed on the right hand alone (the aforementioned word "minimum" is a right-hand-only word). In contrast, with the Dvorak layout, only a few words are typed using only the left hand and even fewer use the right hand alone.[30] [unreliable source?] This is because most syllables require at least one vowel, and, in a Dvorak layout, all the vowels (and "y") fall on the left side of the keyboard.

However, this benefit dwindles for longer words, because one English syllable can contain numerous consonants (as in "schmaltz" or "strengths").[38]
Standard keyboard

QWERTY enjoys advantages with respect to Dvorak due to the fact that it is the de facto standard keyboard:

    Keyboard shortcuts in most major operating systems, including Windows, are designed for QWERTY users, and can be awkward for some Dvorak users, such as Ctrl-C (Copy) and Ctrl-V (Paste). However, Apple computers have a "Dvorak – Qwerty ⌘" setting, which temporarily changes the keyboard mapping to QWERTY when the command (⌘) key is held, and Windows users can replicate this setting using AutoHotkey scripts.
    Some public computers (such as in libraries) will not allow users to change the keyboard to the Dvorak layout.
    Some standardized exams will not allow test takers to use the Dvorak layout (e.g. Graduate Record Examination).
    Support for Dvorak in games, especially those that make use of "WASD" – an ergonomic inverted-T shape using QWERTY but spread out across the keyboard in Dvorak – for in-game movement vary. Some games will automatically detect the keyboard is in Dvorak and adjust keys to the Dvorak equivalent, ",AOE", while others allow the same effect with some manual tweaking; games with hard-coded keybinds that do not allow changing the keys away from WASD become practically impossible to play under Dvorak.
    People who can touch type with a QWERTY keyboard will be less productive with alternative layouts until they retrain themselves, even if these are closer to the optimum.[39]
    Not all people use keyboard fingerings as specified in touch-typing manuals due to either preference or anatomical difference. This can change the relative efficiency on alternative layouts.

Variants
One-handed versions
Left-handed Dvorak layout with the ")(" placement of parenthesis
Right-handed Dvorak layout

In the 1960s, Dvorak designed left- and right-handed Dvorak layouts for touch-typing with only one hand. He tried to minimize the need to move the hand from side to side (lateral travel), as well as to minimize finger movement. Each layout has the hand resting near the center of the keyboard, rather than on one side: the index finger rests on E and the pinky on D.

Because the layouts require less hand movement than layouts designed for two hands, they can be more accessible to single-handed users. The layouts are also used by people with full use of two hands, who prefer having one hand free while they type with the other.

The left-handed Dvorak and right-handed Dvorak keyboard layouts are mostly each other's mirror image, with the exception of some punctuation keys, some of the less-used letters, and the 'wide keys' (Enter, Shift, etc.). Dvorak arranged the parentheses as ")(" on his left-handed keyboard, but some keyboards place them in the typical "()" reading order. Dvorak's original ")(" placement is the more widely distributed layout, and the version that ships with Windows.
Programmer Dvorak
The Programmer Dvorak layout

Programmer Dvorak was developed by Roland Kaufmann and was designed based on code in C, Java, Pascal, Lisp, HTML, CSS and XML.[40]

While the letters are in the same places as the regular Dvorak layout, the numbers and most symbols have been moved. The top row contains brackets, curly brackets, and parentheses positioned in a way which makes opening and closing these symbols more intuitive. Some other common programming symbols are also placed in the top row for easy access: (&%=*+!#). The numbers are in the top row as well but the Shift key must be used to type them like on typewriters. The numbers are arranged with the odds under the left hand and the evens under the right hand, as on Dvorak's original layout. Another notable change is the swap of the semicolon/colon key with the quotation/apostrophe key. Many programming languages require each line to end with a semicolon; therefore, it makes sense to put the semicolon in a spot which is easy to reach.

This layout is preinstalled on some Linux distributions but not on Windows or macOS.
Research on efficiency

The Dvorak layout is designed to improve touch-typing, in which the user rests their fingers on the home row. It would have less effect on other methods of typing such as hunt-and-peck. Some studies show favorable results for the Dvorak layout in terms of speed, while others do not show any advantage, with many accusations of bias or lack of scientific rigour among researchers. The first studies were performed by Dvorak and his associates. These showed favorable results and generated accusations of bias.[41]

In 1956, a study with a sample of 10 people in each group conducted by Earle Strong of the U.S. General Services Administration found Dvorak no more efficient than QWERTY[42] and claimed it would be too costly to retrain the employees.[39] The failure of the study to show any benefit to switching, along with its illustration of the considerable cost of switching, discouraged businesses and governments from making the switch.[43] This study was similarly criticised as being biased in favor of the QWERTY control group.[10]

In the 1990s, economists Stan Liebowitz and Stephen E. Margolis wrote articles in the Journal of Law and Economics[41] and Reason magazine[17] where they rejected Dvorak proponents' claims that the dominance of the QWERTY is due to market failure brought on by QWERTY's early adoption, writing, "[T]he evidence in the standard history of Qwerty versus Dvorak is flawed and incomplete. [...] The most dramatic claims are traceable to Dvorak himself; and the best-documented experiments, as well as recent ergonomic studies, suggest little or no advantage for the Dvorak keyboard."[41][44]

Research published in 2013 by economist Ricard Torres found that the Dvorak was more efficient than QWERTY.[45]
Resistance to adoption

Although the Dvorak design is the only other keyboard design registered with ANSI and is provided with all major operating systems, attempts to convert universally to the Dvorak design have not succeeded. The failure of Dvorak to displace QWERTY has been the subject of some studies.[41][46]

A discussion of the Dvorak layout is sometimes used as an exercise by management consultants to illustrate the difficulties of change. The Dvorak layout is often used in economics textbooks as a standard example of network effects,[47][48] though this method has been criticized.[41]

Most keyboards are based on QWERTY layouts, despite the availability of other keyboard layouts, including the Dvorak.
Other languages

Although DSK is implemented in many[citation needed] languages other than English, there are still potential issues. Every Dvorak implementation for other languages has the same difficulties as for Roman characters. However, other (occidental) language orthographies can have other typing needs for optimization (many are very different from English). Because Dvorak was optimized for the statistical distribution of letters of English text, keyboards for other languages would likely have different distributions of letter frequencies. Hence, non-QWERTY-derived keyboards for such languages would need a keyboard layout that might be quite different from the Dvorak layout for English.
Brazilian Portuguese

There are some non standard Brazilian Dvorak keyboard designs currently in development. The simpler design (also called BRDK) is just a Dvorak layout plus some keys from the Brazilian ABNT2 keyboard layout. Another design, however, was specifically designed for Brazilian Portuguese, by means of a study that optimized typing statistics, like frequent letters, trigraphs and words.[49] It's called BR-Nativo and is available on the Keyman application and Keyman Website.[50]
Danish

The Danish layout DanskDvorak[51] is similar to the Norwegian.
Finnish

A FinnishDAS keyboard layout[52] follows many of Dvorak's design principles, but the layout is an original design based on the most common letters and letter combinations of the Finnish language. Matti Airas has also made another layout for Finnish.[53] Finnish can also be typed reasonably well with the English Dvorak layout if the letters ä and ö are added. The Finnish ArkkuDvorak keyboard layout[54] adds both on a single key and keeps the American placement for each other character. As with DAS, the SuoRak[55] keyboard is designed by the same principles as the Dvorak keyboard, but with the most common letters of the Finnish language taken into account. Contrary to DAS, it keeps the vowels on the left side of the keyboard and most consonants on the right hand side.
French
Main article: BÉPO
Dvorak, with a French BÉPO layout

For French, there is a Dvorak layout.[56] And there's also the Bépo layout which is designed based on Dvorak's method of analyzing key frequency.[57] Although Bépo's placement of keys is optimised for French, the scheme also facilitates key combinations for typing characters of other European languages, Esperanto and various symbols.[20]
German

The most common German Dvorak layout is the German Type II layout. It is available for Windows, Linux, and macOS. There is also the Neo layout[58] and the de ergo layout,[59] both original layouts that also use many of Dvorak's design principles. Because of the similarity of both languages, even the standard Dvorak layout (with minor modifications) is an ergonomic improvement with respect to the common QWERTZ layout. One such modification puts ß at the shift+comma position and the umlaut dots as a dead key accessible via shift+period (standard German keyboards have a separate less/greater key to the right of the left shift key).
Icelandic

An IcelandicDvorak layout exists, created by a student at Reykjavik University. It retains the same basic layout as the standard Dvorak but features special Alt-Gr functions to allow easy usage for common characters such as "þ", "æ", "ö" and dead-keys to allow the typing of characters such as "å" and "ü".
Norwegian

The Norwegian implementation (known as "NorskDvorak") is similar to Parment's layout, with "æ" and "ø" replacing "ä" and "ö".
Polish

Polish propositions of a national keyboard layout smiliar to Dvorak were created in 1950s but were not introduced due to a new version of Polish Norm in 1958 with modernized QWERTZ layout.[60]
Romanian

A Romanian version of the Dvorak layout (named Popak after the name of its inventor) was released in October 2008. It is available for both Windows and Linux.[61]
Spanish

Three Spanish[62] layouts exist.
Swedish
The Svorak Keyboard layout

The Svorak (Swedish Dvorak) layout places the three extra Swedish vowels (å, ä and ö) on the leftmost three keys of the upper row, which correspond to punctuation symbols on the English Dvorak layout. This retains the original English DVORAK design goal of keeping all vowels by the left hand, including Y which is a vowel in Swedish.

The displaced punctuation symbols (period and comma) end up at the edges of the keyboard, but every other symbol is in the same place as in the standard Swedish QWERTY layout, facilitating easier re-learning. The Alt-Gr key is required to access some of the punctuation symbols. This major design goal also makes it possible to "convert" a Swedish QWERTY keyboard to SVORAK simply by moving keycaps around.

Unlike for Norway, there is no standard Swedish Dvorak layout and the community is fragmented.[63] In Svdvorak, by Gunnar Parment, the punctuation symbols are as they were in the English version; the first extra vowel (å) is placed in the far left of the top row while the other two (ä and ö) are placed at the far left of the bottom row.
Turkish

The Turkish F keyboard layout (link in Turkish) is also an original design with Dvorak's design principles, however it's not clear if it is inspired by Dvorak or not. Turkish F keyboard was standardized in 1955 and the design has been a requirement for imported typewriters since 1963.
UK English

Whether Dvorak or QWERTY, a United Kingdom keyboard differs from the U.S. equivalent in these ways: the " and @ are swapped; the backslash/pipe [\ |] key is in an extra position (to the right of the lower left shift key); there is a taller return/enter key, which places the hash/tilde [# ~] key to its lower left corner (see picture).[citation needed]

The most notable difference between the U.S. and UK Dvorak layouts is the [2 "] key remains on the top row, whereas the U.S. [' "] key moves. This means that the query [/ ?] key retains its classic Dvorak location, top right, albeit shifted[citation needed].

Interchanging the [/ ?] and [' @] keys more closely matches the U.S. layout, and the use of "@" has increased in the information technology age. These variations, plus keeping the numerals in Dvorak's idealised order, appear in the Classic Dvorak and Dvorak for the Left Hand and Right Hand varieties.

Presenting Romak, a keyboard layout optimized for Portuguese and English.
The Romak Keyboard Layout

Romak is a keyboard layout built for Portuguese and English users, with a goal to enhance hand alternation, minimize finger movement, reduce single-finger bigrams, and decrease reliance on the pinky and central columns.

Romak is inspired mostly by BEAKL and Engram, but resembles some modern keyboard layouts, like Apt, Sturdy, Semimak, Canary and Recuva, but was not inspired by any of them (I did not know about them when Romak was designed).
Romak 34

This is a variation of Romak that can be used by anyone with a 34 keys columnar staggered keyboard, in the common 3x5+2 format.

  Q  B  M  G  K    X  L  O  U  Y
  D  N  S  T  W    Z  R  A  E  I
  /  F  C  P  V    J  H  ,  .  ;

Romak 24

This is the default Romak layout, designed for the uncommon format 1333+2, in which there is no center columns and only one key per pinky. A secondary alpha layer is necessary to place the missing alphas. Common accented letters, in Portuguese, are also available in this secondary alpha layer.

Alpha 1 Layer:

     B  M  G          L  O  U   
  D  N  S  T          R  A  E  I 
     F  C  P          H  ,  .   
           Rp Sp   A2 SF

Rp = Repeat Last Key
Sp = Space
Sf = One Shot Shift
A2 = One Shot Alpha 2 layer

Alpha 2 Layer:

     Q  Qu K          Ô  Ó  Ú
  Y  Z  X  W          Ã  Á  É  Í
     J  Ç  V          Õ  Â  Ê
           '  _  _  _

Combos for alphas and common symbols:

Alpha 1 combos:

NS = Q, MG = K, ST = W, CP = V,

LO = X, RA = Z, H, = J, AE = Y

Alpha 2 combos:

ZX = (, JÇ = _, QuK = #, XW = ', ÇV = ?

ÔÓ = :, ÃÁ = -, ÕÂ = !, ÁÉ = ), ÂÊ = À

Agora que este post já tem algum tempo, alguém tem algum feedback sobre este layout?

Estou à procura de um layout diferente do QWERTY para aprender. Estava a pensar no Colemak DH mas como vou continuar a escrever em português fui à procura de alguma coisa que tivesse o português em conta.

O que acham deste layout? Confortável? E para programar, já alguém experimentou?

Apenas algumas poucas pessoas me procuraram pra dizer que pretendiam experimentar o layout. E talvez por não ter inglês como primeiro foco, desperte menos interesse nas comunidades de layouts alternativos.

O que posso dizer é que uso a versão de 24 teclas em todos os meus teclados desde que criei o layout. Estou bastante satisfeito com o conforto e velocidade que consegui nele, tanto para textos do dia a dia quanto para programar.

Ainda usando esse layout? Me parece que algumas palavras em português nesse layout vão ser complicadas de se digitar, comparando com canary.

Sim, tenho usado ele diariamente. Não há nada que me incomode nele no momento. Mas Canary parece ser um layout muito bom também, só não tive oportunidade de testa-lo antes de criar o Romak.

Vejo alguns problemas com Canary no entanto.

Digito bastante em inglês também, e W é tão frequente no inglês quanto o Q em português, por isso teria que mover o W (junto com K e Z) pra camada de acentos, visto que não uso as teclas superiores das colunas centrais e dos mindinhos. Talvez troca-lo de lugar com o / seria uma opção interessante, já que tenho / e ? nas minhas camadas de símbolos, assim como ;.

Q e M na coluna central também não me agradam muito, justamente pela alta frequência no português.

Pode me dar alguns exemplos de palavras que não parecem ficar bem em Romak? Realmente não há nenhuma que me incomode no momento.

Na verdade eu tô pensando em mudar de layout (estou usando o Colemak-DH no momento) Mas eu digito principalmente em português, usando inglês de vez em quando. Eu só cheguei a testar no monkeytype achei o Canary um pouco mais confortável que o seu layout, mas talvez seja mais pela similaridade com o Colemak.

O que me incomoda mesmo são palavras com "e" e "u" tipo "que", "eu" "quero", e palavras terminadas em "ão" mas aparentemente não seria um problema se eu estivesse usando a layer de acentos. (Quando eu tô testando o layout eu costumo colocar o lazy mode no monkeytype)

Mas acho que vou testar seu layout por uma semana já que achei a proposta interessante.

Bacana. Qualquer dúvida pode me procurar por DM.

Sobre os bigramas eu e ue, cheguei a ter alguma dificuldade com eles no começo, assim como com ou e uo. Mas isso passou com algumas semanas de uso. Hoje as únicas letras que ainda erro com alguma frequência são o n e r, costumo trocar as duas, não sei bem porque isso acontece. Mas isso também tem melhorado com o tempo. Edit: Acabei por alterar a posição do r pra resolver esse problema.

6. Colemak Mod-DH
Colemak Mod-DH

Colemak Mod-DH introduces a minor modification to the Colemak keyboard layout, designed to make typing more comfortable. The resulting layout is commonly known as Colemak-DH.
Colemak Mod-DH main keys for a ANSI keyboard (default configuration), known as Colemak-DH.
Keys are colored according to the finger that should be used. The 10 most common English letters are assigned to the 10 easiest keys (highlighted in red).

Colemak is a great layout, but that doesn't mean it's impossible to improve on! The idea behind Mod‑DH is that by making an adjustment to the placement of a small number of keys, it is possible to gain a significant improvement in ergonomics and comfort. See this comparison of Mod-DH with other layouts.

There are separate implementations optimized for ISO, ANSI and matrix keyboards.
Highlights:

    Places the heavily used D and H keys in more comfortable and easier-to-reach positions.
    Moves G to a slightly easier position also, reverting to its placement in Qwerty.
    Reduces usage of the difficult-to-reach centre column by about half.
    Utilizes the "Angle Mod" (see below) to promote a more comfortable, symmetrical typing posture on standard keyboards.
    Retains Colemak's many other strengths, such as its home key placement and low rate of same-finger bigrams.
    No keys change fingers from standard Colemak, making it easy to adopt for existing Colemak users.

The Colemak forum has threads containing some background information to the creation of this mod, and also a more detailed discussion of it.
» Changes From Colemak

The mod consists of two parts, the left-hand "D" change, and the right-hand "H" change.
Changed keys relative to standard Colemak. Note that none of the changes move keys to a new finger. This makes the mod easy to learn and also retains Colemak's excellent stats on same-finger bigrams.
Left Hand Changes

The primary change is to the left hand:
1. The "Angle Mod" is applied to keys Z, X, C. This moves these keys one space to the left but maintains the conventional finger assignment.
2. Three keys are relocated: D, G, B. This makes the D key much easier to type, using your index finger. The position of G is also improves, and reverts to its Qwerty placement. The B key moves from the hard-to-reach position at the bottom-middle to the new location on the top row.
Right Hand Changes

There is a minor change to the right hand:
The H and M keys exchange places. This makes H easier to type, being a more common character than M. Since HE is the second most common bigram in English, it also makes it more comfortable to type several very common words such as "the", "then", "where", etc.
» Changes From Qwerty
Changed keys relative to Qwerty. In total, 19 keys are changed, plus the application of the Angle Mod to an additional 3. Of these, only 12 keys change fingers, same as Colemak.

If you are currently using Qwerty and looking for a better layout, then both standard Colemak and Mod-DH are excellent choices. The change from Qwerty is not easy and can take some time, but is worthwhile in the end. If you start with Colemak but find the frequent reaching for D, H and G unsatisfactory, or find the common HE bigram uncomfortable, then Mod-DH is for you!
» The Angle Mod
The Angle Mod makes it possible to adopt a more comfortable typing posture by introducing a degree of symmetry on a standard, staggered keyboard. The keys along the bottom-left are moved one space to the left, but you should continue to type these keys using the conventional finger assignment, i.e. Z=pinky, X=ring, C=middle, V=index.

The Angle Mod on an ISO keyboard. ANSI keyboards are also supported with a slight variation. Keys are colored by finger assignment.

See also: Guide to the Angle Mod.

The Angle Mod is a good innovation, and has been popular in the Colemak community for almost as long as Colemak itself. But, in its default implementation (affecting all five bottom-left keys), it results in the rare V moving to one of best locations on the keyboard. Mod-DH fixes this by assigning D to that key instead, and utilizes the Angle Mod for Z,X,C only. An important feature of Mod-DH is that on standard keyboards, use of the Angle Mod is intrinsic to the layout design.
» What's wrong with standard Colemak anyway?

For many people, nothing! But others who have tried Colemak have identified flaws, and have found the transition from Qwerty frustrating. Some have even given up on Colemak as a result. I believe that those who experience problems with Colemak need not give up on it. Mod-DH was created to fix the most common complaints, and to give a more comfortable Colemak experience for those who want it.

The most commonly identified flaw is Colemak's placement of the D and H keys. As the 8th and 10th most common letters in English, they should ideally be in easy-to-reach positions. Colemak places them in the centre columns, which means a lateral motion of the hand is required to access them. If you try this motion frequently, you'll probably find it is somewhat less comfortable than moving the index finger downward to where Mod-DH places those keys. The H-E combination is often cited as a common English bigram that is unduly awkward with Colemak. If you find it easier for the index finger to curl inward to access the bottom row than stretching for the centre column, then you'll find Mod-DH more comfortable to use.
	left 	right 	total
Colemak 	7.76% 	7.02% 	14.78%
Colemak Mod-DH 	4.49% 	3.31% 	7.80%
Usage of the centre-column keys for standard Colemak and Mod-DH

My own experience is that I used standard Colemak for several months, but was unsatisfied with the frequent reaching for the middle of the keyboard to type D and H, and to some extent G. I initially stuck with it, being reluctant to change an established layout and thinking Colemak's other benefits would outweigh its drawbacks. And to be fair, for the most part they do. But I eventually came to realize that in fact there is no need to compromise: By applying Mod-DH, it is possible to keep all Colemak's best features, while placing some common letters in easier-to-access locations and reducing the need to reach for the centre column. Within a couple of days using the left-hand "D" mod, I found it to be a noticeable, significant improvement over standard Colemak. And when applying the right-hand "H" mod, common English words containing HE (the, then, where…) became almost effortless.
» Curl Technique
The recommended typing technique for Mod-DH users is to have the hands approach the keyboard at an angle, symmetrically, and with wrists straight. The natural home position for the index fingers will tend to hover over the lower part of the T and N keys. It is comfortable to access the D and H keys with a inward curling motion of the index finger. For this reason, Mod-DH is sometimes described as a type of Curl Mod. There is further information in this Guide to Curl.
The Colemak D and H keys (indicated by crosses) are moved to the more comfortable positions for the index finger on the bottom row (indicated with ticks).
» Revision History

The original Mod-DH was developed and launched by SteveP in October 2014. Following feedback, a minor revision was made in May 2017, switching the original M and K key positions for standard staggered keyboards. This mapping, with K in the middle row, is now known as Colemak-DHk. The original mapping, with M in the middle row, continued to be supported for ortholinear and other ergo boards, and became known as Colemak-DHm.

Due to the increasing popularity of ergonomic boards and to ease migration between keyboard types, as well as to simplify the Mod-DH offering, the M-K switch for standard staggered boards was reverted in October 2020.

It is now recommended to use the original release (a.k.a Colemak-DHm) on all keyboard types.

Welcome to the Canary Keyboard Layout!

This layout is the result of collaboration between many of the top layout creators from the AKL (Alternate Keyboard Layout) community, and reflects a lot of different ideas and optimization strategies combined together into one.

Downloads of premade layouts for Windows, Mac, and Linux are available from the Releases page.

We are publicly releasing this in conjunction with a typing tournament, and in partnership with MonkeyType. Please refer to the contact links at the bottom for how to get in touch or participate.

Layout

Here is the layout as-designed to be used with Angle Mod on a Row Stagger (standard) keyboard:

w l y p k z x o u ; [ ] \
 c r s t b f n e i a '
  j v d g q m h / , .

And here is a version that can be used on Ortho keyboards:

w l y p b z f o u '
c r s t g m n e i a
q j v d k x h / , .

Since most people using these boards will be uploading their own custom firmware, we are not suggesting how to solve for placing other keys such as ;[]\.
Design

Canary is based on a few core concepts that have been seen in various layouts, combined together in a novel way. Terminology used is defined below for reference.
The primary guiding principle is High Rolls

Compared to most layouts that don't also sacrifice SFBs or Redirects, Canary has extremely high total Rolls -- over 55% of all Trigrams. This gives it a very "flowy" feel compared to layouts with high Alternates.

It does not overly emphasize inward-rolls over outward-rolls, or vice versa. While there is some conventional wisdom that in-rolls are easier or faster, this is anecdotal at best, and many of us feel any benefit is quickly overcome with use.

As a result, the home-row represents a mixture of both rolling directions, though it does emphasize in-rolls a bit more. This is accomplished by having T on the left index and N on the right. These letters are very high frequency, but they also are most common after many other consonants or vowels, so they will often be the target of rolling sequences on that hand.
More ring/middle/index load and less pinky load

While it's possible to arrange a layout to make great use of top/bottom-row pinky sequences, this is the one finger that grows in a wide range of lengths across the population, making it very easy for some and nearly impossible for others to use well in this way. Canary minimizes this use by limiting it to have almost 0% SFBs and minimal redirect sequences.
Primary vowels on one hand only

One of the most common ways for modern layouts to improve overall stats (especially Rolls) is to put all of the vowels onto one hand. This does lead to some potential challenges since they combine with almost every other letter (and each other) in such high frequency, so it's easy to end up with lots of SFBs.

In addition, vowels participate in lots of Trigram sequences that are also very common such as ea, ou, ai, oa, ui, ue, and so on.

Canary has a vowel arrangement that is designed to minimize SFBs and Redirects without overloading the pinky.
Semivowels

Another challenge with English is where to put the semivowels W and Y, as these combine at relatively high frequencies with a variety of other letters. We decided to move them to the other hand in a way that avoids both the primary vowels and the highest frequency Consonant-Semivowel combinations (such as ly, ty, tw, sw, and so on).

W takes the top left pinky spot because this finger has less to do in an Angle Mod setup, and Y sits in the ysv column. The tradeoff is making the few words that have vy or sy sequences SFBs, but these are reasonably low-frequency Bigrams compared to all the other candidate spots.
Colemak DH similarity and problem-solving

Anyone familiar with Colemak DH mod will recognize there are a lot of similarities with Canary. This isn't an accident as there are many good aspects to this layout, but also some things we feel are downsides.

First, it doesn't take advantage of the Row Stagger inner-index keys on the bottom row (see linked section), opting instead to put K and V there. Both of these keys are relatively low frequency, and they interact with either N or the vowels, or both. Some folks have opted to swap them but that results in the eve Redirect sequence which isn't very comfortable. We decided to keep both on the left hand instead.

Secondly, the upper right vowel cluster includes Y, causing one of the most common words you to be a Redirect that changes rows twice (top-home-top).

Lastly, while having O on the home row does increase the amount of home-row usage over Canary, it also uses the worse SFB ue vs Canary's oe column. We have tried to emphasize middle finger use over ring since the middle is the strongest/longest finger for most people.
L and R

Two of the most difficult consonants to place overall for English are L and R. These "liquids" combine with nearly every other letter in all kinds of sequences, but they are conveniently relatively low-frequency with each other, and by themselves middle of the pack for letter frequencies.

As a result, we put them on the ring finger like many other modern layouts have done (such as Semimak), and find this is an acceptable tradeoff in finger balance, SFB minimization, and is in line with our high Rolling goals.
Quote

Finally, the ' symbol is very problematic in many layouts, as it combines with all sorts of other letters (n't, 's, 're to name a few). But one that it combines with very little is A, so it gets to retain its Qwerty spot.
Row Stagger

Row Stagger refers to the design of the common keyboard that has been in use for over 100 years, where each row is staggered (shifted) relative to the next row. This results in some interesting features, some which are negative (see Angle Mod below), and some which are positive.

The positive ones are taken advantage of in Canary in the following ways:

When looking at the keys around both index-finger home keys, we can see that there is a potential for very convenient key arrangements. The two clusters in question look like this:

 T    N
D G  M H

The distance to reach either the G or M from the index home keys is much lower than if the rows weren't staggered, so we have placed medium-frequency letters there.

Similarly, just like Colemak DH, we have placed D and H in the stronger of the two bottom row positions, where the index fingers can curl slightly in to reach them.

Lastly, in addition to the Angle Mod considerations, there is also the problem of the Qwerty B and Y positions. These are the hardest to reach on Row Stagger, and so Canary has the least-frequent letters there, Q and Z respectively. Q is on the bottom as most people press that key with their left index, and since all vowels are on the right, the most common sequence QU does not require an awkward stretch on one hand. This does mean that some words containing Z will be slightly more awkward, but since it's the rarest letter, this is an acceptable tradeoff.
Angle Mod

"Angle Mod" refers colloquially to a couple of things that are sometimes mixed up, both having to do with the lower left of a Row Stagger keyboard:

    Modifying a layout to account for the stagger angle
    Which fingers you use for which keys

Concerning the former, this is accomplished by taking the far left key on the bottom row and moving it to the Qwerty B position, then shifting the remaining 4 keys to the left to take its spot.

This change can be seen by comparing the Ortho version of Canary with the base version, where QJVD_ gets rotated and becomes JVD_Q.

(The _ is G in the base version but was rotated up in the Ortho, and K is there instead, but the principle is the same.)

The second meaning of "Angle Mod" (often called "Angle Cheat" if the letters aren't moved) refers to adjusting which fingers hit which keys in the lower left by recognizing that "traditional" touch-typing technique is not very ergonomic, and a better approach is to use the following mapping:

    Ring Finger => Qwerty Z
    Middle Finger => Qwerty X
    Index Finger => Qwerty C and V

It is very very important for you to use the Angle Mod fingerings on Canary. All of the heavy optimization completely depends on it.
Ortho

As seen in the opening, the Ortho version is as follows:

w l y p b z f o u '
c r s t g m n e i a
q j v d k x h / , .

This variation has been modified from the Row Stagger base layout by rotating the keys that are harder to reach on Ortho (G and M) up to home-row, and rotating the other index keys up or down to compensate, based on letter frequency and also affinity of common sequences, such that row-skips are minimized as much as possible.

We recommend putting your space key on the left thumb to properly balance the right-hand bias of the layout.
Terminology

    Bigram: A sequence of two keys (not containing space)
    Trigram: A sequence of three keys (not containing space)
    SFB: Same Finger Bigram; a bigram that requires the same finger for both keys
    Redirect: A trigram which changes direction on the same hand (excluding SFBs)
    Roll: A trigram which changes hands once (excluding SFBs)
    Alternate: A trigram which changes hands twice (excluding SFBs)

Etymology

"Canary" comes from the phrase "canary in a coal mine". Adopters of this layout are likened to miners, and the mine is a layout with extremely high roll stats.

The layout was almost called hotdog.

Sturdy vs. Canary: Any Opinions?

I’m planning on taking the plunge for a new layout (I only know qwerty) primarily with comfort/ergonomics in mind. I type on a Corne (42 key, column stagger, split) and now that I have a board that fits my hand well the issues of qwerty are driving me crazy!

Most people seem to go Colemak-DH, and I was thinking of doing so as well, but as I looked more some of the newer even more optimized layouts appealed to me, namely Canary and Sturdy (I like the idea of trying something with rolls and a vowel cluster).

For people who have tried both, what do you think? Which did you prefer and why? Any other layouts I should consider with these goals in mind?

My alt layouts post might be a useful overview. Both Canary and Sturdy have great reviews from the community and excellent metrics. Canary is a bit higher rolls while Sturdy is better on redirects. I haven't used Canary myself. I've been happily using Ikcelaks' Magic Sturdy, a variant of Sturdy.
R4_Unit

Indeed, your article is the one that got me looking beyond Colemak! (Also your symbol layer post and thumb key overuse post were very useful to me when I started switching to customizable keyboards—so I’m a fan!)

For Magic Sturdy, you find the magic key is effective? I’m also interested in shorthand writing systems, and the operation of the magic key reminds me of the kind of thinking common in shorthand. I’d be pretty tempted to at least flash an implementation to my board to see how it feels…
pgetreuer

6mo ago

That's great! Thanks for the feedback. The magic key is effective, especially shorthands, and this can be done with any layout! It doesn't have to be Magic Sturdy. Put the alternate repeat key somewhere easy to press, and define alternate keys to customize how it behaves. See my keymap for how I use it.

Magic Sturdy takes alternate repeating to the next level by eliminating the main SFBs in the layout and incorporating the magic key in easy reach among the alphas. This is comfortable. To give fair warning, it's probably the case that Magic Sturdy and other layouts with adaptive keys take longer to get proficient with than "normal" layouts do. Certain character sequences can be typed in more than one way, depending on where the magic key is used, and sometimes it is a puzzle how to type optimally.

After about a year of Magic Sturdy use, I type at a (not impressive but productive) speed of 70 wpm. I use the magic key fluidly for typing familiar words, though might still get puzzled once in a while on unfamiliar words.

Can the repeat key be configured on https://usevia.app/ ?
pgetreuer
•
6mo ago

I don't believe so. VIA exposes only a subset of what QMK can do, unfortunately. To get the repeat key and full ability to customize it, you'll want to use QMK directly. See the QMK setup guide for where to get started.

Magic Sturdy seems to swap the EU and AO columns of Sturdy. Have you used both layouts? Which arrangement do you prefer?
pgetreuer
•
6mo ago

Great question! I wondered this myself, and spent ~one month trying it each way. My conclusion is that there is no huge difference. Either way, redirect stats are about the same, and the summed frequencies of E and U is close to that of A and O . Both have certain trigrams as awkward redirects, though none that bother me terribly.

In the end, I slightly prefer the EU column on the middle finger rather than ring finger. My limited rationale is that middle finger is stronger, E is the most common English letter, and in Vim, E comes to use more frequently, being navigation key, than do A O U. That works for me. I'd certainly understand a preference for the other way.
Sfaeae

    the summed frequencies of E and U is close to that of A and O

While the usage is close, the finger distance is different. AO will have more finger distance, meaning your finger has to move up and down more than EU.

Personally, I am unsure which I would prefer, as I think my right ring finger has about the same amount of dexterity as my right middle finger.

Thank you so much four your Symbols layer design article and also comparing various layouts. This is how I actually got into Canary. And I love my symbols layer which is based on your symbols layer with a bit customization due to my programming language.

I really wanted to try your Magic Sturdy, but too bad I am using ZMK firmware and those magic keys are not supported yet.

Are you me? I just got my first minimalist split ortholinear keyboard too, and am deciding between Sturdy and Canary, although Colemak-DH seems the 'default'.

Yeah I’ve been on split for a long time (4 years?) and on a Corne for about 6 months. I’ve been loving all of it, and I basically see qwerty as the biggest remaining barrier. How are you currently leaning?

A hand drawing of my layout taped to the wall above my monitor and I play one of these for a few minutes every day:

https://www.keybr.com/

https://www.typelit.io/

and if you choose Colemak: https://gnusenpai.net/colemakclub/

You can have a Sturdy alpha layer and a qwerty alpha layer so you can keep using qwerty for work and practice sturdy until you're better at it. Or just do what I do and have 2 separate keyboards so my brain gets used to full-sized=qwerty and minimal=sturdy (or canary or colemak).

BTW I ended up choosing sturdy (just starting learning it)

Awesome! I’ll need to ask you about it in a month or so. What made you pick Sturdy in the end?

They’re so similar, it was a toss up. I looked at the layouts and pretend typed a few words on a QWERTY keyboard ignoring what came out just for the feel. I also found more people online praising Sturdy. Not much to go on.

I am also using 42 key split and I was sitting exactly on the same fence 1.5 months ago and went with Canary ortho version and quite happy. Learning using keybr.com and https://monkeytype.com

Canary has better support for various operating systems. However, the only fear I have is that Canary staggered is very different from the Canary ortho layout, and jumping from ortho split to laptops keyboard feels like would be a struggle for me.

QMK Implementation

I have added the implementation of Magic Sturdy that I use. The keymap file is for a ZSA moonlander, but the code trivially generalizes to any keyboard. However, it does rely on a pending QMK feature that is still an open PR. You will need to use the PR's branch to compile this code. Here is the PR: qmk/qmk_firmware#19700
Goals

Magic Sturdy is a minor but powerful variation of the already excellent STRD1 layout that @O-X-E-Y generated in Oxeylyzer. The core purpose of the magic key is to nearly eliminate all problem SFBs and scissors from the layout.

Soon after, it was extended to provide briefs for of the six most common trigrams (THE, ING, AND, ION, FOR, and YOU) and a few other sequences. The briefs for WOULD, WHICH, BECAUSE, and BEFORE are a recent and somewhat of an experiment to test if comparatively rare but high impact briefs are worth using.
Features

The most important mappings for improving typing flow are the vowel mappings that convert the SFBs on UE, EU, and OA to inward rolls; the left-index mappings that convert the SFBs involving Y to alternations; the mappings involving K that eliminates those scissors; and the mapping that removes the R L SFB (which is particularly troublesome in STURDY, because "rl" is usually expanded to "rld" or "rly", which makes it a bad candidate for alt-fingering).

I began adding macros once I realized that the reasonably common TM bigram was virtually always expanded to TMENT. From there I added macros where they added value and there were no other flow problems to fix for a particular key. Care was taken to avoid creating too much usage imbalances, and preference was always given to improving flom over removing keystrokes. For example, Y maps to P instead of OU.

A very important detail is that all of the highest frequency uses of the magic key relocate a right index press rather than adding one (THE contains H and ON contains N). For this reason, the total usage on the right-index does not increase by as much as you might expect.

Similar to the last point, there is very little interaction between the magic key and any other key on the left-index. Only the ^N SFB is non-negligible, so I made a second press of the magic key always output N, so the SFB becomes a double tap instead.

The overrides to the regular repeat key are a recent addition. They eliminate the one bad SFB on the right-index (NF) and also provide briefs for the second and third most common trigrams: AND and ING. An additional bonus of the latter two is that they reduce usage of both index fingers.
Why Sturdy?

This layout is based on STRD1, but I call it Magic Sturdy, because that's the name that everyone knows, and the distinguishing features of Sturdy are on its consonant hand, which this layout shares. Additionally, aside from the right-index, the vowel hand can be setup however you personally prefer.

STRD1 is the base, because that was the layout I was learning, and the magic key was conceived as an elegant solution to that layout's two biggest pain points: "RLD"/"RLD" and "Y" plus everything else on the left-index. I thought that it would be great if I could replace the useless Z key with a key that would be either Y or L depending on what I needed. When I noticed that the same spot also provided fixes for "UE", "EU", and "OA", I got very excited.

Serendipitously, there are several characteristics of STRD1 that make it very well suited for having a magic key on the vowel side index. Most critically, this finger begins with fairly low usage and very low movement when compared to the vowel index in a typical layout (The weighted finger movement as measured by Oxeylyzer is only 0.661).

Comparing some modern keyboard layouts.

When working on the new performance docs for Romak, I decided to compare it with some other modern keyboard layouts, using KLA.

The text corpus used in the comparison was the Universal Human Rights Declaration, in English, and the layouts involved, in the order that they scored, were:

    Graphite

    Colemak-DH

    Canary

    Romak

    Sturdy

    Hands-Down Polyglot

    Engram

    BEAKL27

    Aptv3

    Semimak

    Recurva

    and Dvorak, this last one as a baseline.

These results were really surprising to me, particularly for Recuva, which I expected to perform among the bests.

More details can be found here, as well as the results for Portuguese (the language which Romak was designed for).

---

Edit:

Replaced the text corpus to use a 1MB text composed by the most common words in emails and chat messages, which is the kind of text I usually type.

To make the comparison more fair, I also replaced Romak 24 by Romak 34 and standardised how all layouts handle dead keys. And also replaced Hands-Down Polyglot by Gallium.

These are the new results, considering English only:

Probably worth noting that 1: the human rights declaration is an extremely small corpus which can skew results quite a lot pretty much randomand 2: metrics KLA uses aren't the same as you might find in other places, for example 'distance' assumes fingers return to the homerow after every keypress whereas others don't. This pushes higher frequency keys to homerow naturally but affects recurva's r on top row in ways you might not be used to

Good points. I was not aware of number 2. It would be great if we had a tool that was good for comparing multiple layouts, like KLA, had better metrics, like yours, and as a plus, knew how to deal with one shot layers.

Agreed. KLA assumes "perfect touch typist" ... because everyone types differently, and you need some baseline to compare against, and touch typing standard is an objective standard.

Choice of corpus not good ... character frequency incorrect. That's why I made the chained bigrams.

UDHR char freq starts etonasirhdluc⮠fmpg,bwyv.Hjk;:xFTW

while the 1MB chained bigrams starts etaoinsrhldcumfpgw⮠yb,.vk'TI-ASC

Other point to note is that some modern layouts assume all sorts of "extras" in their QMK/whatever code, which KLAnext can't handle. Den's version may be able to.

Wikipedia says (regarding diacritics)

the cedilla (ç), acute accent (á, é, í, ó, ú), circumflex accent (â, ê, ô), tilde (ã, õ), and grave accent (à, rarely ò, formerly also è, ì, and ù). Formerly the diaeresis was also used (ï, ü).

How long ago was "formerly" ? And "rarely"?

i.e. should those diacritics be in a corpus or not? Note: this has knock-on effect, because if in corpus, then also should be on keyboard layout ...

And which are lowercase only (if any)?

how about «»‹› ?
rafaelromao
•
5mo ago

In this context, I would say formerly is a few decades ago and rarely are basically never. I never saw grave used with anything but a, or the diaeresis for i. And for u, it is not used for a few decades now and was officially removed from the language in 2016.

For the other diacrilics, we use dead keys for acute, circuflex, tilde and grave. Except for ç, that has its dedicated key. Circuflex is the shifted version of tilde and grave is the shifted version of acute. There is also a dedicated, non-dead, key for single quote, that does double quote when shifted.

In my layout though, I used macros and combos to create the diacrilics version of the vowels.

ã and õ never occur in the start of a word, but if typing in all caps, all of them should be capitalized.

This is all valid for Brazil, I'm not sure about Portugal and other countries though.

These «» are the quotes in Portugal, if I'm not mistaken, but I'm not sure if they are indeed used. And I never saw the other ones.

In ABNT2 keyboards, the standard for Brazil, we also have ¨, ¬, ¢, £ and § that most of the people don't even know what they are intended for.

Neither seems to have ` and ~ ?

Or can you get them on the deadkeys?

Looks like I will have to do separate versions for these related-but-different ... Euro version does not have cent symbol, or ¬. Are the superscripts implemented in Brazilian version? And ₢ ? I know that's historic.

I have created a corpus for Portuguese, busy generating chained bigrams. But need to finalise what characters should actually be on the different versions... and don't particularly trust Wikipedia.
rafaelromao

5mo ago

` and ~ are only available as dead keys. The standards shown in Wikipedia seems to be correct.

The main difference between Brazilian and Portuguese versions seems to be the quotes, and the place where symbols are located.

¢, ¬ and ₢ symbols are rarely used, including them in the corpus would probably make more bad than good.

Superscript are also not common (people in Brazil are not used to AltGr. Anything that is not available in a shifted symbol will not be used. Most of the time people rely on symbol maps in text editors for them.

Thanks for the comment. I forgot to reply before, but I edited the post after changing the text corpus. The new one has 1MB in size, for each language, and was generated using ChatGPT, asking it to generate a 1MB text using the 180 most common words in work emails and chat messages. Not a full representative of what most people type, but a good representation of what I usually type.

Another point about your tests is that if any of the layouts were missing some required chars, then scoring will not be correct.

• Edited 5mo ago

I edited all layouts to have the same set of symbols, except for Romak, which have accented letters instead of dead keys. But I ran the tests with a clean version, with 34 keys (single alpha layer) and dead keys, and the results were similar.

what kind of keyboard do you use row staggered, columnar staggered, key wells, etc.? I think it makes a difference on the results.

Columnar staggered only. One of my boards has keywells (Rommana) the others are flat. In the analysis, I used the matrix configuration.

Hands Down™
FAQ
Do we really need another layout?
Why not as many layouts as there are people?

For decades, typing has hurt, and like so many of us, I type for a living. I've had split ergonomic keyboards since 1995, but lately I've needed painkiller or analgesic creams if I'm going to type more than a page an hour...so I bought and built several new keyboards during the Covid summer (like the Kyria I built pictured above, and Gergo, redox, even a redox manuform, and I was among the first 100 to back Keyboardio 01 before that), until I realized the problem was as much with the layout as is was with the physical board. So I tried several well regarded layouts, but they didn't quite work for the kind of texts/languages I use every day. There are so many layouts, some designed with individual's texts in mind, some just theoretical (like the very clever but ultimately unusable Seelpy layouts), but I needed a comfortable general purpose layout that could also work in Japanese, and maybe other languages, without sacrificing English usability at all. 

Other languages and the  K penalty. Almost all of the newer (good stats) layouts banish K to the most unusable places on the keyboard (i.e. MTGAP, OneProduct, Kaehi). This may be no problem in English, but as I frequently type in Japanese, where K is the second most frequent consonant after N, this was a deal breaker. For some reason, Dvorak was not great in Japanese, so I tried to modify Colemak-DH and Workman to make the K work, but it always felt a bit Kludgey, inevitably knocking something else out of whack. And they still demand too much of the index fingers for my comfort. I wanted a layout that was as good as in English as the best of them, yet was still easier to use in Japanese than anything else.  K had to be on the index or middle finger, or at least in a place where I could swap it with another letter to get it into prime real estate without upsetting everything else. 

The result is Hands Down. It's great in English, but due to its phonotactics influenced design perhaps, it does very well in other languages, too (sometimes with minor modification). I use Rōmaji, like 80% of those who type in Japanese, which means QWERTY for most of them. (Only about  11% use the JIS kana layout you see on common GMK MX keycaps, and even fewer among younger generations.) There are some great "high efficiency" layouts for Japanese, like Fujitsu's Oyayubi Shift (親指シフト) or the new and super smart Naginata (薙刀式). Hands Down Alt-tx and Hands Down Alt-nx are certainly no where near these Japanese specific layouts, but they feel amazing for a Rōmaji layout.
Wait, isn't Colemak or Dvorak the best?
A lot has happened with layout design since Dvorak (1935) and Colemak (2006)
They are definitely far better than QWERTY,
but neither worked for my situation
So I began to wonder...
What if Colemak and Dvorak had a baby?

Hands Down aims to continue the evolution in typing comfort for a new generation of keyboards. For months, I tried one layout a week, beginning with ASSET, then Norman, and Workman, and others.  As good as these and other layouts are, I came to feel that they may over emphasize the index finger and the center column of keys, resulting in index finger fatigue for me, or simply have much too much same-finger bigrams (SFB), resulting in awkward motions. Colemak-DH is very good, and reduces the lateral burden on the index finger on standard Colemak, but still has extremely high utilization of the right index finger. These issues don't bother many people, and Colemak-DH and Dvorak are great layouts, but I couldn't make them work for me.

Other languages and the  K penalty. Almost all of the newer (good stats) layouts banish K to the most unusable places on the keyboard (i.e. MTGAP). This may be no problem in English, but as I frequently type in Japanese, where K is the second most frequent consonant after N, this was a deal breaker. For some reason, Dvorak was not great in Japanese, so I tried to modify Colemak-DH and Workman to make the K work, but it always felt a bit Kludgey, inevitably knocking something else out of whack. And they still demand too much of the index fingers for my comfort. I wanted a layout that was as good as in English as the best of them, yet was still easier to use in Japanese than anything else.  K had to be on the index or middle finger, or at least in a place where I could swap it with another letter to get it into prime real estate without upsetting everything else. 
Why so many Hands Down variations?
Because no one layout can be
the best for everyone

It really is that simple. Choosing a layout that truly suits you depends on many factors, especially your preference, but also your texts (including languages), your keyboard, and so on. 

I went through dozens of iterations while designing and testing the layouts. I could have just numbered them sequentially, like the BEAKL series (there are more than 35 BEAKLs, and they can vary greatly). But, wouldn't that imply that version 3 was inherently better than version 2? That just isn't the case. (is BEAKL 34 opted better than BEAKLE 27? By what standard?)

Just giving layouts a sequential version number would imply that Hands Down Vibranium (Neu-vx) is the best, because it is the last one I designed. But Gold (Neu-tx) has the best stats overall, in generic English. Why not Bronze (Neu-hx)? It has the best stats in Japanese! But, Silver (Neu-nx) performs the best with my personal test corpus (mixed English 60%, Japanese 20%, code 15%, French 5%. Gold has the letter T on the thumb, which certainly isn't for everyone. Alt-ex has E on the thumb, and the lowest finger movement of any of the layouts I designed, so shouldn't that be the only one you consider? I think most people are using Neu or Reference, because they are deployable on any keyboard, but some like Alt for the really low finger movement, and all these base variations have all the alphas in the alpha field, so they are the easiest to understand. 

I thought it would be most informative to give a unique name to each variation that I thought was good enough to actually use for a while, then describe my studies and experience with it and let you decide which set of factors might suit you best.  

I call them Hands Down variations, rather than separate layouts, because all are variations on a theme, a common design principle–phonotactics. Since they all share a design principle and as much of the same home block as possible, they all feel similar enough that switching between them shouldn't be too difficult. (I designed other layouts based on other principles, and they don't bear a Hands Down name.) Other smart keyboard features I've developed, like Adaptive Keys, Linger Keys, and Semantic Keys are independent of Hands Down, as they can be adapted to work with any layout–they just work exceptionally well with Hands Down, because Hands Down was designed with these in mind (like the straightforward orientation of the H digraph combos).
So is Hands Down a clean-sheet, AI-designed layout?
Typing on the hands of giants
and out of the mouths of babes?

Hands Down is the result of over 18 months of nearly full-time obsessive analysis. Much of my work, especially the home stretch drafts, has been very much Human and Heuristic rather than Artificial Intelligence. Much of it has also been unabashedly manual, given the manual nature of the task at hand. I've tried countless revisions on my own hands, feeling the motions and observing the mental machinations, in addition to looking at stats. 

But Hands Down is definitely built upon the great work that has gone before, with lots of analysis and comparison of previously layouts, many of them algorithm-built. In a sense, by leveraging prior research, Hands Down is built indirectly with a lot of AI underpinnings, even though much of my work was very manual. Those who are very familiar with the various alternative layouts may easily recognize Hands Down's MTGAP heritage (even if flipped, horizontally, and vertically). MTGAP represents a watershed moment in layout design, and it is easy to see its influence in all Hands Down variations (especially load distribution, and statistics guided choices like the value of hand alternation vs rolls, reach effort vs SFBs, etc.) There are distinct trends in the way language is used that will mean a convergence in high performance layouts is inevitable, and that knowledge has guided my research and design of Hands Down.
Designing a layout is like mining for bitcoin or playing Go

(2.6525286e+32 = 265,252,859,812,191,058,636,308,480,000,000)

You're trying to limit liberties (SFB), and your opponent is the language or sample corpus. With 30 glyphs in question, and 30 places to put them, there are 30!, or two-hundred sixty-five nonillion possible keyboard layouts. Um, a tad more than fingers than you have on two hands... While that's an impossibly large number, most of those possibilities will be much worse than QWERTY. 

Getting this write is why people wright algorithms for it, and I've used some of the tools made available. There are several interesting computational approaches to layout designs. Hands Down originated from a study of Carpalx and MTGAP designs (mostly MTGAP). It is substantially different in several ways, but retains enough to show that it is an evolution of these two breakthrough approaches.  And there are very interesting new analyzers (Genkey), with many tweaked versions, and tweaks to old ones (PatorJ's KLA, Carpalx, etc.), thanks to the opennes of the community, that emerged after the Hands Down work began, which in turn influenced subsequent Hands Down variations. New analyzers offer a chance to examine layouts from new angles, as the Genkey has done for finger speed and new motion metrics with trigraph analysis, (Boo, ISRT, Semimak, Whorf come from this).  Scoring systems on all of theses analyzers are very helpful, but it is important to remember that they are based on (usually very well reasoned) assumptions.

In this process I examined many "high efficiency" layouts, well over a hundred, including the more well-known Colemak-DH,  the CarpalX layouts (QGMLWB), MTGAP and others (like BEAKL family, RSTHD, OneProduct, KAEHI, Soul, etc.). These all have some exceptional qualities of their own. In the course of this study I observed patterns for letter pairings that reduce same-finger bigrams (SFBs). I also studied and tried out many QWERTY derivatives, like ASSET/Minimak/Norman/Workman, but none of them felt like enough of a benefit to justify the switch. Workman was very good, but I still felt an uncomfortable number of awkward SFBs, and it just didn't click with Japanese. That led me to develop my first layout design, Notarise, but I literally "felt" that I was missing something. What began with an analysis of a 33k corpus of academic (my master's thesis) and a number of others (SAT words, short stories, and some multi-lingual texts), then evolved through dozens of iterations using PatorJ's, SteveP's, Den's, kla.keyboard-design.com and the Colemak-DH (bigram) analyzers, and countless hand built spreadsheets with data from other corpus analysis like Peter Norvig's amazing work on the 743 trillion word Google English dataset, among many, many other sources.  (see my comments about these analyzers here). 

Phonotactics Influenced Design: No doubt there will be other interesting designs, but there does seem to be a rapid convergence around a few basics (which letters can be grouped on a finger), because human phonetic systems all share one feature, they are produced by humans with a common speech apparatus. I had been studying linguistics in grad school, with special interest in pronunciation, phonetics, and phonotactics (how speech sounds interact). After learning what I could about layout design an statistical measurement, I laid down the basics of Hands Down with attention to how sounds are produced, which letters tend to produce those sounds, and mapping that to the keys on the keyboards almost as though they are teeth in a mouth. This is the domain of phonology, and especially, phonotactics, which I used for the starting point of my Hands Down design. It was surprisingly good, and showed many similarites to algorythmically designed layouts. It needed some tweaking, which was guided by my deep understanding of the many layouts I had studied.

The result of all the above obsessive research is Hands Down, the Reference layout and the several variations. Hands Down is great in English, but due to its phonotactics influenced design perhaps, it does very well in other languages, too (sometimes with minor modification). I use Rōmaji, like 80% of those who type in Japanese, which means QWERTY for most of them. (Less than 11% of native Japanese speakers use the JIS kana layout you see on common GMK MX keycaps, and even fewer among younger generations.) There are some great "high efficiency" layouts for Japanese, like Fujitsu's Oyayubi Shift (親指シフト) or the new and super smart Naginata (薙刀式). Hands Down Alt-tx and Hands Down Alt-nx are certainly no where near these Japanese specific layouts, but they feel amazing for a Rōmaji layout.
Is Hands Down a whole new input method?
Not at all. It's just a really good alpha layout.

Some may have thought that the add-on features are an integral and necessary part of Hands Down, and amounted to an attempt at a full input method.  It is true Hands Down  was designed anticipating these features, so they do work very well together to improve typing comfort. However, these are technically independent features that can be applied to any layout, so they can't be considered as an Hands Down input method in any real sense.

True input methods, like stenographer's lexicon based input systems (ex. Plover) offer unparalleled input efficiency, they require dedicated machines or sophisticated input method interpreters (typically on the host system), but are much more difficult to learn, and are tied to a given language (with robust workflow dictionaries). There are other input methods, like the very clever Artsey and Taipo that use a system of chorded strokes to efficiently enter individual letters (rather than dictionary dependent phonetic patterns) on one or two-handed keyboards having only 8-12 keys per hand. Artsey/Taipo don't need support on the host, but they do require radically different ways of entering text. These are all true input methods, whereas Hands Down and these add-on features are not.

Rather than invent an entirely new way to enter letters or phonetic patterns (or entire words), these "smart keyboard" features offer a way to significantly enhance performance and comfort of any layout while still using very standard keyboard layout mechanics. The result is a normal high-efficiency layout that can be "overclocked" with these added features for even greater performance. Because I conceived of some of these features as add-ons for Hands Down, they may be particularly suited to deployment on Hands Down alpha topologies. But they are all technically independent of the layout, and can be deployed with any layout on almost any "smart keyboard" with a capable controller for increased performance.
Is this, "Hands Down" the best layout?
my grandfather taught me to be wary of superlatives…

All of the analyzers I used and have referred to have a cubic buttload of assumptions baked in. They need to do so, in order to do their jobs—but all of these assumptions have tradeoffs. Is the metric based on a simple list of bigrams, or weighted by frequency of bigrams occurring in typical writing, or a huge corpus of texts, or a domain-specific selection of texts, or effort factors based on a traditional or ergonomic or completely different keyboard? What is "typical?" What is typical writing for me is probably not the same as typical for you. Still…
Hands Down is quite encouraging

Very low same-finger bigrams
Good neighbor-finger bigrams
Good left-right hand/finger balance
Comfortable rolling bigrams (and trigrams)
Very low hand and finger movement
Consistently excellent statistics, across all measures

                outstanding in English, great in other languages, too

In barely 10 weeks, I designed Hands Down from scratch, and adopted it as my primary layout, and wrote most of this website with it (mostly Hands Down Ref, and Hands Down Alt). Even while trying dozens of variations and changing the layout every few days to see how it feels in real use, I have recovered almost 50% of my typing speed. It's that intuitive and comfortable. (Lük fir nypos serulting frim my gonstent thinkerinc.) Nevertheless…
…there can never be just one…
…layout that is objectively best for everyone in all situations.
so…type for yourself…

Every layout performs differently, statistically, with differing Keyboard Layout Analyzers (KLAs) and different sample texts. (see my comments about these analyzers here). None of the analyzers I used were able to consider multi-use keys,  like mod-tap/layer-tap keys, that spurred the Hands Down project (mods on home row). And no current analyzer considers combos, which I use on my own variation to eliminate Q and Z on the keymap, making room for more common characters (used more frequently in another language, human or computer, for example). But every analyzer gives interesting insights into how a layout might perform, and I've regularly used many different approaches to evaluate the dozens of variations as I've developed Hands Down. I have not created my own analyzers or metrics to design Hands Down. I continued to revise Hands Down until it posted outstanding scores in every KLA with any text. All of the stats quoted here are someone else's calculations on English sample texts, most of which are easily reproducible, because I believe that for any layout to be truly valuable, it should be great no matter the method used to evaluate it.

My own implementations of Hands Down have many features that no current analyzer is capaple of evaluating. Things like Home Row Mods, Combos, Adaptive, Linger, and Semantic Keys. To the extent possible, I have considered these bahaviors in my designs. Some specific variations, such as Hands Down Rhodium (my private variation that I use exclusively now), will perform rather poorly on most analyzers. My own usage over months, and my hand calculated statistics for these features suggest, however, that Hands Down Rhodium, is far better for my needs than any other Hands Down variation, and statistically superior to any other layout I've ever analyzed.
Phonetics at work

The final round of refinements to Hands Down was guided by my recent study of linguistics in grad school, paying attention to the "place and manner of articulation," and phonotactics (the way sounds combine). This helped to discover and finalize finger groupings by considering the sounds the letters represent to predict the relative unlikeliness they would be produced at the same time—this is how the unparalleled bigram stats where  achieved—and some of the easy typing features of the Hands Down Alt and Hands Down Neu families.
Judge no layout by stats alone…

…and especially not by any one set of stats.  Hands Down aims not to be the best statistically in a given area or by any one KLA, but to be a very well rounded, versatile layout, suitable for everyday use.  I have used this website as a place to document my discoveries, writing it entirely with whatever Hands Down variation I'm evaluating at the time. I have mentioned a lot of stats and provided links and templates for you to see the results yourself and  to help you get a sense of how Hands Down might perform for you. 

I've been able to "feel" comfortable in Hands Down more quickly than I did trying out Colemak-DH and even QWERTY derivatives such as ASSET/Norman/Workman. That doesn't mean it's better, and since I designed it that's not an objective measure. Each I trained for a week, at least, and then did a full day of light real-time production (emails, etc) with it.  It was my week with Workman that led me to develop my own QWERTY derivative, Notarise. It felt better than those, and was fairly easy to learn, but still had QWERTY quirks, including higher same-finger bigrams, and poor hand/finger balance (I think Workman, overall, is better than Notarise, but it didn't work for me). 

I tried Dvorak, in the 90's when RSI first showed up, but while I respected its objectives, there was no DvorakJP to make it tolerable in Japanese then. I even tried a Safe-Type and Maltron for a few months each, hoping to alleviate the pain. In the end, I didn't stick with any of them—it was a different time, and I just wasn't happy with results, so I kept using my Apple Adjustable Keyboard until I could't make it work anymore, then I used Microsoft Natural and then Sculpt ergo keyboards with modifications using Karabiner, AutoHotKey or ControllerMate. I referred to dozens of layouts and my decades long experience with programming and languages in the final round of Hands Down development. Colemak-DH stands out, and I came to respect its robustness through my week of trial. I really wanted it to work, but it has very heavy index finger usage, even as the index governs 2x the number of keys, and noticeable hand imbalance, that was a problem for me made worse with home-row mods. 

Have you noticed how much name dropping I'm doing in this section, with links to check everything out? Understand it to mean I've tried many layouts, and studied even more, and can handily recommend many of them as worth your time to consider alongside Hands Down. What's most important is that you find something that is comfortable for your own needs. Just remember…
Any layout is a house of keys. 

Compromises must be made. Something will be awkward. The goal is to make the awkward things infrequent, and the common things invisible—with practice.  Hands Down is still relatively new, and dozens of people, if not hundreds, have tried it and affirmed its well-rounded performance. 
Should I switch to Hands Down?
Type more with less movement, less fatigue
Use what works for you

There are many proven layouts available today, so there is no good reason to perpetuate the QWERTY disaster. If you've never considered any QWERTY alternative, you might start by giving my NOTARISE layout a try, to see if you can learn a new one. It is among the easiest QWERTY alternative layouts to learn, with quite respectable reward for your effort. 
Using Hands Down will save my fingers over 18km/11 miles.
Just let that sink in…
That's like walking a half marathon…on your fingertips…

That's for typing my dissertation, projected to be about 500 pages,
on my tiny split keyboard with Hands Down,
instead of using QWERTY on a standard slab keyboard.

Hands Down is indeed very good, and may be just what you're looking for, but I truly don't think that there is one layout that is better for everyone. If you're already at production level proficiency with another high-efficiency layout, Hands Down may not be worth the retraining for you. 

DISCLAIMER: I'm making no claims, nor making any money here. I am only sharing my research and nothing more contagious than my enthusiasm for stumbling on this configuration of letters on keys during my extensive reseach.  I just wish more viable options were available 30 years ago when I was first developing aching joints, so I thought I share my work. I have no evidence that Hands Down will solve your RSI, or butter your bread. See the legal blurb at the bottom of this page.
Is learning to touch type (on a new a new layout) hard?
Okay, I'm not going to lie…
It takes effort, but it is achievable.

It's about like any exercise program—for about thirty minutes a day, in just a few weeks you could be typing in greater comfort, for the rest of your life. So what if you consider it physical therapy for your fingers? Doesn't seem as hard now, does it? Maybe even important? Your transition will be faster if you can go all in, cold turkey, and not switch back and forth between the layouts. Some people seem to be able to recover their former typing speed on a new layout in just a month or two after switching completely and sticking to a disciplined training program.  It's taken me longer than that, but that's largely because I was designing and changing the layouts every week for months, not only trying to remember where I put that key, but also constantly thinking about how that motion felt compared to another motion, over and over. But one thing is certain, a year later my joints are definitely happier, and I'm chewing much less pain killer.
Learning a new layout is just learning to touch type…again.  

1. COGNITIVE STAGE: Start by building muscle memory of the layout of letters:

You need to memorize the position of letters on the keyboard…

Direct muscle memory training is typically how this is done, but there are things you can do while not at a keyboard that can help.  Take some time to memorize the letter positions. 

        Doodle a keyboard, write the letter positions until you can do it from memory. 

        Get some kid alpha blocks, and arrange them like your keyboard.

        Print a layout of your keyboard on cardstock, and tape it above your monitor.
        Looking up will help to break the habit of looking down to see the keycaps.

        Imagine typing a word in your mind. Just pick any word you are reading, and try to imagine the motions as you type. This is impossible at first, but after you've been at it for a while, you may be surprised how imaginary typing can produce physical typing sensations, and help your typing speed.

        Use blank keycaps. Keycaps can help you learn initially, but constantly looking down will limit your speed (to, maybe, ~40 wpm).

        Typing tutor sites can be helpful for learning basic typing principles, but most are based on the default row-stagger (Slab) QWERTY keyboard, so I don't recommend them for learning an alternative layout. If you want to follow a lesson-by-lesson approach on a typical keyboard, consider these:

            Typing.com

            TypingClub.com

…and build muscle memory with practice, practice, practice. 

It's very much like vocabulary acquisition for language learning. Practicing several times a day (like at mealtimes) for shorter periods of time (5–10 min) is more effective than long sessions once a day. These tools drill common bigrams (letter pairs) that help to quickly develop muscle memory. This should help you get to about 40 wpm.

        Ngram Type (focused practice with high frequency bigrams/trigrams)
        excellent tool for initial muscle memory acquisition.

         keybr (next develop speed with greater bigram variety)
        practice until all the letters are green, then move on.

2. ASSOCIATIVE STAGE: Then develop rhythm and accuracy (after all letters/bigrams are learned 40~70 wpm?):

Once you've achieved some consistency with the letter placement  move on to learning hand-eye coordination with longer phrases. If you make a mistake, delete the whole word and type it again, otherwise you'll develop muscle memory for backspacing in the middle of letter pairs. Continue your training with one of these sites, a few times throughout the day for short periods of time. Once you reach about 60 wpm, the keyboard itself should start to feel like a natural part of you.

        monkeytype (check out Gary Internet's Monkeytype Guide, it`s quite good.)
        If you like MonkeyType, as many do, please consider donating directly to the developer, who has poured a lot of time and effort into this great tool. 

        ratatype.com (progressive lessons)

3. AUTONOMOUS STAGE: Continue practicing for duration and accuracy (60~90 wpm?):

Hands Down was designed to improve comfort for long-haul typing. With any layout, accuracy and stamina are the practical outcomes of learning touch typing. These tools help build accuracy, and are most effective if you can devote slightly more time for practice each session (10–20 min.), even if you need to do fewer sessions in a day. Focus on whole-word accuracy at modest speeds (~60 wpm, 96%+ accuracy). 

     problemwords (develop accuracy by focusing on difficult, common words)

     typelit.io (excellent training for duration typing)

4. Train like an athlete for competitive typing speed if that is your thing (once you break 90~wpm?):

NOBODY types above 100 wpm all day, (except copyists, and they barely remember what they're typing). Research has shown that typing speed is a burst phenomenon, and that both typing speed and accuracy plumet after only about a minute or two. Fast long-duration typists sustain a pace of about 80~100wpm, but training for typing speed both helps for duration effectiveness, and is a fun goal. The fastest typists train a lot, and the specific layout matters far less than the amount of training. Hands Down was designed for long haul comfort, but some people have achieved very respectable speeds, with modest training (a month or two).

Will I forget QWERTY?
Won't I become limited or dysfunctional?
No...
You will likely not forget QWERTY
Unless you consider technological augmentation a limitation,
then you won't be dysfunctional, either.
but QWERTY has been the worst since 1867…
Just sayin'

Is it rational to maintain an inefficient system just on the off chance that you might need it later, especially if it has been repeatedly proven to be harmful to the user? Do you refuse to use a dishwasher at all because you're afraid you might forget how to wash dishes by hand? Do you refuse to drive a car, because you fear you might forget how to ride a bike? 

 How is your penmanship?

Give that question some sober thought. There was a time, in my lifetime, when handwriting was considered to be a measure of one's education and status, and even now you still need to take notes by hand sometimes, so did you forgo learning to touch type just because you might need to write with a pen on paper now and then? Haven't we all already given up better handwriting in favor of effective typing skills? Why then, have we settled for the worst available typing system? It's absurd, isn't it? That's all luddite reasoning, and it has never been smart. This is very much similar to learning any alternative layout other than the lowest-common-denominator: You will be able to get by, for the rare times when you need to.

Here's another thought...do you like touching all those public keyboards?
They spend all day, right in the fall zone of every users’ breath...I work at a very large public university, and use public computers a lot. My university supplies sanitizer at every computer station for a reason! I'm not personally all that creeped out, but I must say, I do prefer my own keyboard about as much as I prefer my own undies. Sure, someone else's underwear might fit…but eewww!

I have a tiny, portable, split ergonomic keyboard that I keep in my bag (actually, I  have several, but really, you only need one portable keyboard), and it's very similar to my full-time workstation setup. It works on any any computer or tablet, (via USB or Bluetooth), and on any operating system  (thanks to my Semantic Keys). It takes up very little space, has all my comfortable typing behaviors that have greatly reduced my pain, I never have to ask IT for permission to set it up or worry about changing obscure settings myself, and I never worry about slime on a public computer.  I even have Hands Down layouts specifically designed for tablets, Hands Down Touch, Touché. And for those increasingly rare times when I don't have my portable keyboard with me, I just use what's there, like anyone else. I may not be as fast as I once was on QWERTY, but after just a minute or so my lizard brain kicks in, and I can peck out what I need to as fast as the average typist.
What if Hands Down is not for me?
Can you recommend any other layouts?
The keyboard and layout are the intimate interface between your thoughts and the machine. It should be comfortable for you, and eventually get out of the way.
Even if you don't choose Hands Down,
you can do better than QWERTY.

Most modern operating systems offer support for Dvorak, and some also support Colemak, or Workman. Dvorak  is the oldest of all the noteworthy alternative layouts (See Blickensderfer story), and still much better than QWERTY. While Hands Down does have some similarity to Dvorak (both are alternating layouts), it is quite different and has notably better stats in nearly all areas, I can't say whether switching would be easy, or if the incremental benefits would be worth it for you.  If you're comfortable with Dvorak, Colemak, or any other higher performance layout, Hands Down may not be much improvement for you (you may simply prefer one or the other). There are reasons I personally don't recommend Norman or Workman, and think Hands Down does offer enough benefit to justify switching from these, but your comfort is really the most important thing here. If it is working for you, then you should definitely stick with it.  That same logic may suggest you may want to stick with QWERTY, and honestly, I can't argue against that. I would only encourage you to take a serious look at alternatives, rather than decide by default, because there really is ample evidence to argue that "anything but QWERTY" could be good for you. That's sort of the point of this paragraph, you see, even if it's not Hands Down (or Notarise).

Below is a short-list of the exceptionally "high-performance"※ layouts that I've studied, and can enthusiastically recommend. 

            APT v3

            Gallium

            IENA

            MAKs family

            MTGAP (closest, to Hands Down, in principle)

            poqtea (really great on ANSI/ISO/JIS keyboards too)

            RSTHD (E on the thumb, for some excellent characteristics on a split ergo or ortho board.)

            SNTH (R on the thumb. Truly stunning statistics on a split ergo or ortho board.)

These highly regarded layouts are also worthy of consideration. Many of these have support for standard slabs (ANSI/ISO/JIS) keyboards, and most have well-written descriptions to help you understand how they might work for you:

             BEAKL family (known for light pinky burden)

            Colemak-DH (Reliable mod of a benchmark layout)

            CTGAP

            Engram v2  (light inner column use, better than Halmak)

            ISRT

            KAEHI

            OneProduct

            UCEIA

            Semimak

            STRDY  (great overall metrics, but with a higher ring finger load than I prefer)

            Soul, etc. (a reasonable QWERTY alternative that works well on ANSI/ISO/JIS)

            Vukeys

            Whorf (super low SFBs, with a higher ring finger load)

            AdNW (Deutsch)† 🇩🇪 (notably better than Neo)

            adextre (Français)† 🇫🇷 (notably better than Bépo)

Above are only a subset of those I've evaluated and think might have general appeal. It is by no means a list of what I think are the best, because best is a very slippery term.  Many layouts I've evaluated I may not think are suitable for general use, or have sufficient benefit to be recommended, but they may be perfect for the designer's personal objectives. Some are clever and useful but remarkably niche, so they may offer design ideas even if the layout as a whole may not be of general interest. Inevitably, many are simply not good enough to warrant attention, and some are even worse than QWERTY. But all layouts have different features, and will feel different as you type, so it would be good to read a bit about the layout to see if might meet your needs. 

Some of the recommended layouts above are "fully-optimized" meaning that any letter/symbol can be placed on any key. These optimizations could extend beyond typical punctuation to include the number row, and even shifted key values. These layouts generally bear little resemblance to QWERTY and may be harder to learn.

Still looking? 

     Keyboard-Design.com is a masterpiece of keyboard and layout information by Ian Douglas. There you will find info on over 500 layouts, with statistics and tools and rankings, including the Top 30 list for most common keyboard form factors. This top 30 uses statistics and ranking weight from Ian's own fork of Patrick Gillespie's Keyboard Layout Analyzer (KLA). Other analyzers and sample texts will produce different rankings. (see my notes on analyzers.) There is even a handy layout discovery tool, the Home Row Explorer, that can help you identify a layout by the letters on the home row.

    Here is well thought out discussion of layout design, with a list of high performance layouts. It's a handy list of many good layouts with a stats snapshot of each. You'll want to look for layouts with lower SFBs and Redirects, along with higher Rolls (and Alternates, if alternation is important to you. Hands Down is an alternating layout, and alternators tend to have lower rolling, but Hands Down Reference still has very high rolling, and exceptional statistics across the board–literally. Hands Down Alt and Neu families roll even better!)

    Xah Lee has gathered a ton of random tech related info on his expansive blog, including a lot of interesting keyboard related stuff. He doesn't like Hands Down, but then, he's also misunderstood a lot of things about it. Fair enough! This site has been confusing as it has been evolving with the layout research. Even so, his site has a lot of interesting stuff, and if you're nerdy enough to read this, you may like something you find there.

    Desk Authority also has a lot of keyboard related information.

Your actual keystrokes will vary.

** Colemak-DH and Workman both preserve the QWERTY zxcv locations for their shortcut convenience, but their value is more than that and deserve consideration anyway. Colemak-DH is exceptional, but the very high index finger usage and high hand imbalance gave me paws... After a week's trial, I didn't quite feel the love for Norman then Workman, either, and therefore don't recommend them. It is my opinion that Norman has too much of a hand imbalance, and both Norman and Workman have too many awkward bi-grams, jumps, or stretches, to be worth the effort to learn them. NOTARISE is arguably better than these, in a benefit/effort sense. It requires fewer keys moved from QWERTY for a proportionally greater benefit than either. NOTARISE is not perfect, but it is fairly easy to learn for some good improvement making it far better than QWERTY.

※ I loosely define "high-performance" here to mean very near 1.0 or fewer SFBs based on SteveP's Colemak-DH(mods) analyzer, with default settings for the alpha field on simple matrix beards only.

 † See my comments about the Polyglot project.
What about the keycaps?
A limited but growing number of keycap sets support Hands Down variations.

Drop Coleverak sets have caps that support most, if not all, Hands Down variations.

10. Engram (Arno’s Engram)

Skip to the content.
Arno’s Engram keyboard layout
Arno's Engram v2.0 ("Engram") layout is an optimized key layout for touch typing in English based on ergonomic considerations, with a protocol and software for creating new, optimized key layouts in other languages.
View on GitHub
Arno’s Engram keyboard layout

Engram v2.0 (“Engram”) is a key layout optimized for comfortable and efficient touch typing in English created by Arno Klein, with open source code to create other optimized key layouts. You can install the Engram v2.0 layout on Windows, macOS, and Linux or try it out online. An article is under review (see the preprint for an earlier (and superceded) version (v1.3) with description).

[See here for the Spanish version, engram-es]

Letters are optimally arranged according to ergonomics factors that promote reduction of lateral finger movements and more efficient typing of high-frequency letter pairs. The most common punctuation marks are logically grouped together in the middle columns and numbers are paired with mathematical and logic symbols (shown as pairs of default and Shift-key-accessed characters).

See below for a full description and comparisons with other key layouts.

Why a new key layout?

Personal history
In the future, I hope to include an engaging rationale for why I took on this challenge. Suffice to say I love solving problems, and I have battled repetitive strain injury ever since I worked on an old DEC workstation at the MIT Media Lab while composing my thesis back in the 1990s. I have experimented with a wide variety of human interface technologies over the years – voice dictation, one-handed keyboard, keyless keyboard, foot mouse, and ergonomic keyboards like the Kinesis Advantage and Ergodox keyboards with different key switches. While these technologies can significantly improve comfort and reduce strain, an optimized key layout can only help when typing on ergonomic or standard keyboards.

I have used different key layouts (Qwerty, Dvorak, Colemak, etc.) for communications and for writing and programming projects, and have primarily relied on Colemak for the last 10 years. I find that most to all of these key layouts:

    Demand too much strain on tendons
        strenuous lateral extension of the index and little fingers
    Ignore the ergonomics of the human hand
        different finger strengths
        different finger lengths
        natural roundedness of the hand
        home row easier than upper row for shorter fingers
        home row easier than lower row for longer fingers
        ease of little-to-index finger rolls vs. reverse
    Over-emphasize alternation between hands and under-emphasize same-hand, different-finger transitions
        same-row, adjacent finger transitions are easy and comfortable
        little-to-index finger rolls are easy and comfortable

While I used ergonomic principles outlined below and the accompanying code to help generate the Engram layout, I also relied on massive bigram frequency data for the English language. if one were to follow the procedure below and use a different set of bigram frequencies for another language or text corpus, they could create a variant of the Engram layout, say “Engram-French”, better suited to the French language.

Why “Engram”?
The name is a pun, referring both to “n-gram”, letter permutations and their frequencies that are used to compute the Engram layout, and “engram”, or memory trace, the postulated change in neural tissue to account for the persistence of memory, as a nod to my attempt to make this layout easy to remember.
How does Engram compare with other key layouts?

Below we compare the Engram layout with different prominent key layouts (Colemak, Dvorak, QWERTY, etc.) for some large, representative, publicly available data (all text sources are listed below and available on GitHub).
Engram Scoring Model scores (x100) for layouts, based on publicly available text data

Engram scores higher for all text and software sources than all other layouts according to its own scoring model (higher scores are better):

Keyboard Layout Analyzer (KLA) scores for the same text sources

    The optimal layout score is based on a weighted calculation that factors in the distance your fingers moved (33%), how often you use particular fingers (33%), and how often you switch fingers and hands while typing (34%).

Engram scores highest for 7 of the 9 and second highest for 2 of the 9 text sources; Engram scores third and fourth highest for the two software sources, “Coder” and “Rosetta” (higher scores are better):

Inward roll frequencies

Here we tally the number of bigrams (in billions of instances from Norvig’s analysis of Google data) that engage inward rolls (little-to-index sequences), within the four columns of one hand, or any column across two hands. Engram scores second highest for 32 keys and highest for 24 keys, where the latter ensures that we are comparing Engram’s letters with letters in other layouts (higher scores are better):

7.  Avoid stretching shorter fingers up and longer fingers down.
8.  Avoid using the same finger.
9.  Avoid skipping over the home row.
10. Assign the most common punctuation to keys in the middle of the keyboard.
11. Assign easy-to-remember symbols to the Shift-number keys.

Factors used to compute the Engram layout

    N-gram letter frequencies

    Peter Norvig’s analysis of data from Google’s book scanning project

    Flow factors (transitions between ordered key pairs)
    These factors are influenced by Dvorak’s 11 criteria (1936).

Summary of steps and results

We will assign letters to keys by choosing the arrangement with the highest score according to our scoring model. However, there are over four hundred septillion, or four hundred trillion trillion (26! = 403,291,461,126,605,635,584,000,000, or 4.032914611 E+26) possible arrangements of 26 letters (24! = 6.204484017 E+23), so we will arrange the letters in four steps, based on ergonomics principles. These consist of (Step 1) assigning the eight most frequent letters to different keys, optimizing assignment of the remaining (Step 2) eight most frequent letters, and (Step 3) eight least frequent letters (besides Z and Q), and (Step 4) exchanging letters.
Step 1: Define the shape of the key layout to minimize lateral finger movements

We will assign 24 letters to 8 columns of keys separated by two middle columns reserved for punctuation. These 8 columns require no lateral finger movements when touch typing, since there is one column per finger. The most comfortable keys include the left and right home rows (keys 5-8 and 17-20), the top-center keys (2,3 and 14,15) that allow the longer middle and ring fingers to uncurl upwards, as well as the bottom corner keys (9,12 and 21,24) that allow the shorter fingers to curl downwards. We will assign the two least frequent letters, Z and Q (or J), to the two hardest-to-reach keys lying outside the 24-key columns in the upper right (25 and 26):

    Left:            Right:
 1  2  3  4       13 14 15 16 25
 5  6  7  8       17 18 19 20 26
 9 10 11 12       21 22 23 24

We will consider the most comfortable keys to be those typed by either hand on the home row, by the ring and middle finger above the home row, and by the index and little finger below the home row, with a preference for the strongest (index and middle) fingers:

 -  2  3  -        - 14 15  -  
 5  6  7  8       17 18 19 20  
 9  -  - 12       21  -  - 24

Step 2: Arrange the most frequent letters based on comfort and bigram frequencies

In prior experiments using the methods below, all vowels consistently automatically clustered together. Below, we will arrange vowels on one side and the most frequent consonants to the other side to encourage balance and alternation across hands. Since aside from the letters Z and Q there is symmetry across left and right sides, we will decide later which side the vowels and which side the most frequent consonants should go.
Vowels

E, T, A, O, I, N, S, R, H, L, D, C, U, M, F, P, G, W, Y, B, V, K, X, J, Q, Z

The highest frequency bigrams that contain two vowels are listed below in bold, with more than 10 billion instances in Peter Norvig’s analysis of Google data:

OU, IO, EA, IE, AI, IA, EI, UE, UA, AU, UI, OI, EO, OA, OE

 OU  24,531,132,241
 IO  23,542,263,265
 EA  19,403,941,063
 IE  10,845,731,320
 AI   8,922,759,715
 IA   8,072,199,471   
 EI   5,169,898,489
 UE   4,158,448,570       
 UA   3,844,138,094   
 AU   3,356,322,923
 UI   2,852,182,384
 OI   2,474,275,212
 EO   2,044,268,477
 OA   1,620,913,259
 OE   1,089,254,517 

We will assign the most frequent vowels with over 100 billion instances in Norvig’s analysis (E=445,A=331,O=272,I=270) to four of the six most comfortable keys on the left side of the keyboard (keys 2,3,5,6,7,8). We will assign the letter E, the most frequent in the English language, to either of the strongest (index and middle) fingers on the home row, and assign the other three vowels such that (1) the home row keys typed by the index and middle fingers are not left vacant, and any top-frequency bigram (more than 10 billion instances in Norvig’s analysis) (2) does not use the same finger and (3) reads from left to right (ex: EA, not AE) for ease of typing (inward roll from little to index finger vs. outward roll from index to little finger). These constraints lead to three arrangements of the four vowels:

- - O -    - - O -    - - - -    
- I E A    I - E A    I O E A
- - - -    - - - -    - - - -

Consonants

On the right side of the keyboard, we will assign four of the five most frequent consonants (with over 5% or 150 billion instances in Norvig’s analysis: T=331, N=258, S=232, R=224, and H=180) to the four home row keys. We will assign the letter T, the most frequent consonant in the English language, to either of the strongest (index and middle) fingers on the home row. As with the left side, letters are placed so that top-frequency bigrams read from right to left (ex: HT, not TH) for ease of typing. The top-frequency bigrams (more than 10 billion instances in Norvig’s analysis) include: TH, ND, ST, NT, CH, NS, CT, TR, RS, NC, and RT (below 10 billion instances these bigrams start to occur in reverse, such as RT and TS):

 TH 100,272,945,963  3.56% 
 ND  38,129,777,631  1.35%
 ST  29,704,461,829  1.05%
 NT  29,359,771,944  1.04%
 CH  16,854,985,236  0.60%
 NS  14,350,320,288   
 CT  12,997,849,406
 TR  12,006,693,396       
 RS  11,180,732,354   
 NC  11,722,631,112
 RT  10,198,055,461   

The above constraints lead to five arrangements of the consonants:

- - - -    - - - -    - - - -    - - - -    - - - -
R T S N    H T S N    H T S R    H T N R    T S N R
- - - -    - - - -    - - - -    - - - -    - - - -

We will assign the fifth consonant to a vacant key on the left home row if there is a vacancy, otherwise to the key below the right index finger (any other assignment requires the same finger to type a high-frequency bigram). The resulting 20 initial layouts, each with 15 unassigned keys, are represented below with the three rows on the left and right side of the keyboard as a linear string of letters, with unassigned keys denoted by “-”.

Step 3: Optimize assignment of the remaining letters

We want to assign letters to the 17 unassigned keys in each of the above 20 layouts based on our scoring model. That would mean scoring all possible arrangements for each layout and choosing the arrangement with the highest score, but since there are over 355 trillion (17!) possible ways of arranging 17 letters, we will break up the assignment into two stages for the most frequent and least frequent remaining letters.
Most frequent letters

We will compute scores for every possible arrangement of the seven most frequent of the remaining letters (in bold below) assigned to vacancies among the most comfortable sixteen keys.

E, T, A, O, I, N, S, R, H, L, D, C, U, M, F, P, G, W, Y, B, V, K, X, J, Q, Z

    Left:            Right:
 -  2  3  -        - 14 15  -
 5  6  7  8       17 18 19 20
 9  -  - 12       21  -  - 24

Since there are 5,040 (7!) possible combinations of eight letters for each of the 21 layouts, we need to score and evaluate 105,840 layouts. To score each arrangement of letters, we construct a frequency matrix where we multiply a matrix containing the frequency of each ordered pair of letters (bigram) by our flow and strength matrices to compute a score.
Least frequent letters

Next we will compute scores for every possible (40,320 = 8!) arrangement of the least frequent eight letters (in bold below, besides Z and Q) in the remaining keys, after substituting in the 21 results of the above for an additional 846,720 layouts:

E, T, A, O, I, N, S, R, H, L, D, C, U, M, F, P, G, W, Y, B, V, K, X, J, Q, Z

    Left:            Right:
 1  -  -  4       13  -  - 16
 -  -  -  -        -  -  -  -
 - 10 11  -        - 22 23  -

Further optimize layouts by exchanging more letters

If we relax the above fixed initializations and permit further exchange of letters, then we can search for even higher-scoring layouts. As a final optimization step we exchange letters, eight keys at a time (8! = 40,320) selected twice in 14 different ways, in each of the above 21 layouts, to score a total of 23,708,160 more combinations. We allow the following keys to exchange letters:

1. Top rows
2. Bottom rows
3. Top and bottom rows on the right side
4. Top and bottom rows on the left side
5. Top right and bottom left rows
6. Top left and bottom right rows
7. Center of the top and bottom rows on both sides
8. The eight corners
9. Left half of the top and bottom rows on both sides
10. Right half of the top and bottom rows on both sides
11. Left half of non-home rows on the left and right half of the same rows on the right
12. Right half of non-home rows on the left and left half of the same rows on the right
13. Top center and lower sides
14. Top sides and lower center
15. Repeat 1-14

Engram Scoring Model

Our optimization algorithm finds every permutation of a given set of letters, maps these letter permutations to a set of keys, and ranks these letter-key mappings according to a score reflecting ease of typing key pairs and frequency of letter pairs (bigrams). The score is the average of the scores for all possible bigrams in this arrangement. The score for each bigram is a product of the frequency of occurrence of that bigram, the frequency of each of the bigram’s characters, and flow, strength (and optional speed) factors for the key pair.
Factors to penalize strenuous key transitions

Direction:

- outward = 0.9: outward roll of fingers from the index to little finger (same hand)

Dexterity:

- side_above_3away = 0.9
    - index and little finger type two keys, one or more rows apart (same hand)
- side_above_2away = 0.9^2 = 0.81
    - index finger types key a row or two above ring finger key, or
    - little finger types key a row or two above middle finger key (same hand)
- side_above_1away = 0.9^3 = 0.729
    - index finger types key a row or two above middle finger key, or
    - little finger types key a row or two above ring finger key (same hand)
- middle_above_ring = 0.9
    - middle finger types key a row or two above ring finger key (same hand)
- ring_above_middle = 0.9^3 = 0.729
    - ring finger types key a row or two above middle finger key (same hand)
- lateral = 0.9
    - lateral movement of (index or little) finger outside of 8 vertical columns

Distance:

- skip_row_3away = 0.9       
    - index and little fingers type two keys that skip over home row (same hand)
    - (e.g., one on bottom row, the other on top row)
- skip_row_2away = 0.9^3 = 0.729
    - little and middle or index and ring fingers type two keys that skip over home row (same hand)
- skip_row_1away = 0.9^5 = 0.59049
    - little and ring or middle and index fingers type two keys that skip over home row (same hand)

Repetition:

- skip_row_0away = 0.9^4 = 0.6561
    - same finger types two keys that skip over home row
- same_finger = 0.9^5 = 0.59049
    - use same finger again for a different key
    - cannot accompany outward, side_above, or adjacent_shorter_above 

Strength: Accounted for by the strength matrix (minimum value for the little finger = 0.9)
Step 4: Evaluate winner against other optimized layouts

After assigning letters Z and Q to upper right keys outside of the home blocks and testing left/right side swap of all letters, the winning layout is:

B Y O U  L D W V Z
C I E A  H T S N Q
G X J K  R M F P    

We ran tests on the winning layout:

1. Evaluate optimized layouts using interkey speed estimates   
2. Evaluate variants of the candidate winner using interkey speed estimates
3. Test sensitivity of the candidate winner to the scoring parameters

For test 1, we rescored all of the 20 top-scoring layouts optimized from the 20 initialized layouts, and replaced the factor matrix with the inter-key speed matrix. The same two layouts that tied for first place do so again.

For test 2, we rescored all of the 5,040 variants of the candidate winner that were tied for first place, replacing the factor matrix with the interkey speed matrix. The candidate winner scored highest.

For test 3, we ran a test on the variants of the candidate winner layout to see how robust they are to removal of scoring parameters. We removed each of the 11 scoring parameters one by one and ranked the new scores for the variants. The candidate winner scored highest for 8 of the 11 cases, and second highest for two other cases, demonstrating that this layout is not sensitive to individual parameters.
Step 5. Arrange non-letter characters in easy-to-remember places

Now that we have all 26 letters accounted for, we turn our attention to non-letter characters, taking into account frequency of punctuation and ease of recall.

Add punctuation keys and number keys

We will assign the most frequent punctuation according to Sun, et al (2018) to the six keys in the middle two columns: . , “ ‘ - ? ; : () ! _

        B Y O U   '  "   L D W V Z
        C I E A   ,  .   H T S N Q
        G X J K   -  ?   R M F P

We will use the Shift key to group similar punctuation marks (separating and joining marks in the left middle column and closing marks in the right middle column):

        B Y O U  '(  ")  L D W V Z #$ @`
        C I E A  ,;  .:  H T S N Q
        G X J K  -_  ?!  R M F P

Separating marks (left): The comma separates text in lists; the semicolon can be used in place of the comma to separate items in a list (especially if these items contain commas); open parenthesis sets off an explanatory word, phrase, or sentence.

Joining marks (left): The apostrophe joins words as contractions; the hyphen joins words as compounds; the underscore joins words in cases where whitespace characters are not permitted (such as in variables or file names).

Closing marks (right): A sentence usually ends with a period, question mark, or exclamation mark. The colon ends one statement but precedes the following: an explanation, quotation, list, etc. Double quotes and close parenthesis closes a word, clause, or sentence separated by an open parenthesis.

Number keys: The numbers are flanked to the left and right by [square brackets], and {curly brackets} accessed by the Shift key. Each of the numbers is paired with a mathematical or logic symbol accessed by the Shift key:

{ | = ~ +   <  >   ^ & % * } \
[ 1 2 3 4   5  6   7 8 9 0 ] /

1: | (vertical bar or "pipe" represents the logical OR operator: 1 stroke, looks like the number one)
2: = (equal: 2 strokes, like the Chinese character for "2")
3: ~ (tilde: "almost equal", often written with 3 strokes, like the Chinese character for "3")
4: + (plus: has four quadrants; resembles "4")
5 & 6: < > ("less/greater than"; these angle brackets are directly above the other bracket keys)
7: ^ (caret for logical XOR operator as well as exponentiation; resembles "7")
8: & (ampersand: logical AND operator; resembles "8")
9: % (percent: related to division; resembles "9")
0: * (asterisk: for multiplication; resembles "0") 

The three remaining keys in many common keyboards (flanking the upper right hand corner Backspace key) are displaced in special keyboards, such as the Kinesis Advantage and Ergodox. For the top right key, we will assign the forward slash and backslash: / \. For the remaining two keys, we will assign two symbols that in modern usage have significance in social media: the hash/pound sign and the “at sign”. The hash or hashtag identifies digital content on a specific topic (the Shift key accesses the dollar sign). The “at sign” identifies a location or affiliation (such as in email addresses) and acts as a “handle” to identify users in popular social media platforms and online forums.

The resulting Engram layout:

     [{ 1| 2= 3~ 4+  5<  6>  7^ 8& 9% 0* ]} /\
        bB yY oO uU  '(  ")  lL dD wW vV zZ #$ @`
        cC iI eE aA  ,;  .:  hH tT sS nN qQ
        gG xX jJ kK  -_  ?!  rR mM fF pP

BEAKL 27

Introducing BEAKL 27, the latest recommended layout (replaces BEAKL 15). It improves on 15 by reducing same finger rates.

BEAKL 27 (main layer):

32104 76598

qhoux gcmrv

yiea. dstnb

j",k' wflpz

If you still find same finger rate too high, try the variant 27-A by swapping a few keys. However, these swaps increase pinky usage, and thus more bad pinky rolls. Personally, I don't mind slightly higher same finger rate, because they're on strong fingers, thus neutralizes the bad pinky rolls.

Any or all of the following may be swapped:

N<>R

P<>B

H<>Y

The layout below, BEAKL 27-A, shows the final layout if all three swaps are made.

BEAKL 27-A (main layer):

qyoux gcmnv

hiea. dstrp

j",k' wflbz

(P.S. BEAKL 27 is eerily similar to BEAKL 4. Seems like what we discovered near the beginning was already the best, but we neglected it in our blind search for truth. Frankly I wouldn't blame you if you adopt BEAKL 4 instead.)

Have you got examples of words with "same finger rate" issues? I've been using BEAKL-15 for over a year now, and very happy with it. The changes to BEAKL-27 are very few, so switching should be that hard, but I don't know if I actually experienced any "same finger rate" issues, or just didn't notice it. So example words would be very useful to understand it better.

the main culprit of SFR is "TR" , then "HI". BEAKL 27 moved R to next finger.

the consonants district can be more easily altered and improved. hence the HI is left untouched. nevertheless as suggested, you may swap H-Y to also improve the vowels district.

anyway, if you're fine with BEAKL 15, then by all means continue to use it. It has nigh-unbeatable rolls score. but if TR bothers you, then consider switching to 27 (or 4 or other.)

Glad to see BEAKL back in action! You say the SFR may be too high; Have you considered putting the letter E on a thumb? I’ve made my own variant which does just that, which I’ve used for more than half a year so far. It gives a lot more space for other keys and allows for fewer SFB’s.

• Edited 2y ago

With T being the 2nd most used letter and being used in many common bigrams, it does strike me a bit as odd to move it to the ring finger.

The keyboard layout analyzer (KLA) from stevep (not affiliated, just wanted to have one of the many KLAs quickly run some numbers), seems to indicate that it's a better layout though, at least for same finger usage (lower numbers are better, the right hand is more balanced in the home block):
	Right Thumb 	Right Index 	Right Middle 	Right Ring 	Right Pinky 	Total
Ergodox BEAKL 27-a mod NRTM 	24 	53 	96 	50 	16 	419
Ergodox BEAKL 27-a mod LM 	24 	53 	126 	31 	16 	430
Ergodox BEAKL 27-a modNRSC 	24 	312 	126 	29 	16 	687
Ergodox BEAKL 27-a modRNSC 	24 	312 	126 	29 	16 	687
Ergodox BEAKL 27-a 	24 	53 	126 	31 	16 	430

I thought moving NR (right ring in BEAKL27) to SC (right index) might be good, but then the index is overworked, as the table above shows (the layout name hints at which letters have been swapped from BEAKL 27-a, starting with the home row, then the one above it). Of course, other metrics need to be taken into account, like rolls and digraphs.

I'm not sure what to make of it, trying to learn BEAKl 27-A at the moment, coming from BEAKL 15. Will probably move N and R as they are in BEAKL 27, since it seems I got kind of used to N being in the home row.

Sweet. The BEAKL forums was what started me on the journey of fiddling with custom layouts after I gave up on BEAKL 15 due to the high SFR (that BEAKL 27 is said to address).
fullgrid

3y ago

It seems Beakl layouts take into account multiple factors, rather then go all in for low SFBs.

Beakl 27 seems to reduce SFBs a bit, at the price of slightly more row jumps. Overall it looks a bit better.

Beakl 28 (not sure if that's the right name, found it in ILLDB) reduces SFBs further, at the price of relocated space and more non monotonic trigrams.

Nice layouts.

BEAKL

Unfortunately, the BEAKl site and forum disappears from time to time. Not sure how to contact "shenafu".

The various BEAKL layouts may be found here by doing a search on "beakl" -- though the fingering weightings/penalties are not listed.

Deskthority has some of the BEAKL theory here.

My own take on BEAKL can be found here but is very hard core pinky avoidance. And gets into even more extreme (personalized) factoring of sloppy (relaxed) finger positioning with the chorded Georgi keyboard layouts.

In my own search for the perfect layout, i discovered there is none -- that is perfect for everyone. Only a perfect layout for "you" -- everyone's physiology and finger dexterity is unique.

Almost any layout is a massive improvement on the QWERTY like layouts. Rankings posted by analyser sites reflect the weighting/penalty biases of the authors. In the end, finding the layout that feels natural with the least amount of finger difficulty for you is hopefully what you arrive at.

Good luck!

APT (V1?) vs Engram

I'm currently working towards designing a keyboard that uses a 3x4+2 layout. I really dislike the lateral movement when it comes to typing, so I've decided to omit these entirely.

My current layout, Canary, wouldn't be a great fit for this board, as with the reduction of six keys from a 34-key layout, six letters would be need to be under either a combo or layer, which I'm not too comfortable with.

I've considered both the earlier version of APT, as well as Engram, with these layouts putting punctuation on the center index columns.

I'm not too clued up with the technical terms when describing a layout, and the way this affects how they feel, but the only major discrepancy that I understand is with APT, K and P would need to be on a combo/layer, whereas with Engram, Z and Q would be on a combo/layer, which is slightly less common.

I understand that this is generally a subjective decision, and really I should just try these layouts out first, but I am curious to hear people's thoughts and opinions regarding these layouts, and which one they would personally choose.

All these 3 layouts look amazing, but I guess only trying and experimenting with them to see what works best for you.

I use boards with 30 keys, with only 1 alpha in the pinkies and 2 in the center column. But I do not use combos to type the missing alphas. Instead, I use a oneshot layer that I activate with my right home thumb key. It is quite fast and easy to use. For these same alphas on VIM bindings, I use combos though.

You can see my layout here.

And here you can see a video about this technique being used in a even smaller board.

Ben Vallack has some amazing videos! I discovered these ergonomic boards through him, and I was able to build a Ferris Sweep a few months ago now. I have considered a 3x3+2+2+2 layout as mentioned in my reply to u/phbonachi, which I may explore if I can't get this layout feeling how I want it.

I have also considered opting for 3x4+1+2, but the lack of uniformity bothers me slightly.

Thank you for linking your layout, I'm getting some great inspiration from different ones I've stumbled across.

Hello! Glad to see you are interested in my layouts (Apt).

For reduced key count boards, I find that as you start moving keys off the base layer, one of the biggest improvements you can make is to introduce a thumb alpha key.

I created a layout that's applicable from 26-30 key boards by choosing letters/symbols that are droppable without being as annoying to combo as more common keys. There's a repo here: http://github.com/apsu/aptmak though I didn't really show the 28-30 key versions.

30 key is just like:

v w f p b  j l u y '
r s t h k  x n a i o
; c g d q  z m , . /
           e

And so ;/ can be dropped first, and qz next, depending on target key count.

If you stick with 28-30, you can also rearrange a little bit to improve some stats, in ways that aren't possible on 26 key. For example:

x w f p b  q l u y '
r s t h k  j n a i o
; c g d v  z m , . /
           e

And this is my preferred "full" incarnation of this layout.

Hey, first let me start by saying thank for all the work you put into making these layouts! I wouldn't even know where to start myself.

I actually just found your layout 'engram-apsu' through the AKL Discord which I quite liked the look of, as punctuation, Z, and Q weren't present on the 4 columns that I'm using.

Granted, I've just been looking at the frequency of letters vs punctuation, where . and , certainly sit higher than a fair few letters, so perhaps I should consider taking these off a combo, and replacing it with a less frequent letter. I also have ! and ? as the shifted version of these, which I'm happy to change.

I've been very interested in trying an alpha key on thumb, I just need to figure out a good replacement for the keys I currently use. How do people typically approach having 2 layers, plus a shift key, plus space? I did try homerow-mods, but didn't like it as much as Callum-style mods.

Thanks for the kind words!

On smaller boards I do usually use HRMs, but if you're going to use Callum mods, doesn't really change my approach. I put a nav/shortcut layer as a layer-tap with space on one thumb, and a num/sym layer on the other thumb, in this case with e. I don't usually use thumb shifts anymore, and I put a set of mods on my nav layer opposite the nav cluster, so those can easily be one-shots/callum/etc.

I generally also put tab/enter on the other two thumb keys since they're so common, but nothing stops you from putting shift on one of them and then move, say, tab to a layer. Since shift+space isn't a common shortcut, that's always a good thumb choice for combining.

Hands Down

What is gained with putting F on the T column instead of P, and avoiding the PH sfb and making all the H bigrams roll in? Is the sfb hit worth it to avoid the dfsb of PT, or is there some other consideration I'm not noticing?

Would placing the F on the S column, W on T, (leaving P with H), not result in similarly lower sfbs, but on both the ring and middle? There seems to be a bit better rolling there (FT, SW). Is this a similar dfsb concern, or some other metric I don't understand?

Your suggestions are good! Here's how I think about these things:

    This is closer to Colemak, which 99% of my layout users are coming from, and I'm already asking them to switch to yet another new layout

    F is higher use than W and P, and part of my overall goal with Apt has always been to reduce index use generally (especially middle column/LSB use), so F on middle carries more weight by finger load metrics

But really... the differences between these arrangements is mostly a wash. I don't know a secret metric you missed :) I will probably try out `_ w p f b` and `_ f w p b` a bit and see.

Always nice to hear from you.

Hands Down

All good options, really. I'm a fan of the later Apt, and Engram got a lot better with 2.0.

Have you considered a 3x3+2+2+2? That's a 30 key...Is that reach to the inner column that much worse than the third pinky key having to reach up (or down, depending on stagger)?

I'm not a fan of the layers approach like Ben Valleck's piano...switching seems to be more steps (sequence of keys, rather than simultaneous), and I'm not sure, but latency of layer switching seems to be fractionally longer than combo processing.

u/AlSaMoMo has an amazing Rommana (a project with u/rafaelromao?), with a slick Hands Down Neu mod. I'm working on a similar board (28-30 keys), with a mod of Hands Down Vibranium, which already has even further reduced center column usage.

x w m g      . ' j v
s c n t k  , a e i h 
b p l d      u o y f 
       r   spc
Qu = WG combo, held deletes U
Z = CT combo
X and V might also be removed to combos

This would result in only one lateral key for the index, and only two keys for the pinky, both in closer proximity to the home position. Yes, I do have all that on layers, too, but I find I rarely use them...almost never.

(I think if I had to push it any further, below 28 keys, I'd probaby end up going all in for a UT22 with notgate's amazing Taipo )

Thank you for these links!

I've considered going 3x3+2+2+2 when I saw boards like the Hummingbird and Rufous, and I was almost going to pull the trigger on designing one with the same layout.

I would probably say the most optimal for me would be 3x3+2+1+2 in terms of comfort (I hope I laid this out right, it's 2 on the pinky and 1 on the center index column as you mentioned), but I really love the way the 3x4+2 looks, although perhaps I shouldn't be worrying about that so much.

I suppose a bit more information about the design, it's column-staggered with splay on the pinky, ring and index fingers. I'll also attach a picture of the prototype layout I made in Ergogen.

I did want to keep fast typing in mind, and I do find that going with the tiny boards that Ben Vallack creates, albeit looking extremely comfortable, aren't quite as small as I'd like to go.

I did a custom typing test with Monkeytype, removing keys in the center column, and it was incredible how comfortable it felt. Of course, this isn't the most accurate being that I'm taking off 6 letters from the test, but it was still an amazing feeling with 0 pain that I want to pursue.

Taipo looks really good, I saw this a while ago. It's such a cool concept!

Here is both the Ergogen prototype, as well as the keymap: https://imgur.com/a/g4ynhO5

Hands Down

Yes, it's a really compact design!

Will the thumbs be curled under a lot?
[deleted]
•
1y ago

I'm still working out the thumbs, unfortunately. I would say these need to be pushed out a bit more, especially comparing it with my Sweep. I wanted it to be that compact so I could try and get the MCU as flush as possible, but I don't think that's a good idea in hindsight as excessive curling is not ideal (I do have small hands so it's not unbearable).

I'm really intrigued by the layout you're using. Just looking at Engram, the word big for example, feels incredibly uncomfortable, but perhaps that's something I could get used to? I'm wondering if I could adapt your layout to fit the 3x4+2, without causing issues.

I've never actually tried putting a letter on the thumb key either, how do you go about the missing thumb key? Do you have combos for layers? I'm curious on what your keymap may look like, if that's okay with you?

Hands Down

You can see what I have on my 34 key setup, from which the 28 is derived. Still don't have the 28 fully functioning yet, so this will be the most complete. The changes for 28 key should be straightforward.

My ZMK repo for my Zaphod is here. (I'm using Vibranium-b).

Not everyone is onboard with letter on a thumb, and I totally get it. For me, especially on small keyboards, that's incredibly valuable real-estate to not fully exploit. R has been an amazing sweet spot.

Anyone using APTv3 or Canary layouts?

I have been using Workman for a while now and liking it but I find the keys on the top row to be a little uncomfortable at times.

Just wondering if anyone is using either of these layouts on the regular?

https://github.com/Apsu/APT#aptv3-layout https://github.com/Apsu/Canary#layout

I am not married to any approach but I have tried Colemak and it didn't suit me. Any thoughts on the above?

I don’t use either of them currently but I learned canary to 100+ wpm for the canary tournament and liked it. I haven’t used apt for very long but it also seems like a solid choice. I would definitely recommend them both over workman
quindarka

Wow nice job! Do you have a preference of Canary over Apt?

Why do you suggest them over Workman? Is there something specific or just personal preference?
Flarefin
•
1y ago

I haven’t used apt enough to say if I prefer it to canary, but I can tell you a couple of ways they differ to inform your decision. apt primarily aimed to reduce LSBs (lateral stretch bigrams). this is when you reach inward with your index finger at the same time as pressing a key on the same hand on middle finger, or to a lesser extent, ring. the main way it accomplishes this is just putting less common keys in the center columns. the downside is that pinky and ring have a bit more movement. canary on the other hand, while still being a high roll layout, allows more index movement in exchange for less movement on other fingers

now as for workman, it has many issues compared most modern layouts. like apt, it also had a goal of reducing reachy index keys, but the execution was not that great. the creator also had some questionable ideas about repetitive finger usage and finger movement not mattering very much, which resulted in some patterns that can be annoying, such as ly, lly, op, po, fl, etc

I daily the ortho variant of canary for mostly english and programming, with some spanish sprinkled in, and I really like it (I use it for at least 6 hours a day, realistically about 9). I got used to the w on pinky quite fast, and use vim key bindings without any issues.

I've never typed that fast, so I can't comment that much other than at my 80wpm avg it feels very flowy and nice :D

wow doesnt that make it super difficult and un-ergonomic?

Manueljlin
•
1y ago

not really, I'd say what really matters is having a symbol arrangement that you feel comfortable with. Say, stuff like Vi{<< ci{ da" df) yi' — these are all pretty comfortable with canary. Also using only hjkl to move around isn't a good idea with any keyboard layout. use / to jump around, or 8j 6l to avoid key repeats, 123G to go to line 123 etc

I'm thinking on switching to Canary because I heard it's friendly to Spanish (and hopefully Galician). Do you recommend it? have you tried https://www.reddit.com/r/KeyboardLayouts/comments/15goh04/canaria_an_ergo_layout_for_spanish_and_english/ ?
Manueljlin
•

Definitely recommended. I haven’t tried Canaria but seeing as it’s a 1 swap variant of the original layout it’s probably as good as Canary. I recommend starting with regular Canary and seeing if the J placement is an issue, then consider Canaria

Out of curiosity, did you try Colemak-DH? What didn't you like about it?

I think both APT and Canary are solid layouts. Which one suits you best may be up to personal preference quite a lot. I'm still using Colemak-CAWS myself, never saw the need to switch from that.

I did try it. It didn't fit my fingers well. Just a personal preference it seems.

What have you settled on for vim, assuming you didn't remap any keys for vim or for the layout? I'm trying to consider other layouts besides Colemak-DH as well.

APTv3 Layout

This is an alternate keyboard layout initially based on the work done in MTGAP and CTGAP.

w g d f b  q l u o y
r s t h k  j n e a i ;
x c m p v  z , . ' /

Angle Mod

On traditional row-stagger keyboards, the bottom row keys on the left side can be difficult to press with the same fingers used for the home/top row in the same columns. One workaround popularized for the Colemak layouts is known as an Angle Mod.

This mod rotates the first 5 letters in the bottom row left by 1 spot, and the leftmost letter is wrapped around to the 5th spot (QWERTY b spot). In conjunction with the letter shifts, the intention is that you will also change the fingers you use, so the SFB/column relationships are maintained.

This is what that looks like on APTv3:

w g d f b q l u o y
 r s t h k j n e a i ;
  c m p v x z , . ' /

In this case, c is pressed with Ring, m with Middle, and pvx are all with Index.

Canary

Welcome to the Canary Keyboard Layout!

This layout is the result of collaboration between many of the top layout creators from the AKL (Alternate Keyboard Layout) community, and reflects a lot of different ideas and optimization strategies combined together into one.

Downloads of premade layouts for Windows, Mac, and Linux are available from the Releases page.

We are publicly releasing this in conjunction with a typing tournament, and in partnership with MonkeyType. Please refer to the contact links at the bottom for how to get in touch or participate.

Layout

Here is the layout as-designed to be used with Angle Mod on a Row Stagger (standard) keyboard:

w l y p k z x o u ; [ ] \
 c r s t b f n e i a '
  j v d g q m h / , .

And here is a version that can be used on Ortho keyboards:

w l y p b z f o u '
c r s t g m n e i a
q j v d k x h / , .

Since most people using these boards will be uploading their own custom firmware, we are not suggesting how to solve for placing other keys such as ;[]\.
Design

Canary is based on a few core concepts that have been seen in various layouts, combined together in a novel way. Terminology used is defined below for reference.
The primary guiding principle is High Rolls

Compared to most layouts that don't also sacrifice SFBs or Redirects, Canary has extremely high total Rolls -- over 55% of all Trigrams. This gives it a very "flowy" feel compared to layouts with high Alternates.

It does not overly emphasize inward-rolls over outward-rolls, or vice versa. While there is some conventional wisdom that in-rolls are easier or faster, this is anecdotal at best, and many of us feel any benefit is quickly overcome with use.

As a result, the home-row represents a mixture of both rolling directions, though it does emphasize in-rolls a bit more. This is accomplished by having T on the left index and N on the right. These letters are very high frequency, but they also are most common after many other consonants or vowels, so they will often be the target of rolling sequences on that hand.
More ring/middle/index load and less pinky load

While it's possible to arrange a layout to make great use of top/bottom-row pinky sequences, this is the one finger that grows in a wide range of lengths across the population, making it very easy for some and nearly impossible for others to use well in this way. Canary minimizes this use by limiting it to have almost 0% SFBs and minimal redirect sequences.
Primary vowels on one hand only

One of the most common ways for modern layouts to improve overall stats (especially Rolls) is to put all of the vowels onto one hand. This does lead to some potential challenges since they combine with almost every other letter (and each other) in such high frequency, so it's easy to end up with lots of SFBs.

In addition, vowels participate in lots of Trigram sequences that are also very common such as ea, ou, ai, oa, ui, ue, and so on.

Canary has a vowel arrangement that is designed to minimize SFBs and Redirects without overloading the pinky.
Semivowels

Another challenge with English is where to put the semivowels W and Y, as these combine at relatively high frequencies with a variety of other letters. We decided to move them to the other hand in a way that avoids both the primary vowels and the highest frequency Consonant-Semivowel combinations (such as ly, ty, tw, sw, and so on).

W takes the top left pinky spot because this finger has less to do in an Angle Mod setup, and Y sits in the ysv column. The tradeoff is making the few words that have vy or sy sequences SFBs, but these are reasonably low-frequency Bigrams compared to all the other candidate spots.
Colemak DH similarity and problem-solving

Anyone familiar with Colemak DH mod will recognize there are a lot of similarities with Canary. This isn't an accident as there are many good aspects to this layout, but also some things we feel are downsides.

First, it doesn't take advantage of the Row Stagger inner-index keys on the bottom row (see linked section), opting instead to put K and V there. Both of these keys are relatively low frequency, and they interact with either N or the vowels, or both. Some folks have opted to swap them but that results in the eve Redirect sequence which isn't very comfortable. We decided to keep both on the left hand instead.

Secondly, the upper right vowel cluster includes Y, causing one of the most common words you to be a Redirect that changes rows twice (top-home-top).

Lastly, while having O on the home row does increase the amount of home-row usage over Canary, it also uses the worse SFB ue vs Canary's oe column. We have tried to emphasize middle finger use over ring since the middle is the strongest/longest finger for most people.
L and R

Two of the most difficult consonants to place overall for English are L and R. These "liquids" combine with nearly every other letter in all kinds of sequences, but they are conveniently relatively low-frequency with each other, and by themselves middle of the pack for letter frequencies.

As a result, we put them on the ring finger like many other modern layouts have done (such as Semimak), and find this is an acceptable tradeoff in finger balance, SFB minimization, and is in line with our high Rolling goals.
Quote

Finally, the ' symbol is very problematic in many layouts, as it combines with all sorts of other letters (n't, 's, 're to name a few). But one that it combines with very little is A, so it gets to retain its Qwerty spot.
Row Stagger

Row Stagger refers to the design of the common keyboard that has been in use for over 100 years, where each row is staggered (shifted) relative to the next row. This results in some interesting features, some which are negative (see Angle Mod below), and some which are positive.

The positive ones are taken advantage of in Canary in the following ways:

When looking at the keys around both index-finger home keys, we can see that there is a potential for very convenient key arrangements. The two clusters in question look like this:

 T    N
D G  M H

The distance to reach either the G or M from the index home keys is much lower than if the rows weren't staggered, so we have placed medium-frequency letters there.

Similarly, just like Colemak DH, we have placed D and H in the stronger of the two bottom row positions, where the index fingers can curl slightly in to reach them.

Lastly, in addition to the Angle Mod considerations, there is also the problem of the Qwerty B and Y positions. These are the hardest to reach on Row Stagger, and so Canary has the least-frequent letters there, Q and Z respectively. Q is on the bottom as most people press that key with their left index, and since all vowels are on the right, the most common sequence QU does not require an awkward stretch on one hand. This does mean that some words containing Z will be slightly more awkward, but since it's the rarest letter, this is an acceptable tradeoff.
Angle Mod

"Angle Mod" refers colloquially to a couple of things that are sometimes mixed up, both having to do with the lower left of a Row Stagger keyboard:

    Modifying a layout to account for the stagger angle
    Which fingers you use for which keys

Concerning the former, this is accomplished by taking the far left key on the bottom row and moving it to the Qwerty B position, then shifting the remaining 4 keys to the left to take its spot.

This change can be seen by comparing the Ortho version of Canary with the base version, where QJVD_ gets rotated and becomes JVD_Q.

(The _ is G in the base version but was rotated up in the Ortho, and K is there instead, but the principle is the same.)

The second meaning of "Angle Mod" (often called "Angle Cheat" if the letters aren't moved) refers to adjusting which fingers hit which keys in the lower left by recognizing that "traditional" touch-typing technique is not very ergonomic, and a better approach is to use the following mapping:

    Ring Finger => Qwerty Z
    Middle Finger => Qwerty X
    Index Finger => Qwerty C and V

It is very very important for you to use the Angle Mod fingerings on Canary. All of the heavy optimization completely depends on it.
Ortho

As seen in the opening, the Ortho version is as follows:

w l y p b z f o u '
c r s t g m n e i a
q j v d k x h / , .

This variation has been modified from the Row Stagger base layout by rotating the keys that are harder to reach on Ortho (G and M) up to home-row, and rotating the other index keys up or down to compensate, based on letter frequency and also affinity of common sequences, such that row-skips are minimized as much as possible.

We recommend putting your space key on the left thumb to properly balance the right-hand bias of the layout.
Terminology

    Bigram: A sequence of two keys (not containing space)
    Trigram: A sequence of three keys (not containing space)
    SFB: Same Finger Bigram; a bigram that requires the same finger for both keys
    Redirect: A trigram which changes direction on the same hand (excluding SFBs)
    Roll: A trigram which changes hands once (excluding SFBs)
    Alternate: A trigram which changes hands twice (excluding SFBs)

Etymology

"Canary" comes from the phrase "canary in a coal mine". Adopters of this layout are likened to miners, and the mine is a layout with extremely high roll stats.

The layout was almost called hotdog.

Recurva
An alternate keyboard layout focused on efficiency

recurva

Recurva's name originates from the Eucalyptus Recurva, a critically endangered species endemic to only a tiny section of New South Wales, Australia.

The goal with Recurva was to solely focus on the rudimentary statistics that I personally feel are the most important in layout design to achieve the best stats that would still be usable. The main stats I considered were:

    Same Finger Bigrams - SFBs (two letters pressed in a row with the same finger).
    Same Finger Skipgrams - SFS (two letters pressed on the same finger but with one letter separating the two).
    Hand balance stays somewhat equal (total usage of letters calculated).

What does Recurva accomplish?

Recurva accomplishes a new local minimum for Same Finger Skipgrams (SFS) using less efficient elements, previously Semimak held the lowest SFS of any english layout using columns such as RL, HNB which perform extremely well in that category.

Before understanding Recurva's niche it's best to examine the commonly used elements, typically layouts that have R on the pinky cannot have RL as a column which isn't the best for SFBs or SFS, even still it fits many more advantageous compositions.

SFBs
rl + lr: 0.087%,
hl + lh: 0.017%,
nl + ln: 0.073%,

SFS
rl + lr: 0.377%,
hl + lh: 0.252%,
nl + ln: 0.576%,

All statistics presented here use Shai corpus unless specified.

Looking at these stats you could conclude that HL is better than RL but as mentioned before compositionally this is rarely true because R is much more un-agreeable as a letter in comparison with H. R's most common partners that make sense from as SFB standpoint create a lot of SFS unfortunately which means it often gets put by itself on the pinky homerow or in combination with RL.

Why is this important? because L is just as un-agreeable as R and also causes trouble for the composition, it has the highest number of repeats of any letter (ll: 0.713%) and only goes with the letters I've shown above and the letter M (SFBs: ml + lm: 0.028%, SFS: ml + lm: 0.298%)
Analysis of Whorf and Semimak

Before we get to the differences between Recurva and layouts like Whorf and Semimak we need to talk about what separates Whorf and Semimak apart:

whorf                          semimak_jq
f l h d m  v w o u ,           f l h v z  ' w u o y
s r n t k  g y a e i           s r n t k  c d e a i
x j b z q  p c ' ; .           x j b m q  p g , . /
Sfb:               0.605%      Sfb:               0.798%
Sfs:               6.049%      Sfs:               5.688%
Scissors           0.817%      Scissors:          0.955%
Lsbs               1.988%      Lsbs:              2.122%

Inrolls:           22.39%      Inrolls:           20.24%
Outrolls:          22.48%      Outrolls:          22.18%
Total Rolls:       44.88%      Total Rolls:       42.42%
Onehands:          1.681%      Onehands:          1.862%

Total Alternates:  38.47%      Total Alternates:  40.32%
Total Redirects:   6.293%      Total Redirects:   6.461%

One of the main reasons Semimak(jq) performs better on SFS is because IY performs better than CY and the rest of the index column, while this does decrease SFS dramatically (for this level of optimisation) it sacrifices being able to place every piece of punctuation with the vowels like with Whorf's vowel block. Because of this Semimak_jq specifically places comma below E and apostrophe with the index column which creates quite a few SFBs.

Semimak's Y interactions:

SFBs
iy + yi: 0.039% - y/ + /y: 0.001% - total of 0.040%

SFS
iy + yi: 0.257% - y/ + /y: 0.005% - total of 0.262%


Whorf's Y interactions:

SFBs
cy + yc: 0.042% - yg + gy: 0.024% - yw + wy: 0.011%
yv + vy: 0.006% - py + yp: 0.035% - total of 0.217%

SFS
cy + yc: 0.085% - yg + gy: 0.060% - yw + wy: 0.176%
yv + vy: 0.015% - py + yp: 0.118% - total of 0.427%

Y interaction delta:

SFBs
Whorf's O.217% - Semimak's 0.040% = 0.177%

SFS
Whorf's 0.427% - Semimak's 0.262% = O.165%


Semimak's E interactions:

SFBs
e, + ,e: 0.190% - eu + ue: 0.148% - u, + ,u: 0.006% - total of 0.344%

SFS
e, + ,e: 0.256% - eu + ue: 0.655% - u, + ,u: 0.044% - total of 0.955%

Whorf's E interactions:

SFBs
e; + ;e: 0.005% - eu + ue: 0.148% - u; + ;u: 0.000% - total of 0.153%

SFS
e; + ;e: 0.021% - eu + ue: 0.655% - u; + ;u: 0.002% - total of 0.678%

E interaction delta:

SFBs
Semimak's 0.344% - Whorf's 0.153% = 0.191%

SFS
Semimak's 0.955% - Whorf's 0.678% = 0.277%

This doesn't even account for other corpora where IY scales much better than any other interaction with Y such as monkeytype's 10k and 450k (relevance to real-world application is up for debate).

Another reason for Whorf having more SFS is because of the position of D, on Whorf this is placed on the T index where it generates more SFS than the DC index Semimak opts for but also saves SFBs because of the accumulative conflicts that all the letters on Semimak's index, especially apostrophe.

Now finally we come to Recurva, Recurva uses RN and LHM instead of RL and HNB which are both used on Whorf and Semimak to achieve their extremely impressive SFB and SFS stats respectively. In the very specific combination of letters that completes Recurva it has worse elements that creates a better stats than Semimak on almost all fronts except for usage of less domininant fingers.

Recurva's RN:           Semimak's RL:
rn + nr: 0.191%         rl + lr: 0.073%
rn + nr (SFS): 0.941%   rl + lr (SFS): 0.546%

recurva                        semimak_jq

Lsbs               1.540%      Lsbs:              2.122%

Inrolls:           22.80%      Inrolls:           20.24%
Outrolls:          25.16%      Outrolls:          22.18%
Total Rolls:       47.96%      Total Rolls:       42.42%
Onehands:          2.145%      Onehands:          1.862%

Total Alternates:  35.64%      Total Alternates:  40.32%
Total Redirects:   5.393%      Total Redirects:   6.461%

So how does Recurva use worse parts to create a better whole? The main innovation is using H as the index on the vowel hand, this can only be done by mutating the RL, HNB columns into RN, LHM. As mentioned earlier HL is typically worse for the composition because RL gets rid of two very unagreeable letters without a huge difference to the main stats. In this very specific scenario because we've opted for Semimak style vowels we can place period on that column while still having less SFBs and SFS than Semimak's DC index.

Because of the columns we've chosen most of the SFBs generated in the layout come almost entirely from UE, OA, RN, Y,, and the accumulative period SFBs with the H elements.

If you're confused about any explanations here I encourage you to visit the Keyboard Layout Doc: https://bit.ly/keyboard-layouts-doc, it has a wealth of knowledge to read through if theory of layout composition ever interests you.
Variations

Recurva has a couple variations adaptated for columnar stagger keyboards, these don't change any stats except for Lateral Stretch Bigrams:

recurva-colstag                recurva-colstag2
f r d p v  q m u o y           f r d p v  q l u o y
s n t c b  . h e a i           s n t c b  m h e a i
z x k g w  j l ; ' ,           z x k g w  j . ; ' ,

There won't be any downloads for these variations as it's pretty much assumed that if you have a columnar staggered keyboard it will most likely be programmable.
History

Recurva was found accidently while exploring different composition's on Oxey's Layout Playground - an interactive website that allows you to swap letters in a layout and see the result in real time - https://o-x-e-y.github.io/layouts/playground/index.html.

I had been trying to make RN, LHM as a composition work since the start of 2023 in january after I completed Gallium, Richard Davison (https://github.com/rdavison creator of Graphite) and I collaborated on a layout that used R on the pinky and LHM after I commented on how technically HL was better to RL in isolation, that layout resulted in Ruthenium which doesn't really accomplish anything significant other than existing as a somewhat new combination and some decent stats. Although I didn't look at it again until recently, it bears a striking resemblance to Recurva in a few ways and definitely reinforced the idea

ruthenium
w d l f x  q b u o y
r t h s g  . n e a i
j k m c v  z p ' , ;
Sfb:  0.916%
Dsfb: 6.596%
Scissors: 0.750%
Lsbs: 0.784%

Inrolls: 27.387%
Outrolls: 17.568%
Total Rolls: 44.955%
Onehands: 2.873%

Total Alternates: 38.197%
Total Redirects: 4.799%

After Ruthenium I experimented many times with LHM as a column. I partially wanted to try RN as a replacement to RL, HNB as it made the most sense when mutating those columns but also because I admired the structure of Clemenpine's Pine layout - https://github.com/ClemenPine/pine-layout which exhibits RN on the left middle finger. To my knowledge the first layout to actually use RN and LHM together was Halmak.

After a couple months of sporadically trying the combination, in March I got inspired to experiment with the combination while trying Semimak vowels at the same time.

Ultimately all of these are archival layouts as Recurva accomplishes what they didn't, some of these layouts come close to Semimak's stats but none exceed its superb stats.

3 months later (July) and curious once again about the composition I tried it again but in conjunction with Whorf style vowels.

Total Rolls: 48.237%
Onehands: 1.297%

Total Alternates: 35.722%
Total Redirects: 5.854%

Pycnantha's goal was to lower scissors coming from Whorf and to emulate features I favour from Oxey's Sturdy - https://o-x-e-y.github.io/layouts/sturdy/index.html while keeping the stats very close to Whorf. Pycnantha is only a few swaps from Recurva but it would be 2 months before I discovered it as I was hesitant to try Semimak style vowels again and assumed I could not achieve a better result.

The modification into Recurva is quite simple, in this composition K creates SFBs with the H index that cannot be avoided because the only other place K can go is with T which already has two letters in its column, the prime candidate to place elsewhere is B because its stats when paired in C indexes are very good but the issue is that that column is full and no other exchanges can take place.

Recurva only works because it removes the Letter Y from the C index and allows to you swap B into the C index and thus place the K into the T column.

Hands Down

Thoughts?

I call it Hands Down Élan

I’m quite taken with it, AU on right ring finger notwithstanding.

' w m p q   j y o u z 
r s n t g   k h e a i
x c l d b   v f - ; /
      , .   ␣ ⏎

From u/SteveP99’s analyzer: (here: it doesn't account for thumbs, so use the effort stats with appropriate reservation. The bigram numbers are quite reasonable).

Finger Frequency
finger 0 	 6.85%	 finger 9 	 7.03%
finger 1 	10.86%	 finger 8 	11.06%
finger 2 	13.45%	 finger 7 	20.06%
finger 3 	18.42%	 finger 6 	12.26%
  total L 	49.58%	  total R 	50.42%

Finger Bigram Frequency
finger 0 	0.044%	 finger 9 	0.040%
finger 1 	0.190%	 finger 8 	0.187%
finger 2 	0.147%	 finger 7 	0.137%
finger 3 	0.141%	 finger 6 	0.085%
           **total	0.971%**

I’ve uploaded JSONs for use in PatorJ style KLAs, links for which are on the Hands Down Downloads page.

I’ve applied everything I’ve learned since I picked up this addiction, and my therapist says I need to put it down. So, I’m beginning a thorough review of all my layout work, and this is likely the last of the Hands Down variations. (I thought of calling this "Hands Down Home" because I think the Hands Down vein is tapped out, so it is time to pack my bags and "go home.")

I hope this is a good place to leave things.

This is certainly interesting. Using the additional thumb buttons for"core characters" might also free up a key or two for more language specific letters like the Scandinavian æ,ø or å.

Do you see polyglot being influenced by Elan, or would you recommend sticking to those layouts if typing multiple languages regularly?

Looking forward to the results of the upcoming review. I might dive in before that if I can figure out (i.e. spend some time to learn) how to get it set up on my keyboard.

Speaking of Scandinavian languages specifically, it's a bit unfortunate that r is under pinky, as this is the most frequent consonant in Danish, Norwegian and Swedish. But other then that it looks good to me.

R<->S swap wouldn’t upset the apple cart much, but S & ' shouldn't be on the same finger in English...same for Scandinavian languages?
fullgrid

Right, that solves the issue, s is a better option. Apostrophe is not used as frequently as in English, so should not be an issue either.

V. helpful...thx. One could swap '<->Z if necessary...

I appreciate that list having punctuation properly accounted for.

Polyglot will likely take its own path precisely for the other letter concerns you mention.

Nice. If needed one can turn j, v and ; in modifiers on hold and shield them with BILATERAL_COMBINATIONS option as all frequent followers are on the same side.

Hands Down

In the off chance that someone stumbles across this and cares to comment:

I'm feeling better about the SFB distribution and the rhythm here.

w g m f k   'q u o yz v
r s n t p   x a e i h
j c l d b   / - ( ) =
    ,; .:   ␣ ⏎

Finger Bigram Frequency
finger 0 	0.049%	 finger 9 	0.026%
finger 1 	0.173%	 finger 8 	0.039%
finger 2 	0.148%	 finger 7 	0.082%
finger 3 	0.236%	 finger 6 	0.407%
           **total	1.15%**

Even though there are more SFBs than prev iterations, these feel much more balanced, less awkward, as the index fingers can handle SFBs much better than the others. The rhythm on the vowel hand is much improved. It also nicely isolates the vowels, a guiding objective for the Hands Down Polyglot project to make room for other letters (Scandinavian, German, French), which are mostly lower frequency vowels related to the five basics. In this sense, Élan very well might influence Polyglot, as u/Zlatzman mused. It scores exceptionally well on Ian's new KLA, and still rather well on u/stevep99's fork

Hands Down

What I really want is the Hands Down left hand, (which I really, really like), with a right hand vowel cluster that puts A inside of E, U inside of O for better inward rolling (the prob with the first Élan draft I posted was too much outward roll on the left). Here's where I am in that pursiut:

w f m p k   - u o j v
r s n t g   y i e a h
x c l d b   z ; q / '  
      ⇧ ,.  ␣ ⏎

From u/SteveP99's analyzer

      Finger Frequency
 finger 0 	8.16%	 finger 9 	 8.15%
 finger 1 	10.64%	 finger 8 	 8.21%
 finger 2 	13.45%	 finger 7 	19.91%
 finger 3 	19.12%	 finger 6 	12.36%
      total L 	51.37%	total R 	48.63%

     Same-Finger Bigram Frequency
 finger 0 	0.048%	 finger 9 	0.044%
 finger 1 	0.125%	 finger 8 	0.036%
 finger 2 	0.147%	 finger 7 	0.113%
 finger 3 	0.146%	 finger 6 	0.265%
      total	0.925%

It's not A on index, but motion is a bit more inward on the right hand. K is a problem for me there...and I can't find a satisfactory solution. Not sure how I feel about F, P, G...

Q&Z will disappear to a combo or layer (on K & J respectively) like I do w/all my layouts in practice. I'm not thrilled with the index burden on the left hand, but that's solvable with Alt-tx/nx treatment and putting punc back (Élan-tx?/Alt-tx2 ?), which has def grown on me.

Hands Down

I could go this route, based on Alt-tx, with very favorable SFBs and finger burden distribution:

' g m w v   z u o j k
r s n d p   y i e a h
x c l f b   / - q , .  
      ⇧ t  ␣ ⏎

      Finger Frequency
 finger 0 	8.16%	 finger 9 	 8.01%
 finger 1 	10.30%	 finger 8 	 9.77%
 finger 2 	13.22%	 finger 7 	19.57%
 finger 3 	12.77%	 finger 6 	12.01%
  total L 	50.64%	total R 	48.63%

     Same-Finger Bigram Frequency
 finger 0 	0.043%	 finger 9 	0.059%
 finger 1 	0.166%	 finger 8 	0.055%
 finger 2 	0.143%	 finger 7 	0.109%
 finger 3 	0.054%	 finger 6 	0.250%
          total	0.879%

Still has K problem for me (K->W->'->K), but for English only folks, it performs predictably well on Ian's KLA, and as expected on SteveP's fork, where there is greater tolerance for heavier index finger use and less value on hand alternation.

I like this. I've finally started to build up some decent speed on Hands Down Ref, so time to throw that all away. :-P I've never been happy with my +/= access and I'm skeptical about the last update. The previous left hand symbol position (, . :) worked great for me, especially with colon and semicolon swapped (spot the python programmer/VIM user). Elan seems to address both.

[Here is my current Elan layout on an Iris.](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/10222f7b8c7158052ddcaed9ff67f52d)

I've changed the right bottom non-shifted keys because I'm fine accessing () through a layer and I want easy access to _. The Q and Z are useful for VIM. I'm considering swapping space and period because not having space under my left thumb is really screwing up my typing.

phbonachi, thank you for designing these.

After a bit more than two days using Elan, I came to realize that swapping space and period would be a really bad idea - that would put space and comma on the same thumb. Instead I've swapped the pairs to put both space and enter on the left hand. I'll give it a few days to see how it goes.

Keyboard Guide
Hands Down Layout (2020)
By Xah Lee. Date: 2021-05-19. Last updated: 2024-03-30.

Hands Down keyboard layouts, created in 2020 by R Alan Reiser.

Home page at https://www.sites.google.com/alanreiser.com/handsdown/home

The Hands Down layout is not just a layout, but a 5-heads and 3-wings chimera of a semi input system.

    It requires a keyboard with 2 to 4 thumb keys. [see Do-It-Yourself Keyboards]
    It requires advanced keyboard firmware, such as QMK. [see QMK Configurator Tutorial]
    For certain keys, such as z, you have to type it by pressing j and f at the same time.
    For modifier keys such as Ctrl, it assumes you have set them up using home row keys as dual-purpose keys. [see Dual-Function Keys (Home Row Mods)]

They have several versions.

The Hands Down layouts seem silly and unprofessional. First they put 5 variations on their site. That's like: “come join us, we have 5 ways to swim in arctic ocean for healthy life.”.

Then, you look at their layouts, putting letter in thumb, but none of the variation has the most frequently used e on thumb.

Then, the worst problem is that it require you to type 2 keys together to input some letters. For example:

    press j+f to enter z
    press p+v to enter q

Given the very exotic layouts and non-trivial way to type z, and requiring fancy batman thumb keyboards that requires advanced keyboard firmware such as QMK , you find that they don't talk about placement of Backspace ⌫ Delete ⌦. Nor the all important modifer keys such as shift, Ctrl, Alt. (they advocate that modifier keys be placed on homerow (not shown in their diagrams), so you have Dual-Purpose keys, which by itself introduces other problems. [see Dual-Function Keys (Home Row Mods)] )

The issues of key shortcuts is far more critical for hand health and software operation efficiency than letter layouts.

but also, when you press f+m fast, it becomes f+l. Because Hands Down has a system it calls Adoptive Keys, which they think makes typing certain 2 letter combination easier. Quote:
Hands Down Layout Adoptive Keys 2021-08-04
Hands Down Layout Adoptive Keys 2021-08-04

When you get into this level of complexity, you need to compare to not other keyboard layouts, but other input systems. For example, abbrev system (such as Microsoft Word auto correction, or emacs's various function templates and name completition [see Emacs: Abbrev Mode] ) , shorthand system (such as the statistics based word completion used in every smart cell phones), math input system [see Design of Math Symbols Input System] , or even comparable to Chinese Input Methods and Japanese Input Method . Also, if you require complex hardware that support Dual-Purpose keys on home row and chording, then, what stops you from comparing to chording systems such as Stenotype Machine or Using Piano to Type Text?

For example, let's say, you design a keyboard, such that, there are 4 extra dedicated keys under thumb. Each one, are used to insert 4 of the most frequently used words, such as “the”, “and”, “that”, “what”. Will this system, already be more efficient than the Hands Down system?

Halmak Keyboard Layout

This is an AI designed keyboard layout that was built within the keyboard-genetics project. More details and a documented process can be found on the blog Nikolay Rocks.

Keyboard Layout
Features

    Build based on the real world hand movements analysis
    Nearly maximal possible typing efficiency
    Very low overall fingers movement distance
    Very low same finger / same hand usage overheads
    Very low overall horizontal hands movement
    Highly symmetrical design that accounts for individual fingers strength
    Designed with the modern, web based English in mind

Comparisons

During the research I've identified the following results: in terms of efficiency

    QWERTY - 0% (baseline)
    Dvorak - +77%
    Colemak - +84%
    Workman - +101%
    Halmak - +134%

Please refer to the article Halmak Reborn for the more detailed breakdown of the results.

All scripts are opensourced and can be verified in the keyboard-genetics repository.
The Name

The name is a combination of HAL-9000, as a reference to the layout being designed by an AI. And, Dvorak as a gratitude to Mr. Dvorak for his dedication to the layouts optimizations process. The letter m in between is just to make it sound nicer. Or is it!?...
Installation

    Git clone all the stuff somewhere
    Copy Halmak.bundle into your /Library/Keyboard Layouts folder (create if it is missing)
    Sign out, Sign in
    Go to the keyboard preferences and add the Halmak layout
    Ask here in issues if nothing works

Android installation for physical keyboards

    Install Extra Physical Keyboard Layouts from the Play Store
    Source code is available on github
    Connect a physical keyboard to your Android device e.g. via bluetooth or OTG
    Select the Halmak layout in your system menu e.g. System > Language and Input > Physical keyboard > Keyboard Name

Halmak

Last updated Feb 9, 2024

Table of Contents

    Features

This is a Keyboard Layout created with a Machine Learning algorithm to use the least amount of key travel. So 73% of you would write English if you are using the fingers laying on the home row already.

–> Beautiful, but unfortunately not optimized for vim. I think Dvorak seems to be suited better.
# Features

    Build based on the real-world hand movement analysis
    Nearly maximal possible typing efficiency
    Very low overall finger movement distance
    Very low same-finger / same-hand usage overheads
    Very low overall horizontal hand movement
    Highly symmetrical design that accounts for individual finger strength
    Designed with modern, web-based English in mind

More on GitHub and Reddig: Is there anyone who use Halmak Keyboard layout for programming and daily use (Not as Writer)?.

Quick Explanation

I’m not the creator but I’ll add my own explanation. This is a great layout from two approaches:

    It’s an easy-to-transition-to layout. Most letters stay on the same finger, switching with an up-down swap. You can harness your existing muscle memory.

    It utilizes the middle finger-upper row positions for frequent letters. The middle finger is very strong and it's upper row is easy to press. This also avoids putting common letters on the centre column and avoids overloading the index finger.

I think Norman is the 80/20 rule. It solves 80% of the issues by fixing 20% of the problems. The goal here is to get the most gain for the least pain. Great improvement for the minimal effort. A high payoff ratio. However you want to word it.

It's a sliding scale of how much gain-for-pain you want. It doesn’t matter how great a layout is if you don't use it. I believe this layout expands the pool of people that are able/willing to switch from Qwerty. After I learnt Colemak, personally I would have sacrificed ~5% of efficiency for something ~80% easier to learn. (That’s subjective and mostly meant to convey a point.)

This can be done quickly too. I’m trying to get more testimonials, but so far I think (but I'll admit not sure) that you could pick up Norman over a long weekend well enough to be proficient at work again. One user said he switched right before a big paper. Another with 4-9 hours of practice.
Summary.

The following is a summary, you’ll have to read below for all the details. I moved this up so it gets read.

1) Get 60% of typing on the home row.

    Norman gets 60% of typing on the home row, compared to Qwerty’s 25% (defining the home row as the 8 keys under the fingers). This vastly reduces the number of times you have to leave the home row, whereas on Qwerty most frequent letters are off the home row.

2) Reduce travel distance by 46%.

    Norman cuts the distance travelled by 46% from Qwerty. Almost half the distance! That's huge. Over the course of a week this can cut several miles off the distance your fingers have to travel.

    This includes lower amounts of distance on the index fingers. While the index fingers are strong it's easy to overload them.

3) Reduce the strain of reaching.

    Norman puts frequent letters in easy to reach spots and infrequent letters in hard to reach spots. You don't have to, like on Qwerty, reach for E, reach for H, reach down for N, reach up for I and O. The stretch for Qwerty T and Y are replaced by K and J, very infrequent letters. You don’t realize how much of a stretch it is to reach them until you don’t have to anymore.

    Once you get adjusted it's actually unnerving how your hand doesn't have to fly over the keyboard. Both in movement and not awkwardly reaching all the time.

4) Improves Same Finger Bigrams (SFB) jumps and the locations of the SFB.

    Norman reduces most two row SFB jumps to one row, such as CT UN NY. And replaces off-home-row SFB like RT with IR on the strong middle finger. (Covered in detail further below.)

    Norman removes some SFB that are completely off the home row like RT, effectively replacing it with IR where it starts on or ends on the home row.

5) Improves Neighbour Finger Bigrams (NFB).

    Norman also reduces “Neighbour finger bigrams” (NFB) jumps. Even if the two row jumps aren’t on the same finger, neighbouring fingers can be awkward or tiring over time. This includes bringing two row jumps EX, CE, CT, IM, OM down to one row. Eliminating jumps SE, ST, IN, ON by putting them on the home row, along with ET and IO. (Covered in detail further below.)

6) Remove frequent letters from the centre column.

    Norman doesn’t put frequent letters in the centre column locations, which some find an awkward movement (Qwerty G and H). Norman avoids this by keeping/moving them to the middle finger-upper row and ring finger-upper row. D and L remain on their fingers from row swaps, and R is moved to the middle finger-upper row.

    This also keeps the index finger workload and distance more reasonable. While the index finger is strong, it can easily be overloaded since they have 6-7 keys each.

All this can be done with an easy-to-transition-to layout, that’s quite an achievement.
Other neat things to mention:

    H on the pinky: H is an interesting letter, it’s almost always followed by a vowel. Having it on the pinky means there are very few outside rolls to the pinky finger. Especially for the ring finger to pinky finger, which I think is especially uncomfortable. Colemak’s IO and YO ring-finger to pinky-finger rolls are not comfortable. The most common letters before H are TH, CH, WH, SH, GH - all of which are on the left hand so there are very, very few outside rolls to the pinky finger from any right hand finger.

    A on the pinky: QWERTY’s A and S positions are maintained. Norman’s outside roll of SA is far less common than Colemak’s RA. From Mayzner Revisited the counts are: Norman: SA is 6,147 million (AS is 24,562 million). Colemak: RA 19,333 million (AR is 30,309 million). The SA outside roll is not too common. The SA is also unchanged from QWERTY, so it’s one that’s already burnt into muscle memory.

    None of the vowels change fingers. Given the nature of how most bigrams are between vowels and consonants (see Personal Ponderings section), I think this makes it easier to learn. On those longer words that bounce between vowels and consonants, you at least have the vowels on the same finger.

Who is this for?

People who have touch-typed on Qwerty for a long time and have lots of muscle memory. This muscle memory cannot easily be undone and a new layout learned. It’s for people that want an improved layout to reduce finger travel, reduce fatigue, and reduce RSI, but who don’t want to take months to become productive and proficient in a new layout.
Priorities

For the 80/20 concept, I think the priorities are:

    Keep changes to a minimum and keep changes to the same finger as much as possible.

    Letter frequency, get the 8 most frequent letters to the home row.

    Letter frequency, get the next 3 frequent letters R D L in good strong positions. When you look at the histogram, there are 11 frequent letters before it drops off quickly. That's the 8+3.

    Bigrams and patterns.

Notation

For this document, home row will mean the 8 keys under the fingers. That means Qwerty’s ASDF JKL; or Norman’s ASET NIOH. This excludes the centre column locations (Qwertys GH or Normans GY).
Q: So what if most letters stay on the same fingers?

We've spent years and decades associating letters with specific fingers every time we type. That may seem like a different take on it, but I think it’s true.

There are two pieces, we associate a letter with:

    a finger, and:

    a finger movement.

Do you notice which one came first? I think the strongest association is letters with fingers.

We often talk about associating letters with a keyboard location, but there’s more to it. If you’re a touch typist, you’ve automatically been associating a letter with a finger for a long time. This is a deeply ingrained brain memory, not just muscle memory.

I postulate that keeping letters on the same finger will greatly improve adoption time. You 1) keep the ingrained letter-finger association and 2) only adjust the finger movement. Right out of the gate it wins more than half the battle.

There’s also an age factor for many users. We often read about how your brain becomes less elastic with age. It's harder to mentally rewire the brain as you get older.
Q: But you are changing muscle memory with same finger changes.

I know what you're saying. Locations yes, but the association of letters with fingers is far more ingrained. Changing letters on the same finger is easier by an order of magnitude. It is a change, I’m just trying to simplify the wording.

When I learnt Colemak I found my fingers wanted their old letters. Not the old key locations, their old letters. E.g. my right middle finger wants to type I, even in the qwerty K position. My right ring finger wants to type O, in the qwerty L position. I found my fingers were associated with their old letters and that was very hard to change. All the letters that changed fingers were hard and slow to learn, I had to both undo the old mental assignment and learn a new one.

In contrast Colemak’s T, N, and J were the easiest to learn, because they were the same finger as before.

Seriously what else in life have we integrated our brain and fingers so completely, that we don’t even think about it when we type. This is deeply integrated into our brain from a young age.
Q: What if I don’t actually touch type?

I think hunt and peckers know where the letters are, they just need a visual confirmation - like needing hand-eye coordination. It's not like you’re looking for the letter brand new every time. So I think the advantage of Norman is still there, but it might be lower.
Q: Why does ease of transition matter?

Considering how many people are stuck on Qwerty and can't or won't take the jump to a new layout, this is a big consideration. It's that old adage, it doesn't matter how good the solution is (Dvorak, Colemak) if it’s not used. With so many people stuck on Qwerty, Norman has a role. I think Norman expands the pool of people that are able/willing to switch.

There are many people that can't take or don’t want to have much downtime. A big change will impact productivity too much and take too long to become proficient. They can't take on Colemak or Workman (and Dvorak is right out).

If pure efficiency is what we're after we'd all use Carpalx's layout and everyone would advocate for it, but there's practically no movement behind it. Colemak has the biggest current movement and it's sold as being easy to transition to (but overdone imo. Colemak-DH also does away with much of that). Obviously this is a factor behind the movement and popularity of Colemak, over say Dvorak or Carpalx. Norman gets the big ticket items with minimal changes.
Typos

An under-discussed topic is how many typos a new layout will introduce and how long that lasts. Layouts with lots of changes will take a longer time to adjust to and have more typos for a longer time. I think Norman won’t introduce as many since there are fewer changes.

This can be a serious issue in professional fields. You and your work won't be as professional. Your documents might not be understood, or the meaning actually changed. In legal documents that could be a big deal. (It doesn't have to be written by a lawyer to be a legal document, almost anything can be pulled into a courtroom.) Maybe typos in your code means it won't compile.

On all of these you may have to spend time combing through your work. Some typos are easy to notice, some are not. Some typos are still words so the spell checker doesn't highlight them. It's best to have fewer to begin with - which I think is a plus for Norman.

Typos can be long term too. I don't think it's "Day A" is start of switch, "Day A+n" is end of switch and then "day A+n+1" the switch is completely done and no typos related to the switch will be made again. This can last a long time even after you become proficient.
Q: But it still changes 14 keys compared to [layout’s n keys].

There’s more to it than the number of keys changed. Like keeping most of the letters on the same finger, taking advantage of existing brain and muscle memory, and keeping most of the typing patterns the same. These all make it much easier to transition to.
Q: How much do typing patterns stay the same?

I think the best measurement of ease of transition is to consider how much the typing patterns stay the same. This is the bigram finger to finger movement and how many have to be relearnt. There are 26x26 = 676 bigrams.

Typing patterns refers to these bigram finger to finger movements. Learning a new layout is not just the locations of single letters, it's also all the bigrams and going from one letter to the next letter, i.e. one finger to the next finger.

I realized this issue when after many months on Colemak I would have weird hangups on how to type. For example the word “does”, the OE would mess me up. O is common, I know where that is. E is common, I know where that is. But the OE bigram is uncommon. I was not used to O being followed by E in a new layout. The same thing happened with many other uncommon bigrams. So I think the finger to finger bigram movement is a big factor when learning a new layout.

Norman maintains 71% of bigram typing patterns, keeping them on the same finger to finger movement. I found this by adding up all the bigram frequencies for the bigrams that stay on the same finger to finger. By comparison Workman maintains 21%, Colemak 18%, and Colemak-DH 15%. This makes Norman massively easier to adopt because it maintains far more same finger to finger movements. Especially if you've been typing for a long time - you likely don't even spell out words and solely go off muscle memory.

Let’s also look at where both letters change fingers. I have to invert the scale to percentage that change (lower is better). Norman changes both letters in 0.8% of bigrams. Colemak changes both letters in 32.1% of bigrams, Colemak-DH changes 36.9%, Workman changes 24.8%.

What’s missing with these numbers is 1) I don’t mean to suggest that Norman’s same finger swaps are zero on difficulty, rather that it’s much easier. 2) On the human level, as the number of bigrams changed goes up, I expect the difficulty goes up exponentially, not linearly. So I expect layouts like Colemak, Colemak-DH and Workman are exponentially more difficult than suggested here. And in comparison, Norman is even easier than suggested here, relatively speaking. Although the numbers not reflecting same-finger-changes mitigates this.
Elaborating on all the letters.

Feel free to skip this section, the diagram illustrates it.

See this chart on letter frequencies.

    First, it puts the 8 most common letters on the home row. The A and S are already there. E and D swap, bring T down, N comes up, I comes down, O and L swap. All of these are on the same finger! The only exception is H, which goes to the right pinky.

    Second, the D and L are put on the upper row from simple row swaps. The R is moved to the strong middle finger-upper row.

    Only 4 letters change fingers to achieve all that. First moves H to the pinky and the P moves back to the old N spot. Second moves R to the middle finger-upper row and the infrequent K moves to the bad Qwerty T spot - a good match.

    Fortuitously the next most common letters C M U are in good original positions. U remains in its original location and while it's an easy transition it also leads to bigrams with multiple letters. Ideally U would move off the index finger to avoid this. F Y P J K ; are put into good positions. W G B V Q X Z stay in their good original positions for their frequency.

All together this means that with Norman 12 letters stay in their original spot, 10 letters stay on the same finger, and only 4 letters switch fingers. That’s pretty impressive for what it sorts out.
Q: What was that about overloading the index fingers?

The index fingers are responsible for 6 letters while the other fingers only have 3. Actually most people use the left index finger for C, making it responsible for 7 letters.

While the index finger is strong it’s responsible for a disproportionate amount of the work. It's very easy for them to be overloaded if multiple frequent letters are put on them. Add in another 4-5 letters and the index fingers end up doing a lot of work. (See the distance charts below.)

E.g. Colemak puts the frequent T D on the left index finger, and the frequent N L H on the right index finger. Colemak-DH maintains these. Workman puts the N L on the right index finger. Dvorak puts D H on the right index finger. Norman only puts T on the left index and N on the right index. And keeps/moves the R D L letters on the middle finger-upper row and ring finger-upper row, helping to balance out the load.

The middle fingers are seriously strong fingers, and the upper row is very easy for it to reach. They can easily take some of the load off the index fingers. Also they’re dedicated to pretty much only 2 letters (For the left hand most people use their index finger for C, so the left middle finger is only assigned 2 letters. For the right hand the comma is infrequent, so it's mostly 2 letters as well). To use a phrase to convey a point, it’s almost criminal to not use the middle finger for frequent letters since it's such a strong finger, and instead put all the work on the index fingers. But the problem is SFBs (see below).
Q: How does it rank?

I'll give the distances because that is objective. Analyzer scores are very sensitive to how they’re programmed, e.g. how much it alternates hands, or how much it ‘rolls’, etc. It’s also not possible to model ease of transition, which is Norman’s biggest advantage.

For an easy-to-transition-to layout Norman packs quite a punch:
Keyboard 	Distance 	Distance 	Distance
	(km) 	(miles) 	(% reduction from Qwerty)
MTGAP 	2.592 	1.611 	46.3%
Workman 	2.613 	1.624 	45.9%
Norman 	2.615 	1.625 	45.9%
Colemak 	2.616 	1.625 	45.8%
MiddleMak 	2.710 	1.684 	43.9%
Semimak 	2.739 	1.702 	43.3%
Dvorak 	2.813 	1.748 	41.8%
QWERTY 	4.829 	3.001 	0%

*Source: 62 page / 31k word compilation. Left index used to press Qwerty C location. Includes punctuation. Key presses is the sum of the letters frequency, E is so common it bumps up any finger it's on.

Norman reduces travel distance by 46% with an easy-to-transition-to layout, that’s massive. It also does a decent job on balancing out the number of key presses on the hands. Also see how the number of key presses for the index finger is lower on Norman.
All the finger distances

I'm going to give the raw distance travelled in metres. Percentages rely on the total distance travelled, which changes between layouts, so it's not comparable.

Note that distance is different from the number of key presses. The fingers don't move for the home row, the distance travelled is to the other letters.

*All distances in metres. Same source as table above.

This is really interesting. Qwerty’s travel distances are extremely high, and all the alternatives make big reductions. But Norman's reduction comes with minimal changes and is pretty much identical on the distance reduced, in addition to a more balanced index finger load.

First note the index fingers move way more than the other fingers.

Norman moves to balance this out, mostly by transferring some of the work to the middle finger and a bit to the ring finger. Norman's index fingers move less than half Qwertys distance. Even the middle fingers and right ring move substantially less than Qwerty.

On Colemak the index fingers have to move considerably more than the other fingers. This is because it adds D on the left and H L on the right.

Workman’s left index moves considerably more than Norman’s because it combines C M there. But it’s lower than Colemak because it removes the D and H. The right index is surprisingly slightly less than Normans even with the addition of L, likely because the infrequent K is placed on a diagonal (instead of the Norman’s P).
Zoom in on index fingers
Keyboard 	Distance 	Distance 	Total 	Index Finger % of total distance
		L Index 	R Index 	L+R Index
MTGAP 	246 	667 	913 m 	35%
Workman 	753 	505 	1259 m 	48%
Norman 	674 	525 	1200 m 	46%
Colemak 	842 	747 	1589 m 	61%
MiddleMak 	847 	440 	1287 m 	47%
Semimak 	390 	506 	896 m 	33%
Dvorak 	692 	753 	1445 m 	51%
QWERTY 	1413 	1169 	2582 m 	53%

The percentage of travel that the index finger does is quite insightful. Norman's is down at 46% - meaning the index fingers are responsible for 46% of all the distance travelled. On Colemak the index fingers account for 61% the distance travelled, quite a big difference, relatively. Workman’s is close to Norman. MTGAP and Semimak are very low. Dvorak’s and Qwerty’s percentages are a bit deceiving though - the higher index finger distances are hidden by the higher total amount of distance.
Frequency-off-home-row (F.O.H.R.)

At the risk of too much information, another way to look at this is the frequency that’s off-home-row. I.e. the frequency that is not under the fingers. (Defining home row as the eight letters under the fingers.)

It’s different enough from the distances to warrant mentioning. Distances weigh the keys differently, while frequency-off-home-row levels that field. This should be read in conjunction with distance, neither is better than the other, it’s just a different measurement.

I did this after noticing, on Colemak, that my right index finger moves off the home row a lot, which this confirms. The long distance to B on the left hand skews the distance travelled.

*Same source as above.

Where it’s different from the distances:

This better highlights that Norman’s index fingers have proportionally fewer presses-off-home-row compared to Colemak.

More insightful is “Index FOHR as % of All fingers FOHR”. It shows that on Norman the index fingers do 47% of all frequency-off-home-row, quite low, and 53% goes to the other fingers. Whereas on Colemak the index fingers have 65% of all frequency-off-home-row, very high, and only 35% goes to the other fingers. Workman is just a tad higher than Norman with the index fingers doing 51% of frequency-off-home-row. Dvorak’s and Qwerty’s 53% for index fingers is a bit deceiving though, it appears low but that's because the overall total F.O.H.R. is much higher.
The downside - Same Finger Bigrams.

Since Norman tries to leave as many letters on the same finger as possible, it leaves the same finger bigrams of ED, OL, UN, and actually introduces IR. That’s the biggest downside. Same Finger Bigrams (SFB) are an issue, I acknowledge that. If you choose Norman you should be aware of that.

But this is a double edged sword. By keeping these letters on the same fingers you also retain the muscle memory, which greatly eases transition.
The common complaints against SFBs are:

    SFBs impact on speed: It might be an issue if you're really going for super high speeds but most people can get decently fast, certainly enough for their needs. There are also more basic factors to speed which Norman addresses: 1) Being able to keep your fingers on the home row for the most common letters, and 2) Cutting the travel distance by almost half. Also note that Colemak and other layout users will say don’t switch to them with the goal of increasing speed.

    SFB impact on ease of typing: For ease of typing, I think the first and foremost priorities are to get the 8 most frequent letters to the home row, and then getting the next 3 most common letters into strong positions.

Are reducing bigrams a worthy goal? Yes in their own right. But in the 80-20 sense, I think the far more important priorities are 1) minimizing changes, 2) sorting out frequent letters on the home row, and 3) sorting the next 3 most common letters. Norman stops where it does because there is no easy fix. But also see below on how Norman makes most SFBs much easier.

To specifically address U: It stays in the same place and while it's an easy transition, it can also lead to bigrams and trigrams with the 5 other letters on that finger. Ideally U would move off the index finger to avoid this. However there is no easy fix for this.

[IMO if you want speed, you’re better off with r/Plover stenography. Which is also a seriously good option that doesn’t get the attention it deserves. Stenography is not limited to transcription, you can type, code, etc. The video says typical users can get to 140 wpm.]
But there are more considerations on SFB:

Finally, not to excuse Same Finger Bigrams (SFB), but there's more considerations:

    Where the bigrams are: If it's going to be anywhere it’s best on the middle finger between the home and top row imo. This is A) a very strong finger, and B) it’s very easy to move between those keys. The ring finger, while not quite as strong, is also decent. Also the middle fingers are pretty much dedicated to only two letters (most people use the index finger for C, so the left middle finger only has E and D. For the right middle finger, the comma is not frequent so the right middle finger is mostly I and R).

    Off-home-row SFB: Qwerty’s RT SFB is terrible because both letters are off the home row. Norman removes this (and CR), essentially replacing it with RI. While this replacement essentially doesn’t change the SFB count, Norman's RI bigram is much better because one of the letters is now on the home row. So you either start on, or end on, the home row - your resting position. It’s also easier because it’s now on the strong middle finger, which is pretty much dedicated to only those 2 letters (unlike the left index which has 7 letters).

    Two row jump vs. one row: A bigram like UN on Qwerty is a two row jump, but on Norman it's a one row jump. The reduced distance makes it much easier. Try it yourself by typing Qwerty UN vs. Qwerty UJ. Same with NY, on Qwerty it's a two row jump but on Norman both letters are on the same row, making it much easier. Similarly on the left hand the bigram CT is pretty common (more common than LY for reference). On Qwerty CT is a two row jump, but on both Norman and Colemak it’s a one row jump. So even though SFBs like UN NY and CT remain, Norman makes them much easier. [Aside: I didn’t even notice the CT SFB on Colemak, so I think improving them makes a big difference.]

    Travel distance: (this is technically SFB + letter frequency) Let’s look at the left middle finger: On Qwerty it’s D-E, on Norman it’s E-D. But the travel distance on Qwerty is 670 m, on Norman it’s 223 m. Norman has 67% less distance, just from swapping E and D. Likewise look at the right ring finger: On Qwerty it’s L-O, on Norman it’s O-L. The travel distance on Qwerty is 450 m, on Norman it’s 244 m. Norman has 46% less distance just from swapping O and L. Even with those SFB identical, the distance on Norman is far less, which will give less finger fatigue.

Long story short, simply counting the number of SFB doesn't account for the difficulty of them. Norman vastly improves practically all the SFBs which greatly improves the ease of typing, even if the SFB count is similar.

[Looking over this, Qwerty's SFBs are uniquely screwed up. A similar SFB count between Qwerty and Norman isn’t a like comparison. I get that people don’t like SFBs, but Qwerty's SFBs aren’t even in the same league.]
Considerations on NFB:

    Norman also reduces “Neighbour finger bigrams” (NFB) jumps. Even if the two row jumps aren’t on the same finger, neighbouring fingers can be awkward or tiring over time. I’m also going to include ring-to-index finger jumps here.

    Norman brings Qwerty two row NFB jumps down to one row. This includes EX, CE, CT on the left hand, and IM, OM on the right hand.

    Norman eliminates many Qwerty one and two row NFB jumps by putting them on the home row. This includes SE, ST on the left hand, and IN, ON on the right hand.

    Normon also eliminates Qwerty off-home-row NFBs by putting them on the home row. This includes ET on the left hand, and IO on the right hand.

(That's a lot of detail, but you can see the concept by looking at the heat map. Look at how far away all the common letters are on Qwerty and how much you have to jump around to get to them.)
Designing a keyboard to avoid SFBs comes at a cost too:

    Colemak puts D H and L on the index fingers away from the vowels (most bigrams are between vowels and consonants). While this largely solves SFB issues it introduces others: This comes at a fairly significant rearrangement of the keyboard, frequent letters are put in the centre column, and the index fingers are heavily loaded. Some don't like the D and H positions on the centre column, so Workman and Colemak-DH were created.

    Colemak-DH moves D and H to the bottom row, still keeping them away from the vowels and keeps the index fingers heavily loaded. The cost of this is breaking ZXCV and even more rearrangement of the keyboard.

    Workman does a combination of upper row for D R, and lower row for L. The cost of this is more rearrangement than Colemak and also breaking ZXCV.

    Dvorak does this by putting all the vowels on the left hand and essentially everything else on the right hand. This changes virtually everything and takes away any ease of transition. It also breaks the ZXCV and imbalances the right hand in the amount of travel it has to do.

If you want to minimize SFB, you’ll want to adopt a layout that’s designed for it. If you want ease of transition and to use your old muscle memory, then Norman is a better option. I said above with so many people stuck on Qwerty, ease of transition is a huge factor.

(Also from my own tinkering with layouts, unfortunately there's no solution for SFB short of extensive rearrangement of the keyboard. This takes away any ease of transition. I had to come up with a simple rule: For ease of transition, letter frequency is more important than SFBs.)
Comparing number of changes between layouts

Norman, Colemak, Workman keyboards with changes compared. Green are letters that stay on the same finger, orange are letters that change fingers.

To compare:

    Norman: 12 letters stay in their original spot and 14 move, with 10 letters moving on the same finger and 4 letters switching fingers.

    Colemak: 10 letters stay in their original spot and 16 move, with 4 letters moving on the same finger and 12 letters switching fingers.

    Colemak-DH: 5 letters stay in their original spot and 21 move, with 6 letters moving on the same finger and 15 letters switching fingers.

    Workman: 6 letters stay in their original spot and 20 move, with 8 letters moving on the same finger and 12 letters switching fingers.

    Middlemak: 10 letters stay in their original spot and 16 move, with 5 letters moving on the same finger and 11 letters switching fingers. (But I think “keeping” ASRT order will make it easier than the numbers suggest.)

    Dvorak: 2 letters stay in their original spot and 24 move, with 2 letters moving on the same finger and 22 letters switching fingers.

Now you see how Norman is really an easy-to-transition-to layout.

(*I excluded ; because I wanted it to add up to 26 letters to double check and they all changed it. Remember that Dvorak changes all the punctuation as well.)
Q: Who is this not for?

    If you want a fully analyzed and designed optimization, it’s not for you.

    If you’re NOT heavily ingrained in Qwerty, you can consider a more optimized layout.

    If you can take the time to learn, you can consider a more optimized layout.

Q: Who is this for again?

    Those who want an easy change to a much improved layout.

    Those who are heavily ingrained in Qwerty and don’t think they can make big changes like Colemak.

    Those who can’t take much downtime to become productive again.

    Those who don’t want to take ~6 months or even ~1 year to fully come back up to proficiency.

Ergonomic keyboards

These are good too. One Dvorak reviewer on youtube said the biggest improvements to his RSI was in order: Posture, Ergonomic keyboard, then Dvorak, and each step was a smaller improvement. So I think an Ergo keyboard and an 80-20 layout fix is a great combination!
Hand Balance Summary based on Frequency and Distance

I’m not sure where to put this because on reflection there is a lot more to hand balance (see my personal ponderings section below). But I’ll put this here.
Keyboard 	Dominant Hand 	Hand Balance ratio based on Frequency 	Hand Balance ratio based on Distance 	Hand Balance ratio based on Frequency and Distance 	Corrected comparison number for left hand dominant
MTGAP 	Right 	1.00 	1.43 	1.43 	
Workman 	Left 	0.97 	0.82 	0.80 	1.26
Norman 	Right 	0.93 	1.27 	1.19 	
Colemak 	Right 	1.14 	1.15 	1.32 	
MiddleMak 	Right 	1.05 	1.06 	1.11 	
Semimak 	Right 	1.15 	1.30 	1.49 	
Dvorak 	Right 	1.23 	1.86 	2.30 	
QWERTY 	Left 	0.77 	1.06 	0.82 	1.22

(>1 indicates right hand dominant, <1 indicates left hand dominant).

Hand Balance ratio based on Frequency and Distance is a simple multiplication of the two. I did this because having more frequency and more movement on the same hand amplifies the hand dominance. Or if one hand had more frequency and the other hand had more movement, that would mitigate it to some degree. This is by no means the best or most definitive way to look at it, but it's what I've managed to come up with.

The "Corrected comparison number for left hand dominant" is a hard math thing to explain (that I hope I'm right about anyway). E.g. For workman listing 0.80 gives the wrong impression the hand dominance is equivalent to 1.2 (20%). But it's actually 1.26 (26%), because you'd have to multiply 0.80 by 1.26 to get 1.0.
Hand Balance based on Frequency

You can skip this if you want, this is the frequency on each finger.

*Same source as table above.

* indicates vowel hand (Norman and Qwerty are mixed enough that there is no vowel hand). The ratio between the hands can change quite quickly, so I think that indicates the differences between the layouts better (>1 indicates right hand dominant, <1 indicates left hand dominant). I know it doesn't add up to 100%, the analyzer is doing some rounding behind the scenes. I'm not going to round any further.

You can skip this if you want, this is the distance on each finger.

* indicates vowel hand (Norman and Qwerty are mixed enough that there is no vowel hand). The ratio between the hands can change quite quickly, so I think that indicates the differences between the layouts better (>1 indicates right hand dominant, <1 indicates left hand dominant).
END

I’ve also made my own minimalist keyboard layout ASERT and ASETG if you want to check them out. ASERT has all letters changing on the same finger, ASETG has 3 letters change fingers, while Norman has 4 letters change fingers. The short of it is that ASERT's position of K and P leaves opportunity for improvements, which Norman and ASETG takes advantage of. (You’ll have to see the ASERT diagram for that to make sense). Looking at ASERT will also help you make sense of Norman if it still seems odd to you. We actually came to the same conclusion independently.

This is an interesting presentation on the origins of Qwerty. He says the layout was alphabetical with the vowels on the top row.
My Personal Ponderings
Layout Flavour

There are two main factors that impact the flavour of a layout. I cover this in the next two sections.
Interaction between Vowels & Consonants, Hand comfort, and Hand Balance

First is the interaction between vowels and consonants. What got me thinking about this is how to measure hand dominance. The two most obvious metrics for hand dominance are 1) The number of key presses 2) The distance the hand has to travel (which is different from the number of key presses, because you don't travel to the home-row). But that doesn’t seem sufficient to me anymore.

How I’m thinking of this now is the interaction between the vowels and the consonants. Doing the math myself, 75% of bigram frequency is between vowels and consonants, 5% is between vowels and vowels, and 20% is between consonants and consonants. Open any page and you can see this pattern yourself. Considering there's 6 vowels and 20 consonants, the vowel-to-vowel / consonant-to-consonant aspect is pretty much identical on a per letter basis. But the vowel-to-consonant pattern is very prominent, especially considering there's only 6 vowels.

The interaction between vowels and consonants is the easiest way to think about bigrams and longer patterns that emerge from that. I think how arranges the vowels and consonants is the first factor impacts the flavour of a layout.
Letter Placement of the 9th, 10th, and 11th most common letters.

The second factor in layout flavour is the placement of the 9th, 10th, and 11th most common letters. When you look at the letter frequency there's 11 very common letters before it takes a drop. There's 8 spots underneath the fingers, where the first 8 letters go. So that leaves 3 common letters and where do they go?

Colemak places them on the index fingers laterally and index finger upper row. Colemak DH places them on the index fingers bottom row and index finger upper row. Workman places it on the middle and ring fingers upper row, and then one on the index finger bottom row. MTGAP places them on the middle fingers upper row (which I’m a fan of) and index finger upper row. Semimak on the middle and ring finger upper row. Dvorak has to place 4 because it puts U on the home row, so places them on the index fingers laterally, ring finger and pinky finger upper row (please no).

Wherever they go is the second big factor in the "flavour" of that layout. That is where most common finger movement will be, so it better be in a strong location in addition to a good flow with the consonant vowel interaction.
Is it rolls, pinball, or alternating hands?

I can see this as highly subjective, this is my take.

Inward rolls are comfortable. Outward rolls not so much. When it comes to the upper or lower row, generally jumping around the rows can become awkward very quickly. I can’t go over every permutation but suffice to say the comfortableness is very dependent on the exact pattern. There are many rolls that are comfortable, but there are just as many that are awkward or uncomfortable.

But once it gets longer and starts going in/out/in/+ it's less of a roll and more of a pinball, being stuck on one hand bouncing back and forth rapidly. The problem is when you get to tri/quad/penta/+grams, rather than bigrams. This is where I'd call it a pinball instead of rolls. Having the pinball stuck on one hand for long sequences can get uncomfortable pretty quickly.

The clearest line between the two is probably that it's a roll when it is strictly inward or outward. But when it starts going both inward and outward, that's where it becomes a pinball.

This is not limited to a number, but the dividing line is typically the trigram. Trigrams can be either rolls if it’s only inward or outward, but trigrams could be a pinball instead if it’s bouncing back and forth. When you get into quad+ grams on one hand, it’s likely pinballing. For example: Rolls can be like RR or RRR (R means right hand, RR means right hand twice in a row, RRR means right hand three times in row). Pinball can happen with RRR, but most certainly with RRRR, or RRRRR, or RRRRRR, etc.

The easiest way to avoid this pinball effect entirely is to alternate hands. This is best done by putting the vowels on one hand and the consonants on the other. This was how Dvorak approached it and I’m starting to recognize the advantages of it more.

Applying this thinking to various layouts (also note the most common vowels in order are E A O I. Then U is a distant fifth and Y a little less than U.)

Example first, the word “absolute”. L indicates the letter typed with Left hand, R is right hand.
Keyboard 	Left hand/Right hand pattern
QWERTY 	LLLRRRLL
Workman 	LLLRRRLR
Norman 	LLLRRRLL
Colemak 	LLLRRRLR
Dvorak 	LRRLRLRL
MTGAP 	LRRLRLRL
Semimak 	RLLRLRLR
Colemak

Colemak has E I O U Y (all except A) on the right hand. This is 80% of the vowel frequency. Combined with several frequent consonants N H L M + K J this leads to a lot of bi/tri/quad/+grams that are done on the right hand.

First, this can be the cause of uncomfortable NFB (Neighbour finger bigrams). Some find HE, I find LE/EL. This can't be overlooked, NFB was the whole reason Colemak-DH was created. The very common HE bigram highlighted it, but the concept applies to all NFB when consonants and vowels are close.

Second there can be a significant pinball effect where it bounces repeatedly between the right hand vowels and the frequent N H L M + K J. Or longer patterns with only token input from the left hand. E.g. a bi/trigram on the right hand, followed by one letter on the left hand, then another bi/trigram on the right hand again is still very right hand dominant.
Colemak-DH

The right hand swaps H and M. That works to reduce the frequency of the center column, which some find awkward. But it doesn't change the, as I see it, underlying problem of a pinballing effect between the letters and consonants.

Another point, Colemak with DH changes a lot of the keyboard. At that point, users can also consider full change layouts. Colemak DH leaves shortcuts accessible, but for typing it’s a lot of changes and you can consider a full change layout instead.
Workman

Workman also has E I O U Y on the right hand. But it gets rid of H and M on the vowel hand, replacing them with less frequent P and F. This will reduce the pinball effect compared to Colemak since it's now those vowels with N L P F K J. Not sure if that was a goal but that’s how I see this aspect, and a main advantage of Workman.
Norman

Norman keeps E A on the left hand and I O U Y on the right. This spreads out the vowel frequency, with E A being 52% of the vowel frequency and I O U Y being 48%. The pinball effect is effectively more random with half the vowel frequency on each hand. There will be some level of pinballing on each hand, but with effectively 50/50 vowels on either hand it really shouldn't get caught on either hand for long. It relies on randomness though instead of by design, so some will happen. But it should break up many, but not all, longer quad/penta+grams and break up hand dominance. At least that's how I'm leaning towards looking at it.
Dvorak

Dvorak addressed this by creating alternating hands, by putting all the vowels on one hand and all the consonants on the other. This naturally breaks up most bigrams between hands. Tri+grams would basically be nonexistent. But with only 6 vowels and 20 consonants there is a discrepancy in sheer numbers that can’t easily be solved. Dvorak puts the punctuation and a few infrequent consonants with the vowels. But the right hand has pretty much all the 20 consonants - all the frequent and middle of the pack ones. Thus the right hand has most of the hand movement, 65% - a ratio of almost 2:1. (And if you swap the obvious U-I, the right hand goes up to 71% of the distance, a ratio of 2.4:1.) While it breaks up the bigrams quite well, with a movement imbalance like that I can’t call that balanced either. There are also 7 very frequent consonants and only 4 spots under the fingers, so Dvorak puts 3 off the home row - one on the index, one on the ring, and one on the pinky. The L on the pinky finger-upper row is not a good choice imo. And Dvorak oddly puts the I in the centre column instead of U.
MTGAP

MTGAP keyboard layout is a computer generated layout that’s interesting on a few fronts.

First it puts all the vowels on one hand, but it adds N and P to the vowels to help balance out the hands. This is a good concept because there are so many consonants it leads to overwork and awkwardness for the right hand.

Second it moves O off the home row. When you look at the letter frequencies there are 9 common letters before it takes a drop off. Most layouts move one of the last 2, H or R, off the home row. But MTGAP moves O off the home row instead, a bold move. It pairs well above E because the bigram EO/OE is low (38% lower than EU/UE, see below). Assigning both E and O to one hand brings it to 19% of key presses, which is high - in league with the index finger on many layouts, but with less distance because it has no diagonals. So I think it’s manageable.

Third. Another issue is putting a vowel on an index finger. You automatically think with 4 common vowels they go under the fingers. But the index finger is responsible for 6 letters. A vowel under the index finger naturally leads to a fair number of Same Finger Bigrams and even same finger trigrams. Even if non-frequent consonants are put on the other 5 index finger keys, the vowel-consonant bigrams are so high it will lead to a lot of SFB. MTGAP has a very unique solution of putting punctuation on the index fingers. That bigram information is harder to come by, but I think there's fewer vowel-to-punctuation bigrams. And most punctuation is followed by a space, eliminating the punctuation-to-vowel direction entirely. It looks strange but it’s a very good solution.

Fourth. Putting punctuation on the index fingers also lowers the Near Finger Bigrams (NFB) with both the E and O on the middle finger. E pairs with so many letters that even NFB can be tiring over time. Eg with Colemak, many complain about the HE NFB. Personally I don’t like the LE/EL. The JE is also awkward. MTGAP puts punctuation instead of letters on the adjacent index finger, so it takes out all the E, _E, O, and _O NFBs on the index finger. It’s a bit of a nuclear option, but does it ever work. The O on the upper row middle finger can lead to awkward NFB with the two row jump for the index finger bottom row. But again the punctuation on the index finger eliminates all of these. If you have a layout with vowels on the ring finger upper row, that could be an issue too.

Fifth. For general design, MTGAP puts two frequent letters on the middle finger-upper row, which I’m a fan of. These are strong fingers that can easily reach that position. The next one is the index finger upper row, which is ok.

But I think there’s room for improvement.

Possible improvement # 1) The Y and W seem too frequent for their positions. You can see the charts above where the pinkies have a relatively high travel and presses off home row.

Possible improvement # 2) Second, which I'm going to focus on, is which frequent consonant goes best with the vowels?

There are two ways to look at this: a) Which consonant works well with the vowels, or b) Which common consonant does not play well with the other consonants. That one is the odd one out and gets punted to the vowel hand.

On the first one: a) MTGAP adds the N to the vowels, but let's look at adding H to the vowels instead. H-to-vowel bigram frequency is 54% of N-to-vowel, almost half and most of it is HE. Then N and H have roughly equal bigrams with consonants. u/Keybug has pointed out that H is almost always followed by a vowel. Looking at the bigram data H-vowel is 86x more common than vowel-H. So putting H on the pinky finger of the vowel hand guarantees inward rolls and very few outward rolls. So I think H would go better with the vowels. Using H could lead to Same Finger Bigram with P though, so that pathway also needs to be evaluated and likely changed.

On the second b) I think you’d basically need a computer analysis on this.

For MTGAP, some users say it is both roll and alternating heavy, which seems like a contradictory statement. I think with just one common letter N it keeps rolls limited to bigrams and some trigrams, but it prevents any severe pinballing where it’s stuck on one hand for long. (See pinball battle section below for more.)

The hands are still decently unbalanced even with the N (and H would be slightly more unbalanced). The distances the hands have to travel in Dvorak is 65% right hand to 35% left, a ratio of 1.86x (and if you swap the obvious I-U, it goes to 71% right hand, a ratio of 2.44). MTGAP is 59% right to 41% left, a ratio of 1.42. So the ratio does change quickly, it’s not nearly as bad. (For reference the movement ratios are: BEAKL-15 1.48, Hands Down 1.33, Engram 1.43, Dvorak with U and I swapped goes to 2.44. All these layouts with the vowels on one hand tend to be skewed decently, although QGMLWY balanced it with 1.07. Colemak is 1.16, Norman 1.28, and Workman 1.22.)

To conclude, MTGAP has several interesting and bold approaches to solving the problems of putting all the vowels on one hand 1) Moving O off the home row 2) Adding N and P to the vowel hand 3) Putting the punctuation on the vowel hand’s index finger. I think of it as a modern day Dvorak.

Interestingly and oddly, MTGAP 2.0 came out with a very different concept. Not sure what to think about that.

CTGAP looks like an interesting iteration on MTGAP.

APTAP is another iteration.
Epic Rap Pinball battle of layouts: Colemak vs MTGAP

But wait, didn’t I say Colemak had pinballing with the vowels and NHLMKJ? How does that compare to MTGAP's vowels and NPJQZ? Simply put, there's more pinballing on Colemak and less on MTGAP. For a proper look I’d have to add up all the tri/quad/penta/+grams (that's where the pinball becomes a problem) between the consonants and vowels on the hand, but to give a quick picture let’s just look at the consonant frequency. Colemak’s NHLMKJ is 34% frequency of all consonants, MTGAP’s NPJQZ is 15%. That’s a big difference, Colemak’s NHLMKJ is 1/3 of consonant frequency, MTGAP’s is 1/6.6. So MTGAP’s consonants will give far less pinballing where it’s stuck on one hand for long.

There’s probably another factor on comfort: which consonants are on vs. off the home row. Bigrams on the home row with N and vowels are likely more comfortable. But bigrams off the home row, like Colemak's H L etc., are likely less comfortable. To give a quick picture let’s again look at the consonant frequency: Removing N, Colemak’s HLMKJ is 22% frequency of all consonants, and MTGAP’s PJQZ is 4%. A very stark difference in how much the hands have to move off home row for the rolls.

Caveats and considerations: MTGAP’s addition / Colemak's subtraction of A with the rest of the vowels will change it, but remember Colemak's EOIUY is already 80% of vowel frequency. So I think the consonant frequencies 34% vs 15%, and 22% vs 4% for off home row, still give a very good idea of what’s going on. The probabilities would be 1.0*0.8*0.34... vs 1.0*1.0*0.15...

QGMLWY

QGMLWY also puts all the vowels on one hand and adds H and P. It also puts a vowel on the index finger, which leads to Same Finger Bigram (SFB). Dvorak's index SFB isn’t actually that bad, but QGMLWYs is surprisingly quite high on the index finger.

QGMLWY puts two frequent letters in the centre column, which puts a lot of work on the index fingers and has a quite high SFB on the index fingers. QGMLWY also fixed the punctuation in place. Allowing the punctuation to change opens many more optimization paths, like on the index finger.
BEAKL-15, Hands Down, ISRT

BEAKL-15 and Hands Down also put all the vowels on one hand and also have the bold O above E. BEAKL-15 adds H to the vowels which I like. Hands Down adds the far less frequent W - no frequent letters. These also put a vowel on the index finger, which can lead to Same Finger Bigram. I didn’t run the numbers, but BEAKL-15 should be less because it puts 2 punctuation keys, Hands Down I'm not sure with since it has the less frequent U, but also has Y. ISRT avoids this by putting I and Y on the opposite hand with the consonants, but that subtracts from the alternating concept.

BEAKL-15 has a high overall distance traveled because it avoids putting frequent letters on the home row pinky. Hands Down is also high distance because it puts U under the index finger instead of a frequent letter - missing that one common letter does it.

Both BEAKL-15 and Hands Down put frequent letters on the bottom row middle finger, which is likely better on a matrix keyboard. For a standard keyboard, I think MTGAP would be more comfortable.
Halmak

This also has vowels on one side with D for balance. But D is off the home row so will have more uncomfortable rolls than MTGAP.

For general design, it has one letter on the middle finger-upper row while MTGAP has 2 which is better in my opinion.
Engram

Engram puts all the vowels on one hand with the C under a finger, a middle of the pack consonant. So not as balanced. Putting a middle of the pack consonant under the finger also means the distance travelled is bumped up. Not as much as BEAKL-15 or Hands Down but still higher than most.

Engram also changes the qwerty position of “[“. While I’m a fan of opening up 31 key locations to changes to get optimization (the standard 30 + ‘), I think going beyond that is dicey. Same with all the special characters that it changes.
Conclusion on pinballing

With all this, I think if you want a very optimized layout, a layout with the vowels on one hand (plus at least one frequent consonant for balance) and consonants on the other makes the most sense. MTGAP looks the most appealing, I’m starting to think of it like a modern day Dvorak. Though I’d be tempted to switch the H and N around, but that needs a more thorough analysis with all the knock on effects.

Sidenotes:

Afaik MTGAP, QGMLWY, Halmak, are computer generated. Dvorak, BEAKL, and Hands Down are human designed. It’s interesting how they all have the same concept of vowels on one hand.

Back to Norman, the advantage Norman still has is that it can be picked up quickly, both in absolute and relative terms compared to these other layouts. It’s still the 80/20 fix. Solutions like MTGAP can take 6 months to a year to get fully up to speed. If you want something that can help you relatively quickly Norman’s the one.

On Dvorak, if you modify it to solve the most pressing issues of I and L, then you lose the advantage that it’s already installed on OS’s. So why not learn a more optimized layout like MTGAP at that point.
Right or left hand dominant?

Some say it should be right hand dominant because most people are right handed. But look at pianists, I doubt they have an issue with the left hand. Right handedness is more for fine motor control, pressing keys doesn't really require fine control. So I think the concept of the right hand being any better for typing is off the mark or exaggerated. I think the hands are more or less equivalent for typing.
Vowels hand and Y

The letter Y is an interesting problem if you want to have all the vowels on one hand. With 6 vowels, you have to put one vowel on either the index finger or the pinky upper row. The odd one out is commonly Y, though it can be any vowel.

To put the odd vowel out on the index finger can easily lead to SFBs. To put Y on the middle or ring fingers takes away a good spot for more frequent vowel. To put it on the pinky upper row, it seems a bit too common for that hard to reach location. So choices are limited. Y is a problem letter.

Workman just says nuts to it and keeps it on the index finger. MTGAP puts two vowels on the index finger. Colemak leaves A in the QWERTY position, thus avoiding the problem.
Difficulty maps

You typically see the standard difficulty map that puts a difficulty on each key. But I think you need more than the one standard difficulty map. For a fully optimized layout, you also need a difficulty map for ease-of-movement from one key to the next key. For example, on Qwerty the movement QA is slow, QS is very hard, QD is still hard, QF is ok, QZ is horrendous, QX is both horrendous and awkward, QC (with index pressing C) is meh but not good, QW is ok, QE is ok, QR is ok, (but all lead to a slightly weird hand position after), etc, but Q+anything-on-right-hand is much better. You want to create a whole map for Q and the difficulty of the next letter. But I think most analyzers and people focus on QA and QZ because it's a SFB. I think for a fully optimized computer analysis you need 31 difficulty maps - a map for each key and the difficulty of the next key. That’s on top of the standard single difficulty map.

Having 31 difficulty maps can also account for repeat letters, eg LL, SS, EE, OO, etc. You can put in the difficulty of repeating that same key for each of the 31 keys. E.g. using the pinky for Qwerty’s AA isn't so good and QQ is even worse. On Colemak SS, TT, NN, EE are good because they're on the home row with strong fingers. Colemak's OO isn't so good. And it can use the same scale as the rest of the difficulty map.

I think something for trigrams should also be done like this, but it’s tough without unduly interfering with the bigrams. What’s difficult for the first and third letter, is easy between the second and third letter.

Trying to find something comfortable between the first and third letter could interfere with the comfortableness between the second and third letter. You don’t want the trigrams to overpower the bigram difficulty maps. E.g. Q_Z is difficult (with the underscore representing a letter inbetween them). Let’s say it’s QIZ. QI is marked as easy, IZ is marked as easy, but the Q_Z is bad. But if you optimize for the Q_Z to be easy, you’d interfere with making QI and IZ easy, which are likely more important. So I think to account for trigrams it needs to focus more on punishing the awkward movements between the first and third letter, rather than promoting good trigrams. E.g. punish really awkward trigrams like Qwerty’s Q_A, Q_Z, etc. This is not limited to the same finger, it can be done for adjacent fingers. Q_X is also awkward and can be punished. Same with Q_C. Q_S is not as bad, but also not great and can have a moderate punishment. This would be another 31 maps.

As for quadrigrams, the difficulty between the first and fourth letter, by the time you get there it’s lessened significantly, e.g. the word Quiz, the Q and Z is okay. It could be added, but this is likely the point of diminishing returns and not worth it. (Perhaps really common quadgrams may be worth checking, which is “that”, “ther”, “with”, “tion”.)

[But didn’t I say that patterns come last? For ease-of-transition I think that’s true, first focus on getting frequent letters to the home row and to good spots first. Qwerty is just that bad that it didn’t even do this. My ponderings here are about getting full 100% optimization. There is no easy transition option for this principle. I still think Norman is excellent as an 80-20 fix.]
Distance

The distance travelled is a factor. The biggest benefit is from reducing it down from the insane Qwerty distances, but after that I think it’s diminishing returns. For example, the distance improvements that Colemak, Norman, and Workman make are all important. But the differences between them are so minor that any difference is negligible. I’m not sure how diminishing returns on distances can be programmed into an analyzer.

As for getting infrequent letters on the diagonals, this can be influenced by both the distance and the base difficulty map. But a base difficulty map can also make the lower diagonals V N easier than the upper diagonals T Y, and B significantly harder than V and N.
Shift Key

I can’t be the only one that thinks the left shift is more comfortable. So an analyzer could include using the left shift key with most of the frequent capital letters (like the start of words and “The”) being in a comfortable position, the right hand being obviously better.
More Analyzer

Of course from everything above, I think the index fingers shouldn’t be overloaded either. The only way I can see programming this is as a relative multiple to the other fingers. I think this is necessary since the bigram map wouldn’t account for the distance, just the difficulty/comfort.

Quick Explanation of Norman

This is a great layout from two approaches:

    It’s an easy-to-transition-to layout. Most letters stay on the same finger, switching with an up-down swap. You can harness your existing muscle memory.

    It utilizes the middle finger-upper row positions for frequent letters. The middle finger is very strong and it's upper row is easy to press. This also avoids putting common letters on the centre column and avoids overloading the index finger.

I think Norman is the 80/20 rule. It solves 80% of the issues by fixing 20% of the problems. The goal here is to get the most gain for the least pain. Great improvement for the minimal effort. A high payoff ratio. However you want to word it.

It doesn’t matter how great a layout is if one doesn't use it. I believe this layout expands the pool of people that are able/willing to switch from Qwerty.

See the Wiki for a more in depth explanation and details.

Also see r/Plover, it’s open source steganography. It’s an interesting approach that should get more attention. It is not limited to transcription, you can use it for typing, coding, etc.
If you use Norman, leave a testimonial.

Layouts for typewriters were numerous and varied before the introduction of QWERTY on Remington & Sons typewriters in 1874. The introduction of new technologies that remove some of the limitations of early typewriters as well as the introduction of electronic keyboards came with the ability to make new key layouts.

DHIATENSOR, also known as the Blickensderfer Scientific Key-Board layout by its creator was the primary keyboard layout available for the Blickensderfer typewriter.

The layout had been based on a study of the English language that had showed that 70% written text and about 85% of all words used the letters D,H,I,A,T,E,N,S,O and R. Those were put on the keyboard's home row.

On the original typewriters, the home row is actually on the bottom, but it is moved up one step to the home row position on a standard keyboard.

Dvorak was created by Dr. August Dvorak in the early 1930's as an alternative to the QWERTY layout. Data was gathered in the form of closeup films of a typist fingers to create a primitive heat-map of key use and hand position.

    The most common letters were roughly placed in the rows typists were thought to like best: home-row, top-row and last bottom-row.
    Hand-alternation: To avoid occasional long strings of one-handed-operation, emphasis was placed on hand-alternation. All vowels were moved to the left side of the keyboard, and onto the home-row, including the rare U.
    The right-hand is favored and receives 14% more usage than the lefty, which is 33% more than QWERTY because it favors the left hand with a similar percentage.

Criticisms of the Dvorak design:

    Extreme dissimilarity from QWERTY. System and application hotkeys that are designed around QWERTY will need to be relearned or remapped
    Hand-alternation. Poor single handed typing speed
    Poor placement of common letters. L is a case-example of this

Evolved was released around 2002 on Peter Klausler's own website. During his use of Dvorak he wondered how a better modern layout could be created with the aid of computers. A metric of "work" needed when touch typing with each layout was developed. The factors of what constituted work were as follows:

    All 8 fingers start on the home row.
    An index finger stretch to the center costs 1 unit.
    Fingers of the same hand can't be on both the top and bottom row. When a top-row or bottom-row key is to be hit, each finger on the bottom or top row (respectively) moves to the home row, and that costs 1 unit each.
    After that, if a finger has to move up or down to hit the key, it costs 1 unit. An additional unit is charged to move to the bottom row (except for the index finger in its natural column) or to move an index finger to the top row in its unnatural center column. Furthermore, moving a pinky up or down costs an additional unit. I have weak pinkies.
    Hitting two distinct keys in succession with the same finger is really bad; 3 more units are charged.
    An extra unit is assessed when nonadjacent fingers of the same hand are used in succession and they are not both on the home row.
    But adjacent fingers are charged a unit to hit keys on distinct rows, and one more if there's adjacent movement between the top and bottom rows.
    When a shift key is used, the fingers of the shifting hand move to the home row for free afterwards.

These rules were applied to a corpus of 20mb of English text from books, the bodies of all the authors emails, and about 100k lines of C code. This was to best reflect the authors typing habits. Along with the text samples there was the layouts which were generated programmatically. Additional considerations were added to the layout generation program for alternating hands and adjacent key hits (rolling) after real world testing. Klausler ended up switching back to Dvorak layout. [2]

Programmer Dvorak was released by Roland Kaufmann in about 2003 to his own website. The stated goal of the layout is to eliminate RSI in the way Dvorak does for copy typist with optimizations for programmers. Symbol placement in Dvorak is seen as just as bad as QWERTY to writing source code in C, C#, Java, Pascal, Lisp, CSS, XML and alikes. Thus the changes to symbol placement is meant to reduce the distance to commonly used symbols in the most common programming languages of the time. This leads to number being scrambled, though in a meaningful way. The numbers hit by the left hand are odd and in descending order starting with 7 and wrapping back around to 9. The numbers hit by the right hand are ascending even numbers starting with zero. Symbols that are regularly under the number row are on the unshifted/lower case layer while the numbers are on the shifted/upper case layer. This is because symbols are more common in source code then numbers as having pre-defined numbers in source code is an anti-pattern. For languages other then English a "Compose Key" is used to create accented characters.[4]

Capewell-Dvorak is a modified version of Dvorak created in 2004 by Michael Capewell. The layout came about through issues Michael found with Dvorak and how he tried to reconcile them. The perceived issues are as follows:

    Common shortcuts such as Ctrl+C are difficult to reach
    The "I" key is much more common then the "U" key which is not accounted for
    "GH" is a common digraph which are on the same finger
    "F" and "X", "Y" and "B" on QWERTY, are more difficult to hit then accounted for
    Hitting the upper row with the pinky finger, specifically for the "L" key, is more difficult then accounted for

The Capewell Layout was created in 2005 by Michael Capewell and released to his own site as a work in progress. Inspiration for creating the layout was drawn from Peter M. Klausler's Evolve layout generation program. Thus the layout is generated through a script along with some restrictions on how the key layout can be changed. Goals of the layout are as follows:

    Significant reduction in movement over QWERTY (IE: 48% or 49%)
    Maximize trigrams and bigrams on the same hand but different finger (IE: AS, WE, REA)
    Minimize unconformable combos that exist on QWERTY (IE: DR, DT, CF, CS)
    Keep ZXCF in the lower left to maintain system shortcuts
    If a key in one of the center columns is used, have the keys typed before and after the key be typed by the other hand
    Minimize use of certain positions on the keyboard (On QWERTY: Q, Z, P, /, J, B, X, .)

QWERF was released in 2006 by Michael Capewell on his own site. It is a modification on QWERTY thus should be easy for users to learn. More common keys were moved to the home row for a finger movement reduction of 28% over QWERTY.

Colemak is an alternative keyboard created by Shai Coleman, named as a portmanteau of Dvorak and Coleman. Its design goals consist of easy transition from QWERTY due to repositioning only 17 letter keys. Additionally the AZXCV shortcuts are in the same location perhaps allowing an easier time switching from QWERTY.

It also claims greater efficiency than Dvorak. Furthermore it places complete emphasis on the home-row: the ten most-common characters in English are on the ten home-row keys.

Colemak DH is a modified version of the Colemak layout which moves the D and H keys from the central column to improved locations under the index-finger home position. This allows for a more comfortable and symmetrical hand position. Like in the Workman layout, the central column keys are deprioritized. However as no keys change fingers from standard Colemak, this is achieved without adversely affecting Colemak's impressive stats on same-finger bigrams.
Carpalx Family

The Carpalx project was created around 2005-06 by Martin Krzywinski as a project to find the best keyboard layout to minimize typing effort. This was to be achieved through measuring then optimizing the following in respect to QWERTY:

    Hand-alternation or hand-balancing
    Same-finger typing reduction
    Finger flow such as rolling
    Stronger typing finger use and index finger/pinky finger reduction
    Difficult stroke path limiting (IE upward row progressions such as "nse")

Many layouts were measured through these methods and optimized derivatives were made off these existing layouts. Completely optimized layouts generated by the computer not using existing layouts as a reference were also created. The original primary focus of this project is for English language optimization but other languages, such as Dutch[5], were measured and optimized in recent years.[6]

Workman was created in 2010 in a blog post by OJ Bucao. It is designed around the use of a non-staggered layout or ortho-linear layout but works just fine on standard staggered layout keyboards. The main design goal is to keep the fingers to their main 4 columns per hand and de-prioritizing columns in the middle and sides. This minimizes diagonal and lateral movement.

3l was created in 2015 by Jack Rosenthal, inspired by the symbols layers of Neo, but with letter arrangement optimized for English. As a result, it requires significantly less finger movement than many other common layouts. Additionally, "typing distance is not the only factor that 3l optimizes for. 3l helps increase hand alternation, reduce bottom-to-top row jumps, decrease lateral motion, and also strives to be easy to learn".

Arensito was released in 2001 by Håkon Hallingstad and is also known as the Hallingstad layout. It was originally made to suit the Kinesis Contoured and two-handed Maltron, though an adaptation for usage on standard keyboard was developed later. The named comes from its home-row as apposed to QWERTY which named from its top row. The design intentions are as follows:

    Places the eight most used characters under your fingertips
    Is the layout that minimizes the probability that you use the same finger twice (in succession)
    Is the layout that maximizes the probability for using neighbor fingers in succession (and keeps the probability of sequences like y-d or z-l diminishingly low). This lets the fingers strike diagraphs and trigraphs extremely fast
    Keep the workload off the pinkies. Both pinkies press a button about 40% less than the other fingers

Some punctuation and programming symbols are placed under the AltGr layer, where they are closer to the fingers' home position.

Neo was released in 2004 and open sourced to allow multiple users to contribute to. It was developed with the experiences of other ergonomic layouts like Dvorak in mind. It is mainly targeted at German users, but supports nearly all characters of Latin-based alphabets, as well as the Vietnamese and some African alphabets. It consists of six layers, available by combinations of multiple modifier keys. Using these layers there are special characters available which are not easily available in QWERTY-based layouts, like mathematical symbols and Greek letters. The layers are as follows:
Layer 	Usage
1 	Lowercase characters
2 	Uppercase characters, typographical characters
3 	Special characters, especially for programming, etc.

AdNW is a Dvorak-like layout which appeared around 2012 for the German and English languages.
History

AdNW is a layout that emerged from online discussions about Neo, a layout that was made for the German language. The discussion focused on whether Neo layout which was new at the time was an improvement over Dvorak for German and English typist. AdNW was created in response to this converation, from the idea that a layout could be made that was better then Dvorak or Neo for typist who write in both German and English. To do this, Dvorak's usability criteria were coded in a newly programmed layout optimizer. Since the group formed itself during the Neo discussions, they called their layout "From the Neo World", which in German is Aus der Neo-Welt, abbreviated to AdNW.
Philosophy and Performance

AdNW is based on roughly the same ideas as "Dvorak" keyboard. Being in the Dvorak tradition, the following aspects are important:

    Same finger use (low)
    Adjacent finger use(*)(low)
    Inward motions versus Outward motions (high)
    Home row use (high)
    Row jumps (low)
    Finger balance (less on pinkies, more on middle and index)

(*)On QWERTY AS and SD which are right next together is a negative mark against the layout. The AD and SF positions are seen as better. The idea is that adjacent fingers, especially the pinky and ring finger are not completely independent. Making "rolls" with adjacent finger less pleasant and therefore to be avoided. "Rolls" on index and middle finger (e.g. ER on QWERTY) are less problematic and get a lower penalty for that reason.

As a result of these criteria, the AdNW layouts also have a balanced Left/Right distribution (roughly 50% of effort on each hand, compared to QWERTY that puts most work on the right hand) and a high hand alternation. Alternation means that common letter combinations like ER or IN are not typed on one hand (like in QWERTY) but on two hands. In AdNW, E and I are on the left side, R and N on the right.

To make the differences between QWERTZ and AdNW clear, they are compared both visually and statistically. The graphs and data are produced by the AdNW optimizer. In the graphs, the letter 'flow' is shown. The more common a digraph is (e.g. ER), the fatter the line that is drawn between these two letters.
AdNW and QWERTZ compared.

Looking at the graphs, one sees that QWERTY uses the left hand a lot, especially the top row. Some of the most frequent bigrams are on the left top row (WE, ER, ET, RT). On the right hand the frequent IN bigram includes an home row jump, which is seen as highly unwanted. Compared to QWERTY, AdNW is more balanced, has more home row use, and much less one handed bigrams. Frequent bigrams (like WE, ER and so on) are not typed with one hand, but alternate between hands.

Even though AdNW was optimized for 50/50 English/German, it performs quite well for English solely. Comparison Below:
AdNW and QWERTY compared.

Compared to QWERTY:

    AdNW is more balanced left/right (52.7 versus 59.0)
    AdNW is more home row oriented (72% typed on homerow, versus 32.6% in QWERTZ)
    AdNW is more balanced over fingers (less use of right hand index and middle finger; more of other fingers)
    AdNW has more hand alternation (70.8% versus 52.2%)
    AdNW has less adjacent finger bigrams
    AdNW has less same finger use
    AdNW has higher home row usage

Variations

From its inception AdNW has had several variations apart from the standard community release version. The other versions place slightly different weight to Dvorak's criteria (e.g. even lower adjacent finger use, at the expense of other criteria). Some of these variations are designed for different keyboards (matrix/orthogonal layouts, Ergodox, TEK etc.) or for other languages. A user can also calculate a custom layout.

Reasons for calculating a custom layout include:

    Non-standard physical keyboard, for instance a Planck, a Space Cadet, a modded Ergodox or a DIY split keyboard
    Different preferences regarding finger use, alternation, and so on. Users may sacrifice performance on one aspect (e.g. alternation) in order to gain better performance on others (e.g. lower same finger use).
    Physical differences between users
    Input language. Users may not type 50/50 English-German prose, but for instance 30% French scientific prose and 70% Python code.

All this can be combined: a user may calculate an optimal layout for "30% English prose, 40% Swedish forum use, 30% Polish, for Maltron keyboard, that avoids using the pinkies and that prefers the bottom row over the top row". Because of this freedom, there is not one single AdNW layout.

Some other examples of AdNW layouts are:

Community and Use

Software: AdNW consists of a layout and several software implementations:

    Drivers & scripts for using the layout on Windows, Linux, OSX and *BSD; with versions for standard keyboards and for ergonomic keyboards (Ergodox, Maltron and others). This includes AutoHotKey files for Windows.
    Typing training software
    The Optimizer: an algorithm (written in C++11 and open sourced) for calculating a custom AdNW-layout.

Userbase: AdNW is not a massively adopted layout. The (German language) Google user group has around 100 participants, mostly from Germany. The AdNW website is in German as well. However, the manual of the optimizer is in English, and participants on the discussion group say they are very open to questions in English.

Support: The developers of the software are active on the discussion forum and answer support questions.

Development: AdNW has been iterated upon by many in its community. Usually these changes are trade-offs between the specific use-case the layout is being optimized for. The developers claim that there is not much room for further overall improvement, but invite users to prove them wrong and to come up with new ideas.

Introduction

Being a programmer, I type a lot and I suffer from Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) and tendonitis on my wrist. I’ve tried many different ways to help make it better. One way to do this is to switch to a different keyboard layout other than QWERTY. QWERTY was supposedly designed for typewriters to solve a very specific problem–to keep the types from jamming against each other. The most frequently used keys were placed apart from each other to prevent them from jamming. This results in a non-ergonomic layout. However, there are alternatives.
Dvorak and Colemak

The first alternative keyboard layout that came to mind is Dvorak. It was created in the 1930’s and promised to be vastly superior to QWERTY. I went ahead and tried it out and soon enough after doing “ls -latr” on the terminal, I had to shake my head and sadly walk away from it. I didn’t like the way Dvorak was laid out especially for the weak fingers of the right hand.

Then I stumbled upon a layout called Colemak, a relatively new player in the game compared to QWERTY and Dvorak. It was released in 2006 and boasted impressive metrics in terms of finger travel, hand alternation, and same finger frequency. Everyone in the alternative keyboard layout crowd seemed to be raving about it. There are other layouts available namely Capewell, Arensito, Carpal X, etc. After some research I decided on Colemak because of its metrics and probably partly because it looked “normal” and “familiar”. The other ones either looked too radical and different or they suffered from awkward placements of some often used letters. Colemak looked the most promising and I was excited to try it.

So I went ahead and tried it and immediately it felt good. I noticed that my fingers were not moving up and down as much and most of the time they stayed on the home row. However after a few days of practicing on K-touch, a nagging feeling started to creep in. Something felt rather awkward. At first I thought that maybe I just wasn’t used to it yet and it’s the result of the awkwardness in switching to a different layout. So I kept on and while doing so, I tried to analyze how my hands were moving and then the problem became clear to me.


The Colemak keyboard layout
The Problem with Colemak

My initial excitement turned to disappointment when I realized that even though my fingers were not moving up and down as much, they were moving too much laterally. I realized that the main culprit was the letter ‘H’ placed to the right of the letters ‘N’ and ‘E’. ‘N’ is where your index finger rests. Typing ‘HE’ forced the hand to make a very unnatural sideways twisting motion from the wrist and then back again. To give you an idea on why this could be serious, consider these:

    ‘HE’ is the second most frequent bigram in the English language (‘TH’ is the first).
    It occurs in approximately 8,188 words.
    You type it approximately once every 26 keystrokes, or once in every 5 words.
    At 40wpm, you will make this movement 8 times in one minute. More if you are faster.

Just ask yourself, how often do you type ‘the’, ‘these’, ‘them’, ‘when’, and ‘where’, etc. on a day-to-day basis? It’s even worse when you’re typing these words in the beginning of a sentence. Try typing “The” with the T capitalized on Colemak and hopefully you’ll see what I mean. Your right hand will move somewhat like this: you swing to the right to get the SHIFT key with your pinky, then you swing back to the left to get the letter ‘H’, and then you move to the right again to get the letter ‘E’. All this is happening in a split second. That’s quite a bit of lateral movement. Now I’m not a doctor, but multiplied over a lifetime, making that sideways motion with the wrists could be detrimental to people’s hands. It’s nothing personal against Colemak. However, I consider this to be a major flaw in Colemak’s design and I’m concerned that nobody is talking about it. And even if it’s proven to be benign, I find it personally cumbersome.

The letters ‘D’ and ‘H’ are relatively high frequency letters and placing them in the middle of the keyboard forced the hands to make that lateral twitching move a lot. This is by design since the purpose was to optimize the home row keys for high frequency letters to reduce finger travel, which is primarily caused by moving up and down above and below the home row. Colemak by design, as well as Dvorak tries to reduce use of the top and the bottom rows. Actually, when you think about it, most of the other alternative layouts optimize for this very thing. However, I believe that the way that alternative layouts focus on just the home row for optimization is somewhat misguided. We should optimize the keys inside the hand’s natural range of motion and not just strictly the home row.

Other letters that I think are cumbersome with Colemak are the letters G, L, and O. I believe that by moving these letters, horizontal and diagonal stretching could be made less and the load on the right pinky could be reduced.
Improving Colemak

I was really disappointed that Colemak was not the layout that I had hoped it would be. I no longer wanted to use QWERTY. I didn’t like Dvorak, and the other alternatives didn’t look very promising either – but rather very alien. I really wanted Colemak to work however I can’t live with the H-E movement and having to reach for D and H often. I felt that it could be made better.

I tried to see if there’s anything that could be done to solve this. At first I ignorantly tried to replace ‘D’ and ‘H’ with other lower frequency letters and moved them elsewhere still expecting the same metrics. I used the awesome Keyboard Compare applet by John A. Maxwell with modifications from Michael Capewell, and also Patrick Gillespie’s amazing Keyboard Layout Analyzer. Long story short, I got pretty crappy results. It soon dawned on me that just moving a few things around isn’t going to cut it. It’s like playing with a water balloon. If you squeeze on one side, it bulges on other sides. If I was going to get the results that I’m looking for, I had to sit down and do some thinking.
Back to the Drawing Board

I decided to try to create a new keyboard layout based on these ideas. I first came up with the following observations and assumptions:

    Movement on the Keyboard
        The home keys (not necessarily the home row) are the place to be
        Vertical movement between the columns (reaching and folding) are not necessarily strenuous on the fingers and wrists because it is more natural for the fingers to fold or stretch vertically than horizontally
        Side-to-side movements are more strenuous for the wrists than up and down motion
        Diagonally reaching for the top and bottom middle keys are the worst
    Fingers
        Index Finger: very strong, short
        Middle Finger: strong, very long
        Ring Finger: weak, long
        Pinky Finger: weak, short

Most of these seem obvious enough but it helps to jot them down for clarity. I then came up with a set of principles to serve as guidelines to help me with the design:

    Prioritize the home keys
    If vertical folding and reaching cannot be prevented, prioritize reaching for longer fingers and folding for shorter fingers.
    Place more frequent keys under stronger fingers
    Common bigrams should be easy to type.

Here’s a an illustration that I created grading the keys based on the approximate amount of difficulty/strain in reaching or pressing them with 1 being the easiest and 5 being the most strenuous. This grading scale takes into consideration the position of the keys, the strength of and length of the fingers and the staggered nature of the keyboard.


Keys graded based on strain/difficulty (Standard Keyboard)

Below is what it would be on an “matrix style” keyboard also known as “grid” keyboards.


Keys graded based on strain/difficulty (matrix style Keyboard)
Introducing the Workman Keyboard Layout

I call it the Workman Keyboard Layout in honor of all who type on keyboards for a living. And considering that today is Labor Day, I think it’s perfectly fitting.


The Workman Keyboard Layout

In Workman-P, the top-row numbers and symbols have been switched as well as the brace and brackets. It is great for programmers as well as system administrators.


Workman for Programmers
Pros and Cons
Pros

    It’s different from QWERTY
    Comfortable, ergonomic, and efficient — frequent keys are placed within the natural range of motion of the fingers
    Reduced lateral movement of the fingers and wrists
    Very, very low overall finger travel
    Reduced load on the right pinky compared to Dvorak and Colemak
    More balanced left and right hand usage compared to Dvorak and Colemak
    High same hand utilization and plenty of easy combos
    Common English bigrams are easy to type
    ZXCV shortcuts are still accessible with one hand
    Capslock is Backspace (Linux only)
    Shift+Capslock is Escape (Linux only)
    Only 21 characters are different from QWERTY as opposed to 31 for Dvorak
    Not as intimidating or “alien” looking as other alternatives
    Available for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux

Cons

    It’s different from QWERTY
    C and V shortcuts are slightly shifted to the right and needs a little getting used to
    21 letters are moved compared to Colemak’s 17
    Left ring finger has slightly higher load compared to QWERTY, Dvorak, and Colemak.

Key Usage Visualization

On Workman, the most often used keys are evenly and pleasantly distributed inside the natural range of motion of the fingers. It’s even better on a matrix style keyboard.

% Usage of the Two Middle Columns

    QWERTY: 22%
    Dvorak: 14%
    Colemak: 12%
    Workman: 6%

Workman reduces overall usage of the two middle columns by about 50% over Colemak. This 50% reduction can be divided into two parts, horizontal and diagonal index finger stretching. Workman reduces horizontal finger stretching by 63%, and diagonal index finger stretching by 27% over Colemak. This is because Workman efficiently utilizes other easy to reach keys instead of just placing them in the middle columns where they are difficult to reach. Workman also reduces vertical index finger stretching by 30% over Colemak by realizing that it’s easier for the index finger to fold than reach upwards.

Below are some tests using popular books taken from Project Gutenberg:
Tests Using Popular Books
Don Quixote (English)

Distance

Looking at the first example. Colemak achieves the lowest overall finger-travel distance against QWERTY and Dvorak at 30,352 meters. However, Workman is even lower at 29,656 meters — a difference of 696 meters. It doesn’t sound like much, however if we convert it to centimeters, that’s equal to 69,600 cm. And considering that the distance between keyboard keys is approximately 2 cm, typing on Workman is like typing 34,000 less keystrokes than typing on Colemak. At 40 words per minute, that’s equivalent to approximately 3 hours of work. For Dvorak, it’s 126,000 keystrokes at 11 hours of work. And for QWERTY, it’s 1,369,800 keystrokes at 5 days of work.
Same Finger Utilization (SFU)

This shows how many times you had to do a double combo with one of your fingers. For example, typing the word “fuel” using Workman makes your right middle finger do a double combo because the letters U and E are both typed using the right middle finger. Here, Workman has an SFU of 2.185% which means that for every 46 keystrokes (approx. 9 words), one of your 8 fingers does one double combo. Compare that to QWERTY which is at every 20 keystrokes (4 words). Colemak is at every 58 keystrokes or (11 words). Workman, on average, has a higher SFU than Colemak… at +1%. Some people misunderstand and think that this somehow shows increased effort or discomfort. It doesn’t. Effort is the same, because no matter what, you’re still pressing the same number of keys. Comfort shouldn’t be a problem as long as the key is in a comfortable spot. The only thing that SFU might potentially and theoretically affect is speed because typing two letters with different fingers is a little faster than typing them with the same finger. However, I doubt that most people will have any problems with speed at all using Workman especially considering that very many people type very fast on QWERTY, of all layouts.

In case you were wondering, the bulk of Workman’s SFU comes from these combinations: LY, OP, PO, CT, and UE. All of these combos are very comfortable to type with LY being less comfortable because the movement from L to Y is diagonal. Some people might say that this is a very bad thing but in reality it is not. First, LY occurs at about 0.24% of the time on average. That’s less than a quarter of one percent. To put it into perspective, for every 10,000 keystrokes, you will type LY only 24 times. At this rate, you will not even notice it. Even with this extra 0.24% considered, Colemak’s diagonal movements are still greater than Workman’s. Second, even though it’s a diagonal motion, you’re not really stretching that much because when you type L, you fold your fingers (storing potential energy), then you release it to type Y. The stretch is about the same as when you come from home row. It’s even less when you use a matrix style keyboard. Third, LY occurs at the end of the word almost all the time. This is important and it makes a huge difference. This means that when you type LY, you do it at the end of the flow of a word as a finishing stroke instead of being in the middle, which makes it less cumbersome. All in all, I don’t think this is a big deal.
Finger and Hand Percentages

A better indicator of finger effort is the Finger Percentage. If you look at the Finger Percentages for Workman, Colemak, and Dvorak, nothing really stands out at first glance. However, Workman further reduces the load on the right pinky finger over Colemak and Dvorak. The right pinky, despite being one of the weakest, is one of the most used finger on a standard keyboard due to the location of the Enter, Shift, and Backspace keys, as well as additional punctuation keys. Both Colemak and Dvorak have higher right pinky percentage at 11% (253,850 keystrokes), while Workman is only at 9% (207,696 keystrokes). On Workman, your right pinky finger just typed 46,155 less keystrokes than both Colemak and Dvorak… that’s about 4 hours of work using ALL your fingers.

Below are the average percentages for each hand. The two analyzers give slightly different results because they differ a little bit in how they do the calculations. However you still get the idea. QWERTY has about a 4% lean towards the left while Colemak leans to the right by about 5%, and Dvorak, 7%. Workman balances the load between the left and right hands almost equally at 50%.
  	Patrick’s Analyzer 	John’s Analyzer
Layout 	Left Hand % 	Right Hand % 	Left Hand % 	Right Hand %
QWERTY 	54 	46 	53 	42
Dvorak 	44 	57 	43 	54
Colemak 	45 	56 	43 	54
Workman 	50 	50 	49 	48
Same Hand Utilization (SHU)

Dvorak consistently gets lower Same Hand Utilization than QWERTY, Colemak, and Workman which are usually in the 30% range while Dvorak is in the 20’s. Dvorak was supposedly designed for low SHU which means that your hands alternate more frequently. Dvorak’s 20% SHU means that on average, you’re typing 8 keystrokes alternating between your hands, and the next 2 keystrokes, all in one hand as a combo. 30% SHU then means on average, 7 keystrokes alternating and then the next 3, all in one hand as a combo. In designing Workman, I preferred a high SHU (low alternation) over a low SHU (high alternation). I think high alternation is beneficial if you’re typing on mechanical typewriters but not necessarily on modern keyboards. On typewriters, it is very difficult to type combos with one hand because each key needs a large amount of force to depress. You actually rely more on the momentum of your arms and wrists to provide that force so alternating between your two arms is very helpful. However, this method of typing is inefficient on the modern keyboard because modern keys are easy to press. You are no longer reliant on each arm or wrist stroke to depress a single key. Doing so is actually unnecessary and a waste of energy. It is much more efficient to ride the momentum of a single arm or wrist stroke and type a combo rather than just one key. This way your arms and wrists potentially move less while typing the same number of keys, effectively killing several birds with one stone. In the beginning, this will not be apparent. However, as you become more proficient and familiar with the combos, you will be better able to utilize this advantage and type bursts of familiar texts in one hand using fewer hand strokes. An example of this is the word OPERATION. If you were to type this in Dvorak, you could type it as o-pe-r-a-t-io-n where each grouping is a hand stroke–a total of 7 hand strokes. Whereas with Workman, you’d probably be able to type it as o-pe-rat-ion using only 4 hand strokes. Typing Don Quixote, your wrists and arms potentially moved approximately 200,000 times less on Workman than on Dvorak.
Usage of the Middle Columns

What these stats do not show is the usage of the middle two columns. Colemak puts 280,850 keystrokes (12%) on the middle columns versus Workman at 125,875 keystrokes (5%). On Workman, your index fingers (and potentially your wrists) moved sideways 154,975 times less than on Colemak. Dvorak is at 308,533 (13%) and QWERTY is at 512,568 (22%).

I encourage you to do your own testing and analysis. Note that different keyboard testers will give different results as to what layout is better depending on the criteria that they are using to do their measurements and assessments. Since Workman’s philosophy is unique, many testers will register it inferior to others.

To do your own testing, you can use Patrick Gillespie’s Keyboard Layout Analyzer.

Sure go ahead! Feel free to use it if you would like. Below is a link to the implementation/installation files courtesy of David Norman (deekayen).

IMPORTANT: The Workman Keyboard Layout is only a partial solution. Even the best keyboard layout could not completely remove the risk of typing injury. Typing in itself is an unnatural and hazardous task and no keyboard layout could prevent injury without proper precautions and common sense. I suggest learning to type with good hand and finger posture, taking frequent breaks, keeping your hands and wrists warm while typing, and using a keyboard that meets your needs. Our health, after all, is ultimately our personal responsibility.

I hope that you’ll enjoy this layout and benefit from it. If you like the Workman Layout, feel free to tell others about it.

MTGAP’s Keyboard Layout 2.0
June 21, 2010 Michael Dickens	Leave a comment Go to comments

I am deleting this information from my Keyboard Layout Project page. In order to preserve it, I am putting it up in a blog post. All this was written at some point back in late 2008 or early 2009.

MTGAP’s Layout 2.0

Shortcuts at zero value
Ease to learn at zero value
Designed for standard (non-ergonomic) keyboard
Score: 9.67

, f h d k j c u l .
o a n t g m s e r i
q x b p z y w ' v ;

This is a revised layout, designed to be optimal for any keyboard.

HOW DOES IT COMPARE TO COLEMAK?

Colemak is, in my opinion, the best publicly available keyboard layout other than my own. Here’s how it compares in the 8 criteria that my program uses.

Best travel distance: MTGAP’s evolved standard layout = 68069
Worst travel distance: Colemak = 71162

Best same finger: Colemak = 0.34%
Worst same finger: MTGAP’s evolved standard layout = 0.34%

Best same hand: Colemak = 21.16%
Worst same hand: MTGAP’s evolved standard layout = 25.45%

Best jump home: MTGAP’s evolved standard layout = 0.02%
Worst jump home: Colemak = 0.2%

Best hand warping: Colemak = 0.79%
Worst hand warping: MTGAP’s evolved standard layout = 0.92%

Best row changing: Colemak = 7.55%
Worst row changing: MTGAP’s evolved standard layout = 11.71%

Best to center: MTGAP’s evolved standard layout = 1.16%
Worst to center: Colemak = 1.79%

Best rolls: MTGAP’s evolved standard layout = 14.48%
Worst rolls: Colemak = 6.82%

So my layout wins 4 times and Colemak wins 4 times.

MTGAP’s Layout for an Ergonomic Keyboard

---------UNSHIFTED--------------------------- SHIFTED

S___B__________________E___S

I___S__________________T___A
F___P__ctrl(Mac)___esc_E___C
T___C__________________R___E

Hmm…I really can’t make a picture of thumb pads using text. Well, the 2 main buttons are shift and space, with backspace and enter on the other big buttons. On the left is ctrl, alt, altGr, and Mac ctrl. On the right is copy, paste, undo and escape.

MTGAP’s Layout for a Standard Keyboard

The designer of Arensito had 2 really great ideas. The first was to have a whole different layout for special characters, accessed with AltGr. I’ll get to that later. The second was to a way of using thumb pads on a standard keyboard. All the keys are moved up 1 row, and the thumbs go on the bottom row.

---------UNSHIFTED--------------------------- SHIFTED
q , f h d k j c u l . - = BKSPC || Q ( F H D K J C U L ) _ +
TAB o a n t g m s e r i / [ ] || TAB O A N T G M S E R I ?
CAP q x b p z y w ' v ; ! || CAP Q X B P Z Y W " V : &
shift 5 3 2 1 4 shift
AltGr(used to be space)

I put Q in the tilde position because of the Mac shortcuts CMD-TAB and CMD-Q.
1: space
2: backspace
3: shift
4: enter
5: a dead key that causes the next key pressed to be its QWERTY position. This is mainly for keyboard shortcuts: hit this key, then hit CTRL-C where C is in its QWERTY position.

About that special characters layout. You press AltGr to access this layout.

9 7 5 3 % $ 2 4 6 8
/ = * 1 \ _ 0 : ; #
^ + | @ [ ] { }

This layout puts the most common special characters on the home keys. It’s also easy to remember: I spent no time trying to memorize it, but I have no problem remembering it. Odd numbers are all on the left, and evens are on the right. All the paired symbols (like brackets) are on the bottom. All the mathematical symbols are on the left. \ and |, which are on the same key in QWERTY, are next to each other. As a little bonus, % is in its QWERTY position.

What if you want to use this keyboard?

I can’t help you there. I designed these keyboards for the fun of it. If you want to use a better keyboard, go to Colemak.com
Maybe my keyboard is better than Colemak. But it’s not much better. If we all use Colemak and endorse it, it will have a better chance of overthrowing QWERTY than a bunch of random layouts.

MTGAP

MTGAP 30

Having tried different keyboard layouts lately, namely

    QWERTY,
    Colemak,
    Dvorak,
    Colemak-DH,

I kept looking for alternatives and reading in a couple of forums.

One layout that managed to do well, or rather, stand out, in all the different keyboard layout analyzers I tried is the latest version of MTGAP's layout. I am currently using the version that optimizes the 30 main keys on a standard (ISO or ANSI) keyboard, and I'm very impressed. It is a roll-heavy layout with a good amount of alternation and feels extremely smooth overall.

I am, however, not its creator (whose nickname happens to be MTGAP).

Since I am jumping between operating systems a lot, I implemented the 30-key version of MTGAP for the most common ones.

Nowadays, I'm mainly typing on ergo split keyboards which use the Quantum Mechanical Keyboard (QMK) firmware. This way, I can program the layout "into" the keyboard which enables me to use the layout everywhere without having to install software first (but I have to carry the keyboard with me, of course :D).
Installation
QMK

In case you're interested, check out the QMK configuration that is used across all my keyboards.
Linux
Using xkbcomp

With xkbcomp it's easy to specify a "delta" to an existing layout and immediately use it like this:

xkbcomp ./xkb/mtgap.xkb $DISPLAY

So far I've only built the 30-key version of MTGAP with some German umlauts and CAPS as backspace, but it should be straightforward to adapt the file to your needs.
Manual installation

If you use X, do

sudo cp xkb/mtgap_30 /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/

To make the layout visible to GNOME, add the contents of xkb/evdev_section.xml to

/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.xml

(But be aware that system updates can overwrite evdev.xml. Then you have to manually insert the section again.)

The linux version contains the following variants:

    basic
    german (basic plus German umlauts, ß, and ẞ)
    caps_bksp (CAPS as backspace)
    german_caps_bksp (german with CAPS as backspace)

I have gotten it to work on Wayland as well, but I don't specifically remember what I did to get there. IIRC it was similar to the above plus basically telling Wayland to be xkb compatible.
macOS

The macOS version of MTGAP was created with Ukelele, which can also be used to install the layout. On macOS, I also included the fully optimized variant of MTGAP for an ANSI keyboard, but do not personally use it.
Windows

The layout was created using the ancient Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator. It is able to create an installer/uninstaller executable from the *.klc files inside the win directory (30-key and fully optimized versions).

The Keyboard Layout Project
Leave a comment Go to comments

The Keyboard Layout Project is an attempt to design a fully optimized keyboard layout, with no restrictions. It is one of the world’s most comprehensive studies on keyboard layouts and pulls together research from various other sources. I draw a lot of information for this project from the Colemak forum, which is currently the net’s most active site for keyboard layout-related ventures (especially those related to Colemak).

Updates on The Keyboard Layout Project may be found here.

Objectives

1. Find the optimal keyboard layout based on my own preferences.
2. Provide a means for others to design their own optimized layouts.
3. Continue research in the field of keyboard layout design.

Purposes

The Keyboard Layout Project was originally inspired by the inefficiency of QWERTY, the standard keyboard layout on nearly every computer. Many people spend hours each day typing at their computer, and deserve something more comfortable than QWERTY.

QWERTY is flawed, and we need something better. I recommend that people learn Colemak, as it is currently the most viable alternative to QWERTY (as well as being one of the best keyboard layouts out there). It is easy to download, easy to learn, and actually more optimized than other alternatives such as Dvorak.

But if Colemak is such a great layout, why does the Keyboard Layout Project exist?

The purpose of this project is not to produce a keyboard layout to replace QWERTY — at least, not immediately. Colemak is most suited to widespread use. However, Colemak is (a) stable, and (b) does not provide the same flexibility as the Keyboard Layout Project tries to provide.

A widely-used keyboard layout needs to be stable. The problem with stability, though, is that it cannot be customized. The Keyboard Layout Project is intended to demonstrate the creation of a customized layout and to provide the necessary tools to customize one’s own keyboard.

Methods

This project provides a large set of resources for researching keyboard layouts. The project is only run by one person, and there’s a limit to how much I can do; so I provide plenty of external resources. I have a list of alternative keyboard layouts. The list contains about two dozen alternative layouts, which is more than any other list as far as I know. It contains every keyboard layout that I’ve come across. colemak.com also provides a list of alternative layouts.

Designing a layout to be objectively better is a difficult process, as measuring typing efficiency is very difficult. Generally, estimates of whether one keyboard layout is better than another are subjective. There are certain things that everybody agrees on, for example, that moving your fingers around a lot is bad; but people don’t agree on just how bad it is.

I am trying to collect objective typing data by using a program called Amphetype. It gives detailed readings on your fastest and most accurately typed words. In collecting this data I have noticed that how fast different combinations are often depends more on the frequency of those combinations than on the keyboard layout itself. This makes it difficult to collect a sufficient amount of data. For this reason it is also important to collect data on multiple different keyboard layouts. I only know two layouts, so there is a limit to how far I can go. If you want to contribute, see here.

Other Projects

Colemak:

    The QWERTY layout was designed in the 19th century to allow typewriter salesmen to easily type the word “typewriter” and to prevent typebars from sticking. We’ve been stuck with QWERTY ever since.
    Colemak is a modern alternative to the QWERTY and Dvorak layouts. It is designed for efficient and ergonomic touch typing in English.
    Learning Colemak is a one-time investment that will allow you to enjoy faster and pain-free typing for the rest of your life. Colemak is now the 3rd most popular keyboard layout for touch typing in English, after QWERTY and Dvorak. 

This is the world’s best alternative layout. Its creator, Shai Coleman, put a great deal of time into tweaking Colemak. It currently has several thousand users and an active community.

Carpalx Keyboard Layout Optimizer:

    The carpalx project introduces a quantitative model for typing effort and applies it to (a) evaluate QWERTY and popular alternatives, such as Dvorak and Colemak and (b) find the keyboard layouts that minimize typing effort for a given set of input documents. In the work presented here, these documents are English text, but they can be anything, such as corpora in French, Spanish and even programming languages, like C or Python.

    While there are many alternate layouts, the carpalx project distinguishes itself, however, in that it not only proposes new layouts but also describes a fully baked parametric model of typing effort. 

While I do not agree with some parts of carpalx’s model, it is undeniably a very detailed analysis of keyboard layouts that is worth looking into.

Keyboarding Theory

The most important posts to read would be those about keyboarding theory. Here is a list of such posts. Unlike some of my other posts, these generally do not assume that you are familiar with the technical details of keyboard design or with my own ventures (although all of my experiments may be found on my blog or, for some of the older material, my website).

    Hi, I’m the owner of TypingWeb.com, the largest typing tutor on the net. We have hundreds of thousands of typists learning on our site every day. Your project is extremely interesting to me, and if you are interested I’d be happy to add your format (once completed or during testing if you’d like) to our list if supported keyboards, aiding users in learning as well as giving it plenty of exposure. We currently have around 30 of the most popular international keyboards, and we add new ones as users request them. Best of luck!

        Hi Austin,

        I don’t think I’ve ever seen your site before, but it looks really good. I might have to try it out. 😉

        I’m happy to know that you like my keyboard layouts, and if you want to add one or some of them to your website, you certainly have my permission. That said, I generally don’t encourage people to use my layouts because I think people should use Colemak. While I do think my layouts are a little better, the marginal difference is quite small, and Colemak provides much better user support. But like I said, if you want to add my layout(s) to your site, feel free to do so.

        1. I don’t have a Maltron keyboard.

        2. Maltron is similar enough to Kinesis that you can use the Kinesis layout on a Maltron with only small modifications.

    Great project Michael, we are building KeyRocket to teach people keyboard shortcuts (and later other things) based on their behavior/input. Typing speed and Keyboard layout have been in my idea list for a long time. We should talk whether I can help with getting you a lot of typing data. We just need smart ideas how to protect privacy.

    Nice project! I’ve been down a similar road a 6 years ago when deciding to stop using Qwerty and look for alternatives. I spent half a year finding my personal perfect optimized layout (I type in both English, Dutch, C# and Ruby).
    I’ve decided to opt for Dvorak with a little tweak: reversing the U and I. I am glad I did as otherwise I’d probably still be looking for the best alternative and relearning instead of just using a more efficient but still < 20% suboptimal layout; good enough. For the ultimate in language entry use Plover steno, syllable chord keyboard entry. http://plover.stenoknight.com/

    I noticed the Kinesis keyboard layout does not have a shift key listed. I’m pretty sure the default location is not optimal. Have you thought about this?

        Indeed I have. I wrote about this when I first got a Kinesis keyboard. I haven’t incorporated Shift into the program because it’s difficult to model its interactions with the other keys.

        I currently use MTGAP 2.0, but I think the layout on this page is better. I just think the difference is too small to justify re-learning another keyboard layout, which is why I still use version 2.0. I’d suggest you use the layout given on this page.

    Hi, I am a Spanish guy and I have been looking for the right alternative layout. I type regularly in three languages, Spanish, English and German. I’ve half-learned a slightly modified version of Colemak where I’ve put the `ñ´ letter in place of :; and have also replaced ‘? by ´¨ as a dead key, since getting the accented vowels is usually more efficient with a dead key than with AltGr. The deal-breaking problem with Colemak for me is that it that it uses the right pinky way too much to the point that it hurts (the tip of the finger). This is due to the fact that the `o´ letter is more used in Spanish than in English and I also have to use that finger to get the accented vowels. So I have been looking for alternatives. One is QGMLWY, which has some appeal since it lowers the use of the pinkie in all three languages I use, and is more efficient than Colemak in German, slightly superior in Spanish and a little inferior to Colemak in English, according to http://patorjk.com/keyboard-layout-analyzer/. The problem is it has some combinations which are really uncomfortable, like cl (climb, climate) or yo (you, young, yo in Spanish). So I kept on searching and found your web and I’ve been trying your most recent layout and I think is really good for English. I also like the fact that the vowels are all on the left side so I can easily get the accented vowels with a dead key on the right pinky (alternation is good); but some very common Spanish trigraphs are not comfortable at all, `que´, `qui´. So my question is, would it be possible to create, via your program, a compromise international keyboard that keeps the most important Western European languages in mind (English, Spanish, German, French, Italian)? The point is to sacrifice a little efficiency in one specific language in order to achieve a more universal applicability.

        Thank you for your interest! Yes, it would absolutely be possible to generate such a keyboard layout. Right now I only have typing data for English, so I can’t create a new layout based on what I have. If you could get some typing data for different languages and send it to me, I could incorporate it into my program’s data. Or, if you know a little programming, you could probably do it yourself: https://github.com/MTGandP/Typing

    Sorry, but I am clueless about programming, apart from some simple scripts for Autohotkey. I’ve been searching for these word data and all I have been able to come come up with is this:

    Frequency of letters in Spanish:

    http://www.sttmedia.com/characterfrequency-spanish

    Frequency of digrams and trigrams in Spanish:

    http://www.sttmedia.com/syllablefrequency-spanish

    Frequency of letters in German:

    http://www.sttmedia.com/characterfrequency-german

    Frequency of digrams and trigrams in German:

    http://www.sttmedia.com/syllablefrequency-german

    And here you can download huge lists with hundreds of thousands of words and their frequencies:

    https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=3732e80b128d016f&id=3732E80B128D016F!3584

    `es´ for Spanish and `de´ for German.

    Some letters, like á é í ó ú ä ë ï ö ü ß (in both German and Spanish), are created with 2 dead keys usually to the right of :; and to the right of `p´ in a US QWERTY keyboard.

    Thanks a lot for your interest in my idea too!

        Okay, sorry for the delay. Those sites you linked to don’t provide detailed enough data, and I don’t want to spend the time to try to find better data. If you can find detailed data on characters and digraphs, you can use it to run the program. Put the digraph data into the file allDigraphs.txt and the character data into allChars.txt, using the same format that these files use. Each digraph/character has to have an integer that gives its relative frequency. If you find data that gives frequencies in terms of percentages, simply multiply the percentage by some large number and round to the nearest integer.

        This will require some work, but it should be doable. Let me know if you have any questions.

        You may also want to look into the Arensito keyboard layout, which I believe was designed with multiple languages in mind. http://www.pvv.org/~hakonhal/main.cgi/keyboard

            A friend of mine has compiled the program for me and we have been able to mix frequencies of digraphs and characters from English, German and Spanish. The resulting keyboard is this:

            Q P O U Y J M H C B
            A T E I ; L D N R S
            ? K X W G F Z V

            q p o u y j m h c b
            a t e i , l d n r s
            / k : . x w g f z v

            Now I would like to create a keyboard that will keep the signs in their qwerty places (bottom right corner) and will only move the letters. I would also like to replace the qwerty key ‘:;’ by the Spanish letter ‘ñÑ’. How can I do that? Where is the 30 key keyboard defined? And how? Because lower case and upper case letters seem to be linked (they both move to the same places) but not the signs. Where do you define that link and how?

                There’s not currently an option for keeping special characters in the bottom right corner.

                In tools.h there’s a line that says #define DEFAULT_KEYBOARD_30 which defines the 30 key keyboard. However, it will be difficult to get it to use ñÑ. By default, it can only use ASCII characters, and ñ is not part of the ASCII set. You’d have to modify the program to support other character sets, which would require some significant work. If you or your friend wants to take this on, I’d love to see what you come up with.

    Hi, I am trying to create a layout for my language and would like to know how you compute the effort for every key (like 0 -8 -10 -10 40 40 on the home row). In fact, my language contains more than 30 characters, so we need to design a layout (on a ISO keyboard, not an ANSI, which contains one more key between left shift and “z”). So I need to now efforts for other keys, like these ” [ ] \. Thanks.

        I didn’t have any rigorous method for computing the efforts. I basically just practiced typing different keys and tried to gauge how difficult they were to type.

        If you download the most recent version of the typing program, it contains my best guess as to the efforts for all the keys on the keyboard (although it doesn’t have an extra key between shift and ‘z’). You can find the key efforts table in the values.c file.

        I actually did create an AltGr layer about six years ago: http://mtgap.bilfo.com/completed_keyboard.html I used it for a while but I stopped. I found that, while it was quite comfortable, it was too slow to have to hit an extra key. I haven’t made any updated versions.

    Plugging away at Patorjk’s again, trying to fill in MTGAP on the Ergodox map, and I can’t make heads or tails of the Kinesis Advantage Pro layout you have posted here. Mind if I just put in the main 30 with shift on the left thumb and space on the right? I’d probably use the Ergodox Keyboards: Colemak(v2) layout as the base to fill in the blanks and just overlook the lack of Alt, Win, Delete and Arrow keys.

    It looks like you used the “Optimized for the main 30 keys of a standard keyboard” version for the Ergodox (starting row “Y P O U J”). Wouldn’t the Kinesis Advantage Pro version (Top row containing letters “| \ P O U [” ) be better? I can fairly easily submit it, but I don’t want to make it too confusing.

    In a completely different topic, I saw an article entitled “Case-sensitive letter and bigram frequency counts from large-scale English corpora,” by Michael N. Jones and D. J. K. Mewhort of Queen’s University (Kingston, Ontario, Canada), available here: http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.394.1855&rep=rep1&type=pdf

    Everyone knows about the standard ETAOIN SHRDLU (or more accurate but less mnemonic ETAOIN SRHLDCU), but the order of capital letters is the completely different TSAMC INBRP (EDHWL OFYGJ UKVQXZ). It might help determine where to put a single shift key, if that’s the layout you are using.

    It also has information on case-sensitive bigrams (AA counted separate from Aa, aA, and aa, for example), plus “Single-Unit Frequency of Various Nonalphabetic Characters (ASCII 33–64), and Bigram Frequency as Predecessor (#A) or Successor (A#) to an Alphabetic Character.” Basically, it counts when you have an exclamation point after a letter, or an open parenthesis before a letter, and similar stuff.

    Well, the keycaps for my newly purchased Cherry G86-63400 point-of-sale keyboard, with 144 gloriously programmable keys in a matrix format, come in on Monday. Sadly, I have to roll my own “E on the left thumb” MTGap format. Any suggestions on how to tweak your MTGap software to do that? I assume that removing, disabling, or somehow locking e and space (left and right thumb, respectively) somewhere in the algorithm and letting the rest of the program works its magic may work, but I’ve never compiled a C program before, so suggestions on what I need to download, install, and tweak on my Windows 7 computer first would be great. 🙂

        If you think putting E on the left thumb is the best idea, you should try tweaking the scoring algorithm to get that. It makes more sense to write a strong scoring algorithm than to put constraints on the program, since you should get a better layout that way. In this case, however, there is no left thumb key, so I’d suggest replacing the E key with whatever other key you want to put on the main keyboard instead.

    I’ve been roaming the Internet, looking for more bigram frequency data to play with in “The Keyboard Layout Project” program (Peter Norvig’s Google data was great, but limited to 676 2-letter bigrams). I found the article “Case-sensitive letter and bigram frequency counts from large-scale English corpora” by Michael N. Jones and D. J. K. Mewhort, and it considered all uppercase and lowercase letters separately, as well as 32 nonalphabetic characters including the 10 digits (ASCII 33–64; ! to @).

    But the absolute best of all is the supplementary material “Jones-BRM-2004.zip” which gives all of the data in several formats, including Excel.

    If anyone would like to utilize this fun resource, here is the Springer link:

    http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2FBF03195586

    Just head down the page until you see supplementary material. The article itself is interesting as well. Sadly, the authors didn’t count spaces, but that is fixable. Making “The New York Times Keyboard” or the “Usenet Keyboard” should be fun…

    I don’t suppose we could get an official release for the Main 31 (main 30 + apostrophe/quote)?

    … if you are feeling super generous, an official Wide-Mod* optimization would be nice too.

    I’m going to try to give it a crack myself, but… I’m not getting my hopes up.

    Hi Michael,
    I too have been sucked down the dark rabbit hole of alternate keyboard layouts. It seems to hook those of us with a particular propensity for approaching the elusive limits of perfection.
    Three years ago I spent the better part of a year playing with layouts. I used Andong’s keyboard analyzer for my analysis, my goal being to create a layout that improved on both Dvorak and Colemak’s respective strengths.
    The results of my efforts are HIEANRSTM or Balance 12 (being the 12 iteration of a theme):
    BYOU’KDCLPQ
    HIEA,MTSRNV
    X”-.?WGFJZ
    This layout matches Dvorak for hand alteration and improves on inward rotation. It also matches Colemak’s low same finger court and home row statistics. I also borrow an idea from Andong, using the coma as a deadkey SHIFT, further reducing pinky usage and finger balance.
    I have been typing on this layout for about a year now. On occasion (like today) I play around with trying to improve it, but I seem to have found the limit—any improvement in one matrix reduces performance in another.
    It’s remarkable to me how similar our two layouts are. I would very much be interested in seeing the results of running HIEAMTSRN (or Balance 12, as I dubbed it) through your analysis. When two people working independently come to such similar conclusions, it lends confidence that we may be approaching an optimal solution. Looking again at your layout above, I have to admit, I think it may be a subtle improvement to my own—the only thing it seems to sacrifice is hand alteration, which as many of the forums point out, may not be that relevant. Run mine through the numbers and let me know how they compare.

        That layout looks awesome! Can you post the full keyboard layout (including number keys and all the punctuation keys on the right side of the keyboard) so I can properly analyze it?

        Also, have you posted this online anywhere else? I’d like to link to your layout on my Alternative Layouts page.

    Hi Michael,

    Here’s the complete layout for Balance Twelve, following your format above (double spaces separate characters, Caps first):

    \ / # $ % ^ & * _ +
    B Y O U @ K D C L P Q { }
    H I E A ; M T S R N V
    X [ ] : ! W G F J Z

    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 – =
    b y o u ‘ k d c l p q ” —
    h i e a , m t s r n v
    x ( ) . ? w g f j z

    As I said earlier, I have made the coma a deadkey linked to the shift position. This prevents the awkward double stroke coming off the left shift onto the ‘h’ after a ‘Th’ digraph and better weights the left index finger. I have also made the Colemak swap between Caps Lock and Backspace. The more minor punctuation and numbers I have not spent time optimizing. For the rarely used characters it’s still nice to have the visual reference available on the standard keyboard.

    As an artifact of my process, I type with the mirror of the above, but I think the above version is preferable if for no other reason than it preferentially weights the right hand and provides hand alternation for terminal punctuation such as ‘.’ with the Enter key. This is also optimized for the standard asymmetrical keyboard placing the ‘w’ on the lower right as opposed to the upper left in its mirror

    Should you wish to keep the punctuation on the lower right, here is its mirror. For those committed to the zxcvb shortcut keys, this layout can be modified with minimal effect to its overall fitness:

    \ / # $ % ^ & * _ +
    P L C D W @ U O Y K Q { }
    N R S T M ; A E I H V
    Z J F G B ! : [ ] X

    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 – =
    p l c d w ‘ u o y k q ” —
    n r s t m , a e i h v
    z j f g b ? . ( ) x

    This layout, in either configuration scores very well statistically—particularly in hand alteration, same finger strokes, and inward rotation. It scores less well in overall finger and hand balance, weighting the index finger slightly heavily (a common feature of many layouts). To that end I have developed other layouts which try to maximize overall balance to the cost of inward rotation and hand alternation (ASTHL and STNDC for example, available on Patorjk’s site for comparison).

    I have not posted this layout elsewhere. I have uploaded a number of variations on Patorjk’s site if anyone is interested (Balance Twelve, STNDC, HEIAMTSRN).

    I have compared Balance Twelve to MTGAP and, not surprisingly, they score very closely with Balance Twelve eking out the slightest advantage (I suspect solely on the basis of hand alteration). As you say, Michael, at a certain point in the process the cost of switching layouts outweighs any measurable benefit.

    That said, it would be nice to determine definitively which layout—statistically speaking—reigns supreme. I found in my own process that subjective assessment can contribute to determining which characteristics of a layout are preferable, but when it comes to assessing individual layouts one needs objective statistical analysis.

    Here’s to forming some consensus on which layout those of us interested in this rather obscure and pedantic predilection prefer—even if in the end, we each stick to our own pet favourites.

        I replaced the en-dash (–) with a pipe (|) because the program can only handle ASCII characters right now.

        It looks like my program has a bug with the way it prints out individual statistics; I’ll have to see about fixing that. I only got the overall score to work right. For comparison, here are the scores for a few different layouts.

        MTGAP: 1737
        Balance 12: 1999
        Colemak: 2306
        Dvorak: 2472

        Overall, Balance 12 scores very similarly to my best layouts. The biggest difference is that Balance 12 doesn’t do as good a job of balancing the load on the weaker fingers.

        I’ll post a complete comparison once I fix the bugs in my program.

                Yes, you’ll see them. The actual score is many more digits but I truncated them. The score is calculated as a weighted average of all the different penalties (as described here).

    Michael,

    I agree, you get to the point where you either sacrifice inward rotation and hand alteration (as MTGAP does) or finger and hand balance (as Balance Twelve does, somewhat ironically). A given layout’s fitness score will then depend on how you weigh the scoring algorithm accordingly. I became fixated finding a layout that beat both Dvorak and Colemak on their respective strengths—inward rotation and hand alternation for Dvorak and Colemak’s incredibly low same finger count and low travel distance. Neither of these are particularly outstanding at distributing load over all fingers and so it was not a particularly constraining factor in layout design.

    An optimal finger balance would look something like 8-10-16-16 (in percent of total keystrokes) for both hands. For layouts that that optimize this distribution of load, try the following:

    / @ # $ % ^ & * { } [ ]
    V M H G P X L O U Y J + |
    S T N D C W R A E I _
    Z B K F Q ; : !

    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 ( )
    v m h g p x l o u y j = \
    s t n d c w r a e i –
    z k b f q , . ‘ ” ?

    again, with the “,” as a dead-key shift.

    Or this one, generated after seeing MTGAP seeking optimal distribution of finger effort.

    ( ) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
    X C D R K B F U Y _ + |
    A S T H L M N E I O ”
    Z V G J Q P W : ; !

    [ ] # $ % ^ & * { }
    x c d r k b f u y – = \
    a s t h l m n e i o ‘
    z v g j q p w . , ?

    Both of these do a better job of finger load than Balance Twelve but they sacrifice other things.

    MTGAP does a very good job of balancing all factors but at the expense of inward rotation and hand alternation. Again, the importance of these factors remain open to debate.

    When we get down to the minutia, so much depends on the weighting of the scoring algorithm and the sample text used to evaluate a given layout’s fitness. Agreement on these weightings seems like a prerequisite to forming a consensus on best fit. I sought to resolve the tension between Colemak and Dvorak, and I think both our layouts do this admirably. But further distinctions among the myriad layouts, all of which perform admirably, seems like a problem of underdertimination. Any suggestions on how to have that discussion?

    In the end, we should have all likely thanked Dvorak for improving on Qwerty and then thanked Shai Coleman for improving on Dvorak and all left well enough alone. I now wish someone would just come along and say decisively, “This one.” Alas, that is not our condition.

    Thanks for the forum and the discussion. It’s been awhile since I’ve played among the keys.

        I agree. To progress any further, I think we need more empirical data. Ideally, we could get groups of people and train them on keyboard layouts optimized for different combinations of factors and see which one performs best. I don’t know how we would do that though.

        Even more, I would expect each person to have a different optimal layout, since people’s hands work differently. Once layouts are this similar, the variation among them is as big as the variation between different people’s hands.

        I have a vision of the future where every child gets their own customized keyboard layout….

            Hi Michael,

            Did you ever get the full statistics on Balance 12? Since Andong’s layout analyzer (more detailed than Patorajk’s) is no longer taking new layouts, I’ve been using Parorajk’s for my analysis. Unfortunately it does not offer as detailed statistics as yours.

            When working on layouts, I realized the impact of sample texts. How did you resolve this in your program? I ended up generating a sample text based on word-frequency which generated letter and bi-graph distributions nearly identical with those of large corpus analysis.

            I remain skeptical of subjective weightings and so continue to look to the individual parameters rather than any overall fitness score. The optimization of each individual parameter is indisputable, and so the solution which varies least from these optimal solutions should govern our notion of best fit.

            As we said, once layouts are this similar, their fitness scores will have more to do with how we tweak the scoring algorithm than any objective measure of fitness.

            Still, it seems we can set certain limits or boundaries and optimize within them. I imagine by tweaking the settings on your program, one could determine the optimal layout for any one parameter: distance, hand-alteration, inward rolls, or what have you. You would then have a set of optimal solutions which would not be subject to any measure of “overall fitness”.

            Next, you could determine how far from optimal any solution might be for any given parameter. This could be expressed as a ratio over the optimal figure, yielding a standard figure of parameter result/optimal result. Adding these, you could determine the cumulative fitness score for any given solution, without weighting any particular parameter. The only question that would remain is which parameters to include in your solution set, but at least the optimal solutions would be explicit for a given set of criteria.

            Lastly, I did find a minor improvement in fitness according to Patorjk’s analysis tool. by making an adjustment to Balance 12. It’s layout is below. But I’ll stick to my “sub-optimal” solution for now and likely into perpetuity.

            \ / # $ % ^ & * _ +
            B Y O U @ V C D L P Q { }
            H I E A ; F S T R N K

                That sounds like a really interesting approach. As you said, it still requires weighting each parameter to calculate the overall fitness, so I don’t know if this would actually work any better than the current way of scoring layouts.

    Two questions:
    1) how do I set the starting layout that the program uses? I can’t get it to start with e.g. Dvorak…… (I did surf, try and change all sorts of files, comment stuff out etc… to no avail. Please tell me what to do!) I want to optimize the 30 keys, shifted.

    2) is there a way to tell the program to optimize for alternation or for rolls? Or for some happy middle?

    Thanks!

        1) You probably don’t want to do this. Right now the program always starts with a random keyboard layout. This allows it to explore the full range of possibilities. If it always started from the same layout, it would be more likely to get stuck with a sub-optimal result. If you really want to do this, you need to go to keyboard.c:initKeyboard() and remove the call to shuffleLayout(k). Then, in tools.h, change the definition of DEFAULT_KEYBOARD_30 to contain the keys for the keyboard you want.

        2) This is easy to do. Just change the fitness costs for alternation or rolls. You can change costs at run time by typing, for example, “set inwardRolls -5” which sets the cost of inward rolls to -5 (i.e. fitness increases for every inward roll). Or you can permanently change the costs as they are defined in values.c:initCosts(), in which case you’ll have to re-compile the program.

    Thank you Michael. I’m not @ my own pc right now, will try it out this weekend. Regarding question 1, I was suspicious because every time I run the program it gives the same layout. A fine layout, yes, but I wondered how random the starts were…….

    Does this mean that layoutStore.txt and fullLayoutStore.txt (spelling? I’m not seeing the program right now) are not being called by the program? I uncommented and commented some stuff there (using double slashes // ) , would I have to change anything there?

    If the program starts with a random keyboard, how would I force some keys in a position? Let’s say I want to force ?! in the top right. How would I do that?

    My language is Dutch. Which is close to German and (being a germanic language) also quite close to English. Still, spelling rules and words differ as well. For instance, the English word “the” is in Dutch “de”. The roll on many keyboards “th” is therefore less useful in Dutch.

    On letter-level, some of the more extreme differences are:
    Z: English 0,1% German 1,1% Dutch 1,4%
    K: English 0,8% German 1,4% Dutch 2,2%
    C: English 3,5% German 2,7% Dutch 1,2%
    Q English 0,1% German 0,02% Dutch 0,01%

    What this means is that QWERTY is bad in English, and slightly worse in Dutch. It alsow means that MTGAPx.x, Dvorak, Carpalx.x, Colemak, Asset are all large improvements over Querty, but being optimized for English they score lower in Dutch. But, as I said, much much better than Qwerty.

    I type most of my stuff in Dutch (90% ?) , some in English (9% ? like this post), and occasionally (1%) in other languages (German, French, Spanish, mostly in forums)

    And English optimized layout (such as your best layouts, or Colemak, or Dvorak, Klausler or others) will do fine for my use and be still much better than Qwerty. An alternative could be to optimize for my use, so make a blend of input (Ducth, English, German etc) and optimize for that.

    I chose a different compromise, namely to optimize for the most used (90%) language, Dutch in my case. Meaning that 90% of the time I type on the (mathematically) best layout, and 10% is on a suboptimal layout. The Dutch layout would still be good for English and German (and even for French and Spanish)

    The Dutch optimized layout looks good. I’ll post the layouts in the weekend. It had like 16% inward rolls and 4% outward, 0% home row jumps (!) and 45% same hand use. Yet, I was looking for some alternatives. Useing a different starting point or different optimization rules (more alternation for instance) might give me some alternatives.

    Is there a way to see “near solutions”? The solutions that the program doesn’t spit out because they are not signifficantly better, can we see those “near solutions”?

    Sorry for the rambling

            I was suspicious because every time I run the program it gives the same layout.

        That’s actually a good thing—it means the program quickly converges on the optimal layout. If you try to optimize one of the larger keyboards (standard or kinesis rather than main30), this probably won’t happen since the search space is so much larger.

            Does this mean that layoutStore.txt and fullLayoutStore.txt are not being called by the program?

        If you use the “compare” utility, it pulls keyboards from those files. The optimizer still starts with random layouts.

            If the program starts with a random keyboard, how would I force some keys in a position? Let’s say I want to force ?! in the top right. How would I do that?

        That’s a bit tricky. There are two ways to do it: either you can add a penalty for putting ?! in the wrong place, or you can actually force it to go in the right place. For the first method, you can add a penalty by adding a new function to fitness.c. Look at calcShortcuts() and calcQWERTY() for examples of similar things to what you’re trying to do.

        For the second, look at the top of keyboard.c for legalBox[]. Two keyboard positions are only allowed to swap if they have the same number in the legal box. Change legalBox or add a new one to do what you want. Make sure you search the code for where legalBox appears to make sure the code is using the correct legal box.

        I think the second method will be easier, and it seems more like what you’re trying to do.

            Is there a way to see “near solutions”? The solutions that the program doesn’t spit out because they are not signifficantly better, can we see those “near solutions”? 

        Every time it comes up with a new best layout, it prints it. So you can see all of the previous-best layouts it came up with. It runs the optimizer a bunch of times and only prints the result if it comes up with a new best layout, but you could have it print the result every time. In cjalgorithm.c:runAlgorithm(), you’ll see there’s an if statement:

        if (arg.bestk.fitness < prevBestFitness)

        And then it calls printPercentages() in the body of the if statement. If you move printPercentages() outside the if statement, it will print the best keyboard for every round instead of just when it finds a new overall best.

        I’d be interested to see the Dutch layout you come up with!

        All layouts have great rolls. For instance “tien schapen lopen” (ten sheep walk). Very common words in Dutch are de and en (meaning the and and).

        I guess I’ll have to try some, to see which one feels best.

        It looks like there’s a bug in the way it’s calculating same finger. It always says same finger is 0.0%, which is clearly not true.

    After more analysis I came up with this one (ps, now logged in as myself). My corpus is 85% Dutch and consists of reports I wrote, forum postings, some emails etc. About 12% is English, from Wikipedia, forums, weblogs and so forth. The rest is a bit of German, French and some slivers of Spanis and Italian, languages I use – very – occasionally.

    The layout is appealing. I call this one Juli16, after the day and month (Juli, as we call it in Dutch) it was born… 🙂

    / U O P Y X C L B V
    A I E N H M D R T S

    Hands: 57% 42% Fingers: 9.0% 10% 22% 16% 0.00% 0.00% 14% 12% 10% 8.0%
    Inward rolls:7.54%; Outward rolls: 2.94%; Same hand:36.39%; Same finger:1.46%; Row change:12.27% Home jump: 0.66%; Ring jump: 1.44%; To center:3.94%

    The balance could be better: the left middle finger, and hence the left hand, has a lot to do. But, as you can see, most other stats are very good; a nice alternation, rolls, low home jump count.

    The remarkable thing is: I compared in (in Patorjk) to three other good layouts: Colemak, Dvorak and Balance12 (hi Sasha Viminity!) . For various languages. These are the winners – according to patorjk’s algorithm.

    For Dutch: winner is Juli16
    For German: winner is Juli16
    For French:winner is Juli16
    For Italian: winner is Juli16
    For Spanish: winner is Balance12. Number 2 is Juli16. Dvorak and Colemak rank 3 and 4.
    For English: winner is Balance12. Number 2 is Juli16. Dvorak and Colemak rank 3 and 4.

    The funny thing is that French scores very well in Juli16, better than English, although there was much more English in the ‘source corpus’ for which the layout was optimized…. This is partly to be expected: there are not many French words in Dutch, but there are in English. And partly it is good luck I suppose. I did some rough ‘post mortem’, LOL analysis based on http://www.mcld.co.uk/decipher/french.htm If i compare the most used digraphs and trigraphs in French and compare it to the Juli16 layout, it turns out that the nice roll EN is in Frenche the second frenquent used digraph (for the record, ES is the most used in French). OU is on place seven; AI on place eight.

    If we look at the 10 most used French tripraphs in order of frequency, we see that 7 of them are nice to type on Juli16, 2 are ok and one is bad; all based on subjective judgements by me. ENT:good QUE:bad EST:good LES:ok ION:ok AIT:good TRE:good AIS:good OUR:good MEN:good

    Now it’s time for live testing and learning. Later on I will implement some other ideas, such as making the key of q type qu This is one nasty home jump less, and in the languages I use, q is always followed by an u.

    tl;dr Qwerty sucks. Dvorak and Colemak are way better. Balance12 is even better. The best one however, for *my* uses, is Juli16. Juli16 consistently beats Dvorak and Colemak and scores number one for Dutch, German, French and Italian, and number two for Spanish and English – hot on the heels of Balance12.

    Thank you Michael Dickens for your research and nice mtgap software.

        Interesting that Juli16 has the relatively-common OU digraph has a hand roll on the top row. You hardly ever see rolls not on the home row.

        This layout looks strong overall, but I’m a bit puzzled as to why it put D on the home row. I think it makes more sense to put H on the right index and then T on the right middle finger. Perhaps TH isn’t a very common digraph in Dutch?

            Actually it also has the CL outroll and the BL inroll on the right top!

            My frequencies (absolute numbers). For comparison:
            1. n[space] 26370
            2. e[space] 25488
            3. en 24772
            4. er 19054
            5. in 15530
            6. de 15348
            7. an 15059

            30. th 7512 So th is digraph number 30 in Dutch, so not very common.

            The D is common. In digraphs:
            6. de
            9. [space]d
            25. d[space]
            27. nd

            And in characters. Space is the most common character, the top 20 is as follows:
            153014
            e 131661
            n 75812
            a 64661
            t 62001
            i 61617
            r 55141
            o 54372
            s 43318
            d 39204
            l 31717
            c 23156
            m 22053
            g 22024
            h 21980
            u 17724
            p 16980
            v 15756
            k 13952
            b 13210

            So d (39,204 occurences in my corpus) is nearly twice as common as H (21,980). In conclusion: d is much more common than h, and th is a quite rare digraph in Dutch – and remember that my corpus has parts of English in it – reflecting my use of languages on the keyboard. in pure Dutch the th use would be even lower.

                That actually makes sense then. According to http://www.letterfrequency.org/, NTRDS are the most common consonants, and those are the ones on your home row.

    And by pure coincidence, it’s remarkably like a Dvorak mutant. This was never a goal, but it turned out like it.

    Juli16:

    Dvorak:

    After a holiday I am now back, learning two things at a time: touch typing on a new layout – and this after 25 years of qwerty “hunt & peck”. Which, to put it mildly, requiers a lot of dedication. Put less mildly: ¡qué chingada!

    I must say though that I am happy with the layout, hard as it is to learn.

        Quick note: patorjk.com’s layout analyser’s consecutive finger use measurement is flawed. Specifically, it does not properly calculate where R.Shift and Enter keys are used. For example, use capital-A capital-P Return capital-A capital-P as your text input. With qwerty this should be six consecutive finger uses (R.Shift A, 0; L.Shift P, 2; Return, 3; R. Shift A, 4; L.Shift P, 6). It only counts as four.

    Ok, apologies, but attempts at getting a wide mod optimization to run failed spectacularly.

    Current project is optimization of an office mousing and gaming friendly layout. Considering past failure to make sense of the program: How would I set a mask for the first 4 columns (q-r, a-f, z-v) plus number row? … or if any one is feeling particularly generous (I hate to ask this way); what is the result?

            Wow, that was fast!

            As for mask, I mean a way to set an area as unmovable, uneditable or ignored. For instance, applying a numberbar mask and zxcv mask would tell the program to leave those two keys locked in their starting position and optimize the rest of the layout around them.

            I’m looking to optimize the main 30/31 keys right of the 4th column. … actually, to be specific, I’m looking to create an optimized layout that leaves the lefthand shortcut and gaming keys roughly in the same area, around a W-ASD or AWD-S cluster. I figure I can do most of the left hand manually. Pinning down T-P, G-‘, and N-. would be a big help though.

            (A more advanced version would be to fix the WASD cluster in position , then mask it and everything to the right of the 4th column; optimize; then optimize the resulting layout again, masking everything left of the 5th column.)

            Also, sorry about asking for asking for someone to run the optimization for me. It’s just the frustration talking. I’m not used to being quite so lost.

                That’s actually pretty easy to do. If you look at the top of keyboard.c, you can see a bunch of boxes named legalBox.

                In those boxes, each position corresponds to a position on the keyboard. Any two positions that have the same number may be swapped with each other, and positions that have different numbers may not be swapped. So you can just create a box where every key you want to keep in place has a unique number. Then do a find/replace in the files to find wherever legalBox/bigLegaBox/kinesisLegalBox gets referenced and replace it with the name of your box.

                If that’s still unclear or you have any more questions, let me know.

                    Ok, had some problems, but then I tried running the ‘make’ command AFTER editing keyboard.c. Then it worked.

                    I didn’t even try making a new legalbox, just edited the default.

                    While it is running an optimization now, I still haven’t figured out how to run an optimization starting from a specific layout. Improve seems to just run until the layout is “improved”, then stops. Running it several times will get you different results. I don’t know what the purpose of the Use command is, as it doesn’t seem to do what I think it should. I’m not really sure why the program started doing what I wanted it to do. Maybe ‘improve’, then ‘run’?

    Ah, nevermind. I got it working.

    Results of gaming friendly optimization, by placement of WASD:

    *R-DFG keys had the best scores, but would make gaming awkward, with long reaches for shift, tab and ctrl.
    *W-ASD staying right were it was turned out surprisingly well, giving the second best fitness score of the bunch. E obviously gets placed on the F key, so it ends up with a rather high samefinger score. Increasing the weight of the sameFinger variables gave a very different result, cutting down the samefinger to managable levels but hammering fingerwork score.
    *E-SDF keys forced E onto the A key, which more or less killed the fitness score.
    *E-ADF puts an awkward strech on the ring finger, so I did not test it.
    *W-ASF ends up being my preferred version. The extra reach to D is tollerable for gaming, and putting the D on the F key keeps the samefinger scores down, if not low. Higher travel distance than the WASD layout, but the lowest fingerwork score.

    WASF (Basic Punctuation)
    Hands: 48% 51%
    Fingers: 8.0% 9.0% 14% 17% 0.00% 0.00% 20% 11% 12% 9.0%

    You’ll notice quite a few seemingly arbitrary key placements; where a minor tweak will put them into a more familiar arrangement, AND give better scores, such as:

    Hands: 48% 51%
    Fingers: 8.0% 9.0% 14% 17% 0.00% 0.00% 20% 11% 12% 9.0%

    Too much tweaking, on the other hand, and you end up re-implementing qwerty errors.

    David, I don’t completely get what you are trying to achieve. Do you want to keep the qwerty rows qaz. wsx, edc fixed and optimize the rest of the keyboard? Or do want to keep these letters in the first 3 columns, but not necessariliy on their exact qwerty-positions? Or do you wish to keep asdw in its exact qwerty-position, and optimize the rest of the board?

    In your layouts the crucial (or not?) letter D moved, as well as zxcv.

    You know that some games are programmed wrong, in the sense that they use the scancodes instead of the letters that are mapped to those keys. In other words, they use for instance “the key under the 2 and 3” for “arrow up”. Regardless if you mapped a W or a different letter to it… So the safest thing is to keep the much used letters at their exact qwerty locations.

    Also, how important is (whole) keyboard optimalisation for games? In which you use only a few keys, most of the times, and in which you don’t input lots of text… ? But then again, I do not completely grasp your goals!

    You could of course use a qwerty keyboard for games and an MTGAP board (layout programmed in the controller) for other stuff…. . just a thought!

        I wouldn’t call the layout Goal Driven. It is more of an exercise. “What is the best layout we can get, with XYZ as a limitation.” In this case, ‘XYZ’ is keeping the keys left of the center (TGBYHN), left of center; and keep a loose, but tolerable WASD block.

        As such, D moved, and ZXCV got scrambled. That QRG stayed in their Qwerty positions and ZXCV remained on the bottom row was more of a happy coincidence than anything. The original optimization called for (top to bottom) XAQ on L.Pinkie and CDR on L.Index; but swapping them back to their Qwerty rows decreased home row jumps and increased inward rolls.

        As for having multiple keyboards… um… no? That sounds incredibly irritating. The only keyboards I know that allow reprogramming the controller are the Gateway Anykey and the Kinesis Advantage. Neither are available to me. That means an external hardware solution, or software. OSes usually don’t distinguish between two inputs of the same type, so you either constantly swap your layout through system settings (ick), an keyhook application like AHK (tried it, causes conflicts; so, not much better), or you need some sort of external programmable interface. Low demand means it is a DIY job. Double Ick.

    I stumbled upon a very recent, different layout for the Dutch language. It was calculated by Martin Krzywinski (the man behind the Carpalx website) by request of the Dutch online magazine [i]De Correspondent[]/i, who would like to (quote) “allow their reporters to spend more effort on the stories and less on typing” (unquote). The story in De Correspondent is about path dependency, why qwerty is dumb, and then in presents the alternative “dutch language specific” carpalx layout.

    That layout is (as always with the carpalx layouts) nothing like neither qwerty nor dvorak. This in contrast to MTGAP layouts that look a bit like Dvorak… Anyway, here it is. For comparison my Dutch optimized layout (as calculated with the MTGAP software) is below it.

    carpalx, Dutch
    Q F K L M W V U J Y
    S D T N R I A E O G
    ; Z B H X P C , . /

    my layout, Dutch
    . U O P Y X C L B V
    A I E N H M D R T S
    : , ? K Q F G W J Z

    Similarities:
    – most of the homerow (duh…)
    – all vowels on one hand (carpalx puts them on the right side, I on the left)

    Differences:
    – I don’t see as many nice rolls in carpalx, although this is often hard to see, you have to really use the layout.
    – carpalx puts O and G under the home row fingers, at the expense of R and I
    – carpalx gives ; its own key, in my layout the more used : has it’s own key, ; is in the shift layer
    – carpalx puts Q, Y, J and F in “too good” spots. On the other hand M and W are (in my opinion) in too bad spots.
    – why keep , and . in their qwerty spots?

    Anyway, all this is based on arm chair theorizing! I am happy to see a magazine write about our “fringe” hobby of custom layouts, and I’m happy that we now have several layouts for the Dutch language to chose from. I like my own “Dutch MTGAP” a lot and I suspect that it will be superior to ‘Dutch carpalx”, but I am curious enough to try that other layout out. Maybe it feels good and my critisism is all wrong 🙂

    By the way, I have baptized my dutch mtgap layout the “[b]HERMANS layout[/b]”. Why?
    – HERMANS can be written on the home row
    – it is an hommage to W.F. Hermans (1921–1995), one of the greatest writers in the Dutch language
    – He has lived in Amsterdam, Paris and Brussels; my layout does very well for the languages spoken there – Dutch and French (and German as well, which is also a – small – language in Belgium)
    – Hermans was a typewriter-geek, he left a collection of 160 typewriters. Pic here: http://goo.gl/KH792F (for his work he only used one machine though: a red, electric IBM typewriter)
    [b]- so all in all HERMANS is a fitting name for my AIENHMDRTS layout ![/b]

    Ok, got two… three… no, four questions this time.

    1) Are the variables defined somewhere? I have no idea what entries like handWarp and handSmooth are supposed to be.

    2) Can the keepQWERTY penalty be increased?

    3) Can custom variables be added? Or tweaked? I’m looking for a way to add a metric finger frequency. Consecutive-finger might be a great metric at lower typing speeds, but as you start typing faster, a single keypress of separation is not enough time to position fingers for the next keystrike.

    So what I am looking for is a metric based on finger travel distance (previous key on that finger to current key, do not count travel back to home) divided by time (measured in keypresses). Then, penalize accordingly.

    For example Qwerty ED has a travel distance of 20mm over 1 keypress = call it 2.0X penalty rate. FoR has a L.I. distance of 20mm over 2 keypresses = 1.0X penalty. TuRn: L.I. distance 19, time 2; UN R.I. distance 39, time 2. = 0.95X + 1.95X = 2.9X Penalty. ETC.

    Part 2 of the same question is where do I start looking in the code?

    4) … I’ve forgotten what question 4 was. Well, if it is important it will come back to me.

        1) Variables are defined near the bottom of values.c.

        2) Yes. In values.c, increase the value of

        qwertyPosCost

        .

        3) You can do this, but it’s a lot more complicated. In fitness.c, you can see the definitions of all the current penalties. You can define a new function

        calcMyThing

        . Then look for the places where

        calcSameFinger

        and the other functions are called, and add in your function. The main place is in

        scoreDigraph

        .

        The main problem here is that the program is only set up to compare pairs of keys (digraphs), and it sounds like what you want to do requires comparing longer runs of keys. The program works the way it does because it runs a lot faster. I have thought about adding code to support trigraphs as well as digraphs, but it hasn’t seemed worth it. If you want to add support for longer runs of keys, that would be great and I’d love to see what you come up with. But it’s a pretty substantial undertaking that will probably take 5+ hours of programming.

            Thanks for the info! I was hoping the tweak would be easier, but the difficulty level you describe was expected. *sigh* not going to finish this project anytime soon.

            As for the Variables, thanks for pointing out where the default values are stored. Notepad++ ‘find in files’ was not as helpful as I thought it might be. … the thing is, I still don’t know what some of them actually represent. What is ‘Hand Smooth’ or ‘Hand Warp’? For that matter, what is ‘double jump’? Is that a digraph with Number row and Bottom row?

    @ dave – you may look at a different project, adnw.de (there is also a google group ADNW). ADNW stands for Aus Der Neo Welt, which is on Patorjk if you wan to take a quick look. In their program (written in C++) there is a possibility of running trigrams, which does give slightly different layouts. I’m not sure if they calculate ” indirect same finger”, which is what you are looking for.

    Trigram optimization is good for preventing too long strings of letters on one hand.

    The goals of MTGAP and ADNW are different. Both are great programs and valuable websites by the way ! Mtgap seems more geared towards nice rolls, and preventing “waves” on the keyboard (like qwerty adsd or were). Adnw has (I think) no attention for preventing waves, but it does focus on alternation and preventing neighbouring key strokes, especially on pinky and ring. So qwerty as is worse than ad. This is the opposite of the Colemak goal, Colemak prefers as over ad. What Colemak, Mtgap and ADNW have in common is the preference of inward rolls over outward rolls.

    A minor difference (adnw – mtgap) is the distribution over fingers and preference for home and top row. Mtgap favors the top row and pinky use more than ADNW does – and i agree with Mtgap in this. This is easy to tweak though.

    Optimization software is a rabbit hole, I found. Do I optimize for Dutch (which I type most)? Then I get a layout which is not so good for English (relatively, it’s still better than Dvorak, let alone Colemak which is not very good for my language). Or do I optimize for a mix of languages that reflects my use? This means that overall my keyboard is optimal, but also that in my most used language I type on a suboptimal keyboard.

    For multi language (or text versus coding) there is also the question of special keys. Do I want ñüäöß keys? Means I have to give up nice keys as /?’]

    Do I optimize for maximum inward/outward ratio? Then I have to accept a higher more same finger %. Or a larger distance. Etc. Do i WANT or should I prevent neigbouring keys (a.k.a. rolls)?

    I the end, testing out is the best. The AIENHMDRTS layout in my post above is very good, but.. has some long strings on the left hand. It feels like doing too much work with the left hand. That’s why I started tweaking it, and also I started making ANDW layouts.

    @dave, back to your question: go to adnw.de, download the program and look into the code to see if you find inspiration for your tweaks to the mtgap code. The ADNW code is well annotated, so even if you don’t know much of C++ it may be useful.
    @michael: hope it’s OK to mention alternative solutions? also, correct me if I’m wrong on the goals of the programs. Thanks!

    Ok, turns out I was just thinking about trigraphs the wrong way. The work around is; you take your corpus, set a marcro to delete every other character, then paste the resulting text at the bottom of the original text. Boom! Trigraphs, automatically scaled at 50% weight of digraphs.

    Next problem: where is the tool for generating character/digraph files? I’d rather not have to run a count and enter the data for every character and digraph individually.

        I hadn’t actually publicly released the program I used to generate character/digraph files until just now, and it’s not really set up in a way that’s easy to use. I just uploaded it to GitHub (https://github.com/michaeldickens/Frequency). I really should refactor it to make it easier to use, but in the mean time, you can look at it and see if you can get it to do what you want.

    I’m back! I may have mentioned this in one of the previous threads, but back in July 1960, an article was published in The Bell System Technical Journal titled
    “Human Factors Engineering Studies of the Design and Use of Pushbutton Telephone Sets
    By R. L. DEININGER.”

    This article (available here: http://www.beatriceco.com/bti/porticus/bell/pdf/touchtone_hf.pdf ) gives a pretty in-depth description of the experiments done that resulted in the familiar 3×3 + 1 number format used in touch tone phones (and later, smartphones).

    Several interesting facts emerge. First, they tested a lot of formats (the stairstep, the rainbow, the circle, the cross — well, read the article and see the 16 types they tried out).

    Second, the calculator number pad layout (789 456 123 0) is measurably inferior to the touchtone layout (123 456 789 0), at least among people unfamiliar with either, though the difference was small.

    Third, and most interesting to me, *the 3×3 plus 1 touchtone layout was not the layout most preferred.* Out of the five top designs, two horizontal rows of five keys (they tested 12345 67890) had the most preferred votes (the touchtone layout was third), and forth in “least preferred” votes (the touchtone format had the second highest “least preferred votes). Interestingly enough, while two horizontal rows was the most preferred, two vertical rows were the least preferred.

    I do wish they had tested formats with 0 next to 1 — 01234 56789 rather than just 12345 67890 — because having the most common numbers on the numeric keypad “home row” might be advantageous for data entry, especially with Enter or Shift/Function under the thumb instead of an enlarged 0 key.

    Have you tried your code to optimize the numeric keypad? For example, using the numbers and functions available on the 22-key Goldtouch GTC 0077 keypad (picture here: https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0274/7747/products/gtc-0077_ad457c48-3bba-4a2c-a707-73027bc182ba.jpg?v=1389210920 ) and trying different logical groupings of numbers and functions to see which scored best (you want some sort of numeric order, of course, having the numbers scattered all over isn’t good even if it scores well, and +-/* probably should be together).

        I’ve never tried optimizing a numeric keypad, although it wouldn’t be too hard to adapt my program to do that. I think the major limiting factor for keypads isn’t typing efficiency but ease of learning. Numbers have a clear logical ordering (0123456789 or 1234567890), and a keypad should respect that ordering. A hand-designed keypad will probably produce better results. The most relevant fact is that 0 and 1 are the most common numbers, so they should be the easiest to press. The layout of the arithmetic keys probably doesn’t matter much.

    I keep coming back. 🙂 On Geekhack, a person posted a link from the Department of Economics, University of Strathclyde, in Glasgow, Scotland, titled “QWERTY AND THE SEARCH FOR OPTIMALITY.” Here is the link: http://www.strath.ac.uk/media/departments/economics/researchdiscussionpapers/2013/13-24FINAL.pdf

    The paper covers not only the thought that went behind Christopher Latham Sholes’ original QWERTY layout (adjacent typebars in the type basket tended to jam, so keep common pairs apart), but of a later version he came up with, plus a tweak to that version that makes it even less likely to jam. What’s really interesting to me is that it converts a two-dimensional keyboard to a 1-dimensional puzzle (or a circle, anyway), where you really have to consider only the keys immediately to the left and right in the type basket. It makes me curious if there is a keyboard that is “Sholes’ optimal” (least likely to jam in a mechanical format) as well as close to ergonomically optimal (common keys on the home row, few row changes, plenty of nice rolls to the center of the keyboard).

    Here is Sholes’ later layout:

    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 £ & Z
    X P M C H R T N S D G K
    J B W F L A E I O U Y
    Q V : ; . , ! ? – | _

    (Actually, the | at the bottom is three dots in the image. Not sure what that is.)

    Here are two alternates that are a tiny bit better under Sholes’ criteria, according to the paper’s author:

    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 £ & Z
    Y P G C H R T N S D M K
    J F W B L A E I O U X
    Q V : ; . , ! ? – | _

    (Swapping Y and X, F and B, M and G)

    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 £ & Z
    Y P M C H R T N G D S K
    J F W B L A E I O U X
    Q V : ; . , ! ? – | _

    (Swapping Y and X, F and B, G and S)

    Like many early keyboards, the number 1 (one) was replaced by a lower case L (l) , and zero (0) with capital o (O). Just so there is no confusion on why it was missing some numbers. The spacing is kind of weird, but I hope it’s clear enough, and the pictures in the paper are much better.

        This is pretty cool! It should be feasible to modify my optimizer program to create a Sholes optimal keyboard: just modify the scoring function to add a penalty for common pairs of keys being next to each other.

        I’m guessing a Sholes optimal keyboard would look similar to Dvorak, since optimizing for hand alternation is similar to optimizing for keeping key pairs far apart. The layouts from that paper look pretty bad though–they put all the most common keys (ETAOINSR) on the right hand.

    Exactly, the layout gets it halfway right! Interestingly, Sholes Later has 11 letters on the home row, which is better than standard Sholes, that only has 9 letters on the home row. Also interesting is how many lettersSholes puts on the top row, and even one letter (Z) on the number row. As a consequence, there are only 2 letters on the bottom row.

    This fits in the theory that on a typewriter, the bottom row is harder to hit that than the top rows. Whereas many people feel that on computer keyboards, the top row is easier than the bottom row.

    Let’s compare ” Sholes Later” to AdNW (which is a sort of “Dvorak on steroids”).

    xpmch rtnsdgk
    jbwfl aeiouy
    qv:;. ,!?–|_

    kuü.ä vgcljf
    hieao dtrnsß
    xyö,q bpwmz

    Like Michael says, Sholes has all the frequent letters on the right hand, which kind of sucks. This would be an improved version (let’s call it SH Improved) (also I could no tresist swapping D and R)

    xpmch *jbwflk
    aeiou dtnsrgy
    qv:;. ,!?–|_

    I’m not at my own computer now, so I have to use a web analyser (patorjk.com). For fun I compared Qwerty with Sholes later (jbwfl aeiouy), with an improved version of that (aeiou dtnsrgy) and with a very good keyboard (Mtgap, the older version that’s in patorjk.com). Text: Alice in Wonderland (complete book). The results:

    – SH is *worse* that Qwerty. Important culprit is the overload of the right index. No wonder, that one finger types A E R T
    – SH Improved is slightly better than Qwerty
    – of course MTGap is far, far better.

    All in all the typing world would not have been better with Sholes newer versions.

    Ok, so I finally decided to sit down and make some progress on Trigraphs. Or, Secondary Samefinger as I’ve taken to calling it. An example would be RaT, KnIfe or HaNd on Qwerty; where the same finger is used one character apart on a different key.

    Using an admittedly very limited American-English prose only corpus, locking punctuation & ZXVC (vc swapped to represent typing ZXCVB with Ring Middle Index Index Index) and ramping up samefinger penalties – the optimizer came up with this:

    LRM (temp.)
    LRMGQ JFOUY
    SNTDW BHAEI
    ZXVC: KP?

    lrmgq jfouy
    sntdw bhaei
    zxvc; kp,./

    Distance is just a bit worse than Colemak, SameFinger is just a bit better, and Secondary SameFinger is about 30% less. Hand Alternation is at least in the same ballpark as Dvorak, and rolls are about 4.1% inward and 4.2% outward.

    It is funny how that hated Dvorak LSZ combo shows up. Also RN. Which means a lot of Dvorak style heavy Ring and Pinkie use.

    So, a good start, but plenty of room for improvement.

    For those who are curious, the method is; 2x Corpus, 1x Corpus deleting even characters, 1x Corpus deleting odd characters. Paste together and feed into layout tester of your choice.
    Example:
    The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
    The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
    Teqikbonfxjmsoe h aydg
    h uc rw o up vrtelz o.

    Question: Is the original Keyboard Layout Project corpus available somewhere? Not the frequency tables, but the bodies of text themselves.

        Very cool, Dave! I like your technique for testing trigraphs.

        Unfortunately the original corpus I used is not available because it contains some private texts. I had thought about trying to find an official corpus–my original reason for not doing this was that corpora tend to use just books and I wanted to include other kinds of text like informal writing, but there are modern corpora that include informal writing too. It hasn’t seemed worth the effort, but if I were starting over, that’s what I would do.

        I wrote a script https://github.com/michaeldickens/Frequency which converts text files into a frequency list. If you can get a corpus, you could use this program to generate trigraphs.

    Well that was a bit of a surprise, had forgotten I was subscribed to this. Any I have been working with Den (shenafu.com) and come up with some layouts which score well on Patrick’s analyzer, in particular on Den’s alternate scoring. It seems as if Patrick’s scoring rewards you for using AltGr as in Arensito, so Den modified the scoring to include both horizontal as well as vertical distance travelled.

    I’ve got a site which compares the various layouts on various tests… those of Patrick plus a lot more I added. http://www.keyboard-design.com under the Best Layouts section.

    The current best-scoring layouts are using the Arensito approach, with some twists. The idea is that one thumb lives on AltGr, so does not have to move to use it. This required a new physical layout, since ANSI/ISO sucks for something like this. ErgoDox/Kinesis is doable but key layout is not optimal for reducing finger travel.

    Comments on the layouts welcome. The comparison charts may require some time for you to be familiar with pulling results from the database.

    There are links to a forked version of Patrick’s KLA, mainly so that you can see the various layouts and play with them. Not trying to duplicate Patrick. Also the fork uses Den’s scoring, not Patrick’s.

    BTW speaking of Arensito, the version on Patrick’s site is missing two characters, which affects scoring.

    The sections with Patrick’s scoring are not as complete as with Den’s scoring, I need to add the new physical keyboards and then run all the tests. Will take a while.

    Cheers, Ian

Alternative keyboard layouts
Jump to navigation
Jump to search

Layouts for typewriters were numerous and varied before the introduction of QWERTY on Remington & Sons typewriters in 1874. The introduction of new technologies that remove some of the limitations of early typewriters as well as the introduction of electronic keyboards came with the ability to make new key layouts.

Main article: DHIATENSOR

DHIATENSOR, also known as the Blickensderfer Scientific Key-Board layout by its creator was the primary keyboard layout available for the Blickensderfer typewriter.

The layout had been based on a study of the English language that had showed that 70% written text and about 85% of all words used the letters D,H,I,A,T,E,N,S,O and R. Those were put on the keyboard's home row.

On the original typewriters, the home row is actually on the bottom, but it is moved up one step to the home row position on a standard keyboard.

Dvorak was created by Dr. August Dvorak in the early 1930's as an alternative to the QWERTY layout. Data was gathered in the form of closeup films of a typist fingers to create a primitive heat-map of key use and hand position.

    The most common letters were roughly placed in the rows typists were thought to like best: home-row, top-row and last bottom-row.
    Hand-alternation: To avoid occasional long strings of one-handed-operation, emphasis was placed on hand-alternation. All vowels were moved to the left side of the keyboard, and onto the home-row, including the rare U.
    The right-hand is favored and receives 14% more usage than the lefty, which is 33% more than QWERTY because it favors the left hand with a similar percentage.

Criticisms of the Dvorak design:

    Extreme dissimilarity from QWERTY. System and application hotkeys that are designed around QWERTY will need to be relearned or remapped
    Hand-alternation. Poor single handed typing speed
    Poor placement of common letters. L is a case-example of this

Evolved was released around 2002 on Peter Klausler's own website. During his use of Dvorak he wondered how a better modern layout could be created with the aid of computers. A metric of "work" needed when touch typing with each layout was developed. The factors of what constituted work were as follows:

    All 8 fingers start on the home row.
    An index finger stretch to the center costs 1 unit.
    Fingers of the same hand can't be on both the top and bottom row. When a top-row or bottom-row key is to be hit, each finger on the bottom or top row (respectively) moves to the home row, and that costs 1 unit each.
    After that, if a finger has to move up or down to hit the key, it costs 1 unit. An additional unit is charged to move to the bottom row (except for the index finger in its natural column) or to move an index finger to the top row in its unnatural center column. Furthermore, moving a pinky up or down costs an additional unit. I have weak pinkies.
    Hitting two distinct keys in succession with the same finger is really bad; 3 more units are charged.
    An extra unit is assessed when nonadjacent fingers of the same hand are used in succession and they are not both on the home row.
    But adjacent fingers are charged a unit to hit keys on distinct rows, and one more if there's adjacent movement between the top and bottom rows.
    When a shift key is used, the fingers of the shifting hand move to the home row for free afterwards.

These rules were applied to a corpus of 20mb of English text from books, the bodies of all the authors emails, and about 100k lines of C code. This was to best reflect the authors typing habits. Along with the text samples there was the layouts which were generated programmatically. Additional considerations were added to the layout generation program for alternating hands and adjacent key hits (rolling) after real world testing. Klausler ended up switching back to Dvorak layout. [2]

Programmer Dvorak was released by Roland Kaufmann in about 2003 to his own website. The stated goal of the layout is to eliminate RSI in the way Dvorak does for copy typist with optimizations for programmers. Symbol placement in Dvorak is seen as just as bad as QWERTY to writing source code in C, C#, Java, Pascal, Lisp, CSS, XML and alikes. Thus the changes to symbol placement is meant to reduce the distance to commonly used symbols in the most common programming languages of the time. This leads to number being scrambled, though in a meaningful way. The numbers hit by the left hand are odd and in descending order starting with 7 and wrapping back around to 9. The numbers hit by the right hand are ascending even numbers starting with zero. Symbols that are regularly under the number row are on the unshifted/lower case layer while the numbers are on the shifted/upper case layer. This is because symbols are more common in source code then numbers as having pre-defined numbers in source code is an anti-pattern. For languages other then English a "Compose Key" is used to create accented characters.[4]

Capewell-Dvorak is a modified version of Dvorak created in 2004 by Michael Capewell. The layout came about through issues Michael found with Dvorak and how he tried to reconcile them. The perceived issues are as follows:

    Common shortcuts such as Ctrl+C are difficult to reach
    The "I" key is much more common then the "U" key which is not accounted for
    "GH" is a common digraph which are on the same finger
    "F" and "X", "Y" and "B" on QWERTY, are more difficult to hit then accounted for
    Hitting the upper row with the pinky finger, specifically for the "L" key, is more difficult then accounted for

The Capewell Layout was created in 2005 by Michael Capewell and released to his own site as a work in progress. Inspiration for creating the layout was drawn from Peter M. Klausler's Evolve layout generation program. Thus the layout is generated through a script along with some restrictions on how the key layout can be changed. Goals of the layout are as follows:

    Significant reduction in movement over QWERTY (IE: 48% or 49%)
    Maximize trigrams and bigrams on the same hand but different finger (IE: AS, WE, REA)
    Minimize unconformable combos that exist on QWERTY (IE: DR, DT, CF, CS)
    Keep ZXCF in the lower left to maintain system shortcuts
    If a key in one of the center columns is used, have the keys typed before and after the key be typed by the other hand
    Minimize use of certain positions on the keyboard (On QWERTY: Q, Z, P, /, J, B, X, .)

QWERF was released in 2006 by Michael Capewell on his own site. It is a modification on QWERTY thus should be easy for users to learn. More common keys were moved to the home row for a finger movement reduction of 28% over QWERTY.

Colemak is an alternative keyboard created by Shai Coleman, named as a portmanteau of Dvorak and Coleman. Its design goals consist of easy transition from QWERTY due to repositioning only 17 letter keys. Additionally the AZXCV shortcuts are in the same location perhaps allowing an easier time switching from QWERTY.

It also claims greater efficiency than Dvorak. Furthermore it places complete emphasis on the home-row: the ten most-common characters in English are on the ten home-row keys.

Colemak DH is a modified version of the Colemak layout which moves the D and H keys from the central column to improved locations under the index-finger home position. This allows for a more comfortable and symmetrical hand position. Like in the Workman layout, the central column keys are deprioritized. However as no keys change fingers from standard Colemak, this is achieved without adversely affecting Colemak's impressive stats on same-finger bigrams.
Carpalx Family

The Carpalx project was created around 2005-06 by Martin Krzywinski as a project to find the best keyboard layout to minimize typing effort. This was to be achieved through measuring then optimizing the following in respect to QWERTY:

    Hand-alternation or hand-balancing
    Same-finger typing reduction
    Finger flow such as rolling
    Stronger typing finger use and index finger/pinky finger reduction
    Difficult stroke path limiting (IE upward row progressions such as "nse")

Many layouts were measured through these methods and optimized derivatives were made off these existing layouts. Completely optimized layouts generated by the computer not using existing layouts as a reference were also created. The original primary focus of this project is for English language optimization but other languages, such as Dutch[5], were measured and optimized in recent years.[6]

Workman was created in 2010 in a blog post by OJ Bucao. It is designed around the use of a non-staggered layout or ortho-linear layout but works just fine on standard staggered layout keyboards. The main design goal is to keep the fingers to their main 4 columns per hand and de-prioritizing columns in the middle and sides. This minimizes diagonal and lateral movement.

3l was created in 2015 by Jack Rosenthal, inspired by the symbols layers of Neo, but with letter arrangement optimized for English. As a result, it requires significantly less finger movement than many other common layouts. Additionally, "typing distance is not the only factor that 3l optimizes for. 3l helps increase hand alternation, reduce bottom-to-top row jumps, decrease lateral motion, and also strives to be easy to learn".

Arensito was released in 2001 by Håkon Hallingstad and is also known as the Hallingstad layout. It was originally made to suit the Kinesis Contoured and two-handed Maltron, though an adaptation for usage on standard keyboard was developed later. The named comes from its home-row as apposed to QWERTY which named from its top row. The design intentions are as follows:

    Places the eight most used characters under your fingertips
    Is the layout that minimizes the probability that you use the same finger twice (in succession)
    Is the layout that maximizes the probability for using neighbor fingers in succession (and keeps the probability of sequences like y-d or z-l diminishingly low). This lets the fingers strike diagraphs and trigraphs extremely fast
    Keep the workload off the pinkies. Both pinkies press a button about 40% less than the other fingers

Some punctuation and programming symbols are placed under the AltGr layer, where they are closer to the fingers' home position.

It is mainly targeted at German users, but supports nearly all characters of Latin-based alphabets, as well as the Vietnamese and some African alphabets. It consists of six layers, available by combinations of multiple modifier keys. Using these layers there are special characters available which are not easily available in QWERTY-based layouts, like mathematical symbols and Greek letters. The layers are as follows:
Layer 	Usage
1 	Lowercase characters
2 	Uppercase characters, typographical characters
3 	Special characters, especially for programming, etc.

AdNW is a Dvorak-like layout which appeared around 2012 for the German and English languages.
History

AdNW is a layout that emerged from online discussions about Neo, a layout that was made for the German language. The discussion focused on whether Neo layout which was new at the time was an improvement over Dvorak for German and English typist. AdNW was created in response to this converation, from the idea that a layout could be made that was better then Dvorak or Neo for typist who write in both German and English. To do this, Dvorak's usability criteria were coded in a newly programmed layout optimizer. Since the group formed itself during the Neo discussions, they called their layout "From the Neo World", which in German is Aus der Neo-Welt, abbreviated to AdNW.
Philosophy and Performance

AdNW is based on roughly the same ideas as "Dvorak" keyboard. Being in the Dvorak tradition, the following aspects are important:

    Same finger use (low)
    Adjacent finger use(*)(low)
    Inward motions versus Outward motions (high)
    Home row use (high)
    Row jumps (low)
    Finger balance (less on pinkies, more on middle and index)

(*)On QWERTY AS and SD which are right next together is a negative mark against the layout. The AD and SF positions are seen as better. The idea is that adjacent fingers, especially the pinky and ring finger are not completely independent. Making "rolls" with adjacent finger less pleasant and therefore to be avoided. "Rolls" on index and middle finger (e.g. ER on QWERTY) are less problematic and get a lower penalty for that reason.

As a result of these criteria, the AdNW layouts also have a balanced Left/Right distribution (roughly 50% of effort on each hand, compared to QWERTY that puts most work on the right hand) and a high hand alternation. Alternation means that common letter combinations like ER or IN are not typed on one hand (like in QWERTY) but on two hands. In AdNW, E and I are on the left side, R and N on the right.

To make the differences between QWERTZ and AdNW clear, they are compared both visually and statistically. The graphs and data are produced by the AdNW optimizer. In the graphs, the letter 'flow' is shown. The more common a digraph is (e.g. ER), the fatter the line that is drawn between these two letters.
AdNW and QWERTZ compared.

Looking at the graphs, one sees that QWERTY uses the left hand a lot, especially the top row. Some of the most frequent bigrams are on the left top row (WE, ER, ET, RT). On the right hand the frequent IN bigram includes an home row jump, which is seen as highly unwanted. Compared to QWERTY, AdNW is more balanced, has more home row use, and much less one handed bigrams. Frequent bigrams (like WE, ER and so on) are not typed with one hand, but alternate between hands.

Even though AdNW was optimized for 50/50 English/German, it performs quite well for English solely. Comparison Below:
AdNW and QWERTY compared.

Compared to QWERTY:

    AdNW is more balanced left/right (52.7 versus 59.0)
    AdNW is more home row oriented (72% typed on homerow, versus 32.6% in QWERTZ)
    AdNW is more balanced over fingers (less use of right hand index and middle finger; more of other fingers)
    AdNW has more hand alternation (70.8% versus 52.2%)
    AdNW has less adjacent finger bigrams
    AdNW has less same finger use
    AdNW has higher home row usage

Variations

From its inception AdNW has had several variations apart from the standard community release version. The other versions place slightly different weight to Dvorak's criteria (e.g. even lower adjacent finger use, at the expense of other criteria). Some of these variations are designed for different keyboards (matrix/orthogonal layouts, Ergodox, TEK etc.) or for other languages. A user can also calculate a custom layout.

Reasons for calculating a custom layout include:

    Non-standard physical keyboard, for instance a Planck, a Space Cadet, a modded Ergodox or a DIY split keyboard
    Different preferences regarding finger use, alternation, and so on. Users may sacrifice performance on one aspect (e.g. alternation) in order to gain better performance on others (e.g. lower same finger use).
    Physical differences between users
    Input language. Users may not type 50/50 English-German prose, but for instance 30% French scientific prose and 70% Python code.

All this can be combined: a user may calculate an optimal layout for "30% English prose, 40% Swedish forum use, 30% Polish, for Maltron keyboard, that avoids using the pinkies and that prefers the bottom row over the top row". Because of this freedom, there is not one single AdNW layout.

Some other examples of AdNW layouts are:

Community and Use

Software: AdNW consists of a layout and several software implementations:

    Drivers & scripts for using the layout on Windows, Linux, OSX and *BSD; with versions for standard keyboards and for ergonomic keyboards (Ergodox, Maltron and others). This includes AutoHotKey files for Windows.
    Typing training software
    The Optimizer: an algorithm (written in C++11 and open sourced) for calculating a custom AdNW-layout.

Userbase: AdNW is not a massively adopted layout. The (German language) Google user group has around 100 participants, mostly from Germany. The AdNW website is in German as well. However, the manual of the optimizer is in English, and participants on the discussion group say they are very open to questions in English.

Support: The developers of the software are active on the discussion forum and answer support questions.

Development: AdNW has been iterated upon by many in its community. Usually these changes are trade-offs between the specific use-case the layout is being optimized for. The developers claim that there is not much room for further overall improvement, but invite users to prove them wrong and to come up with new ideas.

Is Carpalx(QGMLWB) layout more ergonomic/comfortable than colemak?

On it's website, it compares layouts based on their typing efforts. I wanted to hear what you guys think of this layout and if it's better than colemak.

I'm sure there's a whole bunch of layouts that technically have better ergonomics than colemak. However, there are definitely diminishing returns, as colemak is already pretty darn good. Plus, there's more to a keyboard layout than ergonomics! I, for one, really appreciate how in colemak a lot of keys are unchanged from qwerty, how the common shortcuts are the same, and colemak support on a lot of operating systems (except Windows! grr). For me, slightly better ergonomics but losing these aspects is not worth it.

I checked this out in my analyser and tested it across different texts (English, Chinese, Slovak, JavaScript, snippets of my own chat history.) It consistently scored worse than Colemak.

I don't mind the middle columns that much, but I still wouldn't put I on it. It has a letter frequency of 7%, and has made AI/IA a Single Finger Bigram (SFB.) R has a letter frequency of 6% and is also in the middle column, making RN/NR an SFB, which is not as common as AI, but still decently common.

TL;DR: I wouldn't switch to it, no thank you.

Every layout is best on its own analyzer. ￣(=⌒ᆺ⌒=)￣

When you assess model-based layouts, make sure you study what the model parameters and assumptions are. Beyond that, it's a matter of how good the analyzer itself is, but that's usually not the biggest issue.

In theory, there are "a hundred optimal layouts". Above a certain level, what's best for you is not what's best for me. So what's good enough? For me, Colemak is certainly good enough – maybe QGMLWB is good enough too but I haven't tried it. Most of the competitors I've seen have made assumptions I didn't like, for instance that the bottom row is horrible or pinkies are completely useless. In doing so, they forsake factors that are more important to me such as same-finger bigram frequency.

The author of CarpalX definitely seems to make big claims about it, I don't think many people use it or take it seriously. I don't know if even the author uses it. It's the result of an algorithmic search for the "best" layout according to a specific set of arbitrary constraints and parameters. I'm sure it's better than QWERTY (in a vacuum), but that's about all I'll say about it.

The one thing pretty much all analyzers agree on is that QWERTY and its derivatives all suck in terms of fingering metrics and that pretty much any other layout is "better". The ranking each analyzer calculates reflects the objectives (biases or fingering preferences) of the algorithm.

When i left the Colemak reservation after venturing down the rabbit hole of wide layouts, remapping keys to counter the left column slant (of standard keyboards) and applying my own key placement optimizations, i discovered ortholinear then split keyboards and QMK firmware... and the hobby that is this search.

That led me to AdNW optimizer and BEAKL explorations which felt good to my hands. But that was only the beginning and i continued to explore layout approaches, continuing to refine my own layout. Layout iteration cycles have grown longer as i reach my end game :-)

For comfort, the first thing i would do is ditch the standard keyboard with its column slant that penalizes the left hand. Then pick a layout which closest matches your fingering preferences and go from there. Being able to flash new layouts will help you reach your most comfortable layout to type on that matches your workflow.

Mine is this but i don't make any claims that it is the best :-)

Full Optimization - Q*MLW* Layouts
ON THIS PAGE

Full Optimization

Full Optimization - typing effort

Full Optimization - detailed statistics

Full Optimization - Convergence and Neighbouring Solutions

QGMLWY - word difficulty

Three fully optimized layouts are presented here. Each provides an optimial typing experience with a slightly different letter mask. Use of the pinky is reduced and hand alternation is increased over popular alternatives like Colemak.
Full Optimization

In contrast to the partial optimization, full optimization did not place a limit on how many keys could be relocated.

There are three full optimizations presented here, differing only in the location of punctuation and the position of ZXCV keys.

    QFMLWY - this is best layout obtained by relocating all QWERTY letters
    QGMLWB - this optimized layout uses a Colemak-like character layout
    QGMLWY - this is similar to the layout above, but keeps ZXCV in place 

Each of these layouts is shown below. You can see that they are very similar. In particular, the home row is nearly identical, except where an additional letter key is made available in place of the ; key in the Colemak-like optimizations.
Figure 1. The canonical QWERTY layout.
Figure 2. When the QWERTY layout is fully optimized, with only the letter keys allowed to move, the resulting layout is QFMLWY and effort is reduced by 43%.
Figure 3. When a modified QWERTY layout is fully optimized (where the P and ; keys are swapped), the resulting layout is QGMLWB and effort is reduced by 44%. Note that ZXC maintain their position relative to QWERTY, as do Q and S.
Figure 4. When a modified QWERTY layout is fully optimized (where the P and ; keys are swapped) with ZXCV held in place, the resulting layout is QGMLWY and effort is reduced by 44%. Compare this layout, in which ZXCV are fixed, to QGMLWB (above) where these keys were not held fixed — only the V was moved.

The benefit of QFMLWY is that it maintains the QWERTY letter mask - no punctuation keys are moved. If this is an important layout characteristic, then this is the layout for you. If you are willing to relocate the ; key to the top row in order to add a letter to home row, then QGMLWB is the best choice. If you insist on ZXCV in QWERTY position, then QGMLWY is the best layout (although consider that QGMLWB has ZXC in QWERTY position already).
How do I know that the simulation has found a global minimum — in other words, the layout with the minimum effort? I don't. This uncertainty about global minimum discovery is present in all stochastic simulations of NP-hard problems (problem in which all potential solutions must be visited to determine a unequivocaly determine where the global minimum lies). For the full optimization described here, I ran the simulation at least 10,000 times. Each simulation lasted for >15,000 iterations and used k=10 and t0=10. For each optimization, multiple simulations converged on the reported layout. (details).
Full Optimization - typing effort

The typing effort of the fully optimized layouts are compared in the table below and contrasted with QWERTY. Keep in mind that the difference between the optimized layouts is the additional character key on home row and mobility of ZXCV.

When home row is given an extra character key, the base effort component drops significantly from 0.510 (optimized, QFMLWY) to 0.382 (optimized, QGMLWB). This is reasonable to expect because an additional letter is made available with zero finger travel distance. Notice, though, that the penalty component is increased from 0.476 to 0.570 (due to an increase in the finger-based component of the penalty). This presumably is a result of the fact that the pinky that services the additional home row key is more frequently used.
QGMLWY vs Colemak

Let's compare the optimized layout to Colemak. I'll use QGMLWY, since this is the layout that keeps ZXCV in place and uses the Colemak-like letter mask. Note that the QGMLWB layout, which does not keep ZXCV fixed during optimization (but that nevertheless places ZXC in their QWERTY positions), is nearly identical in effort profile to QGMLWY, so the two can be used interchangeably.

The first thing to notice is that Colemak seems to be designed to reduce finger travel distance. This is done at the cost of increasing penalty and stroke path. Colemak has both a higher row and a higher finger penalty component. In fact, the finger penalty component is 31% higher. Therefore, in the Colemak layout shorter finger travel distance is prefered over decrease use of weaker fingers.

The detailed finger and row use statistics for QGMLWY and Colemak are shown below. Both keyboards have the same home row frequency (74%), with QGMLWY having a lower bottom row use (6% vs Colemak's 9%). This reduction in bottom row usage is a result of the row-based penalty component, which penalizes the bottom row (recall that the model parameters result in a penalty ratio of 1:0:2 for the top:home:bottow rows).

Hand asymmetry is identical for both layouts, at 6% with the left hand favoured. However, QGMLWY is better at hand alternation, with one-character hand runs (i.e. a given hand is used to type only one character before the other hand is used) at 60% and 56% of keystrokes for the left and right hands, respectively. Colemak has 55% and 49% for these values.

Finger frequencies differ mainly in the use of the pinky, which is penalized in my model. Thus, QGMLWY uses the pinky 11% whereas Colemak uses the pinky 16% of the time. Colmak's 1-finger run is slightly higher, at 93% compared to 92% for QGMLWY. This is due to the reduced pinky usage in QGMLWY.
QGMLWY vs Norman

The Norman layout is a partially optimized layout by David Norman. It modifies 14/26 letter keys, as shown in the figure below. It maintains locations of Q W A S Z X C V keys to maintain keyboard shortcuts. With the exception of the A and W key, QGMLWY maintain these locations as well.

It does a very good job in minimizing the finger travel distance. Its base effort is 0.342, which is in the neighbourhood of Colemak, Workman and Klausler layouts. According to the Carpalx effort model, it does as poor job in managing row and finger penalties—with 4 fewer key relocations QWKRFY manages a 40% reduction in these penalties over Norman.

Norman finger frequencies for pinky, ring, middle and and index finger are 15, 21, 32, 33%. Pinky gets hammered frequencies.

Full Optimization - Convergence and Neighbouring Solutions

Let's take a look at simulation runs that generated the three optimized layouts presented here. Remember that each layout was the lowest effort solution out of a large family of solutions generated by the simulation. It may be that even lower effort solutions exist and that they have not been found by the simulation. This isn't very likely and it's not possible to know whether such a lower-effort state exists.

Each of the three layout discoveries was repeated between ~16,000 and ~21,000 times. The QWERTY optimization that resulted in the QFMLWY layout converged three times to this layout. This means that QFMLWY was the solution in 3/15,961 of the runs. On the other hand, the Colemak mask with ZCXV stationary converged 406/20,797 times to QGMLWY — fixing four keys constrains the problem significantly and results in faster convergence. I believe that the QGMLWY layout is the global minimum for this set of parameters.
Figure 7. Frequency distribution of typing effort for solutions to the layout simulation.
neighbouring solutions to QFMLWY

Below are the three lowest-effort solutions to QWERTY optimization. The lowest effort solution is QFMLWY, as described above. The next lowest solution is JBFUYW and is quite different from QFMLWY. The home row of this solution is nearly reversed — in fact this solution nearly mirrors (left-to-right) the top QFMLWY solution. It is reasonable that this be the case since there is no inherent left/right asymmetry in the penalties or model. The QWERTY mask has a slight asymmetry because, unlike the left pinky, the right pinky does not service a letter key.

The third best solution is QFMLWY, and is very similar to the top solution, varying only in the placement of V, X and J.

neighbouring solutions to QGMLWB

These are the top four solutions to the Colemak-like mask optimization. Unlike the neighbouring solutions to QFMLWY, the top four here do not include a mirror flip. The home row for each of these solutions is identical. The four only vary in the position of G, K, C, X, M, J, F, P. Most of the variation is in the bottom row.

In the top four solutions there is still some fluctuation in the penalty and path component efforts (~1%). This is much larger than the difference in total effort (<0.05%) or the fluctuation in the base effort component (<0.5%).

QGMLWY - word difficulty

Using the typing effort model described in Carpalx - Typing Effort, I ranked 6-12 character words by their corresponding effort (effort is normalized to word length) using a dictionary of 480,000 words (/usr/share/dict/words, Red Hat 4 Enterprise). Below is a table that shows sets of words representing effort percentiles.

QGMLWY - word difficulty

Three fully optimized layouts are presented here. Each provides an optimial typing experience with a slightly different letter mask. Use of the pinky is reduced and hand alternation is increased over popular alternatives like Colemak.
Full Optimization

In contrast to the partial optimization, full optimization did not place a limit on how many keys could be relocated.

There are three full optimizations presented here, differing only in the location of punctuation and the position of ZXCV keys.

    QFMLWY - this is best layout obtained by relocating all QWERTY letters
    QGMLWB - this optimized layout uses a Colemak-like character layout
    QGMLWY - this is similar to the layout above, but keeps ZXCV in place 

Each of these layouts is shown below. You can see that they are very similar. In particular, the home row is nearly identical, except where an additional letter key is made available in place of the ; key in the Colemak-like optimizations.
Figure 1. The canonical QWERTY layout.
Figure 2. When the QWERTY layout is fully optimized, with only the letter keys allowed to move, the resulting layout is QFMLWY and effort is reduced by 43%.
Figure 3. When a modified QWERTY layout is fully optimized (where the P and ; keys are swapped), the resulting layout is QGMLWB and effort is reduced by 44%. Note that ZXC maintain their position relative to QWERTY, as do Q and S.
Figure 4. When a modified QWERTY layout is fully optimized (where the P and ; keys are swapped) with ZXCV held in place, the resulting layout is QGMLWY and effort is reduced by 44%. Compare this layout, in which ZXCV are fixed, to QGMLWB (above) where these keys were not held fixed — only the V was moved.

The benefit of QFMLWY is that it maintains the QWERTY letter mask - no punctuation keys are moved. If this is an important layout characteristic, then this is the layout for you. If you are willing to relocate the ; key to the top row in order to add a letter to home row, then QGMLWB is the best choice. If you insist on ZXCV in QWERTY position, then QGMLWY is the best layout (although consider that QGMLWB has ZXC in QWERTY position already).
How do I know that the simulation has found a global minimum — in other words, the layout with the minimum effort? I don't. This uncertainty about global minimum discovery is present in all stochastic simulations of NP-hard problems (problem in which all potential solutions must be visited to determine a unequivocaly determine where the global minimum lies). For the full optimization described here, I ran the simulation at least 10,000 times. Each simulation lasted for >15,000 iterations and used k=10 and t0=10. For each optimization, multiple simulations converged on the reported layout. (details).
Full Optimization - typing effort

The typing effort of the fully optimized layouts are compared in the table below and contrasted with QWERTY. Keep in mind that the difference between the optimized layouts is the additional character key on home row and mobility of ZXCV.

When home row is given an extra character key, the base effort component drops significantly from 0.510 (optimized, QFMLWY) to 0.382 (optimized, QGMLWB). This is reasonable to expect because an additional letter is made available with zero finger travel distance. Notice, though, that the penalty component is increased from 0.476 to 0.570 (due to an increase in the finger-based component of the penalty). This presumably is a result of the fact that the pinky that services the additional home row key is more frequently used.
QGMLWY vs Colemak

Let's compare the optimized layout to Colemak. I'll use QGMLWY, since this is the layout that keeps ZXCV in place and uses the Colemak-like letter mask. Note that the QGMLWB layout, which does not keep ZXCV fixed during optimization (but that nevertheless places ZXC in their QWERTY positions), is nearly identical in effort profile to QGMLWY, so the two can be used interchangeably.

The first thing to notice is that Colemak seems to be designed to reduce finger travel distance. This is done at the cost of increasing penalty and stroke path. Colemak has both a higher row and a higher finger penalty component. In fact, the finger penalty component is 31% higher. Therefore, in the Colemak layout shorter finger travel distance is prefered over decrease use of weaker fingers.

The detailed finger and row use statistics for QGMLWY and Colemak are shown below. Both keyboards have the same home row frequency (74%), with QGMLWY having a lower bottom row use (6% vs Colemak's 9%). This reduction in bottom row usage is a result of the row-based penalty component, which penalizes the bottom row (recall that the model parameters result in a penalty ratio of 1:0:2 for the top:home:bottow rows).

Hand asymmetry is identical for both layouts, at 6% with the left hand favoured. However, QGMLWY is better at hand alternation, with one-character hand runs (i.e. a given hand is used to type only one character before the other hand is used) at 60% and 56% of keystrokes for the left and right hands, respectively. Colemak has 55% and 49% for these values.

Finger frequencies differ mainly in the use of the pinky, which is penalized in my model. Thus, QGMLWY uses the pinky 11% whereas Colemak uses the pinky 16% of the time. Colmak's 1-finger run is slightly higher, at 93% compared to 92% for QGMLWY. This is due to the reduced pinky usage in QGMLWY.
QGMLWY vs Norman

The Norman layout is a partially optimized layout by David Norman. It modifies 14/26 letter keys, as shown in the figure below. It maintains locations of Q W A S Z X C V keys to maintain keyboard shortcuts. With the exception of the A and W key, QGMLWY maintain these locations as well.

It does a very good job in minimizing the finger travel distance. Its base effort is 0.342, which is in the neighbourhood of Colemak, Workman and Klausler layouts. According to the Carpalx effort model, it does as poor job in managing row and finger penalties—with 4 fewer key relocations QWKRFY manages a 40% reduction in these penalties over Norman.

Detailed finger usage statistics for Norman are shown below. Norman has a lower usage of home row (68% vs 74%), higher bottom row usage (10% vs 6%), and favours the left hand by 5%.

Norman finger frequencies for pinky, ring, middle and and index finger are 15, 21, 32, 33%. Pinky gets hammered frequencies.

Full Optimization - Convergence and Neighbouring Solutions

Let's take a look at simulation runs that generated the three optimized layouts presented here. Remember that each layout was the lowest effort solution out of a large family of solutions generated by the simulation. It may be that even lower effort solutions exist and that they have not been found by the simulation. This isn't very likely and it's not possible to know whether such a lower-effort state exists.

Each of the three layout discoveries was repeated between ~16,000 and ~21,000 times. The QWERTY optimization that resulted in the QFMLWY layout converged three times to this layout. This means that QFMLWY was the solution in 3/15,961 of the runs. On the other hand, the Colemak mask with ZCXV stationary converged 406/20,797 times to QGMLWY — fixing four keys constrains the problem significantly and results in faster convergence. I believe that the QGMLWY layout is the global minimum for this set of parameters.
Figure 7. Frequency distribution of typing effort for solutions to the layout simulation.
neighbouring solutions to QFMLWY

Below are the three lowest-effort solutions to QWERTY optimization. The lowest effort solution is QFMLWY, as described above. The next lowest solution is JBFUYW and is quite different from QFMLWY. The home row of this solution is nearly reversed — in fact this solution nearly mirrors (left-to-right) the top QFMLWY solution. It is reasonable that this be the case since there is no inherent left/right asymmetry in the penalties or model. The QWERTY mask has a slight asymmetry because, unlike the left pinky, the right pinky does not service a letter key.

The third best solution is QFMLWY, and is very similar to the top solution, varying only in the placement of V, X and J.

neighbouring solutions to QGMLWB

These are the top four solutions to the Colemak-like mask optimization. Unlike the neighbouring solutions to QFMLWY, the top four here do not include a mirror flip. The home row for each of these solutions is identical. The four only vary in the position of G, K, C, X, M, J, F, P. Most of the variation is in the bottom row.

In the top four solutions there is still some fluctuation in the penalty and path component efforts (~1%). This is much larger than the difference in total effort (<0.05%) or the fluctuation in the base effort component (<0.5%).

Alternative keyboard layouts

Layouts for typewriters were numerous and varied before the introduction of QWERTY on Remington & Sons typewriters in 1874. The introduction of new technologies that remove some of the limitations of early typewriters as well as the introduction of electronic keyboards came with the ability to make new key layouts.

Main article: DHIATENSOR

DHIATENSOR, also known as the Blickensderfer Scientific Key-Board layout by its creator was the primary keyboard layout available for the Blickensderfer typewriter.

The layout had been based on a study of the English language that had showed that 70% written text and about 85% of all words used the letters D,H,I,A,T,E,N,S,O and R. Those were put on the keyboard's home row.

On the original typewriters, the home row is actually on the bottom, but it is moved up one step to the home row position on a standard keyboard.

Dvorak was created by Dr. August Dvorak in the early 1930's as an alternative to the QWERTY layout. Data was gathered in the form of closeup films of a typist fingers to create a primitive heat-map of key use and hand position.

    The most common letters were roughly placed in the rows typists were thought to like best: home-row, top-row and last bottom-row.
    Hand-alternation: To avoid occasional long strings of one-handed-operation, emphasis was placed on hand-alternation. All vowels were moved to the left side of the keyboard, and onto the home-row, including the rare U.
    The right-hand is favored and receives 14% more usage than the lefty, which is 33% more than QWERTY because it favors the left hand with a similar percentage.

Criticisms of the Dvorak design:

    Extreme dissimilarity from QWERTY. System and application hotkeys that are designed around QWERTY will need to be relearned or remapped
    Hand-alternation. Poor single handed typing speed
    Poor placement of common letters. L is a case-example of this

Evolved was released around 2002 on Peter Klausler's own website. During his use of Dvorak he wondered how a better modern layout could be created with the aid of computers. A metric of "work" needed when touch typing with each layout was developed. The factors of what constituted work were as follows:

    All 8 fingers start on the home row.
    An index finger stretch to the center costs 1 unit.
    Fingers of the same hand can't be on both the top and bottom row. When a top-row or bottom-row key is to be hit, each finger on the bottom or top row (respectively) moves to the home row, and that costs 1 unit each.
    After that, if a finger has to move up or down to hit the key, it costs 1 unit. An additional unit is charged to move to the bottom row (except for the index finger in its natural column) or to move an index finger to the top row in its unnatural center column. Furthermore, moving a pinky up or down costs an additional unit. I have weak pinkies.
    Hitting two distinct keys in succession with the same finger is really bad; 3 more units are charged.
    An extra unit is assessed when nonadjacent fingers of the same hand are used in succession and they are not both on the home row.
    But adjacent fingers are charged a unit to hit keys on distinct rows, and one more if there's adjacent movement between the top and bottom rows.
    When a shift key is used, the fingers of the shifting hand move to the home row for free afterwards.

These rules were applied to a corpus of 20mb of English text from books, the bodies of all the authors emails, and about 100k lines of C code. This was to best reflect the authors typing habits. Along with the text samples there was the layouts which were generated programmatically. Additional considerations were added to the layout generation program for alternating hands and adjacent key hits (rolling) after real world testing. Klausler ended up switching back to Dvorak layout. [2]

Programmer Dvorak was released by Roland Kaufmann in about 2003 to his own website. The stated goal of the layout is to eliminate RSI in the way Dvorak does for copy typist with optimizations for programmers. Symbol placement in Dvorak is seen as just as bad as QWERTY to writing source code in C, C#, Java, Pascal, Lisp, CSS, XML and alikes. Thus the changes to symbol placement is meant to reduce the distance to commonly used symbols in the most common programming languages of the time. This leads to number being scrambled, though in a meaningful way. The numbers hit by the left hand are odd and in descending order starting with 7 and wrapping back around to 9. The numbers hit by the right hand are ascending even numbers starting with zero. Symbols that are regularly under the number row are on the unshifted/lower case layer while the numbers are on the shifted/upper case layer. This is because symbols are more common in source code then numbers as having pre-defined numbers in source code is an anti-pattern. For languages other then English a "Compose Key" is used to create accented characters.[4]

Capewell-Dvorak is a modified version of Dvorak created in 2004 by Michael Capewell. The layout came about through issues Michael found with Dvorak and how he tried to reconcile them. The perceived issues are as follows:

    Common shortcuts such as Ctrl+C are difficult to reach
    The "I" key is much more common then the "U" key which is not accounted for
    "GH" is a common digraph which are on the same finger
    "F" and "X", "Y" and "B" on QWERTY, are more difficult to hit then accounted for
    Hitting the upper row with the pinky finger, specifically for the "L" key, is more difficult then accounted for

The Capewell Layout was created in 2005 by Michael Capewell and released to his own site as a work in progress. Inspiration for creating the layout was drawn from Peter M. Klausler's Evolve layout generation program. Thus the layout is generated through a script along with some restrictions on how the key layout can be changed. Goals of the layout are as follows:

    Significant reduction in movement over QWERTY (IE: 48% or 49%)
    Maximize trigrams and bigrams on the same hand but different finger (IE: AS, WE, REA)
    Minimize unconformable combos that exist on QWERTY (IE: DR, DT, CF, CS)
    Keep ZXCF in the lower left to maintain system shortcuts
    If a key in one of the center columns is used, have the keys typed before and after the key be typed by the other hand
    Minimize use of certain positions on the keyboard (On QWERTY: Q, Z, P, /, J, B, X, .)

QWERF was released in 2006 by Michael Capewell on his own site. It is a modification on QWERTY thus should be easy for users to learn. More common keys were moved to the home row for a finger movement reduction of 28% over QWERTY. The author claims that within one week a user of his layout could be back at their original typing speed.

Colemak is an alternative keyboard created by Shai Coleman, named as a portmanteau of Dvorak and Coleman. Its design goals consist of easy transition from QWERTY due to repositioning only 17 letter keys. Additionally the AZXCV shortcuts are in the same location perhaps allowing an easier time switching from QWERTY.

It also claims greater efficiency than Dvorak. Furthermore it places complete emphasis on the home-row: the ten most-common characters in English are on the ten home-row keys.

Colemak DH is a modified version of the Colemak layout which moves the D and H keys from the central column to improved locations under the index-finger home position. This allows for a more comfortable and symmetrical hand position. Like in the Workman layout, the central column keys are deprioritized. However as no keys change fingers from standard Colemak, this is achieved without adversely affecting Colemak's impressive stats on same-finger bigrams.
Carpalx Family

The Carpalx project was created around 2005-06 by Martin Krzywinski as a project to find the best keyboard layout to minimize typing effort. This was to be achieved through measuring then optimizing the following in respect to QWERTY:

    Hand-alternation or hand-balancing
    Same-finger typing reduction
    Finger flow such as rolling
    Stronger typing finger use and index finger/pinky finger reduction
    Difficult stroke path limiting (IE upward row progressions such as "nse")

Many layouts were measured through these methods and optimized derivatives were made off these existing layouts. Completely optimized layouts generated by the computer not using existing layouts as a reference were also created. The original primary focus of this project is for English language optimization but other languages, such as Dutch[5], were measured and optimized in recent years.[6]

A computer optimized layout in which the restriction is that the letter keys can move from their original QWERTY positions and the semicolon can be moved to the top row. The movement of the semicolon creates a Colemak-like character layout. This layout is considered a "full optimization", as it is a sane re arrangement of all punctuation and alpha keys to achieve the lowest "total effort".

Workman was created in 2010 in a blog post by OJ Bucao. It is designed around the use of a non-staggered layout or ortho-linear layout but works just fine on standard staggered layout keyboards. The main design goal is to keep the fingers to their main 4 columns per hand and de-prioritizing columns in the middle and sides. This minimizes diagonal and lateral movement.

3l was created in 2015 by Jack Rosenthal, inspired by the symbols layers of Neo, but with letter arrangement optimized for English. As a result, it requires significantly less finger movement than many other common layouts. Additionally, "typing distance is not the only factor that 3l optimizes for. 3l helps increase hand alternation, reduce bottom-to-top row jumps, decrease lateral motion, and also strives to be easy to learn".

Arensito was released in 2001 by Håkon Hallingstad and is also known as the Hallingstad layout. It was originally made to suit the Kinesis Contoured and two-handed Maltron, though an adaptation for usage on standard keyboard was developed later. The named comes from its home-row as apposed to QWERTY which named from its top row. The design intentions are as follows:

    Places the eight most used characters under your fingertips
    Is the layout that minimizes the probability that you use the same finger twice (in succession)
    Is the layout that maximizes the probability for using neighbor fingers in succession (and keeps the probability of sequences like y-d or z-l diminishingly low). This lets the fingers strike diagraphs and trigraphs extremely fast
    Keep the workload off the pinkies. Both pinkies press a button about 40% less than the other fingers

Some punctuation and programming symbols are placed under the AltGr layer, where they are closer to the fingers' home position.

Neo was released in 2004 and open sourced to allow multiple users to contribute to. It was developed with the experiences of other ergonomic layouts like Dvorak in mind. It is mainly targeted at German users, but supports nearly all characters of Latin-based alphabets, as well as the Vietnamese and some African alphabets. It consists of six layers, available by combinations of multiple modifier keys. Using these layers there are special characters available which are not easily available in QWERTY-based layouts, like mathematical symbols and Greek letters. The layers are as follows:
Layer 	Usage
1 	Lowercase characters
2 	Uppercase characters, typographical characters
3 	Special characters, especially for programming, etc.
4 	Navigation keys, Numberblock, etc.
5 	Greek lowercase characters
6 	Mathematical symbols and Greek uppercase characters

AdNW is a Dvorak-like layout which appeared around 2012 for the German and English languages.
History

AdNW is a layout that emerged from online discussions about Neo, a layout that was made for the German language. The discussion focused on whether Neo layout which was new at the time was an improvement over Dvorak for German and English typist. AdNW was created in response to this converation, from the idea that a layout could be made that was better then Dvorak or Neo for typist who write in both German and English. To do this, Dvorak's usability criteria were coded in a newly programmed layout optimizer. Since the group formed itself during the Neo discussions, they called their layout "From the Neo World", which in German is Aus der Neo-Welt, abbreviated to AdNW.
Philosophy and Performance

AdNW is based on roughly the same ideas as "Dvorak" keyboard. Being in the Dvorak tradition, the following aspects are important:

    Same finger use (low)
    Adjacent finger use(*)(low)
    Inward motions versus Outward motions (high)
    Home row use (high)
    Row jumps (low)
    Finger balance (less on pinkies, more on middle and index)

(*)On QWERTY AS and SD which are right next together is a negative mark against the layout. The AD and SF positions are seen as better. The idea is that adjacent fingers, especially the pinky and ring finger are not completely independent. Making "rolls" with adjacent finger less pleasant and therefore to be avoided. "Rolls" on index and middle finger (e.g. ER on QWERTY) are less problematic and get a lower penalty for that reason.

As a result of these criteria, the AdNW layouts also have a balanced Left/Right distribution (roughly 50% of effort on each hand, compared to QWERTY that puts most work on the right hand) and a high hand alternation. Alternation means that common letter combinations like ER or IN are not typed on one hand (like in QWERTY) but on two hands. In AdNW, E and I are on the left side, R and N on the right.

To make the differences between QWERTZ and AdNW clear, they are compared both visually and statistically. The graphs and data are produced by the AdNW optimizer. In the graphs, the letter 'flow' is shown. The more common a digraph is (e.g. ER), the fatter the line that is drawn between these two letters.
AdNW and QWERTZ compared.

Looking at the graphs, one sees that QWERTY uses the left hand a lot, especially the top row. Some of the most frequent bigrams are on the left top row (WE, ER, ET, RT). On the right hand the frequent IN bigram includes an home row jump, which is seen as highly unwanted. Compared to QWERTY, AdNW is more balanced, has more home row use, and much less one handed bigrams. Frequent bigrams (like WE, ER and so on) are not typed with one hand, but alternate between hands.

Even though AdNW was optimized for 50/50 English/German, it performs quite well for English solely. Comparison Below:
AdNW and QWERTY compared.

Compared to QWERTY:

    AdNW is more balanced left/right (52.7 versus 59.0)
    AdNW is more home row oriented (72% typed on homerow, versus 32.6% in QWERTZ)
    AdNW is more balanced over fingers (less use of right hand index and middle finger; more of other fingers)
    AdNW has more hand alternation (70.8% versus 52.2%)
    AdNW has less adjacent finger bigrams
    AdNW has less same finger use
    AdNW has higher home row usage

Variations

From its inception AdNW has had several variations apart from the standard community release version. The other versions place slightly different weight to Dvorak's criteria (e.g. even lower adjacent finger use, at the expense of other criteria). Some of these variations are designed for different keyboards (matrix/orthogonal layouts, Ergodox, TEK etc.) or for other languages. A user can also calculate a custom layout.

Reasons for calculating a custom layout include:

    Non-standard physical keyboard, for instance a Planck, a Space Cadet, a modded Ergodox or a DIY split keyboard
    Different preferences regarding finger use, alternation, and so on. Users may sacrifice performance on one aspect (e.g. alternation) in order to gain better performance on others (e.g. lower same finger use).
    Physical differences between users
    Input language. Users may not type 50/50 English-German prose, but for instance 30% French scientific prose and 70% Python code.

All this can be combined: a user may calculate an optimal layout for "30% English prose, 40% Swedish forum use, 30% Polish, for Maltron keyboard, that avoids using the pinkies and that prefers the bottom row over the top row". Because of this freedom, there is not one single AdNW layout.

Some other examples of AdNW layouts are:

Community and Use

Software: AdNW consists of a layout and several software implementations:

    Drivers & scripts for using the layout on Windows, Linux, OSX and *BSD; with versions for standard keyboards and for ergonomic keyboards (Ergodox, Maltron and others). This includes AutoHotKey files for Windows.
    Typing training software
    The Optimizer: an algorithm (written in C++11 and open sourced) for calculating a custom AdNW-layout.

Userbase: AdNW is not a massively adopted layout. The (German language) Google user group has around 100 participants, mostly from Germany. The AdNW website is in German as well. However, the manual of the optimizer is in English, and participants on the discussion group say they are very open to questions in English.

Support: The developers of the software are active on the discussion forum and answer support questions.

Development: AdNW has been iterated upon by many in its community. Usually these changes are trade-offs between the specific use-case the layout is being optimized for. The developers claim that there is not much room for further overall improvement, but invite users to prove them wrong and to come up with new ideas.

[QGMLWY - word difficulty](https://mk.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/?full_optimization#full_optimization_word_difficulty)

Three fully optimized layouts are presented here. Each provides an optimial typing experience with a slightly different letter mask. Use of the pinky is reduced and hand alternation is increased over popular alternatives like Colemak.

## Full Optimization

In contrast to the [partial optimization](https://mk.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/?partial_optimization), full optimization did not place a limit on how many keys could be relocated.

There are three full optimizations presented here, differing only in the location of punctuation and the position of ZXCV keys.

- QFMLWY - this is best layout obtained by relocating all QWERTY letters
- QGMLWB - this optimized layout uses a Colemak-like character layout
- QGMLWY - this is similar to the layout above, but keeps ZXCV in place

Each of these layouts is shown below. You can see that they are very similar. In particular, the home row is nearly identical, except where an additional letter key is made available in place of the ; key in the Colemak-like optimizations.

_Figure 1._ The canonical QWERTY layout.

![](https://mk.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/images/qfmlwy.png)

_Figure 2._ When the QWERTY layout is fully optimized, with only the letter keys allowed to move, the resulting layout is **QFMLWY** and effort is reduced by 43%.

![](https://mk.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/images/qgmlwb.png)

_Figure 3._ When a modified QWERTY layout is fully optimized (where the P and ; keys are swapped), the resulting layout is **QGMLWB** and effort is reduced by 44%. Note that ZXC maintain their position relative to QWERTY, as do Q and S.

![](https://mk.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/images/qgmlwy.png)

_Figure 4._ When a modified QWERTY layout is fully optimized (where the P and ; keys are swapped) with ZXCV held in place, the resulting layout is **QGMLWY** and effort is reduced by 44%. Compare this layout, in which ZXCV are fixed, to QGMLWB (above) where these keys were not held fixed — only the V was moved.

The benefit of QFMLWY is that it maintains the QWERTY letter mask - no punctuation keys are moved. If this is an important layout characteristic, then this is the layout for you. If you are willing to relocate the ; key to the top row in order to add a letter to home row, then QGMLWB is the best choice. If you insist on ZXCV in QWERTY position, then QGMLWY is the best layout (although consider that QGMLWB has ZXC in QWERTY position already).

How do I know that the simulation has found a global minimum — in other words, the layout with the minimum effort? I don't. This uncertainty about global minimum discovery is present in all stochastic simulations of NP-hard problems (problem in which all potential solutions must be visited to determine a unequivocaly determine where the global minimum lies). For the full optimization described here, I ran the simulation at least 10,000 times. Each simulation lasted for >15,000 iterations and used k=10 and t0=10. For each optimization, multiple simulations converged on the reported layout. ([details](https://mk.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/?simulated_annealing)).

## Full Optimization - typing effort

The typing effort of the fully optimized layouts are compared in the table below and contrasted with QWERTY. Keep in mind that the difference between the optimized layouts is the additional character key on home row and mobility of ZXCV.

When home row is given an extra character key, the base effort component drops significantly from 0.510 (optimized, QFMLWY) to 0.382 (optimized, QGMLWB). This is reasonable to expect because an additional letter is made available with zero finger travel distance. Notice, though, that the penalty component is increased from 0.476 to 0.570 (due to an increase in the finger-based component of the penalty). This presumably is a result of the fact that the pinky that services the additional home row key is more frequently used.

### QGMLWY vs Colemak

Let's compare the optimized layout to Colemak. I'll use QGMLWY, since this is the layout that keeps ZXCV in place and uses the Colemak-like letter mask. Note that the QGMLWB layout, which does not keep ZXCV fixed during optimization (but that nevertheless places ZXC in their QWERTY positions), is nearly identical in effort profile to QGMLWY, so the two can be used interchangeably.

The first thing to notice is that Colemak seems to be designed to reduce finger travel distance. This is done at the cost of increasing penalty and stroke path. Colemak has both a higher row and a higher finger penalty component. In fact, the finger penalty component is 31% higher. Therefore, in the Colemak layout shorter finger travel distance is prefered over decrease use of weaker fingers.

The detailed finger and row use statistics for QGMLWY and Colemak are shown below. Both keyboards have the same home row frequency (74%), with QGMLWY having a lower bottom row use (6% vs Colemak's 9%). This reduction in bottom row usage is a result of the row-based penalty component, which penalizes the bottom row (recall that the model parameters result in a penalty ratio of 1:0:2 for the top:home:bottow rows).

Hand asymmetry is identical for both layouts, at 6% with the left hand favoured. However, QGMLWY is better at hand alternation, with one-character hand runs (i.e. a given hand is used to type only one character before the other hand is used) at 60% and 56% of keystrokes for the left and right hands, respectively. Colemak has 55% and 49% for these values.

Finger frequencies differ mainly in the use of the pinky, which is penalized in my model. Thus, QGMLWY uses the pinky 11% whereas Colemak uses the pinky 16% of the time. Colmak's 1-finger run is slightly higher, at 93% compared to 92% for QGMLWY. This is due to the reduced pinky usage in QGMLWY.

### QGMLWY vs Norman

The [Norman layout](http://www.normanlayout.info) is a partially optimized layout by David Norman. It modifies 14/26 letter keys, as shown in the figure below. It maintains locations of Q W A S Z X C V keys to maintain keyboard shortcuts. With the exception of the A and W key, QGMLWY maintain these locations as well.

It does a very good job in minimizing the finger travel distance. Its base effort is 0.342, which is in the neighbourhood of [Colemak, Workman and Klausler layouts](https://mk.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/?popular_alternatives). According to the Carpalx effort model, it does as poor job in managing row and finger penalties—with 4 fewer key relocations QWKRFY manages a 40% reduction in these penalties over Norman.

Detailed [finger usage statistics](https://mk.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/?keyboard_evaluation) for Norman are shown below. Norman has a lower usage of home row (68% vs 74%), higher bottom row usage (10% vs 6%), and favours the left hand by 5%.

Norman finger frequencies for pinky, ring, middle and and index finger are 15, 21, 32, 33%. Pinky gets hammered frequencies.

## Full Optimization - Convergence and Neighbouring Solutions

Let's take a look at simulation runs that generated the three optimized layouts presented here. Remember that each layout was the lowest effort solution out of a large family of solutions generated by the simulation. It may be that even lower effort solutions exist and that they have not been found by the simulation. This isn't very likely and it's not possible to know whether such a lower-effort state exists.

Each of the three layout discoveries was repeated between ~16,000 and ~21,000 times. The QWERTY optimization that resulted in the QFMLWY layout converged three times to this layout. This means that QFMLWY was the solution in 3/15,961 of the runs. On the other hand, the Colemak mask with ZCXV stationary converged 406/20,797 times to QGMLWY — fixing four keys constrains the problem significantly and results in faster convergence. I believe that the QGMLWY layout is the global minimum for this set of parameters.

![](https://mk.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/images/solution-effort.png)

_Figure 7._ Frequency distribution of typing effort for solutions to the layout simulation.

### neighbouring solutions to QFMLWY

Below are the three lowest-effort solutions to QWERTY optimization. The lowest effort solution is QFMLWY, as described above. The next lowest solution is JBFUYW and is quite different from QFMLWY. The home row of this solution is nearly reversed — in fact this solution nearly mirrors (left-to-right) the top QFMLWY solution. It is reasonable that this be the case since there is no inherent left/right asymmetry in the penalties or model. The QWERTY mask has a slight asymmetry because, unlike the left pinky, the right pinky does not service a letter key.

The third best solution is QFMLWY, and is very similar to the top solution, varying only in the placement of V, X and J.

These are the top four solutions to the Colemak-like mask optimization. Unlike the neighbouring solutions to QFMLWY, the top four here do not include a mirror flip. The home row for each of these solutions is identical. The four only vary in the position of G, K, C, X, M, J, F, P. Most of the variation is in the bottom row.

In the top four solutions there is still some fluctuation in the penalty and path component efforts (~1%). This is much larger than the difference in total effort (<0.05%) or the fluctuation in the base effort component (<0.5%).

## QGMLWY - word difficulty

Using the typing effort model described in [Carpalx - Typing Effort](https://mk.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/?typing_effort), I ranked 6-12 character words by their corresponding effort (effort is normalized to word length) using a [dictionary of 480,000 words](https://mk.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/corpus/words.480k.txt) (/usr/share/dict/words, Red Hat 4 Enterprise). Below is a table that shows sets of words representing effort percentiles.

QGMLWY - word difficulty

Three fully optimized layouts are presented here. Each provides an optimial typing experience with a slightly different letter mask. Use of the pinky is reduced and hand alternation is increased over popular alternatives like Colemak.
Full Optimization

In contrast to the partial optimization, full optimization did not place a limit on how many keys could be relocated.

There are three full optimizations presented here, differing only in the location of punctuation and the position of ZXCV keys.

    QFMLWY - this is best layout obtained by relocating all QWERTY letters
    QGMLWB - this optimized layout uses a Colemak-like character layout
    QGMLWY - this is similar to the layout above, but keeps ZXCV in place 

Each of these layouts is shown below. You can see that they are very similar. In particular, the home row is nearly identical, except where an additional letter key is made available in place of the ; key in the Colemak-like optimizations.
Figure 1. The canonical QWERTY layout.
Figure 2. When the QWERTY layout is fully optimized, with only the letter keys allowed to move, the resulting layout is QFMLWY and effort is reduced by 43%.
Figure 3. When a modified QWERTY layout is fully optimized (where the P and ; keys are swapped), the resulting layout is QGMLWB and effort is reduced by 44%. Note that ZXC maintain their position relative to QWERTY, as do Q and S.
Figure 4. When a modified QWERTY layout is fully optimized (where the P and ; keys are swapped) with ZXCV held in place, the resulting layout is QGMLWY and effort is reduced by 44%. Compare this layout, in which ZXCV are fixed, to QGMLWB (above) where these keys were not held fixed — only the V was moved.

The benefit of QFMLWY is that it maintains the QWERTY letter mask - no punctuation keys are moved. If this is an important layout characteristic, then this is the layout for you. If you are willing to relocate the ; key to the top row in order to add a letter to home row, then QGMLWB is the best choice. If you insist on ZXCV in QWERTY position, then QGMLWY is the best layout (although consider that QGMLWB has ZXC in QWERTY position already).
How do I know that the simulation has found a global minimum — in other words, the layout with the minimum effort? I don't. This uncertainty about global minimum discovery is present in all stochastic simulations of NP-hard problems (problem in which all potential solutions must be visited to determine a unequivocaly determine where the global minimum lies). For the full optimization described here, I ran the simulation at least 10,000 times. Each simulation lasted for >15,000 iterations and used k=10 and t0=10. For each optimization, multiple simulations converged on the reported layout. (details).
Full Optimization - typing effort

The typing effort of the fully optimized layouts are compared in the table below and contrasted with QWERTY. Keep in mind that the difference between the optimized layouts is the additional character key on home row and mobility of ZXCV.

When home row is given an extra character key, the base effort component drops significantly from 0.510 (optimized, QFMLWY) to 0.382 (optimized, QGMLWB). This is reasonable to expect because an additional letter is made available with zero finger travel distance. Notice, though, that the penalty component is increased from 0.476 to 0.570 (due to an increase in the finger-based component of the penalty). This presumably is a result of the fact that the pinky that services the additional home row key is more frequently used.
QGMLWY vs Colemak

Let's compare the optimized layout to Colemak. I'll use QGMLWY, since this is the layout that keeps ZXCV in place and uses the Colemak-like letter mask. Note that the QGMLWB layout, which does not keep ZXCV fixed during optimization (but that nevertheless places ZXC in their QWERTY positions), is nearly identical in effort profile to QGMLWY, so the two can be used interchangeably.

The first thing to notice is that Colemak seems to be designed to reduce finger travel distance. This is done at the cost of increasing penalty and stroke path. Colemak has both a higher row and a higher finger penalty component. In fact, the finger penalty component is 31% higher. Therefore, in the Colemak layout shorter finger travel distance is prefered over decrease use of weaker fingers.

The detailed finger and row use statistics for QGMLWY and Colemak are shown below. Both keyboards have the same home row frequency (74%), with QGMLWY having a lower bottom row use (6% vs Colemak's 9%). This reduction in bottom row usage is a result of the row-based penalty component, which penalizes the bottom row (recall that the model parameters result in a penalty ratio of 1:0:2 for the top:home:bottow rows).

Hand asymmetry is identical for both layouts, at 6% with the left hand favoured. However, QGMLWY is better at hand alternation, with one-character hand runs (i.e. a given hand is used to type only one character before the other hand is used) at 60% and 56% of keystrokes for the left and right hands, respectively. Colemak has 55% and 49% for these values.

Finger frequencies differ mainly in the use of the pinky, which is penalized in my model. Thus, QGMLWY uses the pinky 11% whereas Colemak uses the pinky 16% of the time. Colmak's 1-finger run is slightly higher, at 93% compared to 92% for QGMLWY. This is due to the reduced pinky usage in QGMLWY.
QGMLWY vs Norman

The Norman layout is a partially optimized layout by David Norman. It modifies 14/26 letter keys, as shown in the figure below. It maintains locations of Q W A S Z X C V keys to maintain keyboard shortcuts. With the exception of the A and W key, QGMLWY maintain these locations as well.

It does a very good job in minimizing the finger travel distance. Its base effort is 0.342, which is in the neighbourhood of Colemak, Workman and Klausler layouts. According to the Carpalx effort model, it does as poor job in managing row and finger penalties—with 4 fewer key relocations QWKRFY manages a 40% reduction in these penalties over Norman.

Detailed finger usage statistics for Norman are shown below. Norman has a lower usage of home row (68% vs 74%), higher bottom row usage (10% vs 6%), and favours the left hand by 5%.

Norman finger frequencies for pinky, ring, middle and and index finger are 15, 21, 32, 33%. Pinky gets hammered frequencies.

Full Optimization - Convergence and Neighbouring Solutions

Let's take a look at simulation runs that generated the three optimized layouts presented here. Remember that each layout was the lowest effort solution out of a large family of solutions generated by the simulation. It may be that even lower effort solutions exist and that they have not been found by the simulation. This isn't very likely and it's not possible to know whether such a lower-effort state exists.

Each of the three layout discoveries was repeated between ~16,000 and ~21,000 times. The QWERTY optimization that resulted in the QFMLWY layout converged three times to this layout. This means that QFMLWY was the solution in 3/15,961 of the runs. On the other hand, the Colemak mask with ZCXV stationary converged 406/20,797 times to QGMLWY — fixing four keys constrains the problem significantly and results in faster convergence. I believe that the QGMLWY layout is the global minimum for this set of parameters.
Figure 7. Frequency distribution of typing effort for solutions to the layout simulation.
neighbouring solutions to QFMLWY

Below are the three lowest-effort solutions to QWERTY optimization. The lowest effort solution is QFMLWY, as described above. The next lowest solution is JBFUYW and is quite different from QFMLWY. The home row of this solution is nearly reversed — in fact this solution nearly mirrors (left-to-right) the top QFMLWY solution. It is reasonable that this be the case since there is no inherent left/right asymmetry in the penalties or model. The QWERTY mask has a slight asymmetry because, unlike the left pinky, the right pinky does not service a letter key.

The third best solution is QFMLWY, and is very similar to the top solution, varying only in the placement of V, X and J.

neighbouring solutions to QGMLWB

These are the top four solutions to the Colemak-like mask optimization. Unlike the neighbouring solutions to QFMLWY, the top four here do not include a mirror flip. The home row for each of these solutions is identical. The four only vary in the position of G, K, C, X, M, J, F, P. Most of the variation is in the bottom row.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
This article is about the physical and visual arrangement of the keys of a computer keyboard and their function as defined by software. For the underlying physical structure and electronic mechanisms of computer keyboards, see Keyboard technology. For keyboards used in music, see Musical keyboard.
The 104-key US QWERTY layout

A keyboard layout is any specific physical, visual, or functional arrangement of the keys, legends, or key-meaning associations (respectively) of a computer keyboard, mobile phone, or other computer-controlled typographic keyboard.

Physical layout is the actual positioning of keys on a keyboard. Visual layout is the arrangement of the legends (labels, markings, engravings) that appear on those keys. Functional layout is the arrangement of the key-meaning association or keyboard mapping, determined in software, of all the keys of a keyboard; it is this (rather than the legends) that determines the actual response to a key press.

Modern computer keyboards are designed to send a scancode to the operating system (OS) when a key is pressed or released: this code reports only the key's row and column, not the specific character engraved on that key. The OS converts the scancode into a specific binary character code using a "scancode to character" conversion table, called the keyboard mapping table. This means that a physical keyboard may be dynamically mapped to any layout without switching hardware components—merely by changing the software that interprets the keystrokes. Often,[a] a user can change keyboard mapping in system settings. In addition, software may be available to modify or extend keyboard functionality. Thus the symbol shown on the physical key-top need not be the same as appears on the screen or goes into a document being typed. Some settings enable the user to type supplementary symbols that are not engraved on the keys used to invoke them.[b] Modern USB keyboards are plug-and-play; they communicate their (default) visual layout to the OS when connected (though the user is still able to reset this at will).
Key types
A typical 105-key computer keyboard, consisting of sections with different types of keys

A computer keyboard consists of alphanumeric or character keys for typing, modifier keys for altering the functions of other keys,[1] navigation keys for moving the text cursor on the screen, function keys and system command keys—such as Esc and Break—for special actions, and often a numeric keypad to facilitate calculations.[2][3]

There is some variation between different keyboard models in the physical layout—i.e., how many keys there are and how they are positioned on the keyboard.[4] However, differences between national layouts are mostly due to different selections and placements of symbols on the character keys.[5]
Character keys

The core section of a keyboard consists of character keys, which can be used to type letters and other characters. Typically, there are three rows of keys for typing letters and punctuation, an upper row for typing digits and special symbols, and the Space bar on the bottom row. The positioning of the character keys is similar to the keyboard of a typewriter.
Modifier keys
Main article: Modifier key
MIT "space-cadet" keyboard, a pre-ISO/IEC 9995 keyboard with a large number of modifier keys. It was equipped with four keys for bucky bits (Control, Meta, Hyper, and Super); and three shift keys, called "shift", "top", and "front".

Besides the character keys, a keyboard incorporates special keys that do nothing by themselves but modify the functions of other keys. For example, the ⇧ Shift key can be used to alter the output of character keys, whereas the Ctrl (control), Alt (alternate) and AltGr (alternative graphic) keys trigger special operations when used in concert with other keys. (Apple keyboards have differently labelled but equivalent keys, see below).

Typically, a modifier key is held down while another key is struck. To facilitate this, modifier keys usually come in pairs, one functionally identical key for each hand, so holding a modifier key with one hand leaves the other hand free to strike another key.

An alphanumeric key labelled with only a single letter (usually the capital form) can generally be struck to type either a lower case or capital letter, the latter requiring the simultaneous holding of the ⇧ Shift key. The ⇧ Shift key is also used to type the upper of two symbols engraved on a given key, the lower being typed without using the modifier key.

The Latin alphabet keyboard has a dedicated key for each of the letters A–Z, keys for punctuation and other symbols, usually a row of function keys, often a numeric keypad and some system control keys. In most languages except English, additional letters (some with diacritics) are required and some are present as standard on each national keyboard, as appropriate for its national language. These keyboards have another modified key, labelled AltGr (alternative graphic), to the right of the space bar. (US keyboards just have a second Alt key in this position). It can be used to type an extra symbol in addition to the two otherwise available with an alphanumeric key, and using it simultaneously with the ⇧ Shift key usually gives access to a fourth symbol. These third-level and fourth-level symbols may be engraved on the right half of the key top, or they may be unmarked. Cyrillic alphabet and Greek alphabet keyboards have similar arrangements.

Instead of the Ctrl, Alt and AltGr keys seen on commodity keyboards, Apple Keyboards have ⌘ Cmd (command) and ⌥ Option keys. The ⌥ Option key is used much like the AltGr, and the ⌘ Cmd key like the Ctrl and Alt, to access menu options and shortcuts. Macs have a Ctrl key for compatibility with programs that expect a more traditional keyboard layout. It is especially useful when using a terminal, X11 (a Unix environment included with OS X as an install option) or MS Windows. The key can generally be used to produce a secondary mouse click as well. There is also a Fn key on modern Mac keyboards, which is used for switching between use of the F1, F2, etc. keys either as function keys or for other functions like media control, accessing Spotlight, controlling the volume, or handling Mission Control. Fn key can be also found on smaller Windows and Linux laptops and tablets, where it serves a similar purpose.

Many Unix workstations (and also home computers like the Amiga) keyboards placed the Ctrl key to the left of the letter A, and the ⇪ Caps Lock key in the bottom left. This position of the Ctrl key is also used on the XO laptop, which does not have a ⇪ Caps Lock. The UNIX keyboard layout also differs in the placement of the Esc key, which is to the left of 1.

Some early keyboards experimented with using large numbers of modifier keys. The most extreme example of such a keyboard, the so-called "space-cadet keyboard" found on MIT LISP machines, had no fewer than seven modifier keys: four control keys, Ctrl, Meta, Hyper, and Super, along with three shift keys, ⇧ Shift, Top, and Front. This allowed the user to type over 8000 possible characters by playing suitable "chords" with many modifier keys pressed simultaneously.
Dead keys
Main article: Dead key

A dead key is a special kind of a modifier key that, instead of being held while another key is struck, is pressed and released before the other key. The dead key does not generate a character by itself, but it modifies the character generated by the key struck immediately after, typically making it possible to type a letter with a specific diacritic. For example, on some keyboard layouts, the grave accent key ` is a dead key: in this case, striking ` and then A results in à (a with grave accent); ` followed by ⇧ Shift+E results in È (E with grave accent). A grave accent in isolated form can be typed by striking ` and then Space bar.

A key may function as a dead key by default, or sometimes a normal key can temporarily be altered to function as a dead key by simultaneously holding down the secondary-shift key—AltGr or ⌥ Option: a typical example might be AltGr+6 a will produce â (assuming the "6" key is also the "^" key). In some systems, there is no indication to the user that a dead key has been struck, so the key appears dead, but in some text-entry systems the diacritical mark is displayed along with an indication that the system is waiting for another keystroke: either the base character to be marked, an additional diacritical mark, or Space bar to produce the diacritical mark in isolation.

Compared with the secondary-shift modifier key, the dead-key approach may be a little more complicated, but it allows more additional letters. Using AltGr, only one or (if used simultaneously with the normal shift key) two additional letters with each key, whereas using a dead key, a specific diacritic can be attached to a range of different base letters.
Compose key
Main article: Compose key

A Compose key can be characterized as a generic dead key that may in some systems be available instead of or in addition to the more specific dead keys. It allows access to a wide range of predefined extra characters by interpreting a whole sequence of keystrokes following it. For example, striking Compose followed by ' (apostrophe) and then A results in á (a with acute accent), Compose followed by A and then E results in æ (ae ligature), and Compose followed by O and then C results in © (circled c, copyright symbol).

The Compose key is supported by the X Window System (used by most Unix-like operating systems, including most Linux distributions). Some keyboards have a key labeled "Compose", but any key can be configured to serve this function. For example, the otherwise redundant right-hand ⊞ Win key may, when available, be used for this purpose. This can be emulated in Windows with third party programs, for example WinCompose.
System command keys

Depending on the application, some keyboard keys are not used to enter a printable character but instead are interpreted by the system as a formatting, mode shift, or special commands to the system. The following examples are found on personal computer keyboards.
SysRq and PrtSc
4800-52 mainframe / dumb terminal keyboard, c. mid-1980s. There is an obscure configuration of modifier and arrow keys, line feed key, break key, blank keys, and repeat key.

The system request (SysRq) and print screen (PrtSc or on some keyboards e.g. PrtScn) commands often share the same key. SysRq was used in earlier computers as a "panic" button to recover from crashes (and it is still used in this sense to some extent by the Linux kernel; see Magic SysRq key). The print screen command is used to capture the entire screen and send it to the printer, but in the present, it usually puts a screenshot in the clipboard.
Break key

The Break key/Pause key no longer has a well-defined purpose. Its origins go back to teleprinter users, who wanted a key that would temporarily interrupt the communications line. The Break key can be used by software in several different ways, such as to switch between multiple login sessions, to terminate a program, or to interrupt a modem connection.

In programming, especially old DOS-style BASIC, Pascal and C, Break is used (in conjunction with Ctrl) to stop program execution. In addition to this, Linux and variants, as well as many DOS programs, treat this combination the same as Ctrl+C. On modern keyboards, the break key is usually labeled Pause/Break. In most Microsoft Windows environments, the key combination WindowsPause brings up the system properties.
Escape key
Main article: Esc key

The escape key (often abbreviated Esc) "nearly all of the time"[6] signals Stop,[7] QUIT,[8] or let me "get out of a dialog"[6] (or pop-up window).[9]

Another common application today of the Esc key is to trigger the Stop button in many web browsers and operating systems.[6]

ESC was part of the standard keyboard of the Teletype Model 33 (introduced in 1964 and used with many early minicomputers).[10] The DEC VT50, introduced July 1974, also had an Esc key. The TECO text editor (c. 1963) and its descendant Emacs (c. 1985) use the Esc key extensively.

Historically it also served as a type of shift key, such that one or more following characters were interpreted differently, hence the term escape sequence, which refers to a series of characters, usually preceded by the escape character.[11][12]

On machines running Microsoft Windows, prior to the implementation of the Windows key on keyboards, the typical practice for invoking the "start" button was to hold down the control key and press escape. This process still works in Windows 10 and 11.[13]
Enter key

An "enter" key may terminate a paragraph of text and advance an editing cursor to the start of the next available line, similar to the "carriage return" key of a typewriter. When the attached system is processing a user command line, pressing "enter" may signal that the command has been completely entered and that the system may now process it.
Shift key

Shift key: when one presses shift and a letter, it will capitalize the letter pressed with the shift key. Another use is to type more symbols than appear to be available, for instance the semi-colon key is accompanied with a colon symbol on the top. To type a semi-colon, the key is pressed without pressing any other key. To type a colon, both this key and the Shift key are pressed concurrently. (Some systems make provision for users with mobility impairment by allowing the Shift key to be pressed first and then the desired symbol key).
Menu key, Command key, Windows key

The Menu key or Application key is a key found on Windows-oriented computer keyboards: on Apple keyboard the same function is provided by the Command key (labelled ⌘). It is used to launch a context menu with the keyboard rather than with the usual right mouse button. The key's symbol is usually a small icon depicting a cursor hovering above a menu. On some Samsung keyboards the cursor in the icon is not present, showing the menu only. This key was created at the same time as the Windows key. This key is normally used when the right mouse button is not present on the mouse. Some Windows public terminals do not have a Menu key on their keyboard to prevent users from right-clicking (however, in many Windows applications, a similar functionality can be invoked with the Shift+F10 keyboard shortcut).

The Windows key opens the 'Start' (applications) menu.
History
Main article: Typewriter
Keyboard of a Letter-Printing Telegraph Set built by Siemens and Halske in Russia c. 1900

Keyboard layouts have evolved over time, usually alongside major technology changes. Particularly influential have been: the Sholes and Glidden typewriter (1874, also known as Remington No. 1), the first commercially successful typewriter, which introduced QWERTY;[14] its successor, the Remington No. 2 (1878), which introduced the shift key; the IBM Selectric (1961), a very influential electric typewriter, which was imitated by computer keyboards;[15] and the IBM PC (1981), namely the Model M (1985), which is the basis for many modern keyboard layouts.

Within a community, keyboard layout is generally quite stable, due to the high training cost of touch-typing, and the resulting network effect of having a standard layout and high switching cost of retraining, and the suboptimal QWERTY layout is a case study in switching costs. Nevertheless, significant market forces can result in changes (as in Turkish adoption of QWERTY), and non-core keys are more prone to change, as they are less frequently used and less subject to the lock-in of touch-typing. The main, alphanumeric portion is typically stable, while symbol keys and shifted key values change somewhat, modifier keys more so, and function keys most of all: QWERTY dates to the No. 1 (1874)—though 1 and 0 were added later—shifted keys date in some cases to the No. 2 (1878), in other cases to the Selectric (1961), and modifier key placement largely dates to the Model M (1985); function key placement typically dates to the Model M, but varies significantly, particularly on laptops.

The earliest mechanical keyboards were used in musical instruments to play particular notes. With the advent of the printing telegraph, a keyboard was needed to select characters. Some of the earliest printing telegraph machines either used a piano keyboard outright or a layout similar to a piano keyboard.[16][17] The Hughes-Phelps printing telegraph piano keyboard laid keys A-N in left-to-right order on the black piano keys, and keys O-Z in right-to-left order on the white piano keys below.

In countries using the Latin script, the center, alphanumeric portion of the modern keyboard is most often based on the QWERTY design by Christopher Sholes. Sholes' layout was long thought to have been laid out in such a way that common two-letter combinations were placed on opposite sides of the keyboard so that his mechanical keyboard would not jam. However, evidence for this claim has often been contested. In 2012, an argument was advanced by two Japanese historians of technology showing that the key order on the earliest Sholes prototypes in fact followed the left-right and right-left arrangement of the contemporary Hughes-Phelps printing telegraph, described above.[18] Later iterations diverged progressively for various technical reasons, and strong vestiges of the left-right A-N, right-left O-Z arrangement can still be seen in the modern QWERTY layout. Sholes' chief improvement was thus to lay out the keys in rows offset horizontally from each other by three-eighths, three-sixteenths, and three-eighths inches to provide room for the levers and to reduce hand-movement distance. Although it has been demonstrated that the QWERTY layout is not the most efficient layout for typing,[19] it remains the standard.

Sholes chose the size of the keys to be on three-quarter [3⁄4, or 0.75] inch centers (about 19 mm, versus musical piano keys which are 23.5 mm or about 0.93 inches wide). 0.75 inches has turned out to be optimum for fast key entry by the average-size hand, and keyboards with this key size are called "full-sized keyboards".

On a manual typewriter, the operator could press the key down with a lighter touch for such characters as the period or comma, which did not occupy as much area on the paper. Since an electric typewriter supplied the force to the typebar itself after the typist merely touched the key, the typewriter itself had to be designed to supply different forces for different characters. To simplify this, the most common layout for electric typewriters in the United States differed from that for the one most common on manual typewriters. Single-quote and double-quote, instead of being above the keys for the digits 2 and 8 respectively, were placed together on a key of their own. The underscore, another light character, replaced the asterisk above the hyphen.

The ASCII communications code was designed so that characters on a mechanical teletypewriter keyboard could be laid out in a manner somewhat resembling that of a manual typewriter. This was imperfect, as some shifted special characters were moved one key to the left, as the number zero, although on the right, was low in code sequence. Later, when computer terminals were designed from less expensive electronic components, it was not necessary to have any bits in common between the shifted and unshifted characters on a given key. This eventually led to standards being adopted for the "bit-pairing" and "typewriter-pairing" forms of keyboards for computer terminals.

The typewriter-pairing standard came under reconsideration, on the basis that typewriters have many different keyboard arrangements.[20] The U.S. keyboard for the IBM PC, although it resembles the typewriter-pairing standard in most respects, differs in one significant respect: the braces are on the same two keys as the brackets, as their shifts. This innovation predated the IBM Personal Computer by several years.[21]

IBM adopted the 101/102 key layout on the PS/2 in 1987 (after previously using an 84-key keyboard that did not have a separate cursor and numeric keypads).

Most modern keyboards basically conform to the layout specifications contained in parts 1, 2, and 5 of the international standard series ISO/IEC 9995. These specifications were first defined by the user group at AFNOR in 1984 working under the direction of Alain Souloumiac.[22] Based on this work, a well-known ergonomic expert wrote a report[23] which was adopted at the ISO Berlin meeting in 1985 and became the reference for keyboard layouts.

The 104/105-key PC keyboard was born when two ⊞ Win keys and a ≣ Menu key were added on the bottom row (originally for the Microsoft Windows operating system). Newer keyboards may incorporate even further additions, such as Internet access (World Wide Web navigation) keys and multimedia (access to media players) buttons.
Physical, visual, and functional layouts

As noted before, the layout of a keyboard may refer to its physical (arrangement of keys), visual (physical labeling of keys), or functional (software response to a key press or release) layout.
Physical layouts
A comparison of common physical layouts. The ISO-standard physical layout (center left) is common, e.g., in the United Kingdom. Compared with the ANSI layout (top left), the enter key is vertical rather than horizontal. In addition, the left shift key is smaller, to make room for an additional key to its right. The JIS physical layout (bottom right) is the basis for Japanese keyboards. Here it is the right-hand shift key that is smaller. Furthermore, the space bar and backspace key are also smaller, to make room for four additional keys.

Physical layouts only address tangible differences among keyboards. When a key is pressed, the keyboard does not send a message such as the A-key is depressed but rather the left-most main key of the home row is depressed. (Technically, each key has an internal reference number, the scan code, and these numbers are what is sent to the computer when a key is pressed or released.) The keyboard and the computer each have no information about what is marked on that key, and it could equally well be the letter A or the digit 9. Historically, the user of the computer was requested to identify the functional layout of the keyboard when installing or customizing the operating system. Modern USB keyboards are plug-and-play; they communicate their visual layout to the OS when connected (though the user is still able to reset this at will).[example needed]

Today, most keyboards use one of three different physical layouts, usually referred to as simply ISO (ISO/IEC 9995-2), ANSI (ANSI-INCITS 154-1988), and JIS (JIS X 6002-1980), referring roughly to the organizations issuing the relevant worldwide, United States, and Japanese standards, respectively. (In fact, the physical layouts referred such as "ISO" and "ANSI" comply with the primary recommendations in the named standards, while each of these standards in fact also allows the other.) Keyboard layout in this sense may refer either to this broad categorization or to finer distinctions within these categories. For example, as of May 2008, Apple Inc. produces ISO, ANSI, and JIS desktop keyboards, each in both extended and compact forms. The extended keyboards have 110, 109, and 112 keys (ISO, ANSI, and JIS, respectively), and the compact models have 79, 78, and 80.
Visual layouts
A visual layout consisting of both factory-printed symbols and customized stickers

The visual layout includes the symbols printed on the physical keycaps. Visual layouts vary by language, country, and user preference, and any one physical and functional layout can be employed with a number of different visual layouts. For example, the "ISO" keyboard layout is used throughout Europe, but typical French, German, and UK variants of physically identical keyboards appear different because they bear different legends on their keys. Even blank keyboards—with no legends—are sometimes used to learn typing skills or by user preference.

Some users choose to attach custom labels on top of their keycaps. This can be, e.g., for masking foreign layouts, adding additional information such as shortcuts, learning aids, gaming controls, or solely for decorational purposes.
Functional layouts

The functional layout of the keyboard refers to the mapping between the physical keys, such as the A key, and software events, such as the letter "A" appearing on the screen. Usually the functional layout is set (in the system configuration) to match the visual layout of the keyboard being used, so that pressing a key will produce the expected result, corresponding to the legends on the keyboard. However, most operating systems have software that allow the user to easily switch between functional layouts, such as the language bar in Microsoft Windows. For example, a user with a Swedish keyboard who wishes to type more easily in German may switch to a functional layout intended for German—without regard to key markings—just as a Dvorak touch typist may choose a Dvorak layout regardless of the visual layout of the keyboard used.
Customized functional layouts
See also: Overlay keyboard

Functional layouts can be redefined or customized within the operating system, by reconfiguring the operating system keyboard driver, or with the use of a separate software application. Transliteration is one example of that whereby letters in other languages get matched to visible Latin letters on the keyboard by the way they sound. Thus, a touch typist can type in various foreign languages with a visible English-language keyboard only.

Mixed hardware-to-software keyboard extensions exist to overcome the above discrepancies between functional and visual layouts. A keyboard overlay[24] is a plastic or paper masks that can be placed over the empty space between the keys, providing the user with the functional use of various keys. Alternatively, a user applies keyboard stickers with an extra imprinted language alphabet and adds another keyboard layout via language support options in the operating system.[25] The visual layout of any keyboard can also be changed by simply replacing its keys or attaching labels to them, such as to change an English-language keyboard from the common QWERTY to the Dvorak layout, although for touch typists, the placement of the tactile bumps on the home keys is of more practical importance than that of the visual markings.

In the past, complex software that mapped many non-standard functions to the keys (such as a flight simulator) would be shipped with a "keyboard overlay", a large sheet of paper with pre-cut holes matching the key layout of a particular model of computer. When placed over the keyboard, the overlay provided a quick visual reference as to what each key's new function was, without blocking the keys or permanently modifying their appearance. The overlay was often made from good-quality laminated paper and was designed to fold up and fit in the game's packaging when not in use.
National variants

The U.S. IBM PC keyboard has 104 keys, while the PC keyboards for most other countries have 105 keys. In an operating system configured for a non-English language, the keys are placed differently. For example, keyboards designed for typing in Spanish have some characters shifted, to make room for Ñ/ñ; similarly those for French or Portuguese may have a special key for the character Ç/ç. Keyboards designed for Japanese may have special keys to switch between Japanese and Latin scripts, and the character ¥ (yen and yuan sign) instead of \ (backslash – which itself additionally may be displayed as a ¥ or a ₩ in some renditions). Using the same keyboard for alternative languages leads to a conflict: the image on the key may not correspond to the character displayed on screen because of different keyboard mappings. In such cases, each new language may require an additional label on the key, because the national standard keyboard layouts may not share similar characters of different languages or even lay them out in different ways.

The United States keyboard layout is used as default in some Linux distributions.[26]

Most operating systems allow switching between functional keyboard layouts, using a key combination involving register keys that are not used for normal operations (e.g. Microsoft reserve Alt+⇧ Shift or Ctrl+⇧ Shift register control keys for sequential layout switching; those keys were inherited from old DOS keyboard drivers). There are keyboards with two parallel sets of characters labeled on the keys, representing alternate alphabets or scripts. It is also possible to add a second set of characters to a keyboard with keyboard stickers manufactured by third parties.
Size variation
Further information: Computer keyboard § Types and standards
Sections on a standard 104 keyboard. Percentages and relevant values of keys denote the presence of keys at common keyboard sizes.

Modern keyboard models contain a set number of total keys according to their given standard, described as 104, 105, etc., and sold as "full-size" keyboards.[27] This number is not always followed, and individual keys or whole sections are commonly skipped for the sake of compactness or user preference. Consequently, generic keyboard mappings may not be completely effective on unusual layouts.
Latin-script keyboard layouts

Although there are a large number of keyboard layouts used for languages written with Latin-script alphabets, most of these layouts are quite similar. They can be divided into three main families according to where the A, M, Q, W, Y and Z keys are placed on the keyboard. These layouts are usually named after the first six letters on the first row: AZERTY, QWERTY, QWERTZ, QZERTY and national variants thereof.

While the central area of the keyboard, the alphabetic section, remains fairly constant, and the numbers from 1–9 are almost invariably on the row above, keyboards may differ in:

    the placement of punctuation, typographic and other special characters, and which of these characters are included,
    whether numbers are accessible directly or in a shift-state,
    the presence and placement of letters with diacritics (in some layouts, diacritics are applied using dead keys but these are rarely engraved).
    the presence and placement of a row of function keys above the number row
    the presence and placement of one or two Alt keys, an AltGr key or Option key, a backspace or delete key, a control key or command key, a compose key, an Esc key, and OS-specific keys like the Windows key.

The physical keyboard is of the basic ISO, ANSI, or JIS type; pressing a key sends a scan code to the operating-system or other software, which in turn determines the character to be generated: this arrangement is known as the keyboard mapping. It is customary for keyboards to be engraved appropriately to the local default mapping. For example, when the ⇧ Shift and numeric 2 keys are pressed simultaneously on a US keyboard; "@" is generated, and the key is engraved appropriately. On a UK keyboard this key combination generates the double-quote character, and UK keyboards are so engraved.

In the keyboard charts listed below, the primary letters or characters available with each alphanumeric key are often shown in black in the left half of the key, whereas characters accessed using the AltGr key appear in blue in the right half of the corresponding key. Symbols representing dead keys usually appear in red.
QWERTY
Main article: QWERTY

The QWERTY layout is, by far, the most widespread layout in use, and the only one that is not confined to a particular geographical area.[28] In some territories, keys like ↵ Enter and ⇪ Caps Lock are not translated to the language of the territory in question. In other varieties such keys have been translated, like ↵ Intro and ⇪ Bloq Mayús, on Spanish computer keyboards respectively for the example above. On Macintosh computers these keys are usually just represented by symbols without the word "Enter", "Shift", "Command", "Option/Alt" or "Control", with the exception of keyboards distributed in the US and East Asia.[citation needed]

QÜERTY (Azerbaijani)
Azerbaijani QÜERTY keyboard layout

Azerbaijani keyboards use a layout known as QÜERTY, where Ü appears in place of W above S, with W not being accessible at all. It is supported by Microsoft Windows.[29]
PÜŞUD (Azerbaijani)

In 2010, a new layout – known as PÜŞUD – was designed and proposed by Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences. It was praised by Ministry of Digital Development and Transportation. This layout is completely different than the most used one – QÜERTY.[30][31][32][33]
ÄWERTY (Turkmen)
Turkmen ÄWERTY keyboard layout

Turkmen keyboards use a layout known as ÄWERTY (/æˈvɜːrtiː/ av-UR-tee), where Ä appears in place of Q above A, Ü appears in place of X below S, Ç appears in place of C, and Ý appears in place of V, with C, Q, V, and X not being accessible at all. It is supported by Microsoft Windows (Vista and later only).[29]
QWERTZ

Main article: QWERTZ
German QWERTZ layout
Albanian QWERTZ keyboard

The QWERTZ layout is the normal keyboard layout in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. It is also fairly widely used in Czechia, Slovakia and other parts of Central Europe. The main difference between it and QWERTY is that Y and Z are swapped, and some special characters such as brackets are replaced by diacritical characters like Ä, Ö, Ü, ß. In Czechia and Slovakia diacritical characters like Ě, Š, Č, Ř, Ž, Ý, Á, Í also replace numbers. Caps lock can be a shift lock as in AZERTY (see below).
AZERTY
Main article: AZERTY
French AZERTY layout

The AZERTY layout is used in France, Belgium, and some African countries. It differs from the QWERTY layout thus:

    A and Q are swapped,
    Z and W are swapped,
    M is moved to the right of L, (taking place of the :/; or colon/semicolon key on a US keyboard),
    The digits 0 to 9 are on the same keys, but to be typed the shift key must be pressed. The unshifted positions are used for accented characters,
    Caps lock is replaced by Shift lock, thus affecting non-letter keys as well. However, there is an ongoing evolution towards a Caps lock key instead of a Shift lock.

ĄŽERTY (Lithuanian)

As standardized in LST 1582, Lithuanian keyboards have a defined layout known as ĄŽERTY,[34] where Ą appears in place of Q above A, Ž in place of W above S, and Ū in place of X below S, with Q, W, and X being available either on the far right-hand side or by use of the AltGr key. However instead of ĄŽERTY, the Lithuanian QWERTY keyboard is universally used.
QZERTY
Italian typewriter Olivetti Lettera 22

The QZERTY (/ˈkzɜːrtiː/ KZUR-tee) layout was used mostly in Italy, where it was the traditional typewriter layout. In recent years, however, a modified QWERTY layout with stressed keys such as à, è, ò, has gained widespread usage throughout Italy.[35][36] Computer keyboards usually have QWERTY, although non-alphanumeric characters vary.

    Z and W are swapped
    M is moved from the right of N to the right of L, as in AZERTY
    Number keys are shifted

Apple supported QZERTY layout in its early Italian keyboards, and also the iPod Touch had it available.[37]
Sámi Extended

Sámi keyboards use a layout known as the Sámi Extended, where Á appears in place of Q above A, Š appears in place of W above S, Č appears in place of X to the left of C, and Ŧ appears in place of Y to the right of T, with Q, W, X, and Y being available by use of the AltGr key. Also, Å is to the right of P (to match the Norwegian and Swedish/Finnish keyboards), Ŋ is to the right of Å, and Đ is to the right of Ŋ. It is different in Norway than in Sweden and Finland, because of the placement of the letters different between Norwegian and Swedish/Finnish (Ä, Æ, Ö, and Ø), which are placed where they match the standard keyboard for the main language spoken in the country. It is supported by Microsoft Windows (Windows XP SP2 and later only).[29] Microsoft Windows also has Swedish with Sami, Norwegian with Sami and Finnish with Sami layouts, which match the normal Swedish, Norwegian, or Finnish keyboards, but has additional Sami characters as AltGr-combinations.
Other Latin-script keyboard layouts
See also: List of Latin-script keyboard layouts

There are also keyboard layouts that do not resemble traditional typewriter layouts very closely, if at all. These are designed to reduce finger movement and are claimed by some proponents to offer higher typing speed along with ergonomic benefits.
Dvorak
Main article: Dvorak keyboard layout
The Dvorak keyboard layout

The Dvorak layout was named after its inventor, August Dvorak. There are also numerous adaptations for languages other than English and single-handed variants. Dvorak's original layout had the numerals rearranged, but the present-day layout had them in numerical order. Dvorak has numerous properties designed to increase typing speed, decrease errors, and increase comfort. Research has found a 4% average advantage to the end user in typing speed.[38] The layout concentrates the most used English letters in the home row where the fingers rest, thus having 70% of typing done in the home row (compared to 32% in QWERTY).

The layout came before computers came to be, so it challenges programmers and power users because keyboard shortcuts, like copy-paste are in totally different locations, punctuation symbols are significantly affected, while common commands like ls -ls result in strenuous use of the pinky finger.

The Dvorak layout is available out-of-the-box on most operating systems, making switching through software very easy. "Hardwired" Dvorak keyboards are also available, though only from specialized hardware companies.
Colemak
Main article: Colemak
Colemak keyboard layout (US)

The Colemak layout is another popular alternative to the standard QWERTY layout, offering a more familiar change for users already accustomed to the standard layout.[39]

It builds upon the QWERTY layout as a base, changing the positions of 17 keys while retaining the QWERTY positions of most non-alphabetic characters and many popular keyboard shortcuts, supposedly making it easier to learn than Dvorak for people who already type in QWERTY without sacrificing efficiency. It shares several design goals with the Dvorak layout, such as minimizing finger path distance and making heavy use of the home row.[40] An additional defining (albeit optional) feature of the Colemak layout is the lack of a caps lock key; an additional backspace key occupies the position typically occupied by Caps Lock on modern keyboards.[39]

Operating systems such as macOS, Linux, Android, ChromeOS, and BSD allow a user to switch to the Colemak layout. A program to install the layout is available for Microsoft Windows, as well as a portable AutoHotKey implementation.[41]

Colemak variants exist, including Colemak Mod-DH, which seeks to rectify concerns that the layout places too much emphasis on the middle-row centre-column keys (D and H), leading to awkward lateral hand movements for certain common English bigrams such as HE.[42] Others seek to have more compatibility with other keyboard layouts.[43]
Workman
Workman layout for the English language, showing home keys highlighted

Workman is an English layout supported out-of-the-box in Linux/X11 systems.[44]

The Workman layout employs a hypothesis about the preferential movement of each finger rather than categorically considering the lowest letter row to be least accessible. Specifically, the index finger prefers to curl inwards rather than stretch outwards. So for the index finger, the position of second preference goes to the bottom row rather than the top row. Contrarily, the middle and ring fingers are relatively long and prefer to stretch out rather than curl in. Based on this, weighting is allotted to each key specifically rather than each row generically.

Another principle applied is that it is more natural and less effort to curl in or stretch out fingers rather than rotate one's wrist inwards or outwards. Thus the Workman layout allots a lower priority to the two innermost columns between the home keys (G and H columns on a QWERTY layout), similarly to the Colemak-DH or "Curl" mods. Workman also balances the load quite evenly between both hands.

The Workman layout is found to achieve overall less travel distance of the fingers for the English language than even Colemak.[45][46] It does however generally incur higher same-finger n-gram frequencies; or in other words, one finger will need to hit two keys in succession more often than in other layouts.
Other English layouts

There are many other layouts for English, each developed with differing basic principles.

The Norman Layout, like Workman, deprioritizes the central columns but gives more load to the right hand with the assumption that the right hand is more capable than the left. It also gives importance to retaining letters in the same position or at least the same finger as QWERTY.

MTGAP's Layout for a Standard Keyboard / an Ergonomic Keyboard has the lowest finger travel for a standard keyboard, and travel distance for an ergonomic keyboard second only to Arensito's keyboard layout.[47] Further variations were created using the keyboard layout optimizer.[48]

Other layouts lay importance on minimal key deviation from QWERTY to give a reasonable increase in typing speed and ergonomics with minimal relearning of keys.[49]
Qwpr keyboard layout (letters moved from QWERTY in teal, or yellow if different hand)

Qwpr is a layout that changes only 11 basic keys from their QWERTY positions, with only 2 keys typed with different fingers.[50] Minimak has versions that changes four, six, eight, or twelve keys, all have only 3 keys change finger.[51] These intend to offer much of the reduced finger movement of Dvorak without the steep learning curve and with an increased ability to remain proficient with a QWERTY keyboard. The Qwpr layout is also designed for programmers and multilingual users, as it uses Caps Lock as a "punctuation shift", offering quicker access to ASCII symbols and arrow keys, as well as to 15 dead keys for typing hundreds of different glyphs such as accented characters, mathematical symbols, or emoji.

In Canada, the CSA keyboard is designed to write several languages, especially French.
Sholes' 2nd Layout
Sholes' second layout

Christopher Latham Sholes, inventor of the QWERTY layout, created his own alternative, and patented it in 1896.[52] Similar to Dvorak, he placed all the vowels on the home row, but in this case on the right hand. The layout is right-hand biased with both the vowels and many of the most common consonants on the right side of the layout.

JCUKEN keyboard of the UKNC computer

The JCUKEN layout was used in the USSR for all computers (both domestically produced and imported such as Japan-made MSX-compatible systems) except IBM-compatible ES PEVM due to its phonetic compatibility with Russian ЙЦУКЕН layout (see right). The layout has the advantage of having punctuation marks on Latin and Cyrillic layouts mapped on the same keys.[53]
Neo
Main article: Neo (keyboard layout)
Neo Layout, layer 1

The Neo layout is an optimized German keyboard layout developed in 2004 by the Neo Users Group,[54] supporting nearly all Latin-based alphabets, including the International Phonetic Alphabet,[55] the Vietnamese language and some African languages.[56]

The positions of the letters are not only optimized for German letter frequency, but also for typical groups of two or three letters. English is considered a major target as well. The design tries to enforce the alternating usage of both hands to increase typing speed. It is based on ideas from de-ergo and other ergonomic layouts. The high frequency keys are placed in the home row. The current layout, Neo 2.0, has unique features not present in other layouts, making it suited for many target groups such as programmers, mathematicians, scientists or LaTeX authors.[57] Neo is grouped in different layers, each designed for a special purpose.
Neo Layout, layer 3

Most special characters inherit the meaning of the lower layers—the ⟨¿⟩ character is one layer above the ⟨?⟩, or the Greek ⟨α⟩ is above the ⟨a⟩ character. Neo uses a total of six layers with the following general use:[58][59]

    Lowercase characters
    Uppercase characters, typographical characters
    Special characters for programming, etc.
    WASD-like movement keys and number block
    Greek characters
    Mathematical symbols and Greek uppercase characters

BÉPO
Main article: BÉPO
BÉPO layout

The BÉPO layout is an optimized French keyboard layout developed by the BÉPO community,[60] supporting all Latin-based alphabets of the European Union, Greek and Esperanto.[61] It is also designed to ease programming. It is based on ideas from the Dvorak and other ergonomic layouts. Typing with it is usually easier due to the high frequency keys being in the home row. Typing tutors exist to ease the transition.[62]

In 2019, a slightly modified version of the BÉPO layout is featured in a French standard developed by AFNOR, along with an improved version of the traditional AZERTY layout.[63]

Dvorak-fr
Dvorak-fr

The Dvorak-fr layout is a Dvorak like layout specific to the French language, without concession to the use of programming languages, and published in 2002 by Francis Leboutte. Version 2 was released in June 2020. Its design meets the need to maximize comfort and prevent risks when typing in French. Unlike AZERTY, the characters needed for good French typography are easily accessible: for example, the quotation marks (« ») and the curved apostrophe are available directly. More than 150 additional characters are available via dead keys.
Turkish (F-keyboard)
Turkish F-keyboard layout

The Turkish language uses the Turkish Latin alphabet, and a dedicated keyboard layout was designed in 1955 by İhsan Sıtkı Yener[64] (tr). During its design, letter frequencies in the Turkish language were investigated with the aid of Turkish Language Association. These statistics were then combined with studies on bone and muscle anatomy of the fingers to design the Turkish F-keyboard (Turkish: F klavye). The keyboard provides a balanced distribution of typing effort between the hands: 49% for the left hand and 51% for the right. With this scientific preparation, Turkey has broken 14 world records in typewriting championships between 1957 and 1995.[65] In 2009, Recep Ertaş and in 2011, Hakan Kurt from Turkey came in first in the text production event of the 47th (Beijing) and 48th (Paris) Intersteno congresses respectively.[66][67] Despite the greater efficiency of the Turkish F-keyboard however, the modified QWERTY keyboard ("Q-keyboard") is the one that is used on most computers in Turkey. The reason for the popularity of QWERTY in Turkey is that they were overwhelmingly imported since the beginning of the 1990s.[68]
ŪGJRMV
Latvian Keyboard Layout

The ŪGJRMV layout is specifically designed for the Latvian language.[29]


HCESAR
Hcesar keyboard layout

The Hcesar layout was a layout created in 1937 for typewriters during Portugal's Estado Novo. It was specifically designed for the Portuguese language. It is no longer used since the 80s.
Malt

The Malt layout—named for its inventor, South African-born Lilian Malt—is best known for its use on molded, ergonomic Maltron keyboards. Nevertheless, it has been adapted as well for flat keyboards, with a compromise involved: a flat keyboard has a single, wide space-bar, rather than a space button as on Maltron keyboards, so the E key was moved to the bottom row.

Modified Blickensderfer
Original Blickensderfer keyboard
Blick keyboard for computers

The Blickensderfer typewriter, designed by George Canfield Blickensderfer in 1892, was known for its novel keyboard layout, its interchangeable font, and its suitability for travel. The Blickensderfer keyboard had three banks (rows of keys), with special characters being entered using a separate Shift key; the home row was, uniquely, the bottom one (i.e., the typist kept her hands on the bottom row). A computer or standard typewriter keyboard, on the other hand, has four banks of keys, with home row being second from bottom.

To fit on a Sholes-patterned (typewriter or computer) keyboard, the Blickensderfer layout was modified by Nick Matavka in 2012, and released for both Mac OS X and Windows. To accommodate the differences between Blickensderfer and Sholes keyboards (not the layouts, but the keyboards themselves), the order of the rows was changed and special characters were given their own keys.

The keyboard drivers created by Nick Matavka for the modified Blickensderfer layout (nicknamed the 'Blick') have several variations, including one that includes the option of switching between Blick and another keyboard layout and one that is internationalised, allowing the entry of diacritics.
Hexagon
Main article: Typewise
Hexagon keyboard layout

The honeycomb layout has hexagon keys and was invented by Typewise in cooperation with the ETH Zurich[69] in 2015 for smartphones.[70][71] It exists for 40+ languages including English, German, Spanish, French and Afrikaans. The keys are arranged like those of the respective traditional keyboard with a few changes. Instead of the Space bar there are two smaller space bars in the middle of the keyboard. The ⇧ Shift is replaced by swiping up on keys and ← Backspace by swiping to the left on the keyboard. Diacritic characters can be accessed by holding on a key.[72][73]

A few companies offer "ABC" (alphabetical) layout keyboards.[74][75] The ABCDEF layout was used by Minitel. The layout can also be useful for people who do not type often or where using both hands is not practical, such as touchscreens.
Chorded keyboards and mobile devices
Main article: Chorded keyboard

Chorded keyboards, such as the Stenotype and Velotype, allow letters and words to be entered using combinations of keys in a single stroke. Users of stenotype machines regularly reach rates of 225 words per minute.[76] These systems are commonly used for real-time transcription by court reporters and in live closed captioning systems. Ordinary keyboards may be adapted for this purpose using Plover. However, due to hardware constraints, chording three or more keys may not work as expected. Many high-end keyboards support n-key rollover and so do not have this limitation.

The multi-touch screens of mobile devices allow implementation of virtual on-screen chorded keyboards. Buttons are fewer, so they can be made larger. Symbols on the keys can be changed dynamically depending on what other keys are pressed, thus eliminating the need to memorize combos for characters and functions before use. For example, in the chorded GKOS keyboard which has been adapted for the Google Android, Apple iPhone, MS Windows Phone, and Intel MeeGo/Harmattan platforms, thumbs are used for chording by pressing one or two keys at the same time. The layout divides the keys into two separate pads which are positioned near the sides of the screen, while text appears in the middle. The most frequent letters have dedicated keys and do not require chording.

Some other layouts have also been designed specifically for use with mobile devices. The FITALY layout is optimized for use with a stylus by placing the most commonly used letters closest to the centre and thus minimizing the distance travelled when entering words. A similar concept was followed to research and develop the MessagEase keyboard layout for fast text entry with stylus or finger. The ATOMIK layout, designed for stylus use, was developed by IBM using the Metropolis Algorithm to mathematically minimize the movement necessary to spell words in English.[77] The ATOMIK keyboard layout is an alternative to QWERTY in ShapeWriter's WritingPad software.[78] ASETNIOP is a keyboard layout designed for tablet computers that uses 10 input points, eight of them on the home row.[79]
Other original layouts and layout design software
United-States Maltron 3D keyboard layout

Several other alternative keyboard layouts have been designed either for use with specialist commercial keyboards (e.g. Maltron and PLUM) or by hobbyists (e.g. Asset,[80] Arensito,[81] Minimak,[82] Norman,[83] Qwpr,[84] Workman[85] as well as symmetric typing[86] layouts Niro[87] and Soul[88]); however, none of them are in widespread use, and many of them are merely proofs of concept. Principles commonly used in their design include maximizing use of the home row, minimizing finger movement, maximizing hand alternation or inward rolls (where successive letters are typed moving towards the center of the keyboard), minimizing changes from QWERTY to ease the learning curve, and so on.

Maltron also has a single-handed keyboard layout.[89]

Programs such as the Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator[90] (basic editor, free, for use on MS Windows), SIL Ukelele[91] (advanced editor, free, for use on Apple's Mac OS X), KbdEdit[92] (commercial editor, for Windows) and Keyman Developer[93] (free, open source editor for Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, or for sites on the web as virtual keyboards) make it easy to create custom keyboard layouts for regular keyboards;[94] users may satisfy their own typing patterns or specific needs by creating new ones from scratch (like the IPA[95] or pan-Iberian[96] layouts) or modify existing ones (for example, the Latin American Extended[97] or Gaelic[98] layouts). Such editors can also construct complex key sequences using dead keys or the AltGr key.

Certain virtual keyboards and keyboard layouts are accessible online.[99] With no hardware limitations, those online keyboards can display custom layouts, or allow the user to pre-configure or try out different language layouts. Resulting text can then be pasted into other websites or applications flexibly with no need to reprogram keyboard mappings at all.

Some high-end keyboards allow users flexibility to reprogram keyboard mappings at the hardware level. For example, the Kinesis Advantage contoured keyboard allows for reprogramming single keys (not key combinations), as well as creating macros for remapping combinations of keys (this however includes more processing from the keyboard hardware, and can therefore be slightly slower, with a lag that may be noticed in daily use).

Non-QWERTY layouts were also used with specialized machines such as the 90-key Linotype type setting machine.
Keyboard layouts for non-Latin alphabetic scripts

Some keyboard layouts for non-Latin alphabetic scripts, most notably the Greek layout, are based on the QWERTY layout, in that glyphs are assigned as far as possible to keys that bear similar-sounding or appearing glyphs in QWERTY. This saves learning time for those familiar with QWERTY, and eases entry of Latin characters (with QWERTY) as well for Greek users.

This is not a general rule, and many non-Latin keyboard layouts have been invented from scratch.

All non-Latin computer keyboard layouts can also input Latin letters as well as the script of the language, for example, when typing in URLs or names. This may be done through a special key on the keyboard devoted to this task, or through some special combination of keys, or through software programs that do not interact with the keyboard much.

InScript is the standard keyboard for 12 Indian scripts including Assamese, Bengali, Devanagari, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Kannada, Malayalam, Oriya, Tamil, and Telugu etc.

Most Indian scripts are derived from Brahmi, therefore their alphabetic order is identical. On the basis of this property, the InScript keyboard layout scheme was prepared. So a person who knows InScript typing in one language can type in other scripts using dictation even without knowledge of that script.

An InScript keyboard is inbuilt in most modern operating systems including Windows, Linux, and Mac OS. It is also available in some mobile phones.
Khmer
Khmer keyboard layout
Main article: Khmer keyboard

Khmer uses its own layout designed to correspond, to the extent practicable, to its QWERTY counterpart, thus easing the learning curve in either direction. For example, the letter ល [lɔː] is typed on the same key as the letter L on the English-based QWERTY. It also has many specifics due to its record number of vowels, consonants and punctuation signs as well as its cluster structure which bundles letters together in one.


Thai

The Thai Kedmanee keyboard layout predominates. The Thai Pattachote keyboard layout is also used, though it is much less common. Infrequently used characters are accessed via the Shift key. Despite their wide usage in Thai, Arabic numerals are not present on the main section of the keyboard. Instead they are accessed via the numeric keypad or by switching to the Latin character set on keyboards without dedicated numeric keys.

The Bhutanese Standard for a Dzongkha keyboard layout standardizes the layout for typing Dzongkha, and other languages using the Tibetan script, in Bhutan. This standard layout was formulated by the Dzongkha Development Commission and Department of Information Technology in Bhutan. The Dzongkha keyboard layout is very easy to learn as the key sequence essentially follows the order of letters in the Dzongkha and Tibetan alphabet. The layout has been available in Linux since 2004.
Inuktitut
Latin keyboard layout for Inuktitut
Naqittaut keyboard layout for Inuktitut

Inuktitut has two similar, though not identical, commonly available keyboard layouts for Windows. Both contain a basic Latin layout in its base and shift states, with a few Latin characters in the AltGr shift states. The Canadian Aboriginal syllabics can be found in the Capslock and AltGr shift states in both layouts as well.

The difference between the two layouts lies in the use of ] as an alternate to AltGr to create the dotted, long vowel syllables, and the mapping of the small plain consonants to the Caps + number keys in the "Naqittaut" layout, while the "Latin" layout does not have access to the plain consonants, and can only access the long vowel syllables through the AltGr shift states.

Hebrew keyboard

All keyboards in Israel are fitted with both Latin and Hebrew letters. Trilingual editions including either Arabic or Cyrillic also exist.

In the standard layout (but not all keyboards), paired delimiters—parentheses (), brackets [], and braces {}, as well as less/greater than <>—are in the opposite order from the standard in other left-to-right languages. This results in "open"/"close" being consistent with right-to-left languages (Shift-9 always gives "close parenthesis" U+0029, which visually looks like "open parenthesis" in left-to-right languages). This is shared with Arabic keyboards.

Certain Hebrew layouts are extended with niqqud symbols (vowel points),[103] which require Alt+Shift or similar key combination in order to be typed.
Tifinagh

The Royal institute of the Amazigh culture (IRCAM) developed a national standard Tifinagh layout for Tamazight (Berber) in Morocco. It is included in Linux and Windows 8, and is available for the Mac and older versions of Windows.

A compatible, international version of this layout, called "Tifinagh (International)" exists for typing a wide range of Tamazight (Berber) language variants, and includes support for Tuareg variants. It was designed by the Universal Amazigh Keyboard Project and is available from its page on SourceForge.[104]

The Armenian language keyboard is similar to the Greek in that in most (but not all) cases, a given Armenian letter is at the same location as the corresponding Latin letter on the QWERTY keyboard. The illustrated keyboard layout can be enabled on Linux with: setxkbmap am -variant phonetic. Western and Eastern Armenian have different layouts.

In the pre-computer times, Armenian keyboards had quite a different layout, more suitable for producing letter combinations inherent to the language.

Several attempts have been made to create innovative ergonomic layouts, some of them inspired by Dvorak.

Cyrillic
Bulgarian
Bulgarian keyboard layout (BDS 5237:1978)

The current official Bulgarian keyboard layout for both typewriters and computer keyboards is described in BDS (Bulgarian State/National Standard) 5237:1978.[105] It superseded the old standard, BDS 5237:1968, on 1 January 1978.[105] Like the Dvorak layout, it has been designed to optimize typing speed and efficiency, placing the most common letters in the Bulgarian language—О, Н, Т, and А—under the strongest fingers. In addition to the standard 30 letters of the Bulgarian alphabet, the layout includes the non-Bulgarian Cyrillic symbols Э and ы and the Roman numerals I and V (the X is supposed to be represented by the Cyrillic capital Х, which is acceptable in typewriters but problematic in computers).

There is also a second, informal layout in widespread use—the so-called "phonetic" layout, in which Cyrillic letters are mapped to the QWERTY keys for Latin letters that "sound" or "look" the same, with several exceptions (Я is mapped to Q, Ж is mapped to V, etc.—see the layout and compare it to the standard QWERTY layout). This layout is available as an alternative to the BDS one in some operating systems, including Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS X and Ubuntu Linux. Normally, the layouts are set up so that the user can switch between Latin and Cyrillic script by pressing Shift + Alt, and between BDS and Phonetic by pressing Shift + Ctrl.

In 2006, Prof. Dimiter Skordev from the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics of Sofia University and Dimitar Dobrev from the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences proposed a new standard, prBDS 5237:2006, including a revised version of the old BDS layout, which includes the letter Ѝ and the capital Ы and replaces the letters I and V with the currency symbols of $ and € respectively, and a standardization of the informal "phonetic" layout. After some controversy and a public discussion in 2008, the proposal was not accepted,[106] although it had been already used in several places—the "Bulgarian Phonetic" layout in MS Windows Vista is based on it. There is a new "Bulgarian Phonetic" layout in MS Windows 7.[29]
Macedonian
Macedonian keyboard layout

The Macedonian keyboard layout is phonetic. The Latin letters that have a phonetic equivalent in Macedonian are used for the corresponding Cyrillic letters. The letters in the Macedonian alphabet and characters used in the Macedonian orthography that do not have any phonetic equivalent are Љ, Њ, Ѕ, Ш, Ѓ, Ж, Ч, Ќ, Ѝ, Ѐ.

Even though they are not part of the Macedonian alphabet, and are not used in the Macedonian language, the first Macedonian keyboard layout supported by Windows uses Alt Gr to type the glyphs Ћ and Ђ, where their capital forms are next to the small forms. This keyboard does not include the glyphs Ѝ and Ѐ.[29]

A new revised standard version of the layout was supported with Windows Vista. This version includes the glyphs Ѝ and Ѐ and uses Alt Gr to add an acute accent, which is not included in the original Macedonian layout.[29]

Russian Windows keyboard layout

The most common keyboard layout in modern Russia is the so-called Windows layout, which is the default Russian layout used in the MS Windows operating system. The layout was designed to be compatible with the hardware standard in many other countries, but introduced compromises to accommodate the larger alphabet. The full stop and comma symbols share a key, requiring the shift key to be held to produce a comma, despite the high relative frequency of comma in the language.[53]

There are some other Russian keyboard layouts in use: in particular, the traditional Russian Typewriter layout (punctuation symbols are placed on numerical keys, one needs to press Shift to enter numbers) and the Russian DOS layout (similar to the Russian Typewriter layout with common punctuation symbols on numerical keys, but numbers are entered without Shift). The Russian Typewriter layout can be found on many Russian typewriters produced before the 1990s, and it is the default Russian keyboard layout in the OpenSolaris operating system.[107][better source needed]

Keyboards in Russia always have Cyrillic letters on the keytops as well as Latin letters. Usually Cyrillic and Latin letters are labeled with different colors.

Russian QWERTY/QWERTZ-based phonetic layouts
Russian phonetic keyboard layout

The Russian phonetic keyboard layout (also called homophonic or transliterated) is widely used outside Russia, where normally there are no Russian letters drawn on keyboard buttons. This layout is made for typists who are more familiar with other layouts, like the common English QWERTY keyboard, and follows the Greek and Armenian layouts in placing most letters at the corresponding Latin letter locations. It is famous among both native speakers and people who use, teach, or are learning Russian, and is recommended—along with the Standard Layout—by the linguists, translators, teachers and students of AATSEEL.org. The earliest known implementation of the Cyrillic-to-QWERTY homophonic keyboard was by former AATSEEL officer Constance Curtin between 1972 and 1976, for the PLATO education system's Russian Language curriculum developed at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.[108] Curtin's design sought to map phonetically related Russian sounds to QWERTY keys, to map proximate phonetic and visual cues nearby one another, as well as to map unused positions in a mnemonically ideal way. Peter Zelchenko worked under Curtin at UIUC, and his later modifications to the number row for Windows and Macintosh keyboards follow Curtin's original design intent.[109]

There are several different Russian phonetic layouts, for example YaZhERT (яжерт), YaWERT (яверт), and YaShERT (яшерт) suggested by AATSEEL.org and called "Student" layout. They are named after the first several letters that take over the 'QWERTY' row on the Latin keyboard. They differ by where a few of the letters are placed. For example, some have Cyrillic 'B' (which is pronounced 'V') on the Latin 'W' key (after the German transliteration of B), while others have it on the Latin 'V' key.

There are also variations within these variations; for example the Mac OS X Phonetic Russian layout is YaShERT but differs in placement of ж and э.[110][111]

Windows 10 includes its own implementation of a mnemonic QWERTY-based input method for Russian, which does not fully rely on assigning a key to every Russian letter, but uses the sh, sc, ch, ya (ja), yu (ju), ye (je), yo (jo) combinations to input ш, щ, ч, я, ю, э, and ё respectively.

Virtual (on-screen) keyboards allow entering Cyrillic directly in a browser without activating the system layout.

Serbian (Cyrillic)
Serbian Cyrillic keyboard layout

Apart from a set of characters common to most Cyrillic alphabets, the Serbian Cyrillic layout uses six additional special characters unique or nearly unique to the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet: Љ, Њ, Ћ, Ђ, Џ, and Ј. The Macedonian Ѕ is on this keyboard despite not being used in Serbian Cyrillic.

Due to the bialphabetic nature of the language, actual physical keyboards with the Serbian Cyrillic layout printed on the keys are uncommon today. Typical keyboards sold in Serbian-speaking markets are marked with Serbian Latin characters and used with both the Latin (QWERTZ) and Cyrillic layout configured in the software. What makes the two layouts this readily interchangeable is that the non-alphabetic keys are identical between them, and alphabetic keys always correspond directly to their counterparts (except the Latin letters Q, W, X, and Y that have no Cyrillic equivalents, and the Cyrillic letters Љ, Њ and Џ whose Latin counterparts are digraphs LJ, NJ and DŽ). This also makes the Serbian Cyrillic layout a rare example of a non-Latin layout based on QWERTZ.
Ukrainian
Ukrainian keyboard layout

Ukrainian keyboards, based on a slight modification of Russian Standard Layout, often also have the Russian Standard ("Windows") layout marked on them, making it easy to switch from one language to another. This keyboard layout had several problems, one of which was the omission of the letter Ґ, which does not exist in Russian. The other long-standing problem was the omission of the apostrophe, which is used in Ukrainian almost as commonly as in English (though with a different meaning), but which also does not exist in Russian. Both of these problems were resolved with the "improved Ukrainian" keyboard layout for Windows available with Vista and subsequent Windows versions.

There also exists an adapted keyboard for Westerners learning Ukrainian (mostly in the diaspora) which closely matches the QWERTY keyboard, so that the letters either have the same sound or same shape, for example pressing the "v" on the Latin QWERTY produces the Cyrillic в (which makes roughly the same sound) and pressing the QWERTY "w" key gives the Cyrillic ш (based on the similar shape). This is usually called a homophonic or phonetic layout.
Georgian
Main article: Georgian keyboard layout
Georgian keyboard

There are no keyboards in Georgia with the Georgian script printed on the hardware. The conventional keyboards are American QWERTY with a phonetically matched Georgian software layout. Hardware with both Latin QWERTY and the Russian layout are very common, forcing Georgians to know the Georgian layout blindly. As with the Armenian, Greek, and phonetic Russian layouts, most Georgian letters are on the same keys as their Latin equivalents. During the Soviet era, the Georgian alphabet was adapted to the Russian JCUKEN layout, mainly for typewriters. Soviet computers did not support Georgian keyboards. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, a large variety of computers were introduced to post-Soviet countries. The keyboards had QWERTY layout for Latin alphabet and JCUKEN for Cyrillic both printed on keys. Georgia started to adopt the QWERTY pattern. In both cases the letters which did not exist in the Cyrillic or Latin alphabets were substituted by letters that did not exist in Georgian alphabet. Today the most commonly used layout follows the QWERTY pattern with some changes.
Greek
Greek keyboard layout in comparison to US layout

The usual Greek layout follows the US layout for letters related to Latin letters (ABDEHIKLMNOPRSTXYZ, ΑΒΔΕΗΙΚΛΜΝΟΠΡΣΤΧΥΖ, respectively), substitutes phonetically similar letters (Φ at F; Γ at G) and uses the remaining slots for the remaining Greek letters: Ξ at J; Ψ at C; Ω at V; Θ at U).

Greek has two fewer letters than English, but has two diacritic marks which, because of their frequency, are placed on the home row at the U.K. ";" position; they are dead keys. Word-final sigma has its own position as well, replacing W, and semicolon (which is used as a question mark in Greek) and colon move to the position of Q.

The Greek Polytonic layout has various dead keys to input the accented letters. In Microsoft Windows, there is also the Greek 220 layout and the Greek 319 layout.[29]

Further information: Input method editor, Chinese input methods for computers, Japanese input methods, Korean language and computers, and language input keys

The orthography used for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean ("CJK characters") require special input methods, due to the thousands of possible characters in these languages. Various methods have been invented to fit every possibility into a QWERTY keyboard, so East Asian keyboards are essentially the same as those in other countries. However, their input methods are considerably more complex, without one-to-one mappings between keys and characters.

In general, the range of possibilities is first narrowed down (often by entering the desired character's pronunciation). Then, if there remains more than one possibility, the desired ideogram is selected, either by typing the number before the character, or using a graphical menu to select it. The computer assists the typist by using heuristics to guess which character is most likely desired. Although this may seem painstaking, East Asian input methods are today sufficient in that, even for beginners, typing in these languages is only slightly slower than typing an alphabetic language like English (where each phoneme is represented by one grapheme).

In Japanese, the QWERTY-based JIS keyboard layout is used, and the pronunciation of each character is entered using various approximations to Hepburn romanization or Kunrei-shiki romanization. There are several kana-based typing methods. .

Of the three, Chinese has the most varied input options. Characters can either be entered by pronunciation (like Japanese and Hanja in Korean), or by structure. Most of the structural methods are very difficult to learn but extremely efficient for experienced typists, as there is no need to select characters from a menu.

There exist a variety of other, slower methods in which a character may be entered. If the pronunciation of a character is not known, the selection can be narrowed down by giving its component shapes, radicals, and stroke count. Also, many input systems include a "drawing pad" permitting "handwriting" of a character using a mouse. Finally, if the computer does not have CJK software installed, it may be possible to enter a character directly through its encoding number (e.g., Unicode).

In contrast to Chinese and Japanese, Korean is typed similarly to Western languages. There exist two major forms of keyboard layouts: Dubeolsik (두벌식), and Sebeolsik (세벌식). Dubeolsik, which shares its symbol layout with the QWERTY keyboard, is much more commonly used. While Korean consonants and vowels (jamo) are grouped together into syllabic grids when written, the script is essentially alphabetical, and therefore typing in Korean is quite simple for those who understand the Korean alphabet Hangul. Each jamo is assigned to a single key. As the user types letters, the computer automatically groups them into syllabic characters. Given a sequence of jamo, there is only one unambiguous way letters can be validly grouped into syllables, so the computer groups them together as the user types.
Hangul (for Korean)
See also: Korean language and computers, Hangul, and Korean language

Pressing the Han/Eng (한/영) key once switches between Hangul as shown, and QWERTY (US layout). There is another key to the left of the space bar for Hanja (한자 or 漢字) input. If using an ordinary keyboard without the two extra keys, the right Alt key will become the Ha/En key, and the right Ctrl key will become the Hanja key. Apple Keyboards do not have the two extra keys.
Dubeolsik
Dubeolsik Hangul keyboard layout

Dubeolsik (두벌식; 2-set) is by far the most common and the sole national standard of Hangul keyboard layout in use in South Korea since 1969. Consonants occupy the left side of the layout, while vowels are on the right.

Sebeolsik 390 Hangul keyboard layout

Sebeolsik 390 (세벌식 390; 3-set 390) was released in 1990. It is based on Kong Byung Woo's earlier work. This layout is notable for its compatibility with the QWERTY layout; almost all QWERTY symbols that are not alphanumeric are available in Hangul mode. Numbers are placed in three rows. Syllable-initial consonants are on the right (shown green in the picture), and syllable-final consonants and consonant clusters are on the left (shown red). Some consonant clusters are not printed on the keyboard; the user has to press multiple consonant keys to input some consonant clusters, unlike Sebeolsik Final. It is more ergonomic than the dubeolsik, but is not in wide use.
Sebeolsik Final
Sebeolsik Final Hangul keyboard layout

Sebeolsik Final (세벌식 최종; 3-set Final) is another Hangul keyboard layout in use in South Korea. It is the final Sebulsik layout designed by Kong Byung Woo, hence the name. Numbers are placed on two rows. Syllable-initial consonants are on the right, and syllable-final consonants and consonant clusters are on the left. Vowels are in the middle. All consonant clusters are available on the keyboard, unlike the Sebeolsik 390 which does not include all of them. It is more ergonomic than the dubeolsik, but is not in wide use.

Chinese
Further information: Chinese input methods for computers

Chinese keyboards are usually in US layout with/without Chinese input method labels printed on keys. Without an input method handler activated, these keyboards would simply respond to Latin characters as physically labelled, provided that the US keyboard layout is selected correctly in the operating system. Most modern input methods allow input of both simplified and traditional characters, and will simply default to one or the other based on the locale setting.
People's Republic of China
Further information: Standard Chinese and Simplified Chinese characters

Keyboards used in the People's Republic of China are standard or slightly modified English US (QWERTY) ones without extra labelling, while various IMEs are employed to input Chinese characters. The most common IMEs are Hanyu pinyin-based, representing the pronunciation of characters using Latin letters. However, keyboards with labels for alternative structural input methods such as Wubi method can also be found, although those are usually very old products and are extremely rare, as of 2015.

Computers in Taiwan often use Zhuyin (bopomofo) style keyboards (US keyboards with bopomofo labels), many also with Cangjie method key labels, as Cangjie is a popular method for typing in traditional Chinese characters. The bopomofo style keyboards are in lexicographical order, top-to-bottom left-to-right. The codes of three input methods are typically printed on the Chinese (traditional) keyboard: Zhuyin (upper right); Cangjie (lower left); and Dayi (lower right).

The Eten (I-Tien) keyboard layout is an alternative input method used in Taiwan. It's phonetic-based, allowing users to input Zhuyin using Latin letters.

In Hong Kong, both Chinese (Taiwan) and US keyboards are found. Japanese keyboards are occasionally found, and UK keyboards are rare.

For Chinese input, Shape-based input methods such as Cangjie (pronounced cong1 kit3 in Cantonese) or Chinese handwriting recognition are the most common input method. The use of phonetic-based input method is uncommon due to the lack of official standard for Cantonese romanisation and people in Hong Kong almost never learn any romanisation schemes in schools. An advantage of phonetic-based input method is that most Cantonese speakers are able to input Traditional Chinese characters with no particular training at all where they spell out the Cantonese sound of each character without tone marks, e.g. 'heung gong' for 香港 (Cantonese Yale: Hēung góng; Hong Kong) and to choose the characters from a list. However, Microsoft Windows, which is the most popular operating system used in desktops, does not provide any Cantonese phonetic input method, requiring users to find and install third-party input method software. Also, most people find the process of picking characters from a list being too slow due to homonyms so the Cangjie method is generally preferred.

Although thorough training and practice are required to use Cangjie, many Cantonese speakers have taken Cangjie input courses because of the fast typing speed availed by the input method. This method is the fastest because it has the capability to fetch the exact, unambiguous Chinese character which the user has in mind to input, pinpointing to only one character in most cases. This is also the reason why no provision for an input of phonetic accent is needed to complement this Input Method. The Cangjie character feature is available on both Mac OS X and Windows. On Mac OS X, handwriting recognition input method is bundled with the OS.

Macau utilizes the same layouts as Hong Kong, with the addition of Portuguese (Portugal) or English (US) layout for Portuguese language.

Japanese (OADG 109A) keyboard layout with Hiragana keys
Japanese Apple keyboard layout with Hiragana keys
Further information: Japanese language and computers

The JIS standard layout includes Japanese kana in addition to a QWERTY style layout. The shifted values of many keys (digits, together with :* ; + - =) are a legacy of bit-paired keyboards, dating to ASCII telex machines and terminals of the 1960s and 1970s.

For entering Japanese, the most common method is entering text phonetically, as romanized (transliterated) kana, which are then converted to kanji as appropriate by an input method editor. It is also possible to type kana directly, depending on the mode used. To type たかはし, "Takahashi", a Japanese name, one could type either TAKAHAS (H)I in Romanized (Rōmaji) input mode, or QTFD in kana input mode. Then the user can proceed to the conversion step to convert the input into the appropriate kanji.

The extra keys in the bottom row (muhenkan, henkan, and the Hiragana/Katakana switch key), and the special keys in the leftmost column (the hankaku/zenkaku key at the upper left corner, and the eisū key at the Caps Lock position), control various aspects of the conversion process and select different modes of input.
The "Thumb-shift" layout. There are multiple legends and the two modifying keys. "シフト" means L/R Thumb Shift, "後退" means ← Backspace, "取消" means Delete, and "空白" means Space keys.

The Oyayubi Shifuto (Thumb Shift) layout is based on kana input, but uses two modifying keys replacing the space bar. When a key is pressed simultaneously with one of the keys, it yields another letter. Letters with the "dakuten" diacritic are typed with the opposite side "thumb shift". Letters with "handakuten" are either typed while the conventional pinky-operated shift key is pressed (that is, each key corresponds to a maximum of 4 letters), or, on the "NICOLA" variation, on a key which does not have a dakuten counterpart.

The H key in the QWERTY layout individually yields は, but with the 変換 (R Thumb Shift) key, yields み. Simultaneous input with 無変換 (L Thumb Shift) yields ば, which is the individually mapped letter with the aforementioned dakuten. While the pinky-operated ⇧ Shift key is pressed, the same key yields ぱ. (This same letter must be typed with 無変換 (L Thumb Shift) + Y on the NICOLA variant.)

In Japan, 106-key Japanese keyboards and 101-key English (US layout) keyboards are usually found.
Layout changing software

The character code produced by any key press is determined by the keyboard driver software. A key press generates a scancode which is interpreted as an alphanumeric character or control function. Depending on operating systems, various application programs are available to create, add and switch among keyboard layouts. Many programs are available, some of which are language specific.

The arrangement of symbols of specific language can be customized. An existing keyboard layout can be edited, and a new layout can be created using this type of software.

For example, Ukelele [sic] for Mac,[116] AutoHotkey or The Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator[117] for Windows, and open-source Avro Keyboard provide the ability to customize the keyboard layout as desired.

Notes

depending on OS and (where applicable) institutional policy.

    Using, for example, AltGr to add a third and fourth function to each key; the AltGr key may itself be a reassignment of the right-hand Alt key.

The Asset Keyboard
by David Piepgrass (qwertie256@gmail.com) © 2006 blog

The keyboard you likely have in front of you (named "Qwerty", after its top row), was first available as a typewriter sold in 1874. A common myth is that this keyboard was designed to slow down typists to prevent the keys from jamming; but from the accounts I've seen, it was only designed to prevent the keys from jamming: no more, no less. The original typewriter design simply wasn't very good. Rather than improve it, they rearranged the keys from the original alphabetical order to one that kept common pairs (or "digraphs") of letters away from one another. So the story goes, anyway (for the curious, I wrote a report on the whole matter and more.)

It is clear, however, that it was not designed for fast typing. At the time, everybody typed with two fingers, and even with two fingers, key jamming was a problem.

Oddly enough, it took 60 years until Qwerty's speed-savvy competitor appeared, Dvorak. Sadly for Mr. Dvorak, his keyboard never really caught on. But there is reason to doubt its optimality, and so, in the computer age, there have been a few attempts to improve upon it.

This page notes problems with the Qwerty and Dvorak keyboards and introduces a new layout called Asset. Asset is designed

    to be easier to learn than Qwerty for beginners
    to be easier to learn than Dvorak for those who already know Qwerty
    to yield a higher typing speed than Qwerty for a typical computer user

Introducing the Asset keyboard:

Having been fed up with Qwerty, I decided in 2004 to learn Dvorak. I was surprised how difficult it was to learn, and noticed a curious phenomenon: I would often type letters on Dvorak with the correct finger, but the wrong hand. I came to the conclusion that the hand to use was distinct in my brain from the finger. This led me to hypothesize that there were three separate things I had to learn in order to use a new layout:

    The hand to use
    The finger to use
    The finger motion to use

If this was correct, then a key assigned to the same hand as for Qwerty would be easier to learn, and a key assigned to the same finger would be easier still. One of my major beefs with Qwerty was that the keys were on inappropriate rows, so that the hand must do impressive gymnastics to touch-type on it. With these ideas in mind, I designed the original Asset keyboard on May 17, 2004. It gathered dust for awhile, and then from November 10 to 13, 2006, I tweaked it to the layout shown above. It's called Asset because

    The left home keys are ASET, and
    This layout leverages users' existing asset, their knowledge of Qwerty, to improve learning speed.

Analysis
Principles of layout design
It is widely agreed that the following principles should guide layout design for touch-typing:

    It is faster to type consecutive letters should be typed with different fingers. For example, "ED" is a common word ending, so "E" and "D" should be assigned to different fingers. It is a widely-held belief that hand alternation is the most important factor; for this reason, Dvorak's layout had all vowels on the left side, and all common consonants on the right. This relies on the tendency of consonants and vowels to alternate (though it's hardly a consistent pattern in English). Anyway, some designers believe that sequences of letters on the same hand can be typed at least as fast as sequences that alternate between hands. I do not know of evidence either way, but we can all agree that it is slow to type two different, consecutive letters with the same finger. For now, my hypothesis is that typing consecutive letters on the same hand is acceptable (but slightly inferior to alternation), provided that both keys are not pressed by the weakest (outer) two fingers, and provided that the combination does not involve both the top and bottom rows.
    The most common letters should be on home row (the middle row), because fingers will require less movement and movement takes time.
    Within home row, the home keys (ASDF / JKL; on Qwerty), except perhaps the pinky keys (A / ;), are easiest and quickest to press.
    The bottom row is most difficult to reach and should be populated with uncommon characters. Also, the pinky (little finger) is the least dextrous, especially when pressing keys outside home row.

While the principles are agreed upon, their relative importance is not. I haven't yet searched for papers that weigh these matters.

I would add these additional considerations:

    As I said, it's easier to switch away from Qwerty if the new layout resembles Qwerty.
    The B and Y positions are difficult to reach, so take more time to type.
    The index fingers are assigned 5 keys each, so the potential for digraph clashes increases for these keys. Perhaps the most important thing is that a vowel not be assigned here, as clashes would be guaranteed.
    Backspace is a commonly-pressed key. Many have suggested turning Caps Lock into a backspace (particularly, I tip my hat to Colemak). Then the question arises of where to put the Caps Lock: shall it replace the old backspace? or replace a rarely used key such as the Right Windows key or Right Alt key? or require the user to hold shift while holding the former Caps Lock key? I found this last choice to be the most appealing to me.
    Keys that take longer to reach also strain the hands more; so it seems plausible that a better layout will lead to fewer repetitive stress injuries.
    That the bottom row of the standard keyboard is misaligned. When your fingers are on home row and you move them down, they end up between the keys below, which makes it unnecessarily difficult to press keys on the bottom row, especially (in Qwerty) Z, X, C, comma, period and slash. I believe these keys should be moved left by about 1/4 the width of a key. This will improve alignment for touch typing while not excessively annoying experienced typists.
    The top row is also misaligned. This can be realized by noting that the left hand must turn toward the outside of the body while the right hand turns toward the inside; obviously the design is not related to our hand shape. A simple solution would be to align the two rows squarely; I'll leave the more elaborate solutions to the ergonomics experts.

Of course, the last two considerations are not specific to Asset and could be offered by any manufacturer of any layout.
I've divided the alphabet and other common characters into classes according to similar frequencies, i.e. letters within a class occur with similar frequencies. This is based on a sample of over 1000 books (mostly fiction). That page also contains counts of how many words can be formed with a given set of letters--for example, about 30 words can be formed with the Qwerty home keys, ASDFJKL. These counts are based on a word list called 2of12.txt which is found in a package 12dicts-4.0 at Kevin's Word List Page. Note that this list contains abbreviations, some acronyms, and all word variants. By the way, here's a page with other interesting statistics, though it seems to be based on small sample sizes.
Class 	  	Approximate prominance of each character in English documents, respectively
0. Space character 	  	18.7% (may be skewed upward by certain documents that have large runs of spaces)
1. Most common characters 	E T 	9.6% and 7.0% (total 16.6%)
2 	A O I N H S R 	6.2% to 4.4% (total 36.5%)
3 	D L U 	3.5% to 2.3% (total 9.0%)
4 	M C W G F Y 	1.9% to 1.6% (total 10.48%)
5 	P , . B 	1.3% to 1.2% (total 5.0%)
6. 	K V " ' - 	0.7% to 0.3% (total 2.8%)
7. Least common characters 	? X J ; ! Q Z : 	0.2% and below (total 0.7%)

Asset's design is English-centric, but I did consider the above frequency information in my design.
Problems with the Qwerty keyboard:

    Of the nine most common letters in English (ETAOINHSR, in that order), only three are on home row (ASH), and only two, A and S, are home keys. Five (ETOIR) are on the upper row, and one (N) is on the lower row, making it especially difficult to press.
    A disproportionate number of very common characters are found on the left side of the keyboard, giving the left hand a bigger workload. The common characters on the left (ETASRDCWGF) are 42.5% of characters in English, while those on the right (OINHLUMYP) make up only 32.6%.
    It bears no resemblance to the alphabet, making it difficult for new users to learn.
    IMO, the most difficult keys to hit on the keyboard are B, Z, X, C, V, Y, slash, period, comma, P, and Q. Therefore, all of these should be assigned to rare characters. Unfortunately, Y and C (total 3.4%) are fairly common and B, P, period, and comma are more than 1% each.
    The common digrams ED and DE (total 1.35%), among others, are pressed by the same finger, which can introduce significant delay in touch typing. In fact, when I'm typing fast, I deal with this specific problem by using my index finger to hit D and my middle finger to hit E.
    Qwerty is very boring to learn because very few meaningful words can be formed with the keys on home row. Thus typing tutors typically have students typing nonsense for the first several lessons.

Problems with the Dvorak keyboard:

    It is unpopular.
    It bears no resemblance to Qwerty, so it is difficult and frustrating for experienced Qwerty users to learn.
    I (5.2%) is not one of the home keys, and R (4.4%), is not on home row.
    L (3.2%), on the top row, is hit with the pinky.
    M and W (total 4.8%) are on the bottom row, while F (1.6%) is in a difficult position. In fairness, the same criteria weigh against Asset's placement of Y and M.
    comma and period (, .) (1.2% each) are placed at the same place as W and E on on the Qwerty keyboard. It would be better to place more common characters in these positions.

Advantages of the Asset Keyboard
Asset versus Qwerty

    Asset resembles Qwerty. As illustrated above,
        12 letters are in the same place as they are on the Qwerty keyoard: Q W Y A S H Z X C V B M. All punctuation and numbers are in the same place except the ; : key. 
        8 letters moved, but are pressed with the same finger: F G L E T N I O.
        4 more letters moved, but are pressed with the same hand: P U D K.
        2 letters switched hands (J and R). Qwerty is imbalanced in that the left hand must press more characters than the right. By putting R on the right hand side, this imbalance is largely corrected
    All ten of the most common English letters are on home row.
    Eight of the nine most common letters are on the home keys, except H, which was placed to match Qwerty.
    Over 1000 English words can be formed with the home keys alone, and about 3000 English words can be formed with the home row keys, including such basic words as

    a an are as at did do does has had he her here there in into is it its no neither nor not on or she so to too then than that their these

    Thus, while initially learning this keyboard, many meaningful sentences can be constructed with only the home keys and home row. Additionally, 60 words can be formed from ASET alone and 10 from NIOR alone. Unlike with Qwerty, Asset touch typing tutors do not require users to type dull sets of nonsense words.
    Because 12 letters are in the same place, a Qwerty-to-Asset transition course can be developed which starts with those 12 letters plus E. Over 300 words can be formed from these ten letters. Then, if we add the other home keys (ETNIOR), almost 9000 words can be formed! Adding the letter D raises this number to almost 14000. Most of the moved letters are still pressed by the same hand, which means users do not need to change which half of their brain sends the signal for each key. For the most part, users need only to learn new movements, and it should help that many keys are pressed with the same fingers.
    Most typists make numerous mistakes. The long distance to the standard backspace is detrimental, so Caps Lock should be replaced by backspace. Old habits die hard, so the standard backspace can remain in place for the time being. Caps Lock could be removed entirely or it could replace something else such as the right Windows key or the Scroll Lock key.
    Many people have a strong muscle memory for Cut/Copy/Paste (Ctrl+X/C/V) and for some people, Undo (Ctrl+Z) and other keystrokes such as Ctrl+W (close window) and Ctrl+S (Save). To respect such habits, Asset keeps WASZXCVB in the same positions.

Problems with Asset:

    It's new.
    It bears no resemblance to the alphabet, so new users cannot leverage their knowledge of the alphabet to learn it.
    I left M and Y (total 3.5%) in place to increase Qwerty similarity. Small issues like the placement of "A" (6.2%) on the pinky are also done for Qwerty similarity.
    As with Qwerty and Dvorak, it is a poor choice for one-finger typing on a Palm, a PocketPC or a Tablet PC. I have addressed this problem on the Palm with specific layouts for MilliKeys.
    It is not designed for non-English languages (though it is not especially bad for other languages). I am not multilingual but here are some thoughts:
        In French, H is rare and X is relatively common, so it may be good to swap those.
        In German, L is more common than O so it would be wise to swap them, which improves Qwertz similarity. However, the difference may be too small to justify. Y is very rare so it may be preferable to swap it with Z. German also needs a ß key.
    Round brackets are generally more common than square brackets. This leads to the suggestion of swapping the round and square brackets, so that the user need not hold Shift to get round ones. Asset does not include this because some methods of keyboard reprogramming cannot move "(" and ")" without also moving "9" and "0".
    Though better than Qwerty, Asset requires more same-finger digraphs and "same hand row jumping" than Colemak and probably Dvorak. There is a trade-off between Qwerty similarity and optimality, and I've chosen more Qwerty similarity with some expense of efficiency. Asset has 12 letters matching Qwerty, whereas Colemak has only 10. Interestingly, Colemak and Qwerty have the same bottom row.

I am using myself as a guinea pig. I will say how the trial has worked out when there's more to report.
Try it
I've made a Demo page where you can try two versions of the Asset layout.
Install it
You can install Asset on Windows XP and Windows 2000.

The original design isn't nearly as good as it could have been. Here it is if you are curious: Original design
Patent?
I don't believe patents should be granted for easy or simple inventions such as this one, nor the tens of thousands of others that are patented every year. Asset is not patented, so it may be used freely by anyone.
Additional thoughts

    The shape of the keyboard

    As I've said, the bottom row of the standard keyboard is misaligned. When your fingers are on home row and you move them down, they end up between the keys below, which makes it unnecessarily difficult to press keys on the bottom row, especially (in Qwerty) Z, X, C, comma, period and slash. I believe these keys should be moved left by about 1/4 the width of a key.

    I also find that while pressing those six keys, I need to use my fingernails to apply pressure. This is especially true on my small laptop, where there is not enough room to stretch out my hands enough to avoid using my fingernails. I'm sure the ergonomics people have looked at this, but for some reason an improved shape for the keys, that will allow the base of the finger to apply the pressure, has not generally been introduced.

    I hear that there were several keyboards in the 70's and 80's that had the Control and Caps Lock keys swapped from where they are now. At this point I am so accustomed to the status quo that I would resent going back. However, Caps Lock is easier to press from home row, so it is a shame it was wasted on the Caps Lock function which decent people almost never use.

    I wish the keyboard designers would quick screwing with the extended key region. On the right side you can see the standard extended key block. (Insert, Delete, arrow keys, etc.) This style has been around for at least 20 years, but for some reason many new keyboard designs have a rearranged extended key block. Often they also make it less ergonomic by shrinking the keys. Look, it was fine the way it was. Besides, if you're going to change it, get some industry consensus first--I think I've seen three different layouts besides the standard one. And another thing: there have always been spaces between F4 and F5, and between F8 and F9. Some keyboards now remove that space. Why? It ain't broke, and that is no improvement.

    Hey laptop designers! Quit putting the FN key where the Control key is supposed to be! The FN key is one of the least important keys on the keyboard so it should get out of the way. Hey widescreen laptop designers! A wide laptop should have a wide keyboard! There's room for a full size extended key block in some of these gigantic machines, so go ahead and put it in. Better yet, multiplex a full size extended key block with a numeric keypad. And while you're at it, how about a subwoofer? Yeah...
    Punctuation etc.

    It's unfortunate that the shift key is required for round brackets but not square ones. It should be the other way around. It's also unfortunate that keyboard designers can't agree on where to put the backslash.

    It seems odd that / ? were put on one key instead of say, ! and ?. It also seems strange that ? requires shift while period and slash do not.

    It seems odd that minus does not require Shift but plus does. I think + and = should be swapped.

    The Windows key you see on new keyboards is rather presumptuous, isn't it? It presumes that everyone uses only Windows on their PC and solidifies Windows as the status quo. However, I think the key itself is a good idea. The Windows key is normally reserved for system-level commands, i.e. commands that are independent of the active program. This is useful. I would just like to see the icon changed to something generic. Also, there are so many modifier keys now (9: two Shifts, two Controls, two Alts, two Windows, and one Context Menu), that two Windows keys seems excessive.
    The numeric keypad: shouldn't it be on the left side?

    On a standard keyboard, your right hand has to move more than a foot to get from the main keyboard to the mouse and back. This suggests two things: (1) moving from the mouse to the keyboard or vice versa takes more time than necessary. (2) The position in which you use the mouse or the keyboard is ergonomically unsound. I mean, if your arm has good posture in one position, it is probably less good after it has moved such a long distance.

    By putting the number pad on the left, that distance would be decreased by about 3¼ inches. Plus, in time you could learn to use the pad with your left hand, somewhat relieving the overloaded right hand.

    Extended keys: skilled document editing requires heavy use of the "extended" and modifier keys such as the arrow keys, Delete, Home, End, and Ctrl. I wonder if these could be beneficially rearranged, but I have not really thought about it.

The Capewell-Dvorak Keyboard Layout

I designed my own keyboard layout based on the Dvorak layout.
It is creatively named the Capewell-Dvorak layout.

Introduction
[This page was written before the other pages on keyboard layouts on my site.  Sorry if some of it is a bit redundant!]

While it's not true that the common QWERTY layout keyboard was designed to be slow, it wasn't designed to be particularly fast or comfortable. 

Considering the amount of time I spend at the computer, I decided to look into alternative keyboard layouts to find somethng that, in the long run, would save me time by increasing my typing speed. 

What I found was the Dvorak layout (named after one of its designers).  In short, Dvorak reduces the distance your fingers move by about 45%, making it a much more comfortable layout.  Whether the Dvorak layout allows faster typing hasn't been conclusively etablished, but I wanted to switch anyway, for the novelty.

After using the Dvorak layout for a while, I found that I could not get over some of the flaws in the design and decided that I would try to do better.  Thus began the Capewell-Dvorak keyboard layout.

Links About the QWERTY and Dvorak Layouts
Here are some interesting links about Dvorak and QWERTY:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qwerty  —  be sure to check out the 'External links' at the end
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard  —  again, the 'External links.'
http://www.visi.com/~pmk/evolved.html  —  Peter M. Klausler used a randomized evolution algorithm to generate an efficient keyboard layout.
http://www.acm.vt.edu/%7Ejmaxwell/dvorak/compare.html  —  Neat Java applet by Jon A. Maxwell for comparing Dvorak & QWERTY.  I modified his source code to compare my own layout(s) with QWERTY and Dvorak.
http://www.gigliwood.com/abcd/  —  Basic lessons for learning Dvorak (I recommend using my program instead).

Setting Windows XP to Use Dvorak (Not Nearly As Troublesome As You Might Imagine)
Windows XP supports the Dvorak keyboard layout and can be set up to use it in just a couple minutes.

If you want to play around with Dvorak, there's very little inconvenience if you want to use QWERTY most of the time until you get the hang of Dvorak.  It is very easy to set Windows XP to treat a QWERTY keyboard as a Dvorak keyboard.  It is also extremely simple to switch back and forth between Dvorak and QWERTY during every-day use, and XP will even remember which layout you prefer for each program running, so playing around with Dvorak will not prevent you from being productive or drive you totally insane.  It also won't mess up your key arrangements in games.  Here are instructions for setting Windows XP to use Dvorak.  I don't know how well these instructions work on other versions of Windows.

On Learning to Type (It's All About the Combos)
I learned to type in grade 9.  We had a typing class.  72 minutes per class, 5 days per week, for 2 or 3 months.  About 60 hours total.  And after all those hours, I could only type 15 words per minute!

The only typing programs I've seen teach you simply by teaching you the home row on one hand, then the other, then it moves on to maybe the top left row, etc., teaching you based purely on location, trying to make you memorize each individual key location.  When you see the word BECAUSE, you would simply type each letter individually:  B-E-C-A-U-S-E.  However, when you're a good typist, you type something like BE-C-AU-SE.  You type in combos.  If you want to teach someone to type fast, you need to train them on common combinations of keys.

So I wrote a program to teach typing using my combo theory.

My Program that Teaches Typing
I decided to make my own typing program based on the idea that we type using key combinations.

I started by writing a little Java program to analyze a collection of text to find the most commonly typed key combinations. The text I used was comprised of some articles off the internet, paragraphs from some relatively modern books, and a bunch of instant messaging archive text.

I then made another little program that I could use to get a list of words that contained certain keys and key combinations.

With my list of important words handy, I wrote a Visual Basic 6 program to give lessons and then wrote some lessons for it to give.

Download my typing program.  The lessons were written with Dvorak in mind, but I'm sure you could teach any layout with it.  After all, it just teaches you the most common key combos, not areas of the keyboard.  (If the program does not work, you need to install the Microsoft Visual Basic run-time DLLs)

My Impressions of the Dvorak Layout (The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly)
It's far from perfect.  Some things about it drive me crazy.  A couple sections below, you'll find out what I did to get rid of these problems.
The Dvorak Key Layout

The Good:

    You can type a heck of a lot of words on that home row.  All the vowels and five of the top seven consonants (together making up 10 of the top 12 most commonly occurring english letters) are on the home row.  This reduces finger movements ~45% (good for reducing the risk of carpel tunnel syndrome and just generally making typing more comfortable) and makes it easier for beginners to increase their typing speed quickly since it's easy to remember where the common keys are.
    Because all the vowels are on the left side, letters in words tend to alternate back and forth between hands, maximizng typing speed (QWERTY actually isn't too bad at this, which is why there isn't much of a speed difference between the two layouts).

It's not a long list of good things, but it's just a keyboard layout – there are only so many things you can laud! : P

The Bad:

    We live in a CTRL+C world.  Programs have their shortcut keys hard-wired in as CTRL+C, CTRL+V, etc.  Having all the common keyboard shortcuts moved all around is a huge pain.  Check out C way up there on the top row.  Z and V are also way over on the right side of the keyboard.  Ideally, the Copy, Cut, & Paste shortcut keys C, X, and V should remain near the left Ctrl key so you can use the mouse and shortcuts at the same time.
    The I key is used about 2.5 times more than the U key, so it makes no sense at all giving that valuable index finger real estate away to the U key.
    GH is a fairly common key combination, so it's bad to have these two keys typed by the same finger.
    I find it very hard to reach the F and X positions on keyboards (Y and B on QWERTY).  Less common letters should be placed there.
    Using my pinky finger to reach for the L key gives me sore wrists since it requires me to turn my hand to get my pinky up there.  I try to use my ring finger instead.  Putting a rarer letter (or a punctuation mark) here would be good.

The Ugly:

    For one, it's hard to type one-handed (for instance, when eating... I know what you were thinking!).  The standard Dvorak layout was designed to increase the probability that consecutive keys are typed with alternate hands, and about 55% of letters are typed with the right hand.  That makes one-handed typing tough (especially with the left hand, if you're using the mouse with the right hand)!  Dvorak did, in fact, create keyboard layouts that were easy to use with one hand (either the left or the right).
    When you're talking with people on instant messengers while still learning to type using a new keyboard layout, you look pretty weird when you make typos.  People assuming you're using QWERTY will not understand why you are ending all your sentences with the letter V (which replaces the period) or why you're replacing all your Es with periods.  (Sorry, I couldn't think of any funny typos where a word you meant to type would come out as an entirely different and hilarious word : P)

My Custom Layout (The Capewell-Dvorak Layout)
Due to the problems listed in the The Bad section above, I really could not get used to the Dvorak layout.  I decided to make some changes and develop my own layout (which you can download here).  Both layouts are presented below for easy comparison.

The Dvorak Key Layout

The Capewell-Dvorak Layout

First, here is a list of the frequency of use of letters in English (with punctuation marks inserted based on my own research):
E T A O I N S R H L D C U M F P G W Y B . V , K ' - X " J Q Z ) ? ( ; ! : (source)

Here are the changes I made, along with my reasoning.  This probably won't mean much to you if you're not already familiar with Dvorak.

    I moved ZXCV back to their QWERTY positions so that the shortcut keys associated with them could be used in the QWERTY manner (I also use these frequently with Winamp).  Z, I simply switched with the semi-colon key.  You'll find out what happened to the other displaced keys (Q, J, and K) later.
    I switched I and U.  I is used about 2.5 times as often as U, so it makes little sense giving that valuable index-finger real estate away to the U key.  This reduces finger movement by approximately 8.3%!  That is significant!  I have no idea why Dvorak didn't do this.
    I decided to switch A and O.  You never type AO, but OA is fairly common, so, on the left side of the keyboard, O should be to the left of A since it's easier to type moving from keys on the outside of the keyboard to keys towards the middle of the keyboard.
    As I said before, I find it hard to reach the F and X keys the (Y and B keys on QWERTY), so I decided to place the least common keys in these hard-to-reach spots.  I placed Q in F's position and J in X's position (I needed to leave Z and X in their QWERTY positions).
    I didn't like that G was above the H key (because I use the word 'though' a lot), so I moved G into C's old position and replaced G with F (which was displaced by Q).
    I replaced L with K, the 5th most uncommonly-used key, since reaching for the L key so often in the upper right was hurting my wrist.  L then replaced B.   B moved to the gap left by V (I wanted B here instead of L because I find this position to be awkward to reach).  And that's it!

Putting all these modifications together resuled in a finger movement efficiency gain over Dvorak of about 9.7%. Using the same sample text, comparing Dvorak to QWERTY and Capewell-Dvorak to QWERTY, the efficiency gains are 42.5% for Dvorak and 48.4% for Capewell-Dvorak.  (Finger distances travelled:  QWERTY 1961m; Dvorak 1121m; best evolved layout by Peter M. Klausler 1021m; Capewell-Dvorak: 1012m)

It was never even my intention to reduce finger movements – my goal was simply to make the layout more comfortable to use. I don't believe finger movement distance is the greatest contributor to typing speed, either -- it's how easy it is to type combos.

For finger distances, see the keyboard comparison applet.

What Software I Needed to Make My Layout

    The Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator
    Notepad

Using the Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator (MCKLC) tool is relatively straightforward (if frustrating).

However, there is a limitation with the MSKLC tool that basically makes it useless on its own:  from what I can tell, it does not allow you to change the Virtual Key settings of the keys.  If the virtual keys are not set properly, you can not use CTRL+[key] shortcuts properly (because if you hit CTRL+O when the O key is mapped onto the VK_A virtual key, you will be telling Windows to Select All, not to Open)

To get around this limitation, I used notepad to open the .KLC file that MSKLC creates when you create a layout, and then reloaded the layout in MSKLC and compiled the layout.  I won't go into how to do that here, but if you're interested, send me an email ([mcapewell]-[gmail]-[com]).

Installing the Capewell Layout (Be my Guinea Pig)
Download the Capewell-Dvorak v0.23 installer.

It's at version 0.23, but I think eventually I'll just change the name to version 1.0 because I'm doubtful I'll make any more changes.

Here are the instructions for installing and setting up the Capewell-Dvorak layout (in Windows XP).

If you try out this layout, I'd love to hear your feedback.  You can contact me at [mcapewell]-[gmail]-[com].

Rearranging My Keyboard Keys (Not for the Weak-of-Stomach)
I love my keyboard.  I've had it since I had a Cyrix P166+ (that's something like a Intel Pentium 133 or 150MHz).  It's rather quiet and smooth and comforting.  It's me in keyboard form.  I don't even know who made this keyboard (but this I know about myself) – there's no name on it; it was simply made in China (unlike me) and complies with the appropriote FCC regulations (I'm not sure about me).

So when I decided to learn Dvorak, I balked at the idea of tearing up the keys and rearranging them, since my first cautious efforts to remove the keys were unsuccessful.

Instead, I cut up the sticky parts of three Post-It notes into little slightly-smaller-than-key-sized squares (you should get 14 keys per Post-It), stuck them on the keys, and wrote the new letters on these keys.  You could, if you wanted, write both the Dvorak or Capewell-Dvorak keys and the QWERTY keys on the keys.  This worked pretty well, though sometimes the papers would move around a bit.  TIP:  Round the edges on the squares to prevent accidentally ripping up the papers from the keys.

Speaking of keyboards, whose brilliant idea was it to put a POWER button on a keyboard?  Obviously not someone with a cat.

Eventually, however, I tired of the Post-Its and got down and dirty (VERY. DIRTY.) with my keyboard.  I took off all the keys using two screwdrivers to pop them off (one prevents the key from moving sideways and the other pops it up and off). Make sure you have a vacuum on hand, because it is DISGUSTING what accumulates under your keys over 8 years.  I used the screwdrivers to scrape away the miscellaneous goos, crusts, and hairballs.

My keyboard has slightly differently-shaped keys for each row of keys, so rearranging them makes them all not quite level with some of the neighboring keys.  You get use to this quickly and stop noticing it altogether.

Future Evolution of the Capewell-Dvorak Layout
These are some ideas I've had that I haven't really thought through yet.

    I may try to put R on the home row.
    I may put the /? key back to it's QWERTY position to make learning the layout a little easier.  We use the question mark a lot these days with instant messaging and email.
    I may switch the ;: key with J.

Introduction
The QWERF Layout - Similar to the QWERTY layout, but with improvements
The Capewell-Dvorak Layout - puts ZXCV in their QWERTY positions; fixes some "mistakes" in Dvorak
The (Coming) Capewell Layout - an "evolved" layout

((If you are looking specifically for the evolved layout see the following:

    The Capewell Layout - development and numerical comparison to other layouts
    Keyboard Evolve - a C++ program/framework for evolving keyboard layouts

Note, however, that I've stopped working on keyboard layouts for a while in order to concentrate on some other things.  I do not know when I will get back to these layouts.

Until I find the "holy grail" of keyboard layouts, I recommend using the Capewell-QWERF or Capewell-Dvorak layouts, since they are much more comfortable than the regular versions of these layouts.  I've been using QWERF for ages and like it.))

Introduction
Most people use the QWERTY keyboard layout.  But it's a bit like a fridge with a door that opens up.  This is fine and all on a DeLorean, but we're talking about fridges here.  And keyboard layouts.  Anyway, my point is that it still works, but there are many ways it could work better.

So, I tried to find a better layout, but ended up just making my own.  You can download and install the layouts if you wish.

I also have written a small program that helps to teach the layouts (and I think it works pretty well, since it concentrates on building unconscious habits -- you'll find pretty quickly that your fingers know where the keys are, even if your brain doesn't).  Download my typing tutor program (note: I am in the process of splitting up the lessons so they are not as long and tedious).

I'll be brief here, since on these other pages, I certainly am not (very sorry about that :D  I get carried away).

Here are the layouts:

    Move some of the more common keys to the home row for easier, quicker, less repetitive-strain-injury-inducing access
    Reduces finger movements 28% over regular QWERTY. (for original QWERF -- QWERF 2006/2007 should be about the same)
        Could be reduced by 38% by switching E and D, but this made typing ER and RE uncomfortable.  (for original QWERF -- QWERF 2006 should be about the same)

    After one day, you will be used to it. 
    After one week, you will be nearly back to your original speed. 
    After that, you may be faster or at least simply more comfortable.

I am working on making a layout by writing a computer program that uses an evolutionary algorithm to 'evolve' the best possible layout.  The above layout is the result of my most recent attempt.  I still, however, am working on the 'fitness function' used to drive the evolution.

In short, my goals are to:

    Minimize finger movements. 
        There will likely be a reduction in movement by between 48% and 49% over QWERTY.
    Maximize the use of 'combos,' i.e., multiple keys hit on the same hand with one comfortable movement
        E.g. (from a QWERTY keyboard):  AS, WE, FE, LI, IOU, WER, REA, ON
        This will increase typing speed
    Minimize the use of uncomfortable combos
        E.g.: DR, DT, CF, CS (assuming you use the middle finger for C)
        This will reduce repetitive strain injuries
    Keep the ZXCV keys in the lower left so that it is still easy to type CTRL+Z/X/C/V to undo/cut/copy/paste
    If a key in one of the centre columns is used, have the keys typed before and after the key be typed by the other hand
        E.g.: THE
    Minimize use of certain positions on the keyboard
        Those occupied on the QWERTY layout by Q, Z, P, forward-slash, J, B, X, period

Layouts for typewriters were numerous and varied before the introduction of QWERTY on Remington & Sons typewriters in 1874. The introduction of new technologies that remove some of the limitations of early typewriters as well as the introduction of electronic keyboards came with the ability to make new key layouts.

DHIATENSOR, also known as the Blickensderfer Scientific Key-Board layout by its creator was the primary keyboard layout available for the Blickensderfer typewriter.

The layout had been based on a study of the English language that had showed that 70% written text and about 85% of all words used the letters D,H,I,A,T,E,N,S,O and R. Those were put on the keyboard's home row.

On the original typewriters, the home row is actually on the bottom, but it is moved up one step to the home row position on a standard keyboard.

Dvorak was created by Dr. August Dvorak in the early 1930's as an alternative to the QWERTY layout. Data was gathered in the form of closeup films of a typist fingers to create a primitive heat-map of key use and hand position.

    The most common letters were roughly placed in the rows typists were thought to like best: home-row, top-row and last bottom-row.
    Hand-alternation: To avoid occasional long strings of one-handed-operation, emphasis was placed on hand-alternation. All vowels were moved to the left side of the keyboard, and onto the home-row, including the rare U.
    The right-hand is favored and receives 14% more usage than the lefty, which is 33% more than QWERTY because it favors the left hand with a similar percentage.

Criticisms of the Dvorak design:

    Extreme dissimilarity from QWERTY. System and application hotkeys that are designed around QWERTY will need to be relearned or remapped
    Hand-alternation. Poor single handed typing speed
    Poor placement of common letters. L is a case-example of this

Evolved was released around 2002 on Peter Klausler's own website. During his use of Dvorak he wondered how a better modern layout could be created with the aid of computers. A metric of "work" needed when touch typing with each layout was developed. The factors of what constituted work were as follows:

    All 8 fingers start on the home row.
    An index finger stretch to the center costs 1 unit.
    Fingers of the same hand can't be on both the top and bottom row. When a top-row or bottom-row key is to be hit, each finger on the bottom or top row (respectively) moves to the home row, and that costs 1 unit each.
    After that, if a finger has to move up or down to hit the key, it costs 1 unit. An additional unit is charged to move to the bottom row (except for the index finger in its natural column) or to move an index finger to the top row in its unnatural center column. Furthermore, moving a pinky up or down costs an additional unit. I have weak pinkies.
    Hitting two distinct keys in succession with the same finger is really bad; 3 more units are charged.
    An extra unit is assessed when nonadjacent fingers of the same hand are used in succession and they are not both on the home row.
    But adjacent fingers are charged a unit to hit keys on distinct rows, and one more if there's adjacent movement between the top and bottom rows.
    When a shift key is used, the fingers of the shifting hand move to the home row for free afterwards.

These rules were applied to a corpus of 20mb of English text from books, the bodies of all the authors emails, and about 100k lines of C code. This was to best reflect the authors typing habits. Along with the text samples there was the layouts which were generated programmatically. Additional considerations were added to the layout generation program for alternating hands and adjacent key hits (rolling) after real world testing. Klausler ended up switching back to Dvorak layout. [2]

Programmer Dvorak was released by Roland Kaufmann in about 2003 to his own website. The stated goal of the layout is to eliminate RSI in the way Dvorak does for copy typist with optimizations for programmers. Symbol placement in Dvorak is seen as just as bad as QWERTY to writing source code in C, C#, Java, Pascal, Lisp, CSS, XML and alikes. Thus the changes to symbol placement is meant to reduce the distance to commonly used symbols in the most common programming languages of the time. This leads to number being scrambled, though in a meaningful way. The numbers hit by the left hand are odd and in descending order starting with 7 and wrapping back around to 9. The numbers hit by the right hand are ascending even numbers starting with zero. Symbols that are regularly under the number row are on the unshifted/lower case layer while the numbers are on the shifted/upper case layer. This is because symbols are more common in source code then numbers as having pre-defined numbers in source code is an anti-pattern. For languages other then English a "Compose Key" is used to create accented characters.[4]

Capewell-Dvorak is a modified version of Dvorak created in 2004 by Michael Capewell. The layout came about through issues Michael found with Dvorak and how he tried to reconcile them. The perceived issues are as follows:

    Common shortcuts such as Ctrl+C are difficult to reach
    The "I" key is much more common then the "U" key which is not accounted for
    "GH" is a common digraph which are on the same finger
    "F" and "X", "Y" and "B" on QWERTY, are more difficult to hit then accounted for
    Hitting the upper row with the pinky finger, specifically for the "L" key, is more difficult then accounted for

The Capewell Layout was created in 2005 by Michael Capewell and released to his own site as a work in progress. Inspiration for creating the layout was drawn from Peter M. Klausler's Evolve layout generation program. Thus the layout is generated through a script along with some restrictions on how the key layout can be changed. Goals of the layout are as follows:

    Significant reduction in movement over QWERTY (IE: 48% or 49%)
    Maximize trigrams and bigrams on the same hand but different finger (IE: AS, WE, REA)
    Minimize unconformable combos that exist on QWERTY (IE: DR, DT, CF, CS)
    Keep ZXCF in the lower left to maintain system shortcuts
    If a key in one of the center columns is used, have the keys typed before and after the key be typed by the other hand
    Minimize use of certain positions on the keyboard (On QWERTY: Q, Z, P, /, J, B, X, .)

Colemak is an alternative keyboard created by Shai Coleman, named as a portmanteau of Dvorak and Coleman. Its design goals consist of easy transition from QWERTY due to repositioning only 17 letter keys. Additionally the AZXCV shortcuts are in the same location perhaps allowing an easier time switching from QWERTY.

It also claims greater efficiency than Dvorak. Furthermore it places complete emphasis on the home-row: the ten most-common characters in English are on the ten home-row keys.

Colemak DH is a modified version of the Colemak layout which moves the D and H keys from the central column to improved locations under the index-finger home position. This allows for a more comfortable and symmetrical hand position. Like in the Workman layout, the central column keys are deprioritized. However as no keys change fingers from standard Colemak, this is achieved without adversely affecting Colemak's impressive stats on same-finger bigrams.
Carpalx Family

The Carpalx project was created around 2005-06 by Martin Krzywinski as a project to find the best keyboard layout to minimize typing effort. This was to be achieved through measuring then optimizing the following in respect to QWERTY:

    Hand-alternation or hand-balancing
    Same-finger typing reduction
    Finger flow such as rolling
    Stronger typing finger use and index finger/pinky finger reduction
    Difficult stroke path limiting (IE upward row progressions such as "nse")

Many layouts were measured through these methods and optimized derivatives were made off these existing layouts. Completely optimized layouts generated by the computer not using existing layouts as a reference were also created. The original primary focus of this project is for English language optimization but other languages, such as Dutch[5], were measured and optimized in recent years.[6]

Workman was created in 2010 in a blog post by OJ Bucao. It is designed around the use of a non-staggered layout or ortho-linear layout but works just fine on standard staggered layout keyboards. The main design goal is to keep the fingers to their main 4 columns per hand and de-prioritizing columns in the middle and sides. This minimizes diagonal and lateral movement.

3l was created in 2015 by Jack Rosenthal, inspired by the symbols layers of Neo, but with letter arrangement optimized for English. As a result, it requires significantly less finger movement than many other common layouts. Additionally, "typing distance is not the only factor that 3l optimizes for. 3l helps increase hand alternation, reduce bottom-to-top row jumps, decrease lateral motion, and also strives to be easy to learn".

Arensito was released in 2001 by Håkon Hallingstad and is also known as the Hallingstad layout. It was originally made to suit the Kinesis Contoured and two-handed Maltron, though an adaptation for usage on standard keyboard was developed later. The named comes from its home-row as apposed to QWERTY which named from its top row. The design intentions are as follows:

    Places the eight most used characters under your fingertips
    Is the layout that minimizes the probability that you use the same finger twice (in succession)
    Is the layout that maximizes the probability for using neighbor fingers in succession (and keeps the probability of sequences like y-d or z-l diminishingly low). This lets the fingers strike diagraphs and trigraphs extremely fast
    Keep the workload off the pinkies. Both pinkies press a button about 40% less than the other fingers

Some punctuation and programming symbols are placed under the AltGr layer, where they are closer to the fingers' home position.

Neo was released in 2004 and open sourced to allow multiple users to contribute to. It was developed with the experiences of other ergonomic layouts like Dvorak in mind. It is mainly targeted at German users, but supports nearly all characters of Latin-based alphabets, as well as the Vietnamese and some African alphabets. It consists of six layers, available by combinations of multiple modifier keys. Using these layers there are special characters available which are not easily available in QWERTY-based layouts, like mathematical symbols and Greek letters. The layers are as follows:
Layer 	Usage
1 	Lowercase characters
2 	Uppercase characters, typographical characters
3 	Special characters, especially for programming, etc.
4 	Navigation keys, Numberblock, etc.

AdNW is a Dvorak-like layout which appeared around 2012 for the German and English languages.
History

AdNW is a layout that emerged from online discussions about Neo, a layout that was made for the German language. The discussion focused on whether Neo layout which was new at the time was an improvement over Dvorak for German and English typist. AdNW was created in response to this converation, from the idea that a layout could be made that was better then Dvorak or Neo for typist who write in both German and English. To do this, Dvorak's usability criteria were coded in a newly programmed layout optimizer. Since the group formed itself during the Neo discussions, they called their layout "From the Neo World", which in German is Aus der Neo-Welt, abbreviated to AdNW.
Philosophy and Performance

AdNW is based on roughly the same ideas as "Dvorak" keyboard. Being in the Dvorak tradition, the following aspects are important:

    Same finger use (low)
    Adjacent finger use(*)(low)
    Inward motions versus Outward motions (high)
    Home row use (high)
    Row jumps (low)
    Finger balance (less on pinkies, more on middle and index)

(*)On QWERTY AS and SD which are right next together is a negative mark against the layout. The AD and SF positions are seen as better. The idea is that adjacent fingers, especially the pinky and ring finger are not completely independent. Making "rolls" with adjacent finger less pleasant and therefore to be avoided. "Rolls" on index and middle finger (e.g. ER on QWERTY) are less problematic and get a lower penalty for that reason.

As a result of these criteria, the AdNW layouts also have a balanced Left/Right distribution (roughly 50% of effort on each hand, compared to QWERTY that puts most work on the right hand) and a high hand alternation. Alternation means that common letter combinations like ER or IN are not typed on one hand (like in QWERTY) but on two hands. In AdNW, E and I are on the left side, R and N on the right.

To make the differences between QWERTZ and AdNW clear, they are compared both visually and statistically. The graphs and data are produced by the AdNW optimizer. In the graphs, the letter 'flow' is shown. The more common a digraph is (e.g. ER), the fatter the line that is drawn between these two letters.
AdNW and QWERTZ compared.

Looking at the graphs, one sees that QWERTY uses the left hand a lot, especially the top row. Some of the most frequent bigrams are on the left top row (WE, ER, ET, RT). On the right hand the frequent IN bigram includes an home row jump, which is seen as highly unwanted. Compared to QWERTY, AdNW is more balanced, has more home row use, and much less one handed bigrams. Frequent bigrams (like WE, ER and so on) are not typed with one hand, but alternate between hands.

Even though AdNW was optimized for 50/50 English/German, it performs quite well for English solely. Comparison Below:
AdNW and QWERTY compared.

Compared to QWERTY:

    AdNW is more balanced left/right (52.7 versus 59.0)
    AdNW is more home row oriented (72% typed on homerow, versus 32.6% in QWERTZ)
    AdNW is more balanced over fingers (less use of right hand index and middle finger; more of other fingers)
    AdNW has more hand alternation (70.8% versus 52.2%)
    AdNW has less adjacent finger bigrams
    AdNW has less same finger use
    AdNW has higher home row usage

Variations

From its inception AdNW has had several variations apart from the standard community release version. The other versions place slightly different weight to Dvorak's criteria (e.g. even lower adjacent finger use, at the expense of other criteria). Some of these variations are designed for different keyboards (matrix/orthogonal layouts, Ergodox, TEK etc.) or for other languages. A user can also calculate a custom layout.

Reasons for calculating a custom layout include:

    Non-standard physical keyboard, for instance a Planck, a Space Cadet, a modded Ergodox or a DIY split keyboard
    Different preferences regarding finger use, alternation, and so on. Users may sacrifice performance on one aspect (e.g. alternation) in order to gain better performance on others (e.g. lower same finger use).
    Physical differences between users
    Input language. Users may not type 50/50 English-German prose, but for instance 30% French scientific prose and 70% Python code.

All this can be combined: a user may calculate an optimal layout for "30% English prose, 40% Swedish forum use, 30% Polish, for Maltron keyboard, that avoids using the pinkies and that prefers the bottom row over the top row". Because of this freedom, there is not one single AdNW layout.

Some other examples of AdNW layouts are:

Community and Use

Software: AdNW consists of a layout and several software implementations:

    Drivers & scripts for using the layout on Windows, Linux, OSX and *BSD; with versions for standard keyboards and for ergonomic keyboards (Ergodox, Maltron and others). This includes AutoHotKey files for Windows.
    Typing training software
    The Optimizer: an algorithm (written in C++11 and open sourced) for calculating a custom AdNW-layout.

Userbase: AdNW is not a massively adopted layout. The (German language) Google user group has around 100 participants, mostly from Germany. The AdNW website is in German as well. However, the manual of the optimizer is in English, and participants on the discussion group say they are very open to questions in English.

Support: The developers of the software are active on the discussion forum and answer support questions.

Development: AdNW has been iterated upon by many in its community. Usually these changes are trade-offs between the specific use-case the layout is being optimized for. The developers claim that there is not much room for further overall improvement, but invite users to prove them wrong and to come up with new ideas.

Layouts for typewriters were numerous and varied before the introduction of QWERTY on Remington & Sons typewriters in 1874. The introduction of new technologies that remove some of the limitations of early typewriters as well as the introduction of electronic keyboards came with the ability to make new key layouts.

Main article: DHIATENSOR

DHIATENSOR, also known as the Blickensderfer Scientific Key-Board layout by its creator was the primary keyboard layout available for the Blickensderfer typewriter.

The layout had been based on a study of the English language that had showed that 70% written text and about 85% of all words used the letters D,H,I,A,T,E,N,S,O and R. Those were put on the keyboard's home row.

On the original typewriters, the home row is actually on the bottom, but it is moved up one step to the home row position on a standard keyboard.

Dvorak was created by Dr. August Dvorak in the early 1930's as an alternative to the QWERTY layout. Data was gathered in the form of closeup films of a typist fingers to create a primitive heat-map of key use and hand position.

    The most common letters were roughly placed in the rows typists were thought to like best: home-row, top-row and last bottom-row.
    Hand-alternation: To avoid occasional long strings of one-handed-operation, emphasis was placed on hand-alternation. All vowels were moved to the left side of the keyboard, and onto the home-row, including the rare U.
    The right-hand is favored and receives 14% more usage than the lefty, which is 33% more than QWERTY because it favors the left hand with a similar percentage.

Criticisms of the Dvorak design:

    Extreme dissimilarity from QWERTY. System and application hotkeys that are designed around QWERTY will need to be relearned or remapped
    Hand-alternation. Poor single handed typing speed
    Poor placement of common letters. L is a case-example of this

Evolved was released around 2002 on Peter Klausler's own website. During his use of Dvorak he wondered how a better modern layout could be created with the aid of computers. A metric of "work" needed when touch typing with each layout was developed. The factors of what constituted work were as follows:

    All 8 fingers start on the home row.
    An index finger stretch to the center costs 1 unit.
    Fingers of the same hand can't be on both the top and bottom row. When a top-row or bottom-row key is to be hit, each finger on the bottom or top row (respectively) moves to the home row, and that costs 1 unit each.
    After that, if a finger has to move up or down to hit the key, it costs 1 unit. An additional unit is charged to move to the bottom row (except for the index finger in its natural column) or to move an index finger to the top row in its unnatural center column. Furthermore, moving a pinky up or down costs an additional unit. I have weak pinkies.
    Hitting two distinct keys in succession with the same finger is really bad; 3 more units are charged.
    An extra unit is assessed when nonadjacent fingers of the same hand are used in succession and they are not both on the home row.
    But adjacent fingers are charged a unit to hit keys on distinct rows, and one more if there's adjacent movement between the top and bottom rows.
    When a shift key is used, the fingers of the shifting hand move to the home row for free afterwards.

These rules were applied to a corpus of 20mb of English text from books, the bodies of all the authors emails, and about 100k lines of C code. This was to best reflect the authors typing habits. Along with the text samples there was the layouts which were generated programmatically. Additional considerations were added to the layout generation program for alternating hands and adjacent key hits (rolling) after real world testing. Klausler ended up switching back to Dvorak layout. [2]

Programmer Dvorak was released by Roland Kaufmann in about 2003 to his own website. The stated goal of the layout is to eliminate RSI in the way Dvorak does for copy typist with optimizations for programmers. Symbol placement in Dvorak is seen as just as bad as QWERTY to writing source code in C, C#, Java, Pascal, Lisp, CSS, XML and alikes. Thus the changes to symbol placement is meant to reduce the distance to commonly used symbols in the most common programming languages of the time. This leads to number being scrambled, though in a meaningful way. The numbers hit by the left hand are odd and in descending order starting with 7 and wrapping back around to 9. The numbers hit by the right hand are ascending even numbers starting with zero. Symbols that are regularly under the number row are on the unshifted/lower case layer while the numbers are on the shifted/upper case layer. This is because symbols are more common in source code then numbers as having pre-defined numbers in source code is an anti-pattern. For languages other then English a "Compose Key" is used to create accented characters.[4]

Capewell-Dvorak is a modified version of Dvorak created in 2004 by Michael Capewell. The layout came about through issues Michael found with Dvorak and how he tried to reconcile them. The perceived issues are as follows:

    Common shortcuts such as Ctrl+C are difficult to reach
    The "I" key is much more common then the "U" key which is not accounted for
    "GH" is a common digraph which are on the same finger
    "F" and "X", "Y" and "B" on QWERTY, are more difficult to hit then accounted for
    Hitting the upper row with the pinky finger, specifically for the "L" key, is more difficult then accounted for

The Capewell Layout was created in 2005 by Michael Capewell and released to his own site as a work in progress. Inspiration for creating the layout was drawn from Peter M. Klausler's Evolve layout generation program. Thus the layout is generated through a script along with some restrictions on how the key layout can be changed. Goals of the layout are as follows:

QWERF was released in 2006 by Michael Capewell on his own site. It is a modification on QWERTY thus should be easy for users to learn. More common keys were moved to the home row for a finger movement reduction of 28% over QWERTY. The author claims that within one week a user of his layout could be back at their original typing speed.

Colemak is an alternative keyboard created by Shai Coleman, named as a portmanteau of Dvorak and Coleman. Its design goals consist of easy transition from QWERTY due to repositioning only 17 letter keys. Additionally the AZXCV shortcuts are in the same location perhaps allowing an easier time switching from QWERTY.

It also claims greater efficiency than Dvorak. Furthermore it places complete emphasis on the home-row: the ten most-common characters in English are on the ten home-row keys.

Colemak DH is a modified version of the Colemak layout which moves the D and H keys from the central column to improved locations under the index-finger home position. This allows for a more comfortable and symmetrical hand position. Like in the Workman layout, the central column keys are deprioritized. However as no keys change fingers from standard Colemak, this is achieved without adversely affecting Colemak's impressive stats on same-finger bigrams.
Carpalx Family

The Carpalx project was created around 2005-06 by Martin Krzywinski as a project to find the best keyboard layout to minimize typing effort. This was to be achieved through measuring then optimizing the following in respect to QWERTY:

    Hand-alternation or hand-balancing
    Same-finger typing reduction
    Finger flow such as rolling
    Stronger typing finger use and index finger/pinky finger reduction
    Difficult stroke path limiting (IE upward row progressions such as "nse")

Many layouts were measured through these methods and optimized derivatives were made off these existing layouts. Completely optimized layouts generated by the computer not using existing layouts as a reference were also created. The original primary focus of this project is for English language optimization but other languages, such as Dutch[5], were measured and optimized in recent years.[6]

Workman was created in 2010 in a blog post by OJ Bucao. It is designed around the use of a non-staggered layout or ortho-linear layout but works just fine on standard staggered layout keyboards. The main design goal is to keep the fingers to their main 4 columns per hand and de-prioritizing columns in the middle and sides. This minimizes diagonal and lateral movement.

3l was created in 2015 by Jack Rosenthal, inspired by the symbols layers of Neo, but with letter arrangement optimized for English. As a result, it requires significantly less finger movement than many other common layouts. Additionally, "typing distance is not the only factor that 3l optimizes for. 3l helps increase hand alternation, reduce bottom-to-top row jumps, decrease lateral motion, and also strives to be easy to learn".

Arensito was released in 2001 by Håkon Hallingstad and is also known as the Hallingstad layout. It was originally made to suit the Kinesis Contoured and two-handed Maltron, though an adaptation for usage on standard keyboard was developed later. The named comes from its home-row as apposed to QWERTY which named from its top row. The design intentions are as follows:

    Places the eight most used characters under your fingertips
    Is the layout that minimizes the probability that you use the same finger twice (in succession)
    Is the layout that maximizes the probability for using neighbor fingers in succession (and keeps the probability of sequences like y-d or z-l diminishingly low). This lets the fingers strike diagraphs and trigraphs extremely fast
    Keep the workload off the pinkies. Both pinkies press a button about 40% less than the other fingers

Some punctuation and programming symbols are placed under the AltGr layer, where they are closer to the fingers' home position.

It is mainly targeted at German users, but supports nearly all characters of Latin-based alphabets, as well as the Vietnamese and some African alphabets. It consists of six layers, available by combinations of multiple modifier keys. Using these layers there are special characters available which are not easily available in QWERTY-based layouts, like mathematical symbols and Greek letters. The layers are as follows:

AdNW is a Dvorak-like layout which appeared around 2012 for the German and English languages.
History

AdNW is a layout that emerged from online discussions about Neo, a layout that was made for the German language. The discussion focused on whether Neo layout which was new at the time was an improvement over Dvorak for German and English typist. AdNW was created in response to this converation, from the idea that a layout could be made that was better then Dvorak or Neo for typist who write in both German and English. To do this, Dvorak's usability criteria were coded in a newly programmed layout optimizer. Since the group formed itself during the Neo discussions, they called their layout "From the Neo World", which in German is Aus der Neo-Welt, abbreviated to AdNW.
Philosophy and Performance

AdNW is based on roughly the same ideas as "Dvorak" keyboard. Being in the Dvorak tradition, the following aspects are important:

    Same finger use (low)
    Adjacent finger use(*)(low)
    Inward motions versus Outward motions (high)
    Home row use (high)
    Row jumps (low)
    Finger balance (less on pinkies, more on middle and index)

(*)On QWERTY AS and SD which are right next together is a negative mark against the layout. The AD and SF positions are seen as better. The idea is that adjacent fingers, especially the pinky and ring finger are not completely independent. Making "rolls" with adjacent finger less pleasant and therefore to be avoided. "Rolls" on index and middle finger (e.g. ER on QWERTY) are less problematic and get a lower penalty for that reason.

As a result of these criteria, the AdNW layouts also have a balanced Left/Right distribution (roughly 50% of effort on each hand, compared to QWERTY that puts most work on the right hand) and a high hand alternation. Alternation means that common letter combinations like ER or IN are not typed on one hand (like in QWERTY) but on two hands. In AdNW, E and I are on the left side, R and N on the right.

To make the differences between QWERTZ and AdNW clear, they are compared both visually and statistically. The graphs and data are produced by the AdNW optimizer. In the graphs, the letter 'flow' is shown. The more common a digraph is (e.g. ER), the fatter the line that is drawn between these two letters.
AdNW and QWERTZ compared.

Looking at the graphs, one sees that QWERTY uses the left hand a lot, especially the top row. Some of the most frequent bigrams are on the left top row (WE, ER, ET, RT). On the right hand the frequent IN bigram includes an home row jump, which is seen as highly unwanted. Compared to QWERTY, AdNW is more balanced, has more home row use, and much less one handed bigrams. Frequent bigrams (like WE, ER and so on) are not typed with one hand, but alternate between hands.

Even though AdNW was optimized for 50/50 English/German, it performs quite well for English solely. Comparison Below:
AdNW and QWERTY compared.

Compared to QWERTY:

    AdNW is more balanced left/right (52.7 versus 59.0)
    AdNW is more home row oriented (72% typed on homerow, versus 32.6% in QWERTZ)
    AdNW is more balanced over fingers (less use of right hand index and middle finger; more of other fingers)
    AdNW has more hand alternation (70.8% versus 52.2%)
    AdNW has less adjacent finger bigrams
    AdNW has less same finger use
    AdNW has higher home row usage

Variations

From its inception AdNW has had several variations apart from the standard community release version. The other versions place slightly different weight to Dvorak's criteria (e.g. even lower adjacent finger use, at the expense of other criteria). Some of these variations are designed for different keyboards (matrix/orthogonal layouts, Ergodox, TEK etc.) or for other languages. A user can also calculate a custom layout.

Reasons for calculating a custom layout include:

    Non-standard physical keyboard, for instance a Planck, a Space Cadet, a modded Ergodox or a DIY split keyboard
    Different preferences regarding finger use, alternation, and so on. Users may sacrifice performance on one aspect (e.g. alternation) in order to gain better performance on others (e.g. lower same finger use).
    Physical differences between users
    Input language. Users may not type 50/50 English-German prose, but for instance 30% French scientific prose and 70% Python code.

All this can be combined: a user may calculate an optimal layout for "30% English prose, 40% Swedish forum use, 30% Polish, for Maltron keyboard, that avoids using the pinkies and that prefers the bottom row over the top row". Because of this freedom, there is not one single AdNW layout.

Some other examples of AdNW layouts are:

Community and Use

Software: AdNW consists of a layout and several software implementations:

    Drivers & scripts for using the layout on Windows, Linux, OSX and *BSD; with versions for standard keyboards and for ergonomic keyboards (Ergodox, Maltron and others). This includes AutoHotKey files for Windows.
    Typing training software
    The Optimizer: an algorithm (written in C++11 and open sourced) for calculating a custom AdNW-layout.

Userbase: AdNW is not a massively adopted layout. The (German language) Google user group has around 100 participants, mostly from Germany. The AdNW website is in German as well. However, the manual of the optimizer is in English, and participants on the discussion group say they are very open to questions in English.

Support: The developers of the software are active on the discussion forum and answer support questions.

Development: AdNW has been iterated upon by many in its community. Usually these changes are trade-offs between the specific use-case the layout is being optimized for. The developers claim that there is not much room for further overall improvement, but invite users to prove them wrong and to come up with new ideas.

Alternative Keyboard Layouts
-
Featuring, the Capewell layout!
[Draft 2 (v0.9.3)]

I didn't like the QWERTY or Dvorak keyboard layouts, so I made my own

[ back | home ]

NOTE:  This page is out of date.  The Capewell layout has not been finalized and has been undergoing changes lately.  I have not yet updated the scoring for the new version, so the comparisons with other layouts are no longer accurate.  The C-QWERTY layout is not recommended -- QWERF is better.

Introduction
When the typewriter was first invented, I doubt anyone realized how prevalent keyboard use would one day become and that there would be people who could type over 100 words per minute.

The now-ubiquitous QWERTY layout has been king since about 1888 when Frank McGurrin, apparently the first touch-typist, won a typing competition using a Remington QWERTY keyboard.

Since then, it seems that the only major effort to design a better layout was by Drs. August Dvorak and William Dealey, who received a patent for the Dvorak Simplified Layout in 1936.  A Google search for 'Dvorak keyboard' (June 2005) returns over 200 000 results and climbing (+1000 results in the last 5 hours, I kid you not)  -- so there are definately people using it out there.  I'd been using it on-and-off over 2004 and the first half of 2005.

(Update, September 2005:  Google now returns 740 000 results!)

I've come across two other interesting layouts recently:

    Peter M. Klausler wrote a computer program in 2002 to evolve an efficient keyboard (but ended up sticking with Dvorak)
    Håkon Hallingstad developed the Arensito layout in 2000 using "trial and error and exclusion principles" [based on statistics].

The purpose of this page is to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the above layouts and to introduce the 4 (maybe 5.. or 6) layouts I have developed:

    Capewell-Dvorak
        An altered version of the Dvorak layout eliminating some of the things that drove me crazy about the Dvorak layout.
        One of its features is that ZXCV are in their QWERTY positions so that it is easy to use CTRL+Z/X/C/V
        Henceforth refered to as C-Dvorak.
        I used this layout for a couple months but found that, despite it's advantages over Dvorak, I still wasn't as fast as my QWERTY speed.  This fact led to:
    Capewell-QWERTY 1/2
        A slightly-altered version of the QWERTY layout that is very easy to learn for a QWERTY-user.  (There are only 5 simple changes to remember/get used to).
        Henceforth refered to as C-QWERTY 1/2.
    Capewell-QWERTY
        A more significant departure from the QWERTY layout, but preserving many of the basics, keeping it easy to learn for a QWERTY-user, but giving many benefits.  This page was written using this layout.
        Henceforth refered to as C-QWERTY
    The Capewell Layout
        This layout hasn't been finalized yet, but it's getting close!  (And the current version is available for installation)  It is an evolved layout taking into account what I learned from QWERTY, Dvorak, C-Dvorak, P. Klausler's evolved layout, and Arensito.  I'm still tweaking the fitness function, but it's been giving me some decent layouts lately...  It will look a bit like Arensito and will have ZXCV in or near their QWERTY positions (probably XVZC or XCZV).

Yes I named them all after me... Very creative : P.

I have created packages for installing my layouts onto Windows computers.

I'll give a brief overview of the layouts, followed by a quantitative comparison of all the layouts.

In short, if you use Dvorak, I'd recommend switching to C-Dvorak, if you use QWERTY, I'd recommend switching to C-QWERTY, and if you want the most efficient layout possible, then you should look at Capewell or Arensito.

C. Sholes' QWERTY layout (1873)

QWERT YUIOP 
ASDFG HJKL;'
ZXCVB NM'./ 

The QWERTY layout 'everyone' uses was designed by one of the inventors of the typewriter, Chistopher Sholes, somewhere between 1868 and 1876, depending on the source (1873 is the one that seems correct to me).

While it's not true that the QWERTY layout keyboard was designed to be slow (as I have often heard), it wasn't designed to be particularly fast or comfortable.  There seem to be four thoughts that went into designing the QWERTY layout:

    Separating frequently-used pairs of keys to prevent mechanical typewriters from jamming
    Allowing TYPEWRITER to be written using the top row, for ease of demonstration (this is probably just speculation).  Alternately, I think many of the keys on the top row were placed there just because it was easier to see keys on the top row.  Almost 50% of keys typed are on the top row.
    Preserving somewhat an alphabetical layout to make it easier to learn (home row: AsDFGHJKL)
    Putting infrequently-used keys in the corners

I don't think the design took into account that people would eventually be able to touch-type at over 100 words per minute (8 keys per second)!

For more info:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qwerty

For the rest of this discussion, I follow P.M. Klausler in dropping the / character and replacing it with ' to create a 3x10 character layout.

The Dvorak Layout (1936)

',.PY FGCRL
AOEUI DHTNS
;QJKX BMWVZ

Dvorak had some pretty sensible ideas that went into the design of his layout:

    It is easier to type letters alternating between hands (so the vowels are all on the left hand and the most common consonants, on the right hand).
    The most common letters and digraphs should be on the home row, which is where the fingers rest.
    Likewise, the least common letters should be on the bottom row, which is the hardest row to reach.
    The right hand should do more of the typing, because most people are right-handed.
    It is more difficult to type digraphs with adjacent fingers than non-adjacent fingers.
    Stroking should generally move from the edges of the board to the middle.
    (taken from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard)

Unfortunately, I think Dvorak was wrong on some points and had some points obsoleted by the invention of the mouse.

    One point that I think Dvorak was wrong on was that it is not easier to type letters alternating between hands (H. Hallingstad [the Arensito layout creator] also disagrees with Dvorak on this point).  Try typing 'ANTISOCIAL' and 'POSTMUSCULAR' on a QWERTY keyboard.  (This demonstration would work better if M weren't on the bottom row while U is on the top row!).  This was my main reason for giving up on the Dvorak and C-Dvorak layouts:  I could not match my QWERTY speed when I kept having to switch hands.  I think, optimally, you should switch hands after every second key-stroke.
    These days, since we use a mouse, alternating hands can make typing with one hand extremely slow since the one hand must move so much.  The mouse also makes having the right hand type more than the left hand troublesome.
    It is generally no more difficult to type digraphs (common letter combinations like TH) with adjacent fingers than with non-adjacent fingers.  I only find this is difficult if the fingers are the pinky and ring finger.

For more info:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard

I also found that Dvorak made some odd desicions, like putting U under the left index finger and making you have to reach with that finger to get to the I key -- the I key is used 2.5 times as often as the U key, so this makes no sense.  He also had some fairly common keys in the places on the keyboard I find most difficut to reach.

    Installation instructions

To learn about these layouts, see the Capewell-Dvorak page.  There are also Windows installers for the layouts.

This is a modification of the Dvorak layout that I find is much easier to use.  You'll see later on this page that it also reduces the movement of your fingers by about 10% over ordinary Dvorak (even though my intention was merely to make it more comfortable).  I used it for about 2 months and found it pretty comfortable, but I found that my speed wasn't coming near my QWERTY speed due, I think, to having to switch hands so much, so gave up on it and made the C-QWERTY layouts discussed later.

Blue indicates that a letter is in an entirely new position (Q, K, ZXCVJL, ;).
Green indicates that a letter has been shifted one space (OA, IU, FG).

This layout could maybe benefit from a few changes inspired by P.M. Klausler's layout, since I noticed that his layout also came to the conclusion that "I" should be on the home row ane that "O" and "A" should switch positions.

P.M. Klausler's Evolved Layout (2002)

K,UYP WLMFC
OAEID RNTHS
Q.';Z XVGBJ

This is the next layout I encountered.  Here is the report on the development of the layout.

In brief, this layout was developed by creating a set of random layouts, scoring them, replacing the worst half of the layouts with mutations of the top half, and repeating until the scoring plateaued.  The best layout from an evolved set was kept and a new set was generated.  Eventually, the top layouts had an 'all star' round to decide the best overall layout.

The score of a layout was given using the following criteria (paraphrased):

    Every position has an assigned cost that's looked up from a table:
        53334 43335 (top row)
        10002 20001 (home row)
        64447 74446 (bottom row)
    Using the same finger twice in succession on distinct letters costs 10 units.
    When two keys in a row are struck with the same hand, it costs two units if they're on different rows or on the bottom row, and one unit if they're not adjacent.
    If three or more keys are hit in succession by the same hand, one unit is charged for each key after the second.

Though the scoring didn't seem to encourage it, this layout alternates hands about as frequently as the Dvorak layout, (in my opinion) slowing typing.  All the vowels have ended up on one side of the keyboard again.

I haven't used this layout, but I think W and C could have ended up in better places.

H. Hallingstad's Arensito Layout (2000)

QL,P' ;FUDK
ARENB GSITO
ZW.HJ VCYMX

This is a pretty incredible layout.  Here is the Arensito homepage.

He uses a Kinesis keyboard, so some of the layout doesn't translate to a 3x10 box.  I crammed the apostrophe and semi-colon into the top-middle of the layout for purposes of comparison.

It was designed to (paraphrased):

    Place the eight most used characters under your fingertips.
    Minimize the probability of using the same finger twice (in succession).
    Keep the workload off the pinkies. Both pinkies press a button about 40% less than the other fingers.
    Maximize the probability of having two consecutive keystrokes happen next to each other (while keeping the probability of sequences like y-d or z-l low),  which keeps the fingers rolling and increases the typing speed.

He also made use of the Alt-Gr key to make it easy to type special character keys commonly used when programming:

{}[]   _<>$
;/-0: \1()=
6789+ *2345
(The underscore key is to the left of the < sign, but is hidden by the grey border)

I would probably use this layout except that X, C, and V are not in convenient places for use with a mouse.

((I've recently begun to think that these versions of C-QWERTY layouts should only be used if you have an ergonomic keyboard.  I'll keep thinking about how to improve the layouts for plain, rectangular keyboards, though!  It has to do with my realization that there isn't really a home row on a plain keyboard...))

I think any QWERTY user should consider at least switching to one of these layouts, since they drastically reduce the amount of finger movement (27% for C-Q 1/2, 38% for C-Q, and 45% for C-Q N) while only taking a day or two to get used to.  I haven't tried C-QWERTY N yet (I thought of it while making this page).

Blue indicates that a letter is in an entirely new position.
Green indicates that a letter has been shifted one space.

The Capewell Layout (2005)

("Close Keys" 0.9.3 version)

I thought that P.M. Klausler's evolved layout idea was pretty cool, so I decided to make a similar program with my own fitness function.  His program was written in C, but I decided to write mine in C++ in order to learn the language.  The source is available at the end of this section.  I used pretty much the same evolutionary framework: 

    A pool of 2048 random layouts is generated and scored, then the worse half are replaced by mutations of the top half and scored.  If 16 mutation rounds in a row do not produce a new best layout for the current pool, then the top 32 layouts from the pool are saved and a new random pool is generated and scored, and so on...  If 48 pools in a row do not produce a new best score, then the all-star round begins.  The all-star round ends when 144 mutation rounds in a row fail to produce a new best layout.
    The numbers are kind of arbitrary, but attempt to balance speed and thoroughness.  Running the same simulation twice should result in the same winning layout.

I'm still tweaking my scoring method to get 'the best' layout possible.  The above layout is the one that I think could end up as the final version, since it has been able to win under a variety of penalty values.  I'll have to test it out for a while first, though.

In designing a scoring method, I tried to combine what I thought was good from all the other layouts.  I also geared some special cases for the weird, asymmetric keyboards that most people have (why do they still make them like that??).  I'll also make a symmetric version, taking out the penalties that don't apply for nice keyboards like those by Kinesis.

If there are 30 keys in a layout, then the number of possible layouts is 30-factorial.  That's 2.65E32 possible layouts.  To reduce the number of possible layouts in order to eliminate needlessly scoring bad layouts, some constraints were added:

    Of the 8 most common letters used in English (ETAOINSR), the top 6 (ETAOIN) were automatically placed under the home row fingers.  S and R were left to battle it out with keys such as H and D for a spot under a finger on the home row.  Depending on some parameters, D will sometimes kick S off the home row.
    The letters ZXCV were constrained to remain in the lower left of the keyboard in any order, so that it's still easy to use the common keyboard shortcuts CTRL+Z/X/C/V while holding the mouse (if you're right-handed).
    I considered constraining E to its QWERTY position, but didn't.  However, it always seems to assume that position anyway.
    This reduces the number of possible layouts to 1.18E24.

Here is my current scoring method (higher scores are worse).

    Some positions have an assigned cost (X is ten):
        X1000 X001X (top row)
        00000 00000 (home row)
        X100X 0001X (bottom row)
        (I find it hard to reach Y and B on an asymmetric QWERTY keyboard)
     +5: Reaching to the centre column without switching hands before
     +5: Reaching to the centre column without switching hands after
     +5: Changing the row on one hand. (no penalty if you are switching hands or stay on a row)
    +50: Using the same finger twice in a row
    +30: Jumping over the home row (for example, typing CR)
        -20: Reduce the penalty if any of the following or their reverse are used:  VE, VW, NI, NO, MI, MO (QWERTY positions) since these aren't too hard to type
     -4: Using keys on the same hand using different fingers and not reaching to a centre column ("Close Keys")
     -3: Using adjacent keys on the same hand using different fingers ("Adjacent Keys")
    -50%: If there is a space key between two other keys, the penalty is reduced by this percentage.

The above rules don't encourage using adjacent keys as much as they encourage simply using fingers on the same hand, which is why I sometimes refer to the layout presented above as the "close keys" version (as opposed to the "adjacent keys" version).

There are quite a few sets of parameter values that will lead to the "close keys" layout winning.

To understand why I think it is easier to use keys on the same hand consecutively, consider playing piano:  using fingers on the same hand is like playing a chord, except that instead of hitting all the keys at the same time, you hit the keys at slightly different times -- and I think our brains do a good job of picking up on how to time the fingers when striking a 'chord' on a computer keyboard (e.g., type the word "REASON" on a QWERTY keyboard). 

On the other hand (so to speak...), P.M. Klausler mentions on his page that his statistics collected show that it is faster to alternate hands than to type combinations on one hand (averages:  same hand, 330ms -- opposite hand, 267ms).  If I had to guess why his statistics don't show that using the same hand is faster, it would be that they were collected using the dvorak keyboard, so he has optimized his use of opposite-hand keystrokes, combined with the fact that when one hand types two characters or more in a row, the other hand gets time to set up (again, type REASON on a QWERTY); if only one key were pressed, I think it would take longer.  But perhaps I'm wrong -- I'll have to look into it one day, taking into account how many keys were pressed on the other hand before switching hands.  I think the optimum would be 2 on one hand, then 2 on the other (3 keys on one hand would likely induce error -- again, type REASON).  Perhaps if 2 keys were pressed on each hand at a time, both averages would go down.

I should probably rewrite the program to try to achieve this 2-keys-per-hand goal.

Another thing I do differenty than P.M. Klausler is that I don't have the layouts race to type a weighted word list words.  Instead, it races to a type weighted key-combination list.  I took a 120kb text file of random paragraphs of whatever I've read or written lately and counted 2- and 3-character combinations.  I then threw out any 2-character combos with a space in them and any 3-letter combos that was not either character-space-character or space-space-character (space-space is also '\r\n' to account for new paragraphs [It was easier to do it using the Windows-style endline]).  This is both faster (~1900 layouts tested per second) and allows me to take into account the effects of ending one word and starting another.  I had it originally implemented as simply reading through a text file, but this combo method scores within 2% of the text file method and is waaayyy faster.  I did not try the word list method. The space-space-character combo indicates the beginning of a paragraph, so does not take into account any previously typed key.  The character-space-character combo behaves like a character-character 2-key combo, except that the score is reduced in magnitude by a specified percentage since pressing space should let your fingers reset themselvessome what.  The "close keys" layout has won with space key penalty reductions of 50% and 35% (I haven't tried other percentages yet).

Anyway, you can download the keyboard evolution program source code package here.  The evolution program is in C++; it was written over the past 2.5 weeks.  The program that converts a text file to a combo list is in Java, written some time in 2004 (it seems some methods have been deprecated in the meantime.  hm.).

Just a note about the evolution program: this was my first C++ program, and I was learning as I went and didn't always go back and incorporate some new technique I just learned, so some of it is a bit of a mess.  The Score class is especially horrible, but that's just because it was added last-minute and I haven't yet tried to integrate it nicely -- I just wanted it to work as soon as possible!

If anyone has some ideas on how I could make the program run faster, I'd be fascinated to hear them!  It currently does about 3000 layouts per second on a 2.8GHz Intel P4 Northwood.  A typical run through the program takes about two to three hours and inspects 15+ million layouts (a mere 1.5E07 of the 1.18E24 possible layouts).

Comparing the Layouts
Jon A. Maxwell wrote a neat Java applet for comparing the QWERTY and Dvorak layouts and kindly released the source to the world.  I have modified it to be able to compare all the layouts discussed above.  You can play with my version here, but I have included a screenshot below based on the text I used to evolve the layouts.

comparison of the different layouts. QWERTY: 3056m. Cepewell-QWERTY: 1899m. Dvorak: 1766m. Capewell-Dvorak: 1586m. Klausler: 1604m. Arensito: 1573m. Capewell (Adjacent): 1572m. Capewell (Close): 1573m.


You'll notice that QWERTY uses the same hand again about 36% of the time, very nearly as much as the Arensito and Capewell layout, whereas the Dvorak layouts and Klausler's layout use the same hand about 25% of the time.

Below is a comparison of the distance the fingers must travel when using the layouts:

	-0.1%
	-0.1%
(C-QWERTY scores 37.7% better than QWERTY, Dvorak scores 7.2% better than C-QWERTY, etc)

Basically, when it comes to distance, all the other layouts are way better than QWERTY, since it has 4 vowels on the top row.  Curiously, the evolved layouts of mine that I like have nearly identical scores as Arensito has.  However, Arensito's score is inflated a bit by having the semi-colon and apostrophe put in the top-middle positions and ignoring the Alt-Gr programming keys.

As an interesting note, if I switch the H and R keys on C-Dvorak, the layout scores a lower distance than any other layout shown, at 1555m IIRC, which is about as low as any I have generated -- but distance is not the only imporant only metric.

    Capewell vs Arensito

Capewell     Arensito

We've already been through the fact that QWERTY- and DVORAK-like layouts have some major weaknesses.  The question remaining is, is the Capewell Layout any better than the Arensito layout?

The answer, in short, is that the layouts are pretty much the same, except that my layout places the ZXCV keys in the lower right of the layout, which makes it the more convenient of the two if you copy/cut/paste/undo a lot.  I use these so much that I even have one of my (five) mouse buttons assigned to act as CTRL+V to make pasting easier.

The results are summarized below:

    The layouts score identically in 1 of 9 categories (the overall score is not considered, nor is the distance measurement).
    The layouts score within 10% of each other in 5 of the remaining 8 categories (mine getting the better score 3 times).
    The layouts score within 20% of each other in 1 of the remaining 3 categories.  The Capewell layout uses the ring finger off the home row 19.4% less than the Arensito layout.  I personally find this finger a bit uncomfortable to use (otherwise, I wouldn't have penalized it), but other people may not think it matters.
    The layouts split the remaining 2 categories, each winning by nearly half the score of the other:
        The Arensito layout requires one to skip over the home row 83% more than with the Capewell layout.  The Capewell layout is further helped in this category by the fact that 59% of the time when this happens, the space key is used between the letters, compared to only 46% of the time with Arensito.
        The Capewell layout uses the pinky off the home row 85% more than with the Arensito layout.  However, 64% of the time, this is the period key, so I don't think the flow of typing would be affected much.  I'm not happy with the apostrophe being where it is, though -- I think I'll probably put it in it's QWERTY position instead of up in the corner.

In the end, I think the only real difference between my layout and the Arensito layout (if we ignore the special programming keys arrangement) is that my layout puts all of the ZXCV keys in the lower-left of the layout, making it easier to use Copy/Cut/Paste/Undo frequently.  A and S also remain on the left side of the layout, so Select All and Save can still be hit with the left hand.  CTRL+F is a bit of a reach, but should still useable for most people.  In Arensito, A and Z remain in their QWERTY position, but the other keys are moved to the right side of the keyboard.

I don't know if I'll add an Alt-Gr set of programming keys to the layout -- it's a neat idea, but I haven't used Alt-Gr before.

C-Dvorak beats Dvorak in 7 of 9 categories and Klausler in 6 of 9 categories.  When it does lose, it gets trounced, however; but it still has a better total score than the other two layouts.  I think it is significantly more comfortable to use than Dvorak.

    C-QWERTY vs QWERTY
C-QWERTY beats QWERTY in every single category.  What more can be said?  Oh, that it absolutely whips QWERTY in 7 of 9 of those categories.

(Sorry, only Windows versions right now)

On Learning to Type (It's All About the Combos)
I learned to type in grade 9.  We had a typing class.  72 minutes per class, 5 days per week, for 2 or 3 months.  About 60 hours total.  And after all those hours, I could only type 15 words per minute!

The only typing programs I've seen (and that's not many, I must admit) teach you simply by teaching you the home row on one hand, then the other, then move on to maybe the top left row, etc., teaching you based purely on location, trying to make you memorize each individual key location.  When you see the word BECAUSE, you would simply type each letter individually:  B-E-C-A-U-S-E.  However, when you're a good typist, you type something like BE-C-AU-SE.  You type in combos.  If you want to teach someone to type fast, you need to train them on common combinations of keys.

So, while learning the Dvorak layout last year, I wrote a program to teach typing using this combo theory, based on the idea that we type using key combinations.

I started by writing a little Java program to analyze a collection of text to find the most commonly typed key combinations (which I later reused when writing the keyboard evolution program). The text I used was comprised of some articles off the internet, paragraphs from some relatively modern books, and a bunch of instant messaging archive text.

I then made another little program that I could use to get a list of words that contained certain keys and key combinations.

With my list of important words handy, I wrote a Visual Basic 6 program to give lessons and then wrote some lessons for it to give.

Download my typing program (Windows only).  The lessons were written with Dvorak in mind, but I'm sure you could teach any layout with it.  After all, it just teaches you the most common key combos, not areas of the keyboard.  (If the program does not work, you need to install the Microsoft Visual Basic run-time DLLs)

Rearranging Your Keyboard Keys (Not for the Weak-of-Stomach)
I love my keyboard.  I've had it since I had a Cyrix P166+ (that's something like a Intel Pentium 133 or 150MHz).  It's rather quiet and smooth and comforting.  It's me in keyboard form.  I don't even know who made this keyboard (but this I know about myself) – there's no name on it; it was simply made in China (unlike me) and complies with the appropriote FCC regulations (I'm not sure about me).

So when I decided to learn Dvorak, I balked at the idea of tearing up the keys and rearranging them, since my first cautious efforts to remove the keys were unsuccessful.

Instead, I cut up the sticky parts of three Post-It notes into little slightly-smaller-than-key-sized squares (you should get 14 keys per Post-It), stuck them on the keys, and wrote the new letters on these keys.  You could, if you wanted, write both the new letters and the QWERTY letters on the keys, for when other people use your keyboard and switch back to the QWERTY layout (after you comment on how good your wrists feel that day).  This worked pretty well, though sometimes the papers would move around a bit.  TIP:  Round the edges on the squares to prevent accidentally lifting up the papers from the keys.

Speaking of keyboards, whose brilliant idea was it to put a POWER button on a keyboard?  Obviously not someone with a cat.

Eventually, however, I tired of the Post-Its and got down and dirty (VERY. DIRTY.) with my keyboard.  I took off all the keys using two screwdrivers to pop them off (one prevents the key from moving sideways and the other pops it up and off). Make sure you have a vacuum on hand, because it is DISGUSTING what accumulates under your keys over 8 years.  I used the screwdrivers to scrape away the miscellaneous goos, crusts, and hairballs.

My keyboard has slightly differently-shaped keys for each row of keys, so rearranging them makes them all not quite level with some of the neighboring keys.  You get use to this quickly and stop noticing it altogether.

I am looking for some user input on how good you think each of these keyboard layouts is. Please rate each layout based on the amount of effort you think it takes to type. If you want to know letter frequency, you can find it here. See here, here, here or here for some ideas on what makes a good keyboard layout.

You do not have to answer every question. Any answers are appreciated. Please do not answer any questions more than once. And, of course, feel free to leave comments.

EDIT 8/1/09: I added Phynnboi’s layout at the bottom.

First, take this preliminary poll:
How much do you know about keyboard layouts?
I have no idea what makes a good layout.
I think I know which layouts are good and which aren't.
I know a lot more about keyboard layouts than the average person.
You could call me a keyboard layout expert.

    I don’t really feel like taking that many polls, so here’s an ordering according to my program, from best to worst:

    (0.28) Klausler
    (0.29) Dvorak
    (0.38) Carpalx
    (0.41) Colemak
    (0.59) MTGAP
    (0.72) Arensito
    (0.74) Capewell
    (1.35) Qwerty

    The number is the overall evaluation of the layout. (My best layout scores 0.05.)

            That layout scores 0.28, which is respectable, but not my best. Here’s the 0.05 layout:

                Hi Phynnboi. Do you still use this layout? I just started learning about all this and your layout looks like a winner.

                    I used it for a while, but eventually dropped it. At around the 50 WPM proficiency mark, it started to feel like I was a four-finger typist, “noodling around” with the middle and especially index fingers. For some folks that might actually be preferable, but it wasn’t the experience I was after.

                I like the layout. I think I use a question mark more than the semi-colon so I’d replace yours with a question mark. The semi-colon has always just been a fancy comma to me so it would be the shifted comma and colons are fancy periods so they’d be the shifted period. My theory on keyboard layout is ordering keys based on sound similarity aka q, k, c, s. And harder guttural sounds seem more suited to the right hand and softer vowels for the left hand. Which is also why I’d place a period on the right hand and a question mark for the left hand. The left hand is more artsy, feely, and philosophical. Also ordering keys based on similarity of shapes like a K and X; Q and O; I and L not to mention a little R and B thrown in. And I think the number row needs to shift one to the right to center it more. Those first two keys could be and ( ). And the $ should be above the 5 and probably in line with an S. Keyboard layouts have always been a pet peeve of mine, almost as much as the non Phonetic language we are stuck with.

            How is JCLFX “uncomfortable?” If you study the layout for a bit, you’ll see that it’s basically an improved version of Dvorak. Since Dvorak got nothing but “decent” and “solid” votes, I don’t see how JCLFX could score any worse.

            I was voting based off of the old layout, and I don’t know how to remove votes. IMO, your layout provides an improvement over Dvorak.

    Hello every one, I just finished making my account and I really want to say whats up! I’ve been a lurker around here for quite a while and finally chose to join.

    I’m a comic at heart, but my real job is selling homes. However I’m also working on my own home business wooden picture frames and that is very exciting :), for me, at least!

    So that is a tiny bit from me. I hope to chat with you guys and become an active person in your community. Thanks!

    I need to change my vote on Phinnbois layout. It caught me of guard. I didnt realize until after my vote, he intentionally favored the bottom row, instead of the top row. Interesting. I wonder if its better for ‘lazy’ heel-resting typists (like me). (Keep your arms up in the air for hours? Are they kidding me?)

    It bothers me to see frequent letters on the ‘wrong row’, in this case LCF, but overall it could be solid.

        Pardon the exceptionally late reply: I didn’t even know this page still existed!

        It’s true that I favor the bottom row, but only for the the index and pinky fingers. I favor the top row for the middle and ring fingers. This feels more comfortable for me, and makes the layout feel more “open.” (In contrast, layouts that always favor the top row over the bottom row, like Colemak, tend to feel a bit “cramped” to me).

Gallium vs Semimak-JQ?

Hey guys, quick question for you.

I've been messing around with gallium for the past couple of weeks and I'm liking it for the most part, but there are some things I don't like. Not a fan of the index sfb, such as 'ph' 'phy' 'sw' 'sc' etc... Not sure what this is called, but I also don't like how a lot of the alternated fingers are also essentially sfb. An example would be the word 'mad', middle finger needs to hit m and d with only one letter inbetween.

I started looking into semimakjq and it seems like it might fix some of the issues I'm having with gallium. I figure if I'm going to switch anytime, now would be the best before I go too deep into gallium. I've been using canary before this which I love, but canary is abysmal with vim so I'm wanting to switch to something not so bad lol.

I know that semimak uses a lot of ring/pinky finger, but that wouldn't bother me at all I don't think.

Anybody who has used both of them have any input? Or really any input in general would be nice lol.

I'm using these layouts on a 34 key ortholinear board

Thank you all so much! :D

Hi, Gallium creator here, sorry about the late response.

Firstly I totally agree that DTM as a column produces quite a lot of same finger skipgrams (M_D, T_D, T_D), this is somewhat unavoidable with N as the pinky key as we are forced to have SC together.

In knowing that I had to have SC I naturally put it on the index finger where it could easily be alt-fingered (C pressed with middle, S pressed with index).

Another regrettable thing about the layout is PHY, which is definitely the worst part and again cannot be solved for another way in this composition as having P with N like with nerps' predecessor nerts causes a nasty PR pinky-ring row skipping bigram that occurs in 0.5% of english.

Semimak is a really strong layout on stats, it has the lowest same finger skipgrams (SFS) of essentially any usable layout and is in the same family of layouts as Whorf which has the lowest same finger bigrams (SFB) of any usable layout.

Gallium and Semimak's goals are quite different, Gallium is tailored to a more general user whereas Semimak is optimised with Semi's preferences in mind.

i'll outline some design decisions for Gallium below:

    S is repeated much more often than N and I wanted to engineer a layout with that in mind as S pinky can be too much for some. SS : 0.353%, NN : 0.087%.

    Semimak's FS pinky is more usage on the top row. When i made Gallium i tried to find the least prohibitive letter to place above N. both in usage and in combination with R: F : 2.124%, B : 1.488%, FR : 0.243%, BR : 0.136%.

    Redirects were obsessively optimised to be the lowest possible within reason as I believe they slow down the learning process for people switching layouts. 3.157% total.

    Hand balance was also obsessed over, I still wish I could have 50-50 but it's not possible without compromising somewhere else.

    A new term called scissors also plays a part in my decisions (like BL on Semimak which is 0.229% common), that particular bigram is quite awful for some and I think gallium performs quite well with that considered.

Some reasons that you might consider Semimak over Gallium:

    You wouldn't mind the extra movemtent movement and redirects on the vowel hand index. (+3%~ redirect increase)

    Semimak scales much better with word complexity, when dealing with less complex words HY and IY perform similar, only when P is introduced does it become statistically significant because of how all three interact with eachother. By the time the words are complex IY is virtually the best partner for Y in any context for any layout.

One thing i think both layouts do well is break up repetitive typing patterns by having a mix of alternation and rolls. This mix is mostly determined by what letters you place on the index of the vowel hand, DC and H both perform quite similarly in this respect albeit with less movement on H indexes typically.

I hope this explains almost everything about why you would want to try Semimak and why Gallium is structured the way it is, I encourage trying semimak out for yourself anyways to see if it's for you and to experiment with index arrangement to suite your personal needs.

Was reducing DSFB's one of your design goals?

it was definitely something i was focused on keeping as low as possible given the constraints i was using.

    a lot of the alternated fingers are also essentially sfb. An example would be the word 'mad', middle finger needs to hit m and d with only one letter inbetween.

This is a skipgram. Gallium's skipgram statistics are not bad if you go to clemenpine's keysolve. I'd think having a somewhat frequent 'm' on mid finger bottom row would be more of a problem as it guarantees a lot of row hops (and worse, scissors). But such is the tradeoff you make to not have y on pinky.

Ph/py alt fingering (hitting h,y with middle finger) seems quite doable. Phy is a challenge if you are a physics major.

I’m really enjoying it overall, but the index sfb are my biggest complaint.

But, after messing around with semimakjq today, I think I’ll stick with gallium. The vim keybinds aren’t as great and that’s the whole reason I’m switching.

Thanks for your input! :D

You might compare them on https://o-x-e-y.github.io/layouts/playground/

You will see that in English, they have comparable stats, including the use of pinkeys and ring fingers (roughly 9% pinky, 13% ring finger; for both Semimak jq and Gallium). The layouts also visually seem to roughly follow the same layout philosophy.

I'm using semimak jq myself, nice layout, not perfect, but no layout is.

Gallium is better balanced in English (Left/Right). But I use Semimak because by sheer luck it is also great for Dutch with I type a lot. So pick what you like.

Good luck!

Thank you! I decided to stick with gallium with a couple of key swaps to make vim keybinds a bit better. After messing around with semimakjq, I realized that using vim with it wasn't as great and that's the whole reason why I'm switching lol.

I appreciate your input! :D

I'm sorry to say this. The RSTLNE keyboard layout is a bad joke, and I strongly recommend against it.

If you are considering switching to an alternative keyboard layout, that's great. Check out the Keyboard layouts doc and Alt keyboard layouts: Why? How? Which one?!. This will give you the background in what alt layouts are out there, what metrics people commonly use to compare them, and how different designs differ. The Colemak-DH layout is an especially popular alt layout among keyboard enthusiasts.

Why is RSTLNE bad? As the author says, he came up with using a genetic algorithm to minimize finger travel. While that's a good metric to minimize, it's definitely not the only consideration, and the idea of designing a keyboard this way is not new. For instance the Carpalx model of typing effort has been around for a while. Most keyboard layout designs consider a balance of objectives in addition to finger travel: reducing same-finger bigrams (or SFBs, where successive keys are typed by the same finger), reducing lateral finger movements, increasing rolling, yet reducing "redirects" where the rolls changes direction, etc. There is a section in Keyboard layouts doc that describes metrics in detail. The RSTLNE author appears to be unaware of Carpalx or SFBs or any of this :-/

To give RSTLNE fair consideration, I plugged it into Oxey's analyzer. Here are its metrics vs. QWERTY and a few other layouts for comparison (for SFBs, LSBs, and Total Redirects, lower is better. For Total Rolls, higher is better.):
Layout 	SFBs 	LSBs 	Total Rolls 	Total Redirects
RSTLNE 	6.302% 	2.943% 	41.740% 	13.164%
QWERTY 	6.615% 	6.882% 	37.243% 	13.187%
Dvorak 	2.779% 	1.255% 	38.924% 	3.458%
Colemak DH 	1.387% 	1.975% 	46.113% 	10.579%
Colemak Qi;x 	1.106% 	2.259% 	45.141% 	9.544%
Hands Down 	1.082% 	3.487% 	44.137% 	4.165%
Semimak JQ 	0.872% 	2.410% 	42.705% 	6.616%

RSTLNE is an objectively bad layout, with very high SFBs and redirects, on par with QWERTY.

No, but after switching to colemak-dh I can say that it does look very reasonable. Leaving E on the left hand will probably make it much easier to switch from QWERTY.

I use Colemak which keeps ZXCV where they are.

The problem with new alternate layouts is that you can't use sculpted keycaps. You're forced to use XDA (barf) or something like SA R3.

We actually use it as our layout, have been for about a year or so. Though we did make one change to it, we swapped the ";" and the "q" as it makes coding easier that way.
I find the keyboard extremely comfortable to type on and the only downside is needing to rebind controls in games, but that would happen with any non-qwerty layout.

Keyboard-Design.com's version of Whorf

Hi all, I was looking at Whorf and noticed that the version on Keyboard-Design.com is different than the one currently on the google doc. Here is the one from Keyboard-Design: whorf.en.ansi

It's basically Whorf with a Semimak-like left hand home row. What's interesting is that this change makes it one of the best layouts per genkey metrics, close to Semimak and superior to standard Whorf. What's the history of this layout? Just an old version?

Ian can't keep up with layouts that are frequently revised and can't be bothered to use version numbers ... :-)

I will check what's happening with Clemenpine's .doc. Thanks for the advisory.

What actually happened is that I was busy working with both lists (ClemenPine and yours) then got sidetracked by urgent work stuff for a few weeks and then was made aware of a subtle bug in all versions of KLA so started to look at that then a new French layout came along so looked at how to add non-English ISO layouts to my comparisons while also looking at how to add a Level 5 and 6 modifier to KLA, then one day Load-shedding caught me by surprise, PC shut down ungracefully, and when it came up, Kate editor has forgotten the scores of documents that I had open ... and somewhere in all of that, I got confused about the two lists and their authors. I actually did check yours a few weeks back to see if there were any updates because I have a batch of about 30 layouts that I need to add ..

Things keep getting pushed down the memory stack in my head :-)

And let's not even talk about Giza .... :-) a real sleep-stealer!

The one in the google doc is new, neither one are really great because the indexes are a little messed up. Whorf was made to perform best on finger speed with some finger reordering done in the end, nothing else so it has some flaws there. Anyway I think this is the original yeah, before the hn swap and maybe some other minor changes that made the google doc

Not sure about the revision history of whorf, but iirc semimak was developed as an improvement of sort?

Anyway, I think the improvement in score you are seeing, from swapping 'h' and 'n' between the two versions, is entering into the "overfitting" area, where slight change in the weight of things -- either in the optimizer or the corpus -- will likely produce slightly different optimum. At this point I think it's probably more useful to tune by your own use/philosophy or some other more holistic considerations

Recurva
An alternate keyboard layout focused on efficiency

recurva

Recurva's name originates from the Eucalyptus Recurva, a critically endangered species endemic to only a tiny section of New South Wales, Australia.

The goal with Recurva was to solely focus on the rudimentary statistics that I personally feel are the most important in layout design to achieve the best stats that would still be usable. The main stats I considered were:

    Same Finger Bigrams - SFBs (two letters pressed in a row with the same finger).
    Same Finger Skipgrams - SFS (two letters pressed on the same finger but with one letter separating the two).
    Hand balance stays somewhat equal (total usage of letters calculated).

What does Recurva accomplish?

Recurva accomplishes a new local minimum for Same Finger Skipgrams (SFS) using less efficient elements, previously Semimak held the lowest SFS of any english layout using columns such as RL, HNB which perform extremely well in that category.

Before understanding Recurva's niche it's best to examine the commonly used elements, typically layouts that have R on the pinky cannot have RL as a column which isn't the best for SFBs or SFS, even still it fits many more advantageous compositions.

SFBs
rl + lr: 0.087%,
hl + lh: 0.017%,
nl + ln: 0.073%,

SFS
rl + lr: 0.377%,
hl + lh: 0.252%,
nl + ln: 0.576%,

All statistics presented here use Shai corpus unless specified.

Looking at these stats you could conclude that HL is better than RL but as mentioned before compositionally this is rarely true because R is much more un-agreeable as a letter in comparison with H. R's most common partners that make sense from as SFB standpoint create a lot of SFS unfortunately which means it often gets put by itself on the pinky homerow or in combination with RL.

Why is this important? because L is just as un-agreeable as R and also causes trouble for the composition, it has the highest number of repeats of any letter (ll: 0.713%) and only goes with the letters I've shown above and the letter M (SFBs: ml + lm: 0.028%, SFS: ml + lm: 0.298%)
Analysis of Whorf and Semimak

Before we get to the differences between Recurva and layouts like Whorf and Semimak we need to talk about what separates Whorf and Semimak apart:

whorf                          semimak_jq
f l h d m  v w o u ,           f l h v z  ' w u o y

Sfb:               0.605%      Sfb:               0.798%
Sfs:               6.049%      Sfs:               5.688%
Scissors           0.817%      Scissors:          0.955%
Lsbs               1.988%      Lsbs:              2.122%

Inrolls:           22.39%      Inrolls:           20.24%
Outrolls:          22.48%      Outrolls:          22.18%
Total Rolls:       44.88%      Total Rolls:       42.42%
Onehands:          1.681%      Onehands:          1.862%

Total Alternates:  38.47%      Total Alternates:  40.32%
Total Redirects:   6.293%      Total Redirects:   6.461%

One of the main reasons Semimak(jq) performs better on SFS is because IY performs better than CY and the rest of the index column, while this does decrease SFS dramatically (for this level of optimisation) it sacrifices being able to place every piece of punctuation with the vowels like with Whorf's vowel block. Because of this Semimak_jq specifically places comma below E and apostrophe with the index column which creates quite a few SFBs.

Semimak's Y interactions:

SFBs
iy + yi: 0.039% - y/ + /y: 0.001% - total of 0.040%

SFS
iy + yi: 0.257% - y/ + /y: 0.005% - total of 0.262%


Whorf's Y interactions:

SFBs
cy + yc: 0.042% - yg + gy: 0.024% - yw + wy: 0.011%
yv + vy: 0.006% - py + yp: 0.035% - total of 0.217%

SFS
cy + yc: 0.085% - yg + gy: 0.060% - yw + wy: 0.176%
yv + vy: 0.015% - py + yp: 0.118% - total of 0.427%

Y interaction delta:

SFBs
Whorf's O.217% - Semimak's 0.040% = 0.177%

SFS
Whorf's 0.427% - Semimak's 0.262% = O.165%


Semimak's E interactions:

SFBs
e, + ,e: 0.190% - eu + ue: 0.148% - u, + ,u: 0.006% - total of 0.344%

SFS
e, + ,e: 0.256% - eu + ue: 0.655% - u, + ,u: 0.044% - total of 0.955%

Whorf's E interactions:

SFBs
e; + ;e: 0.005% - eu + ue: 0.148% - u; + ;u: 0.000% - total of 0.153%

SFS
e; + ;e: 0.021% - eu + ue: 0.655% - u; + ;u: 0.002% - total of 0.678%

E interaction delta:

SFBs
Semimak's 0.344% - Whorf's 0.153% = 0.191%

SFS
Semimak's 0.955% - Whorf's 0.678% = 0.277%

This doesn't even account for other corpora where IY scales much better than any other interaction with Y such as monkeytype's 10k and 450k (relevance to real-world application is up for debate).

Another reason for Whorf having more SFS is because of the position of D, on Whorf this is placed on the T index where it generates more SFS than the DC index Semimak opts for but also saves SFBs because of the accumulative conflicts that all the letters on Semimak's index, especially apostrophe.

Now finally we come to Recurva, Recurva uses RN and LHM instead of RL and HNB which are both used on Whorf and Semimak to achieve their extremely impressive SFB and SFS stats respectively. In the very specific combination of letters that completes Recurva it has worse elements that creates a better stats than Semimak on almost all fronts except for usage of less domininant fingers.

Recurva's RN:           Semimak's RL:
rn + nr: 0.191%         rl + lr: 0.073%
rn + nr (SFS): 0.941%   rl + lr (SFS): 0.546%

recurva                        semimak_jq

Inrolls:           22.80%      Inrolls:           20.24%
Outrolls:          25.16%      Outrolls:          22.18%
Total Rolls:       47.96%      Total Rolls:       42.42%

Total Redirects:   5.393%      Total Redirects:   6.461%

So how does Recurva use worse parts to create a better whole? The main innovation is using H as the index on the vowel hand, this can only be done by mutating the RL, HNB columns into RN, LHM. As mentioned earlier HL is typically worse for the composition because RL gets rid of two very unagreeable letters without a huge difference to the main stats. In this very specific scenario because we've opted for Semimak style vowels we can place period on that column while still having less SFBs and SFS than Semimak's DC index.

Because of the columns we've chosen most of the SFBs generated in the layout come almost entirely from UE, OA, RN, Y,, and the accumulative period SFBs with the H elements.

If you're confused about any explanations here I encourage you to visit the Keyboard Layout Doc: https://bit.ly/keyboard-layouts-doc, it has a wealth of knowledge to read through if theory of layout composition ever interests you.
Variations

Recurva has a couple variations adaptated for columnar stagger keyboards, these don't change any stats except for Lateral Stretch Bigrams:

recurva-colstag                recurva-colstag2
f r d p v  q m u o y           f r d p v  q l u o y
s n t c b  . h e a i           s n t c b  m h e a i
z x k g w  j l ; ' ,           z x k g w  j . ; ' ,

There won't be any downloads for these variations as it's pretty much assumed that if you have a columnar staggered keyboard it will most likely be programmable.
History

Recurva was found accidently while exploring different composition's on Oxey's Layout Playground - an interactive website that allows you to swap letters in a layout and see the result in real time - https://o-x-e-y.github.io/layouts/playground/index.html.

I had been trying to make RN, LHM as a composition work since the start of 2023 in january after I completed Gallium, Richard Davison (https://github.com/rdavison creator of Graphite) and I collaborated on a layout that used R on the pinky and LHM after I commented on how technically HL was better to RL in isolation, that layout resulted in Ruthenium which doesn't really accomplish anything significant other than existing as a somewhat new combination and some decent stats. Although I didn't look at it again until recently, it bears a striking resemblance to Recurva in a few ways and definitely reinforced the idea

ruthenium
w d l f x  q b u o y
r t h s g  . n e a i
j k m c v  z p ' , ;
Sfb:  0.916%
Dsfb: 6.596%
Scissors: 0.750%
Lsbs: 0.784%

Inrolls: 27.387%
Outrolls: 17.568%
Total Rolls: 44.955%
Onehands: 2.873%

Total Alternates: 38.197%
Total Redirects: 4.799%

After Ruthenium I experimented many times with LHM as a column. I partially wanted to try RN as a replacement to RL, HNB as it made the most sense when mutating those columns but also because I admired the structure of Clemenpine's Pine layout - https://github.com/ClemenPine/pine-layout which exhibits RN on the left middle finger. To my knowledge the first layout to actually use RN and LHM together was Halmak.

After a couple months of sporadically trying the combination, in March I got inspired to experiment with the combination while trying Semimak vowels at the same time.

Total Redirects:   5.146%      Total Redirects:   7.309%

Ultimately all of these are archival layouts as Recurva accomplishes what they didn't, some of these layouts come close to Semimak's stats but none exceed its superb stats.

3 months later (July) and curious once again about the composition I tried it again but in conjunction with Whorf style vowels.

pycnantha
f r d p v  z q o u ,
s n t c y  k h a e i
x j b g w  m l ' ; .
Sfb:  0.709%
Dsfb: 6.048%
Scissors: 0.451%
Lsbs: 1.643%

Inrolls: 22.737%
Outrolls: 25.499%
Total Rolls: 48.237%
Onehands: 1.297%

Total Alternates: 35.722%
Total Redirects: 5.854%

Pycnantha's goal was to lower scissors coming from Whorf and to emulate features I favour from Oxey's Sturdy - https://o-x-e-y.github.io/layouts/sturdy/index.html while keeping the stats very close to Whorf. Pycnantha is only a few swaps from Recurva but it would be 2 months before I discovered it as I was hesitant to try Semimak style vowels again and assumed I could not achieve a better result.

The modification into Recurva is quite simple, in this composition K creates SFBs with the H index that cannot be avoided because the only other place K can go is with T which already has two letters in its column, the prime candidate to place elsewhere is B because its stats when paired in C indexes are very good but the issue is that that column is full and no other exchanges can take place.

Recurva only works because it removes the Letter Y from the C index and allows to you swap B into the C index and thus place the K into the T column.

Time is running out.. Gallium, Recurva or Engram?

TL;DR Can those who know any of these layouts share their insights?

Hi all, thanks a ton for this helpful sub!

Like so many others, I'm trying to pinpoint the (hopefully somewhat) ideal layout. Trouble is, my vacation will end soon and I'd like to put some training hours in for a new (and my first) akl.

Target device is a 3x5 +3 thumb keys split colstag wired keyboard currently running vanilla Miryoku (Colemak DH on base layer). Will likely upgrade to a 3*6+3 in the near future, though.

Admittedly, from all the research I've done so far I know that comparing layouts is hard and metrics differ wildly regarding subjective significance as well as target corpus. I'm looking for a daily driver working in IT, but not coding, so typing / software requirements emails more than actual code.

As a bonus requirement, I need to type in both English and German at work, so if any of these layouts would be useful for this, I appreciate if you share your thoughts. (Currently also looking into bone/neo for this part)

Thanks again and happy belated new year!

Idk but I've heard Gallium is great and Engram not so much, though I haven't heard of Recurva. Also, I don't use it myself (planning to switch once I get my corne (3x6, but pretty similar anyway), but I've heard that Canary is really good

I'm really willing to try canary, but that w on pinky is scaring me out. Also overloading right hand is a concern (though it may be balanced by pressing space with left hand i guess).

If you save and exit Vim a lot with :wq I guess you would need to rebind the command! Or strengthen your pinky.

Very nice layouts so personal preference will definitely come into play here.

With Gallium and Recurva you get consonants on the left which I like for common windows shortcuts not needing my mouse hand. They also have less single finger bigrams. I don't know German but I would think it would benefit from having R on the home row more than C.

Recurva will minimize your center column usage and shift the load to the pinkies, if that's your priority. Recurva's YOU trigram doesn't work for me because I don't like to use pinkie extend much, but other folks may have no problem with this movement.

Although low in center column usage overall, Recurva puts M and W on the bottom row as a lateral stretch for the index finger which is more than I'd want to be using those keys. Meanwhile Gallium puts P and G in center columns, but they are on the center row so not as awkward to type for me. Pinkie/ring scissors are lowest overall for Gallium but BR is very awkward for me.

Would you prefer LM with the vowels or or PF?

The layout I use for myself is distinct but closest to Gallium, with an EO stack so higher SFBs and less pinkie use. Definitely produces a "high alternation" feel, but I like that because of the very low redirects.

Thanks a ton for all your input, sphlonglonius! :) All things considered so far, I'm currently leaning towards gallium which was originally suggested by another helpful redditor as well.

    Would you prefer LM with the vowels or or PF?

You got me on this one.. too much of a noob, I'm afraid.. could you elaborate on this?

I said that because the layouts have different answers for a common question in layout design: Which frequently-used consonants share a hand with the vowels?

The answer dictates which particular character sequences end up as rolls versus alternations, and which particular words can be typed with a single hand. This is another spot for personal preference to come up if you need a tie breaker: character sequences you need to type all the time but aren't in the broader corpus of an analyzer. If you tend to use certain consonants as shortcuts, putting those on the vowel side makes them harder to use keeping hand on mouse. Or if your name is either awkward or awesome to type because the consonants in it are also on the vowel side. Little things like that can affect the feel of a layout beyond what the stats will tell you. In your case it sounds like German is the biggest special consideration so the amount of time you spend in each language might help decide between Gallium or something like Bone.

Thanks a ton for the input! Ooh, so you were basically asking about actual consonants - got it. :)

I'll give all of that some serious thought. Right now struggling with updating the keymap on my keyboard, so finally need to get into all that firmware business. 😬

Do you use vim? I am switching to a 40% split columnar keyboard (from 110+ wpm Qwerty traditional board) and this is the perfect time for me to commit to a layout change. I'm trying to find a layout for English prose and programming on vim (not necessarily hjkl because there are more efficient movements) and was wondering if you have any thoughts on how Gallium, Gallium v2, Graphite, Sturdy, and Engram 2.0/Engrammer compares. I've crossed off the rest of the modern layouts, notably Canary which is excellent for prose but particularly bad for vim even at first glance. I feel like post-Colemak-DH layouts are more refined and I don't need compromises with hotkey compatibility that Colemak brings. On a Qwerty traditional board, I am experiencing some pain on both pinkies--not sure if this has more to do with layouts or that it's not a split/tented board.

I've come across a stats-based comparison but don't know how much weight each metric should be given: SFBs, DSFBs, LSBs, rolls, and redirects (my intuition as a decently fast typer is dsfb > lsb > sfb > rolls > redirects in terms of importance, but I could be totally wrong). I think I prefer not having to remap any keys on a layout because that tends to taint the spirit of the layout (unless it's an inconsequential change to the status but I trust the creators of the layouts as well as their proponents more than my intuition. After all, people who have only ever used Qwerty probably don't realize there's a "problem" with the layout).

Any insights much appreciated.

I don’t use vim so no personal opinion there, but I know there are some threads in this sub occasionally about alt layouts and vim. Some people use a vim layer instead so they can optimize for prose.

The hierarchy of stats might be different for everyone, you really just need a balanced layout that doesn’t have any bad stat outliers for the sake of optimizing another stat. For example I’d say as a starting point it’s important to me that my SFB score is not too much higher than 1%, but beyond that I’d rather keep the other stats pretty good than get THE BEST sfb score. Redirects on pinkie/ring can really suck, but not all redirects are uncomfortable so it’s hard to pin a value rank on each stat like you asked for. Hope this helps.

Personally, I've taken Gallium (v1) to 100wpm before moving onto a self-made custom layout and can only really speak about that one out of the three you've mentioned (and only English).

There are a couple of versions available for different keyboards and for traditional vs. angle-mod fingerings. Since you mentioned you'll be using a colstag board, the creator on the AKL Discord server has mentioned that the original version (the one seen on the Github README) is meant to better accommodate those types of boards. I wish the creator would go back and document the different versions so that people don't get confused upon seeing additional files in the repository with the version names.

The layout flows nicely, and I never really encountered any pain points while using it. Granted, the layout doesn't contain as many inward rolls as I would have liked, but for a comfortable layout with good all-around stats, it's easily a top recommendation. The only other thing about Gallium that personally bothered me was the fact that the right index finger doesn't get much use in general, being used somewhere between 10-11% of the time according to the cmini bot on the AKL Discord server. The right ring finger gets used quite a bit, and personally my ring fingers aren't the most dexterous so I ended up abandoning it after learning it for several weeks.

That all being said, Recurva is made by the same creator and is currently being tried out by many users in the AKL Discord so it might be worthwhile to hop in and ask about Recurva experiences there.

It's a modified version of rollla that replaces angle mod for traditional fingering, mostly mirrored for left thumb space, and (somewhat) rearranged for comfort on column-staggered keyboards:

Rollla:

y o u b .  x k c l v
 i a e n ,  m h s r t
  ' / p w z  f d g j q

My modifications:

v l c d k  . b u o y
t r s h f  , n e a i
z x g m q  w p / ' j

It's not perfect and there's still more ring finger usage than I'd like but in this case I'm willing to put up with it for the sake of high inward rolls and low overall SFB and SFS.

I put your version on ANSI as-is, right thumb on space works better.

I never know how to put these skeleton layouts onto ergo .. too many keys not specified. Then layers etc ....

Can you tell me the differences between Gallium v1 and v2?

Gallium (v1):

 b l d c v  j y o u ,
 n r t s g  p h a e i
 x q m w z  k f ' ; .

Gallium (v2):

 b l d c v  j f o u ,
 n r t s g  y h a e i
 x q m w z  k p ' ; .

As for the actual use cases, v2 was intended to be a little better for row staggered boards while v1 can be good for both row and column staggered boards. Honestly speaking, you could probably pick either one for any kind of board and it'll be fine.

Among these three, I would choose Gallium, but with a few changes:

    swapping , and ; to reduce pinky stretch.

    a combo in ,. for ;.

    using the key where they put , for something else, like ?.

    swapping top and bottom row in the left side.

Q X M W J Z Y O U ? 
N R T S G P H A E I
B L D C V K F ' , . 

I use a similar layout and tried to move , and . from its qwerty position but the experience wasn't good.

I would go even further, actually. Moving ' below l and ,. to their original positions. The sfbs it would introduce are really not a problem in practice and much better than the increased pinky usage.

Do you really like Engrams all the punctuation in the centre?
Tech-Buffoon
•
4mo ago

I actually find the idea quite intriguing, yes. I know there's the tradeoff of not having letters there / shifting those somewhere else. But in general, I do need to use a lot of punctuation (I think). Though recurva-alternative-layout 2 for colstag (if it's called that, on it's dedicated GitHub page anyway), there's punctuation on the right hand bottom row, also intriguing. So many intriguing things, phew.. 😵‍💫

Right layout for me

Hey all,

I'll start by saying I am mostly unfamiliar with keyboard layouts. I've been using qwerty all my life. In the last year, I've developed some pains in my hands, wrists, and shoulders that comes and goes. I've gone to a chiropractor and have done some trigger point therapy, which has helped some in the last few weeks.

I currently use a Cloud 9 split ergo Tkl. At first, this helped but some of the pain and occasional burning is back.

With all of this said, I feel like the Cloud 9 is a rather large board for my hand size, and the qwerty layout isn't helping.

For reference: I'm not a developer or programmer. I'm a marketer and writer. I don't need to type 120+ wpm. I can easily push to that speed after getting warmed up on Monkey type, but don't care.

Also, the first pain I felt months ago was a muscle pain on my right side pinkie which occurred when reaching for the backspace button on a new mech keyboard with brown switches. I feel like the overall stretch required of qwerty and using my small fingers to access keys is not helping.

I've certainly heard of Coleman and dvorak. Just hoping for direction to decide which one.

The first step is an ergo keyboard. That's both the best solution and easiest switch to make. The second is posture/exercises. Going to alt layouts is diminishing returns. I would even say try a different ergo board before a different layout. I like the look of the Glove80 but have no direct experience.

If you want to switch layouts the first thing you have to decide is if you want qwerty similarity to make it easier to switch (and how much), or if you want a full change layout. They go from keeping lots of qwerty to keeping no qwerty.

I think a good choice is a programmable keyboard so you can put Backspace in a better location. Colemak commonly puts it on CapsLock and it works well. Putting on a thumb key works well too. You can also put shift and ctrl on a thumb key which works well.

If you think qwerty has too much reaching and want a quick fix, look at r/Norman. It's made to be an easy transition from qwerty and puts the common letters in better spots, but not as optimized as others that change more.

+1, despite my limited knowledge. I recently built my very first split ergo (cheapino) to test the waters and can say it's weird at first, to be able to hit backspace on one of 3 (or 6 total) thumb keys, but it's reaaaally nice. I can understand the strain from hitting a key with a pinky religiously and I think I only got away without that from using ctrl+backspace and also (wrongly) using my right ring finger instead of pinky when in a traditional row stagger qwerty 100% board.

So yeah, I personally think the split is going to do wonders for your back and shoulders while stuff like pinky stagger (column stagger) is going to help with finger / lower arm strain.

As comment above states, you don't necessarily have to switch layouts right away when switching to a split ergo, but I did some research and concluded it's a good idea to not learn qwerty on the colstag split only to unlearn it again when switching layouts. If you decide to dive in and switch both, physical board and keymap/layout, I think it's less effort overall and quicker rewards. Just go easy at first if you're already hurt, eh? Might be wishful thinking, but maybe one of your medical professionals who's treating you could chime in when you show them your new keyboard and your plan to switch layouts by (most likely daily?) typing practice.

Last note, again about pinky pain from bckspc: there are boards out there with even more thumb keys (to take away the effort of function keys from ring or pinky), but home row mods (i.e. holding keys down to trigger shift, ctrl, alt, OSkey) can yield similar results, especially when you're not looking for raw speed but comfort instead. :)

All the best for you and your recuperation!

P.s.: my phone liked to autocorrect Colemak to Coleman, too. Very annoying, until just now: finally deleted that bugger from the dictionary, could be worthwhile for you to do the same when doing your akl research, hehe!

You may not know this but chiropractors aren't doctors or trained in medicine in any way. Chiropractics was invented by a guy who thought that ALL disease could be cured by adjusting your spine. Any benefit you may feel just comes from the placebo effect. I would recommend spending your money on a nice split ergonomic mechanical keyboard instead :)

the question is how far should your journey go or how extreme do you want it to be

buy a columnar ergo board with a new layout is extreme

there are always finished products to buy or a DIY solution, i name only examples out of the box

there more easy paths, like buy a split staggered board and only change your arm postions, no software changes

2. UHK or dygma raise which offers options for a better thumb usage and give the pinky more rest

3. columar staggered with thumb keys, you have to learn new, if you go this far i suggest to make ONE decision, learning qwerty new on this hardware and later change the layout is a BAD decision

staggered keyboards as not ergonomic and qwerty as bad as it is are here to stay, if you go down deep in the rabit hole i suggest keep qwerty as it is and learn a new layout on a columnar keyboard as ONE big step, no babysteps between, will cause a lot of brain chaos

if you are deepest in the hole there are different boards for different audiences, the best for me are: glove80 voyager dygma defy DIY really small which you also can order ready to go

the main issue is learning what are your goals, i built a reviung41 and for me there are to less keys, i learned i want more, other people are happiest with 32 keys, there is not one true answer, the answer is everbody has to find his_her own sweet spot

Glove80 is excellent, that'll be the biggest change. Then I recommend having two dedicated layers for symbols and numbers, you can program those with the a programmable board, or with third party software like kmonad or AHK. Alongside a symbol layer, I highly recommend having a navigation layer with arrow keys, modifiers, Home/End, Backspace, Cut, Copy, Paste, Undo, Save, etc. Honestly that might be more important than a symbol layer. Then if you still want more comfort you can look into learning a new keyboard layout.

The idea is to minimize movement, make things easy. An ergo board will do that the most, especially the glove80. Then a sym/number and navigation layer will make pressing most of the keys you use on a day to day basis way way closer to the home position (typing periods and commas for me is incredibly smooth since they are both on the home row and accessed by a thumb key). Finally, you can look into optimizing your letters. I recommend Colemak-dh or a boutique design (like Canary, Recurva, Sturdy, Semimak, etc.). Dvorak and regular Colemak are worse than these other options.

Time is running out.. Gallium, Recurva or Engram?

TL;DR Can those who know any of these layouts share their insights?

Hi all, thanks a ton for this helpful sub!

Like so many others, I'm trying to pinpoint the (hopefully somewhat) ideal layout. Trouble is, my vacation will end soon and I'd like to put some training hours in for a new (and my first) akl.

Target device is a 3x5 +3 thumb keys split colstag wired keyboard currently running vanilla Miryoku (Colemak DH on base layer). Will likely upgrade to a 3*6+3 in the near future, though.

Admittedly, from all the research I've done so far I know that comparing layouts is hard and metrics differ wildly regarding subjective significance as well as target corpus. I'm looking for a daily driver working in IT, but not coding, so typing / software requirements emails more than actual code.

As a bonus requirement, I need to type in both English and German at work, so if any of these layouts would be useful for this, I appreciate if you share your thoughts. (Currently also looking into bone/neo for this part)

Thanks again and happy belated new year!

Very nice layouts so personal preference will definitely come into play here.

With Gallium and Recurva you get consonants on the left which I like for common windows shortcuts not needing my mouse hand. They also have less single finger bigrams. I don't know German but I would think it would benefit from having R on the home row more than C.

Recurva will minimize your center column usage and shift the load to the pinkies, if that's your priority. Recurva's YOU trigram doesn't work for me because I don't like to use pinkie extend much, but other folks may have no problem with this movement.

Although low in center column usage overall, Recurva puts M and W on the bottom row as a lateral stretch for the index finger which is more than I'd want to be using those keys. Meanwhile Gallium puts P and G in center columns, but they are on the center row so not as awkward to type for me. Pinkie/ring scissors are lowest overall for Gallium but BR is very awkward for me.

Would you prefer LM with the vowels or or PF?

The layout I use for myself is distinct but closest to Gallium, with an EO stack so higher SFBs and less pinkie use. Definitely produces a "high alternation" feel, but I like that because of the very low redirects.
Tech-Buffoon

Thanks a ton for all your input, sphlonglonius! :) All things considered so far, I'm currently leaning towards gallium which was originally suggested by another helpful redditor as well.

    Would you prefer LM with the vowels or or PF?

You got me on this one.. too much of a noob, I'm afraid.. could you elaborate on this?
shponglonius

4mo ago

I said that because the layouts have different answers for a common question in layout design: Which frequently-used consonants share a hand with the vowels?

The answer dictates which particular character sequences end up as rolls versus alternations, and which particular words can be typed with a single hand. This is another spot for personal preference to come up if you need a tie breaker: character sequences you need to type all the time but aren't in the broader corpus of an analyzer. If you tend to use certain consonants as shortcuts, putting those on the vowel side makes them harder to use keeping hand on mouse. Or if your name is either awkward or awesome to type because the consonants in it are also on the vowel side. Little things like that can affect the feel of a layout beyond what the stats will tell you. In your case it sounds like German is the biggest special consideration so the amount of time you spend in each language might help decide between Gallium or something like Bone.

Thanks a ton for the input! Ooh, so you were basically asking about actual consonants - got it. :)

Do you use vim? I am switching to a 40% split columnar keyboard (from 110+ wpm Qwerty traditional board) and this is the perfect time for me to commit to a layout change. I'm trying to find a layout for English prose and programming on vim (not necessarily hjkl because there are more efficient movements) and was wondering if you have any thoughts on how Gallium, Gallium v2, Graphite, Sturdy, and Engram 2.0/Engrammer compares. I've crossed off the rest of the modern layouts, notably Canary which is excellent for prose but particularly bad for vim even at first glance. I feel like post-Colemak-DH layouts are more refined and I don't need compromises with hotkey compatibility that Colemak brings. On a Qwerty traditional board, I am experiencing some pain on both pinkies--not sure if this has more to do with layouts or that it's not a split/tented board.

I've come across a stats-based comparison but don't know how much weight each metric should be given: SFBs, DSFBs, LSBs, rolls, and redirects (my intuition as a decently fast typer is dsfb > lsb > sfb > rolls > redirects in terms of importance, but I could be totally wrong). I think I prefer not having to remap any keys on a layout because that tends to taint the spirit of the layout (unless it's an inconsequential change to the status but I trust the creators of the layouts as well as their proponents more than my intuition. After all, people who have only ever used Qwerty probably don't realize there's a "problem" with the layout).

Any insights much appreciated.

I don’t use vim so no personal opinion there, but I know there are some threads in this sub occasionally about alt layouts and vim. Some people use a vim layer instead so they can optimize for prose.

The hierarchy of stats might be different for everyone, you really just need a balanced layout that doesn’t have any bad stat outliers for the sake of optimizing another stat. For example I’d say as a starting point it’s important to me that my SFB score is not too much higher than 1%, but beyond that I’d rather keep the other stats pretty good than get THE BEST sfb score. Redirects on pinkie/ring can really suck, but not all redirects are uncomfortable so it’s hard to pin a value rank on each stat like you asked for. Hope this helps.

Personally, I've taken Gallium (v1) to 100wpm before moving onto a self-made custom layout and can only really speak about that one out of the three you've mentioned (and only English).

There are a couple of versions available for different keyboards and for traditional vs. angle-mod fingerings. Since you mentioned you'll be using a colstag board, the creator on the AKL Discord server has mentioned that the original version (the one seen on the Github README) is meant to better accommodate those types of boards. I wish the creator would go back and document the different versions so that people don't get confused upon seeing additional files in the repository with the version names.

The layout flows nicely, and I never really encountered any pain points while using it. Granted, the layout doesn't contain as many inward rolls as I would have liked, but for a comfortable layout with good all-around stats, it's easily a top recommendation. The only other thing about Gallium that personally bothered me was the fact that the right index finger doesn't get much use in general, being used somewhere between 10-11% of the time according to the cmini bot on the AKL Discord server. The right ring finger gets used quite a bit, and personally my ring fingers aren't the most dexterous so I ended up abandoning it after learning it for several weeks.

That all being said, Recurva is made by the same creator and is currently being tried out by many users in the AKL Discord so it might be worthwhile to hop in and ask about Recurva experiences there.

It's a modified version of rollla that replaces angle mod for traditional fingering, mostly mirrored for left thumb space, and (somewhat) rearranged for comfort on column-staggered keyboards:

Rollla:

y o u b .  x k c l v
 i a e n ,  m h s r t
  ' / p w z  f d g j q

My modifications:

v l c d k  . b u o y

It's not perfect and there's still more ring finger usage than I'd like but in this case I'm willing to put up with it for the sake of high inward rolls and low overall SFB and SFS.

I put your version on ANSI as-is, right thumb on space works better.

I never know how to put these skeleton layouts onto ergo .. too many keys not specified. Then layers etc ....

Can you tell me the differences between Gallium v1 and v2?

Gallium (v1):

 b l d c v  j y o u ,
 n r t s g  p h a e i
 x q m w z  k f ' ; .

Gallium (v2):

 b l d c v  j f o u ,
 n r t s g  y h a e i
 x q m w z  k p ' ; .

As for the actual use cases, v2 was intended to be a little better for row staggered boards while v1 can be good for both row and column staggered boards. Honestly speaking, you could probably pick either one for any kind of board and it'll be fine.

Among these three, I would choose Gallium, but with a few changes:

    swapping , and ; to reduce pinky stretch.

    a combo in ,. for ;.

    using the key where they put , for something else, like ?.

    swapping top and bottom row in the left side.

Q X M W J Z Y O U ? 
N R T S G P H A E I
B L D C V K F ' , . 

I use a similar layout and tried to move , and . from its qwerty position but the experience wasn't good.

I would go even further, actually. Moving ' below l and ,. to their original positions. The sfbs it would introduce are really not a problem in practice and much better than the increased pinky usage.

Do you really like Engrams all the punctuation in the centre?

I actually find the idea quite intriguing, yes. I know there's the tradeoff of not having letters there / shifting those somewhere else. But in general, I do need to use a lot of punctuation (I think). Though recurva-alternative-layout 2 for colstag (if it's called that, on it's dedicated GitHub page anyway), there's punctuation on the right hand bottom row, also intriguing. So many intriguing things, phew.. 😵‍💫

Hi Greg, I ended up with gallium, have been practicing for a while and am now up to around 38wpm. Happy to report that it feels pretty decent. :)

Recurva
An alternate keyboard layout focused on efficiency

recurva

Recurva's name originates from the Eucalyptus Recurva, a critically endangered species endemic to only a tiny section of New South Wales, Australia.

The goal with Recurva was to solely focus on the rudimentary statistics that I personally feel are the most important in layout design to achieve the best stats that would still be usable. The main stats I considered were:

    Same Finger Bigrams - SFBs (two letters pressed in a row with the same finger).
    Same Finger Skipgrams - SFS (two letters pressed on the same finger but with one letter separating the two).
    Hand balance stays somewhat equal (total usage of letters calculated).

What does Recurva accomplish?

Recurva accomplishes a new local minimum for Same Finger Skipgrams (SFS) using less efficient elements, previously Semimak held the lowest SFS of any english layout using columns such as RL, HNB which perform extremely well in that category.

Before understanding Recurva's niche it's best to examine the commonly used elements, typically layouts that have R on the pinky cannot have RL as a column which isn't the best for SFBs or SFS, even still it fits many more advantageous compositions.

SFBs
rl + lr: 0.087%,
hl + lh: 0.017%,
nl + ln: 0.073%,

SFS
rl + lr: 0.377%,
hl + lh: 0.252%,
nl + ln: 0.576%,

All statistics presented here use Shai corpus unless specified.

Looking at these stats you could conclude that HL is better than RL but as mentioned before compositionally this is rarely true because R is much more un-agreeable as a letter in comparison with H. R's most common partners that make sense from as SFB standpoint create a lot of SFS unfortunately which means it often gets put by itself on the pinky homerow or in combination with RL.

Why is this important? because L is just as un-agreeable as R and also causes trouble for the composition, it has the highest number of repeats of any letter (ll: 0.713%) and only goes with the letters I've shown above and the letter M (SFBs: ml + lm: 0.028%, SFS: ml + lm: 0.298%)
Analysis of Whorf and Semimak

Before we get to the differences between Recurva and layouts like Whorf and Semimak we need to talk about what separates Whorf and Semimak apart:

whorf                          semimak_jq
f l h d m  v w o u ,           f l h v z  ' w u o y
s r n t k  g y a e i           s r n t k  c d e a i
x j b z q  p c ' ; .           x j b m q  p g , . /
Sfb:               0.605%      Sfb:               0.798%
Sfs:               6.049%      Sfs:               5.688%
Scissors           0.817%      Scissors:          0.955%
Lsbs               1.988%      Lsbs:              2.122%

Inrolls:           22.39%      Inrolls:           20.24%
Outrolls:          22.48%      Outrolls:          22.18%
Total Rolls:       44.88%      Total Rolls:       42.42%
Onehands:          1.681%      Onehands:          1.862%

Total Alternates:  38.47%      Total Alternates:  40.32%
Total Redirects:   6.293%      Total Redirects:   6.461%

One of the main reasons Semimak(jq) performs better on SFS is because IY performs better than CY and the rest of the index column, while this does decrease SFS dramatically (for this level of optimisation) it sacrifices being able to place every piece of punctuation with the vowels like with Whorf's vowel block. Because of this Semimak_jq specifically places comma below E and apostrophe with the index column which creates quite a few SFBs.

Semimak's Y interactions:

SFBs
iy + yi: 0.039% - y/ + /y: 0.001% - total of 0.040%

SFS
iy + yi: 0.257% - y/ + /y: 0.005% - total of 0.262%


Whorf's Y interactions:

SFBs
cy + yc: 0.042% - yg + gy: 0.024% - yw + wy: 0.011%
yv + vy: 0.006% - py + yp: 0.035% - total of 0.217%

SFS
cy + yc: 0.085% - yg + gy: 0.060% - yw + wy: 0.176%
yv + vy: 0.015% - py + yp: 0.118% - total of 0.427%

Y interaction delta:

SFBs
Whorf's O.217% - Semimak's 0.040% = 0.177%

SFS
Whorf's 0.427% - Semimak's 0.262% = O.165%


Semimak's E interactions:

SFBs
e, + ,e: 0.190% - eu + ue: 0.148% - u, + ,u: 0.006% - total of 0.344%

SFS
e, + ,e: 0.256% - eu + ue: 0.655% - u, + ,u: 0.044% - total of 0.955%

Whorf's E interactions:

SFBs
e; + ;e: 0.005% - eu + ue: 0.148% - u; + ;u: 0.000% - total of 0.153%

SFS
e; + ;e: 0.021% - eu + ue: 0.655% - u; + ;u: 0.002% - total of 0.678%

E interaction delta:

SFBs
Semimak's 0.344% - Whorf's 0.153% = 0.191%

SFS
Semimak's 0.955% - Whorf's 0.678% = 0.277%

This doesn't even account for other corpora where IY scales much better than any other interaction with Y such as monkeytype's 10k and 450k (relevance to real-world application is up for debate).

Another reason for Whorf having more SFS is because of the position of D, on Whorf this is placed on the T index where it generates more SFS than the DC index Semimak opts for but also saves SFBs because of the accumulative conflicts that all the letters on Semimak's index, especially apostrophe.

Now finally we come to Recurva, Recurva uses RN and LHM instead of RL and HNB which are both used on Whorf and Semimak to achieve their extremely impressive SFB and SFS stats respectively. In the very specific combination of letters that completes Recurva it has worse elements that creates a better stats than Semimak on almost all fronts except for usage of less domininant fingers.

Recurva's RN:           Semimak's RL:
rn + nr: 0.191%         rl + lr: 0.073%
rn + nr (SFS): 0.941%   rl + lr (SFS): 0.546%

Total Redirects:   5.393%      Total Redirects:   6.461%

So how does Recurva use worse parts to create a better whole? The main innovation is using H as the index on the vowel hand, this can only be done by mutating the RL, HNB columns into RN, LHM. As mentioned earlier HL is typically worse for the composition because RL gets rid of two very unagreeable letters without a huge difference to the main stats. In this very specific scenario because we've opted for Semimak style vowels we can place period on that column while still having less SFBs and SFS than Semimak's DC index.

Because of the columns we've chosen most of the SFBs generated in the layout come almost entirely from UE, OA, RN, Y,, and the accumulative period SFBs with the H elements.

If you're confused about any explanations here I encourage you to visit the Keyboard Layout Doc: https://bit.ly/keyboard-layouts-doc, it has a wealth of knowledge to read through if theory of layout composition ever interests you.
Variations

Recurva has a couple variations adaptated for columnar stagger keyboards, these don't change any stats except for Lateral Stretch Bigrams:

recurva-colstag                recurva-colstag2
f r d p v  q m u o y           f r d p v  q l u o y
s n t c b  . h e a i           s n t c b  m h e a i
z x k g w  j l ; ' ,           z x k g w  j . ; ' ,

There won't be any downloads for these variations as it's pretty much assumed that if you have a columnar staggered keyboard it will most likely be programmable.
History

Recurva was found accidently while exploring different composition's on Oxey's Layout Playground - an interactive website that allows you to swap letters in a layout and see the result in real time - https://o-x-e-y.github.io/layouts/playground/index.html.

I had been trying to make RN, LHM as a composition work since the start of 2023 in january after I completed Gallium, Richard Davison (https://github.com/rdavison creator of Graphite) and I collaborated on a layout that used R on the pinky and LHM after I commented on how technically HL was better to RL in isolation, that layout resulted in Ruthenium which doesn't really accomplish anything significant other than existing as a somewhat new combination and some decent stats. Although I didn't look at it again until recently, it bears a striking resemblance to Recurva in a few ways and definitely reinforced the idea

Total Rolls: 44.955%
Onehands: 2.873%

Total Alternates: 38.197%
Total Redirects: 4.799%

After Ruthenium I experimented many times with LHM as a column. I partially wanted to try RN as a replacement to RL, HNB as it made the most sense when mutating those columns but also because I admired the structure of Clemenpine's Pine layout - https://github.com/ClemenPine/pine-layout which exhibits RN on the left middle finger. To my knowledge the first layout to actually use RN and LHM together was Halmak.

After a couple months of sporadically trying the combination, in March I got inspired to experiment with the combination while trying Semimak vowels at the same time.

Total Redirects:   5.146%      Total Redirects:   7.309%

Ultimately all of these are archival layouts as Recurva accomplishes what they didn't, some of these layouts come close to Semimak's stats but none exceed its superb stats.

3 months later (July) and curious once again about the composition I tried it again but in conjunction with Whorf style vowels.

pycnantha
f r d p v  z q o u ,
s n t c y  k h a e i
x j b g w  m l ' ; .
Sfb:  0.709%
Dsfb: 6.048%

Total Rolls: 48.237%
Onehands: 1.297%

Total Alternates: 35.722%
Total Redirects: 5.854%

Pycnantha's goal was to lower scissors coming from Whorf and to emulate features I favour from Oxey's Sturdy - https://o-x-e-y.github.io/layouts/sturdy/index.html while keeping the stats very close to Whorf. Pycnantha is only a few swaps from Recurva but it would be 2 months before I discovered it as I was hesitant to try Semimak style vowels again and assumed I could not achieve a better result.

The modification into Recurva is quite simple, in this composition K creates SFBs with the H index that cannot be avoided because the only other place K can go is with T which already has two letters in its column, the prime candidate to place elsewhere is B because its stats when paired in C indexes are very good but the issue is that that column is full and no other exchanges can take place.

Recurva only works because it removes the Letter Y from the C index and allows to you swap B into the C index and thus place the K into the T column.

Recurva
An alternate keyboard layout focused on efficiency

recurva

Recurva's name originates from the Eucalyptus Recurva, a critically endangered species endemic to only a tiny section of New South Wales, Australia.

The goal with Recurva was to solely focus on the rudimentary statistics that I personally feel are the most important in layout design to achieve the best stats that would still be usable. The main stats I considered were:

    Same Finger Bigrams - SFBs (two letters pressed in a row with the same finger).
    Same Finger Skipgrams - SFS (two letters pressed on the same finger but with one letter separating the two).
    Hand balance stays somewhat equal (total usage of letters calculated).

What does Recurva accomplish?

Recurva accomplishes a new local minimum for Same Finger Skipgrams (SFS) using less efficient elements, previously Semimak held the lowest SFS of any english layout using columns such as RL, HNB which perform extremely well in that category.

Before understanding Recurva's niche it's best to examine the commonly used elements, typically layouts that have R on the pinky cannot have RL as a column which isn't the best for SFBs or SFS, even still it fits many more advantageous compositions.

SFBs
rl + lr: 0.087%,
hl + lh: 0.017%,
nl + ln: 0.073%,

SFS
rl + lr: 0.377%,
hl + lh: 0.252%,
nl + ln: 0.576%,

All statistics presented here use Shai corpus unless specified.

Looking at these stats you could conclude that HL is better than RL but as mentioned before compositionally this is rarely true because R is much more un-agreeable as a letter in comparison with H. R's most common partners that make sense from as SFB standpoint create a lot of SFS unfortunately which means it often gets put by itself on the pinky homerow or in combination with RL.

Why is this important? because L is just as un-agreeable as R and also causes trouble for the composition, it has the highest number of repeats of any letter (ll: 0.713%) and only goes with the letters I've shown above and the letter M (SFBs: ml + lm: 0.028%, SFS: ml + lm: 0.298%)
Analysis of Whorf and Semimak

Before we get to the differences between Recurva and layouts like Whorf and Semimak we need to talk about what separates Whorf and Semimak apart:

whorf                          semimak_jq
f l h d m  v w o u ,           f l h v z  ' w u o y
s r n t k  g y a e i           s r n t k  c d e a i
x j b z q  p c ' ; .           x j b m q  p g , . /
Sfb:               0.605%      Sfb:               0.798%
Sfs:               6.049%      Sfs:               5.688%
Scissors           0.817%      Scissors:          0.955%
Lsbs               1.988%      Lsbs:              2.122%

Inrolls:           22.39%      Inrolls:           20.24%
Outrolls:          22.48%      Outrolls:          22.18%
Total Rolls:       44.88%      Total Rolls:       42.42%
Onehands:          1.681%      Onehands:          1.862%

Total Alternates:  38.47%      Total Alternates:  40.32%
Total Redirects:   6.293%      Total Redirects:   6.461%

One of the main reasons Semimak(jq) performs better on SFS is because IY performs better than CY and the rest of the index column, while this does decrease SFS dramatically (for this level of optimisation) it sacrifices being able to place every piece of punctuation with the vowels like with Whorf's vowel block. Because of this Semimak_jq specifically places comma below E and apostrophe with the index column which creates quite a few SFBs.

SFS
Semimak's 0.955% - Whorf's 0.678% = 0.277%

This doesn't even account for other corpora where IY scales much better than any other interaction with Y such as monkeytype's 10k and 450k (relevance to real-world application is up for debate).

Another reason for Whorf having more SFS is because of the position of D, on Whorf this is placed on the T index where it generates more SFS than the DC index Semimak opts for but also saves SFBs because of the accumulative conflicts that all the letters on Semimak's index, especially apostrophe.

Now finally we come to Recurva, Recurva uses RN and LHM instead of RL and HNB which are both used on Whorf and Semimak to achieve their extremely impressive SFB and SFS stats respectively. In the very specific combination of letters that completes Recurva it has worse elements that creates a better stats than Semimak on almost all fronts except for usage of less domininant fingers.

Recurva's RN:           Semimak's RL:
rn + nr: 0.191%         rl + lr: 0.073%
rn + nr (SFS): 0.941%   rl + lr (SFS): 0.546%

Total Redirects:   5.393%      Total Redirects:   6.461%

So how does Recurva use worse parts to create a better whole? The main innovation is using H as the index on the vowel hand, this can only be done by mutating the RL, HNB columns into RN, LHM. As mentioned earlier HL is typically worse for the composition because RL gets rid of two very unagreeable letters without a huge difference to the main stats. In this very specific scenario because we've opted for Semimak style vowels we can place period on that column while still having less SFBs and SFS than Semimak's DC index.

Because of the columns we've chosen most of the SFBs generated in the layout come almost entirely from UE, OA, RN, Y,, and the accumulative period SFBs with the H elements.

If you're confused about any explanations here I encourage you to visit the Keyboard Layout Doc: https://bit.ly/keyboard-layouts-doc, it has a wealth of knowledge to read through if theory of layout composition ever interests you.
Variations

Recurva has a couple variations adaptated for columnar stagger keyboards, these don't change any stats except for Lateral Stretch Bigrams:

recurva-colstag                recurva-colstag2
f r d p v  q m u o y           f r d p v  q l u o y
s n t c b  . h e a i           s n t c b  m h e a i
z x k g w  j l ; ' ,           z x k g w  j . ; ' ,

There won't be any downloads for these variations as it's pretty much assumed that if you have a columnar staggered keyboard it will most likely be programmable.
History

Recurva was found accidently while exploring different composition's on Oxey's Layout Playground - an interactive website that allows you to swap letters in a layout and see the result in real time - https://o-x-e-y.github.io/layouts/playground/index.html.

I had been trying to make RN, LHM as a composition work since the start of 2023 in january after I completed Gallium, Richard Davison (https://github.com/rdavison creator of Graphite) and I collaborated on a layout that used R on the pinky and LHM after I commented on how technically HL was better to RL in isolation, that layout resulted in Ruthenium which doesn't really accomplish anything significant other than existing as a somewhat new combination and some decent stats. Although I didn't look at it again until recently, it bears a striking resemblance to Recurva in a few ways and definitely reinforced the idea

Total Rolls: 44.955%
Onehands: 2.873%

Total Alternates: 38.197%
Total Redirects: 4.799%

After Ruthenium I experimented many times with LHM as a column. I partially wanted to try RN as a replacement to RL, HNB as it made the most sense when mutating those columns but also because I admired the structure of Clemenpine's Pine layout - https://github.com/ClemenPine/pine-layout which exhibits RN on the left middle finger. To my knowledge the first layout to actually use RN and LHM together was Halmak.

After a couple months of sporadically trying the combination, in March I got inspired to experiment with the combination while trying Semimak vowels at the same time.

Total Redirects:   5.146%      Total Redirects:   7.309%

Ultimately all of these are archival layouts as Recurva accomplishes what they didn't, some of these layouts come close to Semimak's stats but none exceed its superb stats.

3 months later (July) and curious once again about the composition I tried it again but in conjunction with Whorf style vowels.

pycnantha
f r d p v  z q o u ,
s n t c y  k h a e i
x j b g w  m l ' ; .
Sfb:  0.709%
Dsfb: 6.048%

Lsbs: 1.643%

Inrolls: 22.737%
Outrolls: 25.499%
Total Rolls: 48.237%
Onehands: 1.297%

Total Alternates: 35.722%
Total Redirects: 5.854%

Pycnantha's goal was to lower scissors coming from Whorf and to emulate features I favour from Oxey's Sturdy - https://o-x-e-y.github.io/layouts/sturdy/index.html while keeping the stats very close to Whorf. Pycnantha is only a few swaps from Recurva but it would be 2 months before I discovered it as I was hesitant to try Semimak style vowels again and assumed I could not achieve a better result.

The modification into Recurva is quite simple, in this composition K creates SFBs with the H index that cannot be avoided because the only other place K can go is with T which already has two letters in its column, the prime candidate to place elsewhere is B because its stats when paired in C indexes are very good but the issue is that that column is full and no other exchanges can take place.

Recurva only works because it removes the Letter Y from the C index and allows to you swap B into the C index and thus place the K into the T column.

Tungsten mounting plate?
help

Is this idea too absurd or is it possible to actually get a quote for one from a vendor of custom parts or something like that?

Tungsten is extremely difficult to machine though I'm sure for the right amount of money you can find a shop that will make a one off.

what msdmsdx said stuff wrecks cuting tools but if u throw 1k or so at a maker im sure they could do it . no vendor will prob do this u have to contact a makerspace and have a big wallet . here an article from aplace that cuts for aerospace and lists issues with using the metal https://www.mmsonline.com/articles/what-it-takes-to-tackle-tungsten

The price of even just the raw metal sheet is pretty much ridiculous at roughly 80-100 usd per kg... then add the machining, which as noted is not as trivial as an aluminum plate... Totally possible, but I’d rather spend the money on something else... Why not just add an extra plate of bronze or steel on the bottom of the case if you want heft?

What are 4 types of keyboard layout?

Different characters, letters and symbols are not the only things that differ from layout to layout. There are also four different key arrangements commonly found in keyboards:

    ANSI (commonly known as US/American type), featuring horizontal, rectangular enter key and wide left Shift key;
    ISO (commonly know as European type), featuring 7-shaped enter key and short left Shift key together with additional regular key on the right of the left Shift key;
    JIS (commonly known as Japanese type), featuring multiple additional keys around spacebar, shortened spacebar, and an enter key similar in shape to ISO type, but wider;
    ABNT (commonly known as Brazilian type), which is identical to ISO type, but features an additional key to the left of right Shift key.

How to physically switch/change layouts or to make a multilingual keyboard?

We run Keyshorts for several years now and we learned that many people need to change their keyboard layout or to have multiple layouts on the same keyboard. Unfortunately, purchasing and replacing the keyboard is expensive and hard, and - in the case of quite a few layouts - impossible.

Keyboard stickers are a great solution for this. They are relatively cheap and easy to apply and come with many different layouts. You can even customize their caption and background colors.

If you simply want to switch your keyboard to another layout, we can suggest choosing our Simple Black stickers or language stickers.

If you want to have two languages on one keyboard, try our bilingual stickers. If you need even more, our trilingual stickers and quadrilingual stickers will be the perfect solution.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
This article is about the physical and visual arrangement of the keys of a computer keyboard and their function as defined by software. For the underlying physical structure and electronic mechanisms of computer keyboards, see Keyboard technology. For keyboards used in music, see Musical keyboard.
The 104-key US QWERTY layout

A keyboard layout is any specific physical, visual, or functional arrangement of the keys, legends, or key-meaning associations (respectively) of a computer keyboard, mobile phone, or other computer-controlled typographic keyboard.

Physical layout is the actual positioning of keys on a keyboard. Visual layout is the arrangement of the legends (labels, markings, engravings) that appear on those keys. Functional layout is the arrangement of the key-meaning association or keyboard mapping, determined in software, of all the keys of a keyboard; it is this (rather than the legends) that determines the actual response to a key press.

Modern computer keyboards are designed to send a scancode to the operating system (OS) when a key is pressed or released: this code reports only the key's row and column, not the specific character engraved on that key. The OS converts the scancode into a specific binary character code using a "scancode to character" conversion table, called the keyboard mapping table. This means that a physical keyboard may be dynamically mapped to any layout without switching hardware components—merely by changing the software that interprets the keystrokes. Often,[a] a user can change keyboard mapping in system settings. In addition, software may be available to modify or extend keyboard functionality. Thus the symbol shown on the physical key-top need not be the same as appears on the screen or goes into a document being typed. Some settings enable the user to type supplementary symbols that are not engraved on the keys used to invoke them.[b] Modern USB keyboards are plug-and-play; they communicate their (default) visual layout to the OS when connected (though the user is still able to reset this at will).
Key types
A typical 105-key computer keyboard, consisting of sections with different types of keys

A computer keyboard consists of alphanumeric or character keys for typing, modifier keys for altering the functions of other keys,[1] navigation keys for moving the text cursor on the screen, function keys and system command keys—such as Esc and Break—for special actions, and often a numeric keypad to facilitate calculations.[2][3]

There is some variation between different keyboard models in the physical layout—i.e., how many keys there are and how they are positioned on the keyboard.[4] However, differences between national layouts are mostly due to different selections and placements of symbols on the character keys.[5]
Character keys

The core section of a keyboard consists of character keys, which can be used to type letters and other characters. Typically, there are three rows of keys for typing letters and punctuation, an upper row for typing digits and special symbols, and the Space bar on the bottom row. The positioning of the character keys is similar to the keyboard of a typewriter.
Modifier keys
Main article: Modifier key
MIT "space-cadet" keyboard, a pre-ISO/IEC 9995 keyboard with a large number of modifier keys. It was equipped with four keys for bucky bits (Control, Meta, Hyper, and Super); and three shift keys, called "shift", "top", and "front".

Besides the character keys, a keyboard incorporates special keys that do nothing by themselves but modify the functions of other keys. For example, the ⇧ Shift key can be used to alter the output of character keys, whereas the Ctrl (control), Alt (alternate) and AltGr (alternative graphic) keys trigger special operations when used in concert with other keys. (Apple keyboards have differently labelled but equivalent keys, see below).

Typically, a modifier key is held down while another key is struck. To facilitate this, modifier keys usually come in pairs, one functionally identical key for each hand, so holding a modifier key with one hand leaves the other hand free to strike another key.

An alphanumeric key labelled with only a single letter (usually the capital form) can generally be struck to type either a lower case or capital letter, the latter requiring the simultaneous holding of the ⇧ Shift key. The ⇧ Shift key is also used to type the upper of two symbols engraved on a given key, the lower being typed without using the modifier key.

The Latin alphabet keyboard has a dedicated key for each of the letters A–Z, keys for punctuation and other symbols, usually a row of function keys, often a numeric keypad and some system control keys. In most languages except English, additional letters (some with diacritics) are required and some are present as standard on each national keyboard, as appropriate for its national language. These keyboards have another modified key, labelled AltGr (alternative graphic), to the right of the space bar. (US keyboards just have a second Alt key in this position). It can be used to type an extra symbol in addition to the two otherwise available with an alphanumeric key, and using it simultaneously with the ⇧ Shift key usually gives access to a fourth symbol. These third-level and fourth-level symbols may be engraved on the right half of the key top, or they may be unmarked. Cyrillic alphabet and Greek alphabet keyboards have similar arrangements.

Instead of the Ctrl, Alt and AltGr keys seen on commodity keyboards, Apple Keyboards have ⌘ Cmd (command) and ⌥ Option keys. The ⌥ Option key is used much like the AltGr, and the ⌘ Cmd key like the Ctrl and Alt, to access menu options and shortcuts. Macs have a Ctrl key for compatibility with programs that expect a more traditional keyboard layout. It is especially useful when using a terminal, X11 (a Unix environment included with OS X as an install option) or MS Windows. The key can generally be used to produce a secondary mouse click as well. There is also a Fn key on modern Mac keyboards, which is used for switching between use of the F1, F2, etc. keys either as function keys or for other functions like media control, accessing Spotlight, controlling the volume, or handling Mission Control. Fn key can be also found on smaller Windows and Linux laptops and tablets, where it serves a similar purpose.

Many Unix workstations (and also home computers like the Amiga) keyboards placed the Ctrl key to the left of the letter A, and the ⇪ Caps Lock key in the bottom left. This position of the Ctrl key is also used on the XO laptop, which does not have a ⇪ Caps Lock. The UNIX keyboard layout also differs in the placement of the Esc key, which is to the left of 1.

Some early keyboards experimented with using large numbers of modifier keys. The most extreme example of such a keyboard, the so-called "space-cadet keyboard" found on MIT LISP machines, had no fewer than seven modifier keys: four control keys, Ctrl, Meta, Hyper, and Super, along with three shift keys, ⇧ Shift, Top, and Front. This allowed the user to type over 8000 possible characters by playing suitable "chords" with many modifier keys pressed simultaneously.
Dead keys
Main article: Dead key

A dead key is a special kind of a modifier key that, instead of being held while another key is struck, is pressed and released before the other key. The dead key does not generate a character by itself, but it modifies the character generated by the key struck immediately after, typically making it possible to type a letter with a specific diacritic. For example, on some keyboard layouts, the grave accent key ` is a dead key: in this case, striking ` and then A results in à (a with grave accent); ` followed by ⇧ Shift+E results in È (E with grave accent). A grave accent in isolated form can be typed by striking ` and then Space bar.

A key may function as a dead key by default, or sometimes a normal key can temporarily be altered to function as a dead key by simultaneously holding down the secondary-shift key—AltGr or ⌥ Option: a typical example might be AltGr+6 a will produce â (assuming the "6" key is also the "^" key). In some systems, there is no indication to the user that a dead key has been struck, so the key appears dead, but in some text-entry systems the diacritical mark is displayed along with an indication that the system is waiting for another keystroke: either the base character to be marked, an additional diacritical mark, or Space bar to produce the diacritical mark in isolation.

Compared with the secondary-shift modifier key, the dead-key approach may be a little more complicated, but it allows more additional letters. Using AltGr, only one or (if used simultaneously with the normal shift key) two additional letters with each key, whereas using a dead key, a specific diacritic can be attached to a range of different base letters.
Compose key
Main article: Compose key

A Compose key can be characterized as a generic dead key that may in some systems be available instead of or in addition to the more specific dead keys. It allows access to a wide range of predefined extra characters by interpreting a whole sequence of keystrokes following it. For example, striking Compose followed by ' (apostrophe) and then A results in á (a with acute accent), Compose followed by A and then E results in æ (ae ligature), and Compose followed by O and then C results in © (circled c, copyright symbol).

The Compose key is supported by the X Window System (used by most Unix-like operating systems, including most Linux distributions). Some keyboards have a key labeled "Compose", but any key can be configured to serve this function. For example, the otherwise redundant right-hand ⊞ Win key may, when available, be used for this purpose. This can be emulated in Windows with third party programs, for example WinCompose.
System command keys

Depending on the application, some keyboard keys are not used to enter a printable character but instead are interpreted by the system as a formatting, mode shift, or special commands to the system. The following examples are found on personal computer keyboards.
SysRq and PrtSc
4800-52 mainframe / dumb terminal keyboard, c. mid-1980s. There is an obscure configuration of modifier and arrow keys, line feed key, break key, blank keys, and repeat key.

The system request (SysRq) and print screen (PrtSc or on some keyboards e.g. PrtScn) commands often share the same key. SysRq was used in earlier computers as a "panic" button to recover from crashes (and it is still used in this sense to some extent by the Linux kernel; see Magic SysRq key). The print screen command is used to capture the entire screen and send it to the printer, but in the present, it usually puts a screenshot in the clipboard.
Break key

The Break key/Pause key no longer has a well-defined purpose. Its origins go back to teleprinter users, who wanted a key that would temporarily interrupt the communications line. The Break key can be used by software in several different ways, such as to switch between multiple login sessions, to terminate a program, or to interrupt a modem connection.

In programming, especially old DOS-style BASIC, Pascal and C, Break is used (in conjunction with Ctrl) to stop program execution. In addition to this, Linux and variants, as well as many DOS programs, treat this combination the same as Ctrl+C. On modern keyboards, the break key is usually labeled Pause/Break. In most Microsoft Windows environments, the key combination WindowsPause brings up the system properties.
Escape key
Main article: Esc key

The escape key (often abbreviated Esc) "nearly all of the time"[6] signals Stop,[7] QUIT,[8] or let me "get out of a dialog"[6] (or pop-up window).[9]

Another common application today of the Esc key is to trigger the Stop button in many web browsers and operating systems.[6]

ESC was part of the standard keyboard of the Teletype Model 33 (introduced in 1964 and used with many early minicomputers).[10] The DEC VT50, introduced July 1974, also had an Esc key. The TECO text editor (c. 1963) and its descendant Emacs (c. 1985) use the Esc key extensively.

Historically it also served as a type of shift key, such that one or more following characters were interpreted differently, hence the term escape sequence, which refers to a series of characters, usually preceded by the escape character.[11][12]

On machines running Microsoft Windows, prior to the implementation of the Windows key on keyboards, the typical practice for invoking the "start" button was to hold down the control key and press escape. This process still works in Windows 10 and 11.[13]
Enter key

An "enter" key may terminate a paragraph of text and advance an editing cursor to the start of the next available line, similar to the "carriage return" key of a typewriter. When the attached system is processing a user command line, pressing "enter" may signal that the command has been completely entered and that the system may now process it.
Shift key

Shift key: when one presses shift and a letter, it will capitalize the letter pressed with the shift key. Another use is to type more symbols than appear to be available, for instance the semi-colon key is accompanied with a colon symbol on the top. To type a semi-colon, the key is pressed without pressing any other key. To type a colon, both this key and the Shift key are pressed concurrently. (Some systems make provision for users with mobility impairment by allowing the Shift key to be pressed first and then the desired symbol key).
Menu key, Command key, Windows key

The Menu key or Application key is a key found on Windows-oriented computer keyboards: on Apple keyboard the same function is provided by the Command key (labelled ⌘). It is used to launch a context menu with the keyboard rather than with the usual right mouse button. The key's symbol is usually a small icon depicting a cursor hovering above a menu. On some Samsung keyboards the cursor in the icon is not present, showing the menu only. This key was created at the same time as the Windows key. This key is normally used when the right mouse button is not present on the mouse. Some Windows public terminals do not have a Menu key on their keyboard to prevent users from right-clicking (however, in many Windows applications, a similar functionality can be invoked with the Shift+F10 keyboard shortcut).

The Windows key opens the 'Start' (applications) menu.
History
Main article: Typewriter
Keyboard of a Letter-Printing Telegraph Set built by Siemens and Halske in Russia c. 1900

Keyboard layouts have evolved over time, usually alongside major technology changes. Particularly influential have been: the Sholes and Glidden typewriter (1874, also known as Remington No. 1), the first commercially successful typewriter, which introduced QWERTY;[14] its successor, the Remington No. 2 (1878), which introduced the shift key; the IBM Selectric (1961), a very influential electric typewriter, which was imitated by computer keyboards;[15] and the IBM PC (1981), namely the Model M (1985), which is the basis for many modern keyboard layouts.

Within a community, keyboard layout is generally quite stable, due to the high training cost of touch-typing, and the resulting network effect of having a standard layout and high switching cost of retraining, and the suboptimal QWERTY layout is a case study in switching costs. Nevertheless, significant market forces can result in changes (as in Turkish adoption of QWERTY), and non-core keys are more prone to change, as they are less frequently used and less subject to the lock-in of touch-typing. The main, alphanumeric portion is typically stable, while symbol keys and shifted key values change somewhat, modifier keys more so, and function keys most of all: QWERTY dates to the No. 1 (1874)—though 1 and 0 were added later—shifted keys date in some cases to the No. 2 (1878), in other cases to the Selectric (1961), and modifier key placement largely dates to the Model M (1985); function key placement typically dates to the Model M, but varies significantly, particularly on laptops.

The earliest mechanical keyboards were used in musical instruments to play particular notes. With the advent of the printing telegraph, a keyboard was needed to select characters. Some of the earliest printing telegraph machines either used a piano keyboard outright or a layout similar to a piano keyboard.[16][17] The Hughes-Phelps printing telegraph piano keyboard laid keys A-N in left-to-right order on the black piano keys, and keys O-Z in right-to-left order on the white piano keys below.

In countries using the Latin script, the center, alphanumeric portion of the modern keyboard is most often based on the QWERTY design by Christopher Sholes. Sholes' layout was long thought to have been laid out in such a way that common two-letter combinations were placed on opposite sides of the keyboard so that his mechanical keyboard would not jam. However, evidence for this claim has often been contested. In 2012, an argument was advanced by two Japanese historians of technology showing that the key order on the earliest Sholes prototypes in fact followed the left-right and right-left arrangement of the contemporary Hughes-Phelps printing telegraph, described above.[18] Later iterations diverged progressively for various technical reasons, and strong vestiges of the left-right A-N, right-left O-Z arrangement can still be seen in the modern QWERTY layout. Sholes' chief improvement was thus to lay out the keys in rows offset horizontally from each other by three-eighths, three-sixteenths, and three-eighths inches to provide room for the levers and to reduce hand-movement distance. Although it has been demonstrated that the QWERTY layout is not the most efficient layout for typing,[19] it remains the standard.

Sholes chose the size of the keys to be on three-quarter [3⁄4, or 0.75] inch centers (about 19 mm, versus musical piano keys which are 23.5 mm or about 0.93 inches wide). 0.75 inches has turned out to be optimum for fast key entry by the average-size hand, and keyboards with this key size are called "full-sized keyboards".

On a manual typewriter, the operator could press the key down with a lighter touch for such characters as the period or comma, which did not occupy as much area on the paper. Since an electric typewriter supplied the force to the typebar itself after the typist merely touched the key, the typewriter itself had to be designed to supply different forces for different characters. To simplify this, the most common layout for electric typewriters in the United States differed from that for the one most common on manual typewriters. Single-quote and double-quote, instead of being above the keys for the digits 2 and 8 respectively, were placed together on a key of their own. The underscore, another light character, replaced the asterisk above the hyphen.

The ASCII communications code was designed so that characters on a mechanical teletypewriter keyboard could be laid out in a manner somewhat resembling that of a manual typewriter. This was imperfect, as some shifted special characters were moved one key to the left, as the number zero, although on the right, was low in code sequence. Later, when computer terminals were designed from less expensive electronic components, it was not necessary to have any bits in common between the shifted and unshifted characters on a given key. This eventually led to standards being adopted for the "bit-pairing" and "typewriter-pairing" forms of keyboards for computer terminals.

The typewriter-pairing standard came under reconsideration, on the basis that typewriters have many different keyboard arrangements.[20] The U.S. keyboard for the IBM PC, although it resembles the typewriter-pairing standard in most respects, differs in one significant respect: the braces are on the same two keys as the brackets, as their shifts. This innovation predated the IBM Personal Computer by several years.[21]

IBM adopted the 101/102 key layout on the PS/2 in 1987 (after previously using an 84-key keyboard that did not have a separate cursor and numeric keypads).

Most modern keyboards basically conform to the layout specifications contained in parts 1, 2, and 5 of the international standard series ISO/IEC 9995. These specifications were first defined by the user group at AFNOR in 1984 working under the direction of Alain Souloumiac.[22] Based on this work, a well-known ergonomic expert wrote a report[23] which was adopted at the ISO Berlin meeting in 1985 and became the reference for keyboard layouts.

The 104/105-key PC keyboard was born when two ⊞ Win keys and a ≣ Menu key were added on the bottom row (originally for the Microsoft Windows operating system). Newer keyboards may incorporate even further additions, such as Internet access (World Wide Web navigation) keys and multimedia (access to media players) buttons.
Physical, visual, and functional layouts

As noted before, the layout of a keyboard may refer to its physical (arrangement of keys), visual (physical labeling of keys), or functional (software response to a key press or release) layout.
Physical layouts
A comparison of common physical layouts. The ISO-standard physical layout (center left) is common, e.g., in the United Kingdom. Compared with the ANSI layout (top left), the enter key is vertical rather than horizontal. In addition, the left shift key is smaller, to make room for an additional key to its right. The JIS physical layout (bottom right) is the basis for Japanese keyboards. Here it is the right-hand shift key that is smaller. Furthermore, the space bar and backspace key are also smaller, to make room for four additional keys.

Physical layouts only address tangible differences among keyboards. When a key is pressed, the keyboard does not send a message such as the A-key is depressed but rather the left-most main key of the home row is depressed. (Technically, each key has an internal reference number, the scan code, and these numbers are what is sent to the computer when a key is pressed or released.) The keyboard and the computer each have no information about what is marked on that key, and it could equally well be the letter A or the digit 9. Historically, the user of the computer was requested to identify the functional layout of the keyboard when installing or customizing the operating system. Modern USB keyboards are plug-and-play; they communicate their visual layout to the OS when connected (though the user is still able to reset this at will).[example needed]

Today, most keyboards use one of three different physical layouts, usually referred to as simply ISO (ISO/IEC 9995-2), ANSI (ANSI-INCITS 154-1988), and JIS (JIS X 6002-1980), referring roughly to the organizations issuing the relevant worldwide, United States, and Japanese standards, respectively. (In fact, the physical layouts referred such as "ISO" and "ANSI" comply with the primary recommendations in the named standards, while each of these standards in fact also allows the other.) Keyboard layout in this sense may refer either to this broad categorization or to finer distinctions within these categories. For example, as of May 2008, Apple Inc. produces ISO, ANSI, and JIS desktop keyboards, each in both extended and compact forms. The extended keyboards have 110, 109, and 112 keys (ISO, ANSI, and JIS, respectively), and the compact models have 79, 78, and 80.
Visual layouts
A visual layout consisting of both factory-printed symbols and customized stickers

The visual layout includes the symbols printed on the physical keycaps. Visual layouts vary by language, country, and user preference, and any one physical and functional layout can be employed with a number of different visual layouts. For example, the "ISO" keyboard layout is used throughout Europe, but typical French, German, and UK variants of physically identical keyboards appear different because they bear different legends on their keys. Even blank keyboards—with no legends—are sometimes used to learn typing skills or by user preference.

Some users choose to attach custom labels on top of their keycaps. This can be, e.g., for masking foreign layouts, adding additional information such as shortcuts, learning aids, gaming controls, or solely for decorational purposes.
Functional layouts

The functional layout of the keyboard refers to the mapping between the physical keys, such as the A key, and software events, such as the letter "A" appearing on the screen. Usually the functional layout is set (in the system configuration) to match the visual layout of the keyboard being used, so that pressing a key will produce the expected result, corresponding to the legends on the keyboard. However, most operating systems have software that allow the user to easily switch between functional layouts, such as the language bar in Microsoft Windows. For example, a user with a Swedish keyboard who wishes to type more easily in German may switch to a functional layout intended for German—without regard to key markings—just as a Dvorak touch typist may choose a Dvorak layout regardless of the visual layout of the keyboard used.
Customized functional layouts
See also: Overlay keyboard

Functional layouts can be redefined or customized within the operating system, by reconfiguring the operating system keyboard driver, or with the use of a separate software application. Transliteration is one example of that whereby letters in other languages get matched to visible Latin letters on the keyboard by the way they sound. Thus, a touch typist can type in various foreign languages with a visible English-language keyboard only.

Mixed hardware-to-software keyboard extensions exist to overcome the above discrepancies between functional and visual layouts. A keyboard overlay[24] is a plastic or paper masks that can be placed over the empty space between the keys, providing the user with the functional use of various keys. Alternatively, a user applies keyboard stickers with an extra imprinted language alphabet and adds another keyboard layout via language support options in the operating system.[25] The visual layout of any keyboard can also be changed by simply replacing its keys or attaching labels to them, such as to change an English-language keyboard from the common QWERTY to the Dvorak layout, although for touch typists, the placement of the tactile bumps on the home keys is of more practical importance than that of the visual markings.

In the past, complex software that mapped many non-standard functions to the keys (such as a flight simulator) would be shipped with a "keyboard overlay", a large sheet of paper with pre-cut holes matching the key layout of a particular model of computer. When placed over the keyboard, the overlay provided a quick visual reference as to what each key's new function was, without blocking the keys or permanently modifying their appearance. The overlay was often made from good-quality laminated paper and was designed to fold up and fit in the game's packaging when not in use.
National variants

The U.S. IBM PC keyboard has 104 keys, while the PC keyboards for most other countries have 105 keys. In an operating system configured for a non-English language, the keys are placed differently. For example, keyboards designed for typing in Spanish have some characters shifted, to make room for Ñ/ñ; similarly those for French or Portuguese may have a special key for the character Ç/ç. Keyboards designed for Japanese may have special keys to switch between Japanese and Latin scripts, and the character ¥ (yen and yuan sign) instead of \ (backslash – which itself additionally may be displayed as a ¥ or a ₩ in some renditions). Using the same keyboard for alternative languages leads to a conflict: the image on the key may not correspond to the character displayed on screen because of different keyboard mappings. In such cases, each new language may require an additional label on the key, because the national standard keyboard layouts may not share similar characters of different languages or even lay them out in different ways.

The United States keyboard layout is used as default in some Linux distributions.[26]

Most operating systems allow switching between functional keyboard layouts, using a key combination involving register keys that are not used for normal operations (e.g. Microsoft reserve Alt+⇧ Shift or Ctrl+⇧ Shift register control keys for sequential layout switching; those keys were inherited from old DOS keyboard drivers). There are keyboards with two parallel sets of characters labeled on the keys, representing alternate alphabets or scripts. It is also possible to add a second set of characters to a keyboard with keyboard stickers manufactured by third parties.
Size variation
Further information: Computer keyboard § Types and standards
Sections on a standard 104 keyboard. Percentages and relevant values of keys denote the presence of keys at common keyboard sizes.

Modern keyboard models contain a set number of total keys according to their given standard, described as 104, 105, etc., and sold as "full-size" keyboards.[27] This number is not always followed, and individual keys or whole sections are commonly skipped for the sake of compactness or user preference. Consequently, generic keyboard mappings may not be completely effective on unusual layouts.
Latin-script keyboard layouts

Although there are a large number of keyboard layouts used for languages written with Latin-script alphabets, most of these layouts are quite similar. They can be divided into three main families according to where the A, M, Q, W, Y and Z keys are placed on the keyboard. These layouts are usually named after the first six letters on the first row: AZERTY, QWERTY, QWERTZ, QZERTY and national variants thereof.

While the central area of the keyboard, the alphabetic section, remains fairly constant, and the numbers from 1–9 are almost invariably on the row above, keyboards may differ in:

    the placement of punctuation, typographic and other special characters, and which of these characters are included,
    whether numbers are accessible directly or in a shift-state,
    the presence and placement of letters with diacritics (in some layouts, diacritics are applied using dead keys but these are rarely engraved).
    the presence and placement of a row of function keys above the number row
    the presence and placement of one or two Alt keys, an AltGr key or Option key, a backspace or delete key, a control key or command key, a compose key, an Esc key, and OS-specific keys like the Windows key.

The physical keyboard is of the basic ISO, ANSI, or JIS type; pressing a key sends a scan code to the operating-system or other software, which in turn determines the character to be generated: this arrangement is known as the keyboard mapping. It is customary for keyboards to be engraved appropriately to the local default mapping. For example, when the ⇧ Shift and numeric 2 keys are pressed simultaneously on a US keyboard; "@" is generated, and the key is engraved appropriately. On a UK keyboard this key combination generates the double-quote character, and UK keyboards are so engraved.

In the keyboard charts listed below, the primary letters or characters available with each alphanumeric key are often shown in black in the left half of the key, whereas characters accessed using the AltGr key appear in blue in the right half of the corresponding key. Symbols representing dead keys usually appear in red.
QWERTY
Main article: QWERTY

The QWERTY layout is, by far, the most widespread layout in use, and the only one that is not confined to a particular geographical area.[28] In some territories, keys like ↵ Enter and ⇪ Caps Lock are not translated to the language of the territory in question. In other varieties such keys have been translated, like ↵ Intro and ⇪ Bloq Mayús, on Spanish computer keyboards respectively for the example above. On Macintosh computers these keys are usually just represented by symbols without the word "Enter", "Shift", "Command", "Option/Alt" or "Control", with the exception of keyboards distributed in the US and East Asia.[citation needed]

QÜERTY (Azerbaijani)
Azerbaijani QÜERTY keyboard layout

Azerbaijani keyboards use a layout known as QÜERTY, where Ü appears in place of W above S, with W not being accessible at all. It is supported by Microsoft Windows.[29]
PÜŞUD (Azerbaijani)

In 2010, a new layout – known as PÜŞUD – was designed and proposed by Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences. It was praised by Ministry of Digital Development and Transportation. This layout is completely different than the most used one – QÜERTY.[30][31][32][33]
ÄWERTY (Turkmen)
Turkmen ÄWERTY keyboard layout

Turkmen keyboards use a layout known as ÄWERTY (/æˈvɜːrtiː/ av-UR-tee), where Ä appears in place of Q above A, Ü appears in place of X below S, Ç appears in place of C, and Ý appears in place of V, with C, Q, V, and X not being accessible at all. It is supported by Microsoft Windows (Vista and later only).[29]
QWERTZ

Main article: QWERTZ
German QWERTZ layout
Albanian QWERTZ keyboard

The QWERTZ layout is the normal keyboard layout in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. It is also fairly widely used in Czechia, Slovakia and other parts of Central Europe. The main difference between it and QWERTY is that Y and Z are swapped, and some special characters such as brackets are replaced by diacritical characters like Ä, Ö, Ü, ß. In Czechia and Slovakia diacritical characters like Ě, Š, Č, Ř, Ž, Ý, Á, Í also replace numbers. Caps lock can be a shift lock as in AZERTY (see below).
AZERTY
Main article: AZERTY
French AZERTY layout

The AZERTY layout is used in France, Belgium, and some African countries. It differs from the QWERTY layout thus:

    A and Q are swapped,
    Z and W are swapped,
    M is moved to the right of L, (taking place of the :/; or colon/semicolon key on a US keyboard),
    The digits 0 to 9 are on the same keys, but to be typed the shift key must be pressed. The unshifted positions are used for accented characters,
    Caps lock is replaced by Shift lock, thus affecting non-letter keys as well. However, there is an ongoing evolution towards a Caps lock key instead of a Shift lock.

ĄŽERTY (Lithuanian)

As standardized in LST 1582, Lithuanian keyboards have a defined layout known as ĄŽERTY,[34] where Ą appears in place of Q above A, Ž in place of W above S, and Ū in place of X below S, with Q, W, and X being available either on the far right-hand side or by use of the AltGr key. However instead of ĄŽERTY, the Lithuanian QWERTY keyboard is universally used.
QZERTY
Italian typewriter Olivetti Lettera 22

The QZERTY (/ˈkzɜːrtiː/ KZUR-tee) layout was used mostly in Italy, where it was the traditional typewriter layout. In recent years, however, a modified QWERTY layout with stressed keys such as à, è, ò, has gained widespread usage throughout Italy.[35][36] Computer keyboards usually have QWERTY, although non-alphanumeric characters vary.

    Z and W are swapped
    M is moved from the right of N to the right of L, as in AZERTY
    Number keys are shifted

Apple supported QZERTY layout in its early Italian keyboards, and also the iPod Touch had it available.[37]
Sámi Extended

Sámi keyboards use a layout known as the Sámi Extended, where Á appears in place of Q above A, Š appears in place of W above S, Č appears in place of X to the left of C, and Ŧ appears in place of Y to the right of T, with Q, W, X, and Y being available by use of the AltGr key. Also, Å is to the right of P (to match the Norwegian and Swedish/Finnish keyboards), Ŋ is to the right of Å, and Đ is to the right of Ŋ. It is different in Norway than in Sweden and Finland, because of the placement of the letters different between Norwegian and Swedish/Finnish (Ä, Æ, Ö, and Ø), which are placed where they match the standard keyboard for the main language spoken in the country. It is supported by Microsoft Windows (Windows XP SP2 and later only).[29] Microsoft Windows also has Swedish with Sami, Norwegian with Sami and Finnish with Sami layouts, which match the normal Swedish, Norwegian, or Finnish keyboards, but has additional Sami characters as AltGr-combinations.
Other Latin-script keyboard layouts
See also: List of Latin-script keyboard layouts

There are also keyboard layouts that do not resemble traditional typewriter layouts very closely, if at all. These are designed to reduce finger movement and are claimed by some proponents to offer higher typing speed along with ergonomic benefits.
Dvorak
Main article: Dvorak keyboard layout
The Dvorak keyboard layout

The Dvorak layout was named after its inventor, August Dvorak. There are also numerous adaptations for languages other than English and single-handed variants. Dvorak's original layout had the numerals rearranged, but the present-day layout had them in numerical order. Dvorak has numerous properties designed to increase typing speed, decrease errors, and increase comfort. Research has found a 4% average advantage to the end user in typing speed.[38] The layout concentrates the most used English letters in the home row where the fingers rest, thus having 70% of typing done in the home row (compared to 32% in QWERTY).

The layout came before computers came to be, so it challenges programmers and power users because keyboard shortcuts, like copy-paste are in totally different locations, punctuation symbols are significantly affected, while common commands like ls -ls result in strenuous use of the pinky finger.

The Dvorak layout is available out-of-the-box on most operating systems, making switching through software very easy. "Hardwired" Dvorak keyboards are also available, though only from specialized hardware companies.
Colemak
Main article: Colemak
Colemak keyboard layout (US)

The Colemak layout is another popular alternative to the standard QWERTY layout, offering a more familiar change for users already accustomed to the standard layout.[39]

It builds upon the QWERTY layout as a base, changing the positions of 17 keys while retaining the QWERTY positions of most non-alphabetic characters and many popular keyboard shortcuts, supposedly making it easier to learn than Dvorak for people who already type in QWERTY without sacrificing efficiency. It shares several design goals with the Dvorak layout, such as minimizing finger path distance and making heavy use of the home row.[40] An additional defining (albeit optional) feature of the Colemak layout is the lack of a caps lock key; an additional backspace key occupies the position typically occupied by Caps Lock on modern keyboards.[39]

Operating systems such as macOS, Linux, Android, ChromeOS, and BSD allow a user to switch to the Colemak layout. A program to install the layout is available for Microsoft Windows, as well as a portable AutoHotKey implementation.[41]

Colemak variants exist, including Colemak Mod-DH, which seeks to rectify concerns that the layout places too much emphasis on the middle-row centre-column keys (D and H), leading to awkward lateral hand movements for certain common English bigrams such as HE.[42] Others seek to have more compatibility with other keyboard layouts.[43]
Workman
Workman layout for the English language, showing home keys highlighted

Workman is an English layout supported out-of-the-box in Linux/X11 systems.[44]

The Workman layout employs a hypothesis about the preferential movement of each finger rather than categorically considering the lowest letter row to be least accessible. Specifically, the index finger prefers to curl inwards rather than stretch outwards. So for the index finger, the position of second preference goes to the bottom row rather than the top row. Contrarily, the middle and ring fingers are relatively long and prefer to stretch out rather than curl in. Based on this, weighting is allotted to each key specifically rather than each row generically.

Another principle applied is that it is more natural and less effort to curl in or stretch out fingers rather than rotate one's wrist inwards or outwards. Thus the Workman layout allots a lower priority to the two innermost columns between the home keys (G and H columns on a QWERTY layout), similarly to the Colemak-DH or "Curl" mods. Workman also balances the load quite evenly between both hands.

The Workman layout is found to achieve overall less travel distance of the fingers for the English language than even Colemak.[45][46] It does however generally incur higher same-finger n-gram frequencies; or in other words, one finger will need to hit two keys in succession more often than in other layouts.
Other English layouts

There are many other layouts for English, each developed with differing basic principles.

The Norman Layout, like Workman, deprioritizes the central columns but gives more load to the right hand with the assumption that the right hand is more capable than the left. It also gives importance to retaining letters in the same position or at least the same finger as QWERTY.

MTGAP's Layout for a Standard Keyboard / an Ergonomic Keyboard has the lowest finger travel for a standard keyboard, and travel distance for an ergonomic keyboard second only to Arensito's keyboard layout.[47] Further variations were created using the keyboard layout optimizer.[48]

Other layouts lay importance on minimal key deviation from QWERTY to give a reasonable increase in typing speed and ergonomics with minimal relearning of keys.[49]
Qwpr keyboard layout (letters moved from QWERTY in teal, or yellow if different hand)

Qwpr is a layout that changes only 11 basic keys from their QWERTY positions, with only 2 keys typed with different fingers.[50] Minimak has versions that changes four, six, eight, or twelve keys, all have only 3 keys change finger.[51] These intend to offer much of the reduced finger movement of Dvorak without the steep learning curve and with an increased ability to remain proficient with a QWERTY keyboard. The Qwpr layout is also designed for programmers and multilingual users, as it uses Caps Lock as a "punctuation shift", offering quicker access to ASCII symbols and arrow keys, as well as to 15 dead keys for typing hundreds of different glyphs such as accented characters, mathematical symbols, or emoji.

In Canada, the CSA keyboard is designed to write several languages, especially French.
Sholes' 2nd Layout
Sholes' second layout

Christopher Latham Sholes, inventor of the QWERTY layout, created his own alternative, and patented it in 1896.[52] Similar to Dvorak, he placed all the vowels on the home row, but in this case on the right hand. The layout is right-hand biased with both the vowels and many of the most common consonants on the right side of the layout.

JCUKEN keyboard of the UKNC computer

The JCUKEN layout was used in the USSR for all computers (both domestically produced and imported such as Japan-made MSX-compatible systems) except IBM-compatible ES PEVM due to its phonetic compatibility with Russian ЙЦУКЕН layout (see right). The layout has the advantage of having punctuation marks on Latin and Cyrillic layouts mapped on the same keys.[53]
Neo
Main article: Neo (keyboard layout)
Neo Layout, layer 1

The Neo layout is an optimized German keyboard layout developed in 2004 by the Neo Users Group,[54] supporting nearly all Latin-based alphabets, including the International Phonetic Alphabet,[55] the Vietnamese language and some African languages.[56]

The positions of the letters are not only optimized for German letter frequency, but also for typical groups of two or three letters. English is considered a major target as well. The design tries to enforce the alternating usage of both hands to increase typing speed. It is based on ideas from de-ergo and other ergonomic layouts. The high frequency keys are placed in the home row. The current layout, Neo 2.0, has unique features not present in other layouts, making it suited for many target groups such as programmers, mathematicians, scientists or LaTeX authors.[57] Neo is grouped in different layers, each designed for a special purpose.
Neo Layout, layer 3

Most special characters inherit the meaning of the lower layers—the ⟨¿⟩ character is one layer above the ⟨?⟩, or the Greek ⟨α⟩ is above the ⟨a⟩ character. Neo uses a total of six layers with the following general use:[58][59]

    Lowercase characters
    Uppercase characters, typographical characters
    Special characters for programming, etc.
    WASD-like movement keys and number block
    Greek characters
    Mathematical symbols and Greek uppercase characters

BÉPO
Main article: BÉPO
BÉPO layout

The BÉPO layout is an optimized French keyboard layout developed by the BÉPO community,[60] supporting all Latin-based alphabets of the European Union, Greek and Esperanto.[61] It is also designed to ease programming. It is based on ideas from the Dvorak and other ergonomic layouts. Typing with it is usually easier due to the high frequency keys being in the home row. Typing tutors exist to ease the transition.[62]

In 2019, a slightly modified version of the BÉPO layout is featured in a French standard developed by AFNOR, along with an improved version of the traditional AZERTY layout.[63]

Dvorak-fr
Dvorak-fr

The Dvorak-fr layout is a Dvorak like layout specific to the French language, without concession to the use of programming languages, and published in 2002 by Francis Leboutte. Version 2 was released in June 2020. Its design meets the need to maximize comfort and prevent risks when typing in French. Unlike AZERTY, the characters needed for good French typography are easily accessible: for example, the quotation marks (« ») and the curved apostrophe are available directly. More than 150 additional characters are available via dead keys.
Turkish (F-keyboard)
Turkish F-keyboard layout

The Turkish language uses the Turkish Latin alphabet, and a dedicated keyboard layout was designed in 1955 by İhsan Sıtkı Yener[64] (tr). During its design, letter frequencies in the Turkish language were investigated with the aid of Turkish Language Association. These statistics were then combined with studies on bone and muscle anatomy of the fingers to design the Turkish F-keyboard (Turkish: F klavye). The keyboard provides a balanced distribution of typing effort between the hands: 49% for the left hand and 51% for the right. With this scientific preparation, Turkey has broken 14 world records in typewriting championships between 1957 and 1995.[65] In 2009, Recep Ertaş and in 2011, Hakan Kurt from Turkey came in first in the text production event of the 47th (Beijing) and 48th (Paris) Intersteno congresses respectively.[66][67] Despite the greater efficiency of the Turkish F-keyboard however, the modified QWERTY keyboard ("Q-keyboard") is the one that is used on most computers in Turkey. The reason for the popularity of QWERTY in Turkey is that they were overwhelmingly imported since the beginning of the 1990s.[68]
ŪGJRMV
Latvian Keyboard Layout

The ŪGJRMV layout is specifically designed for the Latvian language.[29]


HCESAR
Hcesar keyboard layout

The Hcesar layout was a layout created in 1937 for typewriters during Portugal's Estado Novo. It was specifically designed for the Portuguese language. It is no longer used since the 80s.
Malt

The Malt layout—named for its inventor, South African-born Lilian Malt—is best known for its use on molded, ergonomic Maltron keyboards. Nevertheless, it has been adapted as well for flat keyboards, with a compromise involved: a flat keyboard has a single, wide space-bar, rather than a space button as on Maltron keyboards, so the E key was moved to the bottom row.

Modified Blickensderfer
Original Blickensderfer keyboard
Blick keyboard for computers

The Blickensderfer typewriter, designed by George Canfield Blickensderfer in 1892, was known for its novel keyboard layout, its interchangeable font, and its suitability for travel. The Blickensderfer keyboard had three banks (rows of keys), with special characters being entered using a separate Shift key; the home row was, uniquely, the bottom one (i.e., the typist kept her hands on the bottom row). A computer or standard typewriter keyboard, on the other hand, has four banks of keys, with home row being second from bottom.

To fit on a Sholes-patterned (typewriter or computer) keyboard, the Blickensderfer layout was modified by Nick Matavka in 2012, and released for both Mac OS X and Windows. To accommodate the differences between Blickensderfer and Sholes keyboards (not the layouts, but the keyboards themselves), the order of the rows was changed and special characters were given their own keys.

The keyboard drivers created by Nick Matavka for the modified Blickensderfer layout (nicknamed the 'Blick') have several variations, including one that includes the option of switching between Blick and another keyboard layout and one that is internationalised, allowing the entry of diacritics.
Hexagon
Main article: Typewise
Hexagon keyboard layout

The honeycomb layout has hexagon keys and was invented by Typewise in cooperation with the ETH Zurich[69] in 2015 for smartphones.[70][71] It exists for 40+ languages including English, German, Spanish, French and Afrikaans. The keys are arranged like those of the respective traditional keyboard with a few changes. Instead of the Space bar there are two smaller space bars in the middle of the keyboard. The ⇧ Shift is replaced by swiping up on keys and ← Backspace by swiping to the left on the keyboard. Diacritic characters can be accessed by holding on a key.[72][73]
Alphabetical layout

A few companies offer "ABC" (alphabetical) layout keyboards.[74][75] The ABCDEF layout was used by Minitel. The layout can also be useful for people who do not type often or where using both hands is not practical, such as touchscreens.
Chorded keyboards and mobile devices
Main article: Chorded keyboard

Chorded keyboards, such as the Stenotype and Velotype, allow letters and words to be entered using combinations of keys in a single stroke. Users of stenotype machines regularly reach rates of 225 words per minute.[76] These systems are commonly used for real-time transcription by court reporters and in live closed captioning systems. Ordinary keyboards may be adapted for this purpose using Plover. However, due to hardware constraints, chording three or more keys may not work as expected. Many high-end keyboards support n-key rollover and so do not have this limitation.

The multi-touch screens of mobile devices allow implementation of virtual on-screen chorded keyboards. Buttons are fewer, so they can be made larger. Symbols on the keys can be changed dynamically depending on what other keys are pressed, thus eliminating the need to memorize combos for characters and functions before use. For example, in the chorded GKOS keyboard which has been adapted for the Google Android, Apple iPhone, MS Windows Phone, and Intel MeeGo/Harmattan platforms, thumbs are used for chording by pressing one or two keys at the same time. The layout divides the keys into two separate pads which are positioned near the sides of the screen, while text appears in the middle. The most frequent letters have dedicated keys and do not require chording.

Some other layouts have also been designed specifically for use with mobile devices. The FITALY layout is optimized for use with a stylus by placing the most commonly used letters closest to the centre and thus minimizing the distance travelled when entering words. A similar concept was followed to research and develop the MessagEase keyboard layout for fast text entry with stylus or finger. The ATOMIK layout, designed for stylus use, was developed by IBM using the Metropolis Algorithm to mathematically minimize the movement necessary to spell words in English.[77] The ATOMIK keyboard layout is an alternative to QWERTY in ShapeWriter's WritingPad software.[78] ASETNIOP is a keyboard layout designed for tablet computers that uses 10 input points, eight of them on the home row.[79]
Other original layouts and layout design software
United-States Maltron 3D keyboard layout

Several other alternative keyboard layouts have been designed either for use with specialist commercial keyboards (e.g. Maltron and PLUM) or by hobbyists (e.g. Asset,[80] Arensito,[81] Minimak,[82] Norman,[83] Qwpr,[84] Workman[85] as well as symmetric typing[86] layouts Niro[87] and Soul[88]); however, none of them are in widespread use, and many of them are merely proofs of concept. Principles commonly used in their design include maximizing use of the home row, minimizing finger movement, maximizing hand alternation or inward rolls (where successive letters are typed moving towards the center of the keyboard), minimizing changes from QWERTY to ease the learning curve, and so on.

Maltron also has a single-handed keyboard layout.[89]

Programs such as the Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator[90] (basic editor, free, for use on MS Windows), SIL Ukelele[91] (advanced editor, free, for use on Apple's Mac OS X), KbdEdit[92] (commercial editor, for Windows) and Keyman Developer[93] (free, open source editor for Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, or for sites on the web as virtual keyboards) make it easy to create custom keyboard layouts for regular keyboards;[94] users may satisfy their own typing patterns or specific needs by creating new ones from scratch (like the IPA[95] or pan-Iberian[96] layouts) or modify existing ones (for example, the Latin American Extended[97] or Gaelic[98] layouts). Such editors can also construct complex key sequences using dead keys or the AltGr key.

Certain virtual keyboards and keyboard layouts are accessible online.[99] With no hardware limitations, those online keyboards can display custom layouts, or allow the user to pre-configure or try out different language layouts. Resulting text can then be pasted into other websites or applications flexibly with no need to reprogram keyboard mappings at all.

Some high-end keyboards allow users flexibility to reprogram keyboard mappings at the hardware level. For example, the Kinesis Advantage contoured keyboard allows for reprogramming single keys (not key combinations), as well as creating macros for remapping combinations of keys (this however includes more processing from the keyboard hardware, and can therefore be slightly slower, with a lag that may be noticed in daily use).

Non-QWERTY layouts were also used with specialized machines such as the 90-key Linotype type setting machine.
Keyboard layouts for non-Latin alphabetic scripts

Some keyboard layouts for non-Latin alphabetic scripts, most notably the Greek layout, are based on the QWERTY layout, in that glyphs are assigned as far as possible to keys that bear similar-sounding or appearing glyphs in QWERTY. This saves learning time for those familiar with QWERTY, and eases entry of Latin characters (with QWERTY) as well for Greek users.

This is not a general rule, and many non-Latin keyboard layouts have been invented from scratch.

All non-Latin computer keyboard layouts can also input Latin letters as well as the script of the language, for example, when typing in URLs or names. This may be done through a special key on the keyboard devoted to this task, or through some special combination of keys, or through software programs that do not interact with the keyboard much.

InScript is the standard keyboard for 12 Indian scripts including Assamese, Bengali, Devanagari, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Kannada, Malayalam, Oriya, Tamil, and Telugu etc.

Most Indian scripts are derived from Brahmi, therefore their alphabetic order is identical. On the basis of this property, the InScript keyboard layout scheme was prepared. So a person who knows InScript typing in one language can type in other scripts using dictation even without knowledge of that script.

An InScript keyboard is inbuilt in most modern operating systems including Windows, Linux, and Mac OS. It is also available in some mobile phones.
Khmer
Khmer keyboard layout
Main article: Khmer keyboard

Khmer uses its own layout designed to correspond, to the extent practicable, to its QWERTY counterpart, thus easing the learning curve in either direction. For example, the letter ល [lɔː] is typed on the same key as the letter L on the English-based QWERTY. It also has many specifics due to its record number of vowels, consonants and punctuation signs as well as its cluster structure which bundles letters together in one.

The layout has been available in Linux since 2004.
Inuktitut

Naqittaut keyboard layout for Inuktitut

Inuktitut has two similar, though not identical, commonly available keyboard layouts for Windows. Both contain a basic Latin layout in its base and shift states, with a few Latin characters in the AltGr shift states. The Canadian Aboriginal syllabics can be found in the Capslock and AltGr shift states in both layouts as well.

The difference between the two layouts lies in the use of ] as an alternate to AltGr to create the dotted, long vowel syllables, and the mapping of the small plain consonants to the Caps + number keys in the "Naqittaut" layout, while the "Latin" layout does not have access to the plain consonants, and can only access the long vowel syllables through the AltGr shift states.

Hebrew keyboard

All keyboards in Israel are fitted with both Latin and Hebrew letters. Trilingual editions including either Arabic or Cyrillic also exist.

In the standard layout (but not all keyboards), paired delimiters—parentheses (), brackets [], and braces {}, as well as less/greater than <>—are in the opposite order from the standard in other left-to-right languages. This results in "open"/"close" being consistent with right-to-left languages (Shift-9 always gives "close parenthesis" U+0029, which visually looks like "open parenthesis" in left-to-right languages). This is shared with Arabic keyboards.

Certain Hebrew layouts are extended with niqqud symbols (vowel points),[103] which require Alt+Shift or similar key combination in order to be typed.

The Royal institute of the Amazigh culture (IRCAM) developed a national standard Tifinagh layout for Tamazight (Berber) in Morocco. It is included in Linux and Windows 8, and is available for the Mac and older versions of Windows.

A compatible, international version of this layout, called "Tifinagh (International)" exists for typing a wide range of Tamazight (Berber) language variants, and includes support for Tuareg variants. It was designed by the Universal Amazigh Keyboard Project and is available from its page on SourceForge.[104]

The illustrated keyboard layout can be enabled on Linux with: setxkbmap am -variant phonetic. Western and Eastern Armenian have different layouts.

In the pre-computer times, Armenian keyboards had quite a different layout, more suitable for producing letter combinations inherent to the language.

Several attempts have been made to create innovative ergonomic layouts, some of them inspired by Dvorak.

Cyrillic
Bulgarian
Bulgarian keyboard layout (BDS 5237:1978)

The current official Bulgarian keyboard layout for both typewriters and computer keyboards is described in BDS (Bulgarian State/National Standard) 5237:1978.[105] It superseded the old standard, BDS 5237:1968, on 1 January 1978.[105] Like the Dvorak layout, it has been designed to optimize typing speed and efficiency, placing the most common letters in the Bulgarian language—О, Н, Т, and А—under the strongest fingers. In addition to the standard 30 letters of the Bulgarian alphabet, the layout includes the non-Bulgarian Cyrillic symbols Э and ы and the Roman numerals I and V (the X is supposed to be represented by the Cyrillic capital Х, which is acceptable in typewriters but problematic in computers).

There is also a second, informal layout in widespread use—the so-called "phonetic" layout, in which Cyrillic letters are mapped to the QWERTY keys for Latin letters that "sound" or "look" the same, with several exceptions (Я is mapped to Q, Ж is mapped to V, etc.—see the layout and compare it to the standard QWERTY layout). This layout is available as an alternative to the BDS one in some operating systems, including Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS X and Ubuntu Linux. Normally, the layouts are set up so that the user can switch between Latin and Cyrillic script by pressing Shift + Alt, and between BDS and Phonetic by pressing Shift + Ctrl.

In 2006, Prof. Dimiter Skordev from the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics of Sofia University and Dimitar Dobrev from the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences proposed a new standard, prBDS 5237:2006, including a revised version of the old BDS layout, which includes the letter Ѝ and the capital Ы and replaces the letters I and V with the currency symbols of $ and € respectively, and a standardization of the informal "phonetic" layout. After some controversy and a public discussion in 2008, the proposal was not accepted,[106] although it had been already used in several places—the "Bulgarian Phonetic" layout in MS Windows Vista is based on it. There is a new "Bulgarian Phonetic" layout in MS Windows 7.[29]
Macedonian
Macedonian keyboard layout

The Macedonian keyboard layout is phonetic. The Latin letters that have a phonetic equivalent in Macedonian are used for the corresponding Cyrillic letters. The letters in the Macedonian alphabet and characters used in the Macedonian orthography that do not have any phonetic equivalent are Љ, Њ, Ѕ, Ш, Ѓ, Ж, Ч, Ќ, Ѝ, Ѐ.

Even though they are not part of the Macedonian alphabet, and are not used in the Macedonian language, the first Macedonian keyboard layout supported by Windows uses Alt Gr to type the glyphs Ћ and Ђ, where their capital forms are next to the small forms. This keyboard does not include the glyphs Ѝ and Ѐ.[29]

A new revised standard version of the layout was supported with Windows Vista. This version includes the glyphs Ѝ and Ѐ and uses Alt Gr to add an acute accent, which is not included in the original Macedonian layout.[29]

Russian Windows keyboard layout

The most common keyboard layout in modern Russia is the so-called Windows layout, which is the default Russian layout used in the MS Windows operating system. The layout was designed to be compatible with the hardware standard in many other countries, but introduced compromises to accommodate the larger alphabet. The full stop and comma symbols share a key, requiring the shift key to be held to produce a comma, despite the high relative frequency of comma in the language.[53]

There are some other Russian keyboard layouts in use: in particular, the traditional Russian Typewriter layout (punctuation symbols are placed on numerical keys, one needs to press Shift to enter numbers) and the Russian DOS layout (similar to the Russian Typewriter layout with common punctuation symbols on numerical keys, but numbers are entered without Shift). The Russian Typewriter layout can be found on many Russian typewriters produced before the 1990s, and it is the default Russian keyboard layout in the OpenSolaris operating system.[107][better source needed]

Keyboards in Russia always have Cyrillic letters on the keytops as well as Latin letters. Usually Cyrillic and Latin letters are labeled with different colors.

The Russian phonetic keyboard layout (also called homophonic or transliterated) is widely used outside Russia, where normally there are no Russian letters drawn on keyboard buttons. This layout is made for typists who are more familiar with other layouts, like the common English QWERTY keyboard, and follows the Greek and Armenian layouts in placing most letters at the corresponding Latin letter locations. It is famous among both native speakers and people who use, teach, or are learning Russian, and is recommended—along with the Standard Layout—by the linguists, translators, teachers and students of AATSEEL.org. The earliest known implementation of the Cyrillic-to-QWERTY homophonic keyboard was by former AATSEEL officer Constance Curtin between 1972 and 1976, for the PLATO education system's Russian Language curriculum developed at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.[108] Curtin's design sought to map phonetically related Russian sounds to QWERTY keys, to map proximate phonetic and visual cues nearby one another, as well as to map unused positions in a mnemonically ideal way. Peter Zelchenko worked under Curtin at UIUC, and his later modifications to the number row for Windows and Macintosh keyboards follow Curtin's original design intent.[109]

There are several different Russian phonetic layouts, for example YaZhERT (яжерт), YaWERT (яверт), and YaShERT (яшерт) suggested by AATSEEL.org and called "Student" layout. They are named after the first several letters that take over the 'QWERTY' row on the Latin keyboard. They differ by where a few of the letters are placed. For example, some have Cyrillic 'B' (which is pronounced 'V') on the Latin 'W' key (after the German transliteration of B), while others have it on the Latin 'V' key.

There are also variations within these variations; for example the Mac OS X Phonetic Russian layout is YaShERT but differs in placement of ж and э.[110][111]

Windows 10 includes its own implementation of a mnemonic QWERTY-based input method for Russian, which does not fully rely on assigning a key to every Russian letter, but uses the sh, sc, ch, ya (ja), yu (ju), ye (je), yo (jo) combinations to input ш, щ, ч, я, ю, э, and ё respectively.

Virtual (on-screen) keyboards allow entering Cyrillic directly in a browser without activating the system layout.

Serbian (Cyrillic)
Serbian Cyrillic keyboard layout

Apart from a set of characters common to most Cyrillic alphabets, the Serbian Cyrillic layout uses six additional special characters unique or nearly unique to the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet: Љ, Њ, Ћ, Ђ, Џ, and Ј. The Macedonian Ѕ is on this keyboard despite not being used in Serbian Cyrillic.

Due to the bialphabetic nature of the language, actual physical keyboards with the Serbian Cyrillic layout printed on the keys are uncommon today. Typical keyboards sold in Serbian-speaking markets are marked with Serbian Latin characters and used with both the Latin (QWERTZ) and Cyrillic layout configured in the software. What makes the two layouts this readily interchangeable is that the non-alphabetic keys are identical between them, and alphabetic keys always correspond directly to their counterparts (except the Latin letters Q, W, X, and Y that have no Cyrillic equivalents, and the Cyrillic letters Љ, Њ and Џ whose Latin counterparts are digraphs LJ, NJ and DŽ). This also makes the Serbian Cyrillic layout a rare example of a non-Latin layout based on QWERTZ.
Ukrainian
Ukrainian keyboard layout

Ukrainian keyboards, based on a slight modification of Russian Standard Layout, often also have the Russian Standard ("Windows") layout marked on them, making it easy to switch from one language to another. This keyboard layout had several problems, one of which was the omission of the letter Ґ, which does not exist in Russian. The other long-standing problem was the omission of the apostrophe, which is used in Ukrainian almost as commonly as in English (though with a different meaning), but which also does not exist in Russian. Both of these problems were resolved with the "improved Ukrainian" keyboard layout for Windows available with Vista and subsequent Windows versions.

There also exists an adapted keyboard for Westerners learning Ukrainian (mostly in the diaspora) which closely matches the QWERTY keyboard, so that the letters either have the same sound or same shape, for example pressing the "v" on the Latin QWERTY produces the Cyrillic в (which makes roughly the same sound) and pressing the QWERTY "w" key gives the Cyrillic ш (based on the similar shape). This is usually called a homophonic or phonetic layout.
Georgian

Georgian keyboard

There are no keyboards in Georgia with the Georgian script printed on the hardware. The conventional keyboards are American QWERTY with a phonetically matched Georgian software layout. Hardware with both Latin QWERTY and the Russian layout are very common, forcing Georgians to know the Georgian layout blindly. As with the Armenian, Greek, and phonetic Russian layouts, most Georgian letters are on the same keys as their Latin equivalents. During the Soviet era, the Georgian alphabet was adapted to the Russian JCUKEN layout, mainly for typewriters. Soviet computers did not support Georgian keyboards. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, a large variety of computers were introduced to post-Soviet countries. The keyboards had QWERTY layout for Latin alphabet and JCUKEN for Cyrillic both printed on keys. Georgia started to adopt the QWERTY pattern. In both cases the letters which did not exist in the Cyrillic or Latin alphabets were substituted by letters that did not exist in Georgian alphabet. Today the most commonly used layout follows the QWERTY pattern with some changes.
Greek
Greek keyboard layout in comparison to US layout

The usual Greek layout follows the US layout for letters related to Latin letters (ABDEHIKLMNOPRSTXYZ, ΑΒΔΕΗΙΚΛΜΝΟΠΡΣΤΧΥΖ, respectively), substitutes phonetically similar letters (Φ at F; Γ at G) and uses the remaining slots for the remaining Greek letters: Ξ at J; Ψ at C; Ω at V; Θ at U).

Greek has two fewer letters than English, but has two diacritic marks which, because of their frequency, are placed on the home row at the U.K. ";" position; they are dead keys. Word-final sigma has its own position as well, replacing W, and semicolon (which is used as a question mark in Greek) and colon move to the position of Q.

The Greek Polytonic layout has various dead keys to input the accented letters. In Microsoft Windows, there is also the Greek 220 layout and the Greek 319 layout.[29]

The orthography used for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean ("CJK characters") require special input methods, due to the thousands of possible characters in these languages. Various methods have been invented to fit every possibility into a QWERTY keyboard, so East Asian keyboards are essentially the same as those in other countries. However, their input methods are considerably more complex, without one-to-one mappings between keys and characters.

In general, the range of possibilities is first narrowed down (often by entering the desired character's pronunciation). Then, if there remains more than one possibility, the desired ideogram is selected, either by typing the number before the character, or using a graphical menu to select it. The computer assists the typist by using heuristics to guess which character is most likely desired. Although this may seem painstaking, East Asian input methods are today sufficient in that, even for beginners, typing in these languages is only slightly slower than typing an alphabetic language like English (where each phoneme is represented by one grapheme).

In Japanese, the QWERTY-based JIS keyboard layout is used, and the pronunciation of each character is entered using various approximations to Hepburn romanization or Kunrei-shiki romanization. There are several kana-based typing methods. .

Of the three, Chinese has the most varied input options. Characters can either be entered by pronunciation (like Japanese and Hanja in Korean), or by structure. Most of the structural methods are very difficult to learn but extremely efficient for experienced typists, as there is no need to select characters from a menu.

There exist a variety of other, slower methods in which a character may be entered. If the pronunciation of a character is not known, the selection can be narrowed down by giving its component shapes, radicals, and stroke count. Also, many input systems include a "drawing pad" permitting "handwriting" of a character using a mouse. Finally, if the computer does not have CJK software installed, it may be possible to enter a character directly through its encoding number (e.g., Unicode).

In contrast to Chinese and Japanese, Korean is typed similarly to Western languages. There exist two major forms of keyboard layouts: Dubeolsik (두벌식), and Sebeolsik (세벌식). Dubeolsik, which shares its symbol layout with the QWERTY keyboard, is much more commonly used. While Korean consonants and vowels (jamo) are grouped together into syllabic grids when written, the script is essentially alphabetical, and therefore typing in Korean is quite simple for those who understand the Korean alphabet Hangul. Each jamo is assigned to a single key. As the user types letters, the computer automatically groups them into syllabic characters. Given a sequence of jamo, there is only one unambiguous way letters can be validly grouped into syllables, so the computer groups them together as the user types.
Hangul (for Korean)
See also: Korean language and computers, Hangul, and Korean language

Pressing the Han/Eng (한/영) key once switches between Hangul as shown, and QWERTY (US layout). There is another key to the left of the space bar for Hanja (한자 or 漢字) input. If using an ordinary keyboard without the two extra keys, the right Alt key will become the Ha/En key, and the right Ctrl key will become the Hanja key. Apple Keyboards do not have the two extra keys.
Dubeolsik
Dubeolsik Hangul keyboard layout

Dubeolsik (두벌식; 2-set) is by far the most common and the sole national standard of Hangul keyboard layout in use in South Korea since 1969. Consonants occupy the left side of the layout, while vowels are on the right.
Sebeolsik 390
Sebeolsik 390 Hangul keyboard layout

Sebeolsik 390 (세벌식 390; 3-set 390) was released in 1990. It is based on Kong Byung Woo's earlier work. This layout is notable for its compatibility with the QWERTY layout; almost all QWERTY symbols that are not alphanumeric are available in Hangul mode. Numbers are placed in three rows. Syllable-initial consonants are on the right (shown green in the picture), and syllable-final consonants and consonant clusters are on the left (shown red). Some consonant clusters are not printed on the keyboard; the user has to press multiple consonant keys to input some consonant clusters, unlike Sebeolsik Final. It is more ergonomic than the dubeolsik, but is not in wide use.
Sebeolsik Final
Sebeolsik Final Hangul keyboard layout

Sebeolsik Final (세벌식 최종; 3-set Final) is another Hangul keyboard layout in use in South Korea. It is the final Sebulsik layout designed by Kong Byung Woo, hence the name. Numbers are placed on two rows. Syllable-initial consonants are on the right, and syllable-final consonants and consonant clusters are on the left. Vowels are in the middle. All consonant clusters are available on the keyboard, unlike the Sebeolsik 390 which does not include all of them. It is more ergonomic than the dubeolsik, but is not in wide use.
Sebeolsik Noshift
Sebeolsik Noshift Hangul keyboard layout

Sebeolsik Noshift is a variant of sebeolsik which can be used without pressing the shift key. Its advantage is that people with disabilities who cannot press two keys at the same time will still be able to use it to type in Hangul.
HNC & GongjinCheong Romaja
HNC Romaja keyboard layout

HNC Romaja and GongjinCheong Romaja are macOS keyboards for typing Korean that are closest to pronunciation. They use Revised and McCune-Reischauer romanizations respectively.
Korean Phonetic (SIL)
Korean Phonetic (SIL) keyboard layout

Korean Phonetic (SIL) is a desktop keyboard layout. It uses Korean letters arranged in a transliteration system that closely resembles Korean pronunciation. It doesn't use romanization but provides a mnemonic layout for ease of use.[115]


Chinese
Further information: Chinese input methods for computers

Chinese keyboards are usually in US layout with/without Chinese input method labels printed on keys. Without an input method handler activated, these keyboards would simply respond to Latin characters as physically labelled, provided that the US keyboard layout is selected correctly in the operating system. Most modern input methods allow input of both simplified and traditional characters, and will simply default to one or the other based on the locale setting.
People's Republic of China
Further information: Standard Chinese and Simplified Chinese characters

Keyboards used in the People's Republic of China are standard or slightly modified English US (QWERTY) ones without extra labelling, while various IMEs are employed to input Chinese characters. The most common IMEs are Hanyu pinyin-based, representing the pronunciation of characters using Latin letters. However, keyboards with labels for alternative structural input methods such as Wubi method can also be found, although those are usually very old products and are extremely rare, as of 2015.
Taiwan

Zhuyin Eten keyboard layout

Computers in Taiwan often use Zhuyin (bopomofo) style keyboards (US keyboards with bopomofo labels), many also with Cangjie method key labels, as Cangjie is a popular method for typing in traditional Chinese characters. The bopomofo style keyboards are in lexicographical order, top-to-bottom left-to-right. The codes of three input methods are typically printed on the Chinese (traditional) keyboard: Zhuyin (upper right); Cangjie (lower left); and Dayi (lower right).

The Eten (I-Tien) keyboard layout is an alternative input method used in Taiwan. It's phonetic-based, allowing users to input Zhuyin using Latin letters.
Hong Kong and Macau

In Hong Kong, both Chinese (Taiwan) and US keyboards are found. Japanese keyboards are occasionally found, and UK keyboards are rare.

For Chinese input, Shape-based input methods such as Cangjie (pronounced cong1 kit3 in Cantonese) or Chinese handwriting recognition are the most common input method. The use of phonetic-based input method is uncommon due to the lack of official standard for Cantonese romanisation and people in Hong Kong almost never learn any romanisation schemes in schools. An advantage of phonetic-based input method is that most Cantonese speakers are able to input Traditional Chinese characters with no particular training at all where they spell out the Cantonese sound of each character without tone marks, e.g. 'heung gong' for 香港 (Cantonese Yale: Hēung góng; Hong Kong) and to choose the characters from a list. However, Microsoft Windows, which is the most popular operating system used in desktops, does not provide any Cantonese phonetic input method, requiring users to find and install third-party input method software. Also, most people find the process of picking characters from a list being too slow due to homonyms so the Cangjie method is generally preferred.

Although thorough training and practice are required to use Cangjie, many Cantonese speakers have taken Cangjie input courses because of the fast typing speed availed by the input method. This method is the fastest because it has the capability to fetch the exact, unambiguous Chinese character which the user has in mind to input, pinpointing to only one character in most cases. This is also the reason why no provision for an input of phonetic accent is needed to complement this Input Method. The Cangjie character feature is available on both Mac OS X and Windows. On Mac OS X, handwriting recognition input method is bundled with the OS.

Macau utilizes the same layouts as Hong Kong, with the addition of Portuguese (Portugal) or English (US) layout for Portuguese language.

Japanese (OADG 109A) keyboard layout with Hiragana keys
Japanese Apple keyboard layout with Hiragana keys
Further information: Japanese language and computers

The JIS standard layout includes Japanese kana in addition to a QWERTY style layout. The shifted values of many keys (digits, together with :* ; + - =) are a legacy of bit-paired keyboards, dating to ASCII telex machines and terminals of the 1960s and 1970s.

For entering Japanese, the most common method is entering text phonetically, as romanized (transliterated) kana, which are then converted to kanji as appropriate by an input method editor. It is also possible to type kana directly, depending on the mode used. To type たかはし, "Takahashi", a Japanese name, one could type either TAKAHAS (H)I in Romanized (Rōmaji) input mode, or QTFD in kana input mode. Then the user can proceed to the conversion step to convert the input into the appropriate kanji.

The extra keys in the bottom row (muhenkan, henkan, and the Hiragana/Katakana switch key), and the special keys in the leftmost column (the hankaku/zenkaku key at the upper left corner, and the eisū key at the Caps Lock position), control various aspects of the conversion process and select different modes of input.
The "Thumb-shift" layout. There are multiple legends and the two modifying keys. "シフト" means L/R Thumb Shift, "後退" means ← Backspace, "取消" means Delete, and "空白" means Space keys.

The Oyayubi Shifuto (Thumb Shift) layout is based on kana input, but uses two modifying keys replacing the space bar. When a key is pressed simultaneously with one of the keys, it yields another letter. Letters with the "dakuten" diacritic are typed with the opposite side "thumb shift". Letters with "handakuten" are either typed while the conventional pinky-operated shift key is pressed (that is, each key corresponds to a maximum of 4 letters), or, on the "NICOLA" variation, on a key which does not have a dakuten counterpart.

The H key in the QWERTY layout individually yields は, but with the 変換 (R Thumb Shift) key, yields み. Simultaneous input with 無変換 (L Thumb Shift) yields ば, which is the individually mapped letter with the aforementioned dakuten. While the pinky-operated ⇧ Shift key is pressed, the same key yields ぱ. (This same letter must be typed with 無変換 (L Thumb Shift) + Y on the NICOLA variant.)

In Japan, 106-key Japanese keyboards and 101-key English (US layout) keyboards are usually found.
Layout changing software

The character code produced by any key press is determined by the keyboard driver software. A key press generates a scancode which is interpreted as an alphanumeric character or control function. Depending on operating systems, various application programs are available to create, add and switch among keyboard layouts. Many programs are available, some of which are language specific.

The arrangement of symbols of specific language can be customized. An existing keyboard layout can be edited, and a new layout can be created using this type of software.

For example, Ukelele [sic] for Mac,[116] AutoHotkey or The Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator[117] for Windows, and open-source Avro Keyboard provide the ability to customize the keyboard layout as desired.

We are excited to bring you an enhanced look, feel and enjoyable experience as you collaborate for impact. :arrow_down_small: Below are some of the design changes that you may notice from today as you browse through our revamped TWB Platform:

    Improved Homepage view: This new view of the homepage will allow tasks to be displayed in a smoother and better manner allowing you to see more information about the task, including the task type, the number of tasks in the entire project and more.

    Claiming Tasks: The process of claiming tasks remains similar to the old platform UI except for the small formatting changes, as seen in this short video(00:30s).

    New Badge: This revamp brings you a better-looking image copy of the badge that you can share with your network, displaying the current number of words you have donated.

    Claimed Tasks Section: The Claimed Tasks is now a section of its own directly on the header, allowing you to quickly find the tasks you are working on and more information on available tasks in your language pair(s).

    Mode: The mode functionality (button on the top left corner of the platform near the username button) will allow you to use the platform in light or dark mode, ensuring a better experience depending on one’s preference.

:hugs: These new changes to the interface were made for you: our amazing community, and we would love to hear your feedback. You can post it directly under this thread or contact us at translators@translatorswithoutborders.org.

For more information and a demonstration of key features improved by this platform revamp, please take 2 minutes and watch this short video. :clapper:

:black_nib: Languages use a wide variety of characters in their writing systems. A keyboard allows users to input characters and information into the computer. Learn how to use your keyboard 3.

:computer: If you look at the symbols in your keyboard right now, probably some of the characters you use to write in your language are not printed on the keys. Using a keyboard layout designed for your language can make those characters available to you easily, without having to change your actual physical keyboard.

:thinking: How does it work?

Multiple keyboard layouts can be installed at the same time on a computer. You can easily switch from one to the other with a few clicks.

:old_key: Key concepts:

    Keyboard layout: a specific distribution of keys and characters in a keyboard. It can be physical (the keys you see printed in your keyboard) or functional (a new set of characters configured by the user).
    Modifier keys: The most common modifier key is the Shift key, which on most keyboards will allow access to capital letters. Alt and Ctrl are also modifier keys. They can be combined with other keys to access different characters.
    Deadkeys: A special type of key that does not generate a character on the screen right away. It is combined with another key to create a special character. In French, for example, the combination of the deadkey ` (acute accent) with the key a (letter a) produces à.
    Combinations: In some keyboards, typing two characters one after the other causes them to change. For example, one might type n and then g but, instead of getting “ng” see it change to ŋ.

Depending on the keyboard one chooses, one or many of these alternatives may be used. The documentation for the keyboard generally covers this.

:mag_right: How to find keyboard layouts for specific language online

There are many applications to help you manage your keyboard layout.

    Operating system keyboard layout options
        Windows 4
        MacOs 1
    Keyman 2: helps you type in over 2000 languages on just about any device.

Here you can find some tutorials on how to install and use Keyman keyboards on your device. The documentation is available for both desktop and mobile versions.

:keyboard: Keyboard layouts for non-Latin alphabets

Here we’ve linked some suggested keyboards layouts designed specifically for each language or language family.

Nigeria: These three Keyman keyboards pair together to cover the expected needs of most of Nigeria’s languages. The three keyboards are identical except that the vowels are treated differently.

    Nigeria Odd Vowels (SIL) Keyboard. The vowels on this keyboard can have a non-standard shape as well as the standard tone markings. The keyboard also includes standard hook (implosives), nasality, tone, and the Naira sign. It includes Waha, Bura-Pabir, Fulfulde, Kanuri, Hausa, Marghi, Mandara and Kibaku characters.
    Nigeria Dot (SIL) keyboard. The vowels on this keyboard can have a dot below them as well as the standard tone markings. The keyboard also includes standard hook (implosives), nasality, tone, and the Naira sign.
    Nigeria Underline (SIL) keyboard. The vowels on this keyboard can have an underline below them as well as the standard tone markings. The keyboard also includes standard hook (implosives), nasality, tone, and the Naira sign.

Using a keyboard layout designed for your language can make those characters available to you easily, without having to change your actual physical keyboard.

Keyman has a large repository of keyboard layouts available for download. Below are the steps on how to install Keyman and a keyboard layout in your computer:

    Install “Keyman” which is the program that will manage the different keyboards you install on your computer. A full explanation on how to do this in different systems (Windows, macOS, Android, etc.) is provided here 1.

    Add keyboard layouts using this search page 1. Download the keyboard file and install it on your computer. You can check this page 1 for detailed instructions.

Do you have any specific keyboard layouts to recommend for your language? Do you use any other tool that in your experience works better for your language? We would love to know more!

Hi Aya,
I have watched the translator’s tool and find it very informative. However, I am not sure how to type the segment in Farsi in the letters. How can I utilize a Farsi keyboard. Please assist me and help me start the first project that I want to do correctly. Many thanks.

Welcome to the website about keyboard layouts in Windows.
input language -> keyboard layout -> keyboard driver

Layouts on this website can be linked using:
KLID number:	http://kbdlayout.info/00010405
Driver filename:	http://kbdlayout.info/kbdcz1
BCP-47 language tag:	http://kbdlayout.info/cs

Windows distinguishes input languages, keyboard layouts and keyboard drivers. Input language informs the system what language is the typed text supposedly in, which is used for features like spellchecking. Technically any keyboard layout can be used for any input language, but recent Windows versions started limiting which layouts can be selected for a given language in the user interface. All supported keyboard layouts are defined in the registry, under HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layouts. The subkeys identify the keyboard layouts (using KLID) and contain layout names as seen by the user, as well as references to the keyboard driver that defines which keys produce which characters. Several keyboard layouts can share one keyboard driver.

This data come from Windows 10.0.26200.5001, which contains 214 keyboard drivers and supports 215 keyboard layouts. Pick the one you are interested in:

Sertain / Nerts / Nerps, low redirect, low sfb, low pinky layouts.

Small intro first: I started using workman in October 2020, and then learnt other layouts over the following months (DH, Colemak, Dvorak, Semimak). I then realised that there likely weren't any layouts that met my exact preferences (not a particularly novel realisation haha). After learning a few layouts made by Apsu, I started making layouts with genkey (made by semi).

Main goals were avoiding redirects (3 keys in a row on the same hand that don't go in the same direction, like sad on QWERTY), reducing sfbs/sfs (dsfbs) (not particularly surprising), and not using the upper pinkies too much (semimak does this quite extensively, which, while it isn't a complete dealbreaker, certainly causes issues at times (fr, ay, and you on semimak are things I dislike, for example).

Here are the layouts:

Sertain:

x l d k v  z w o u ;

s r t n f  g y e i a

 j m h b q  p c ' , .

(Roughly 0.86% sfb and 4.35% redirects)

Nerts:

p l d v x  z k o u ;

n r t s g  y h e i a

 j m c w q  b f ' , .

(Roughly 0.90% sfb and 3.13% redirects)

Nerps:

x l d p v  z k o u ;

n r t s g  y h e i a

 j m c w q  b f ' , .

(Roughly 1.03% sfb and 3.11% redirects)

Further explanation:

The layouts posted here are for ANSI + angle mod, if you are to use them on ortho/colstag/rowstag without angle, I'd recommend reorganising the index fingers (whilst keeping in mind certain sfbs, notably kn on sertain, and sw/sc/by/(ps) on nerts/(nerps)).

When compared to many other layouts, the SFB rates aren't great (Semimak JQ has around a third fewer sfbs than Nerps) but I think that anything that hovers around 1% is absolutely useable, and the other factors are important as well. In terms of redirects, they're all pretty great, most layouts seem to be around 6-7% so I'm quite happy with these layouts in that regard.

Nerps is one cycle (p > v > x) away from Nerts, it sacrifices sfbs for lower pinky usage. Personally I'm using nerps but it's basically personal preference. Something similar can be done with Sertain (to increase pinky usage and decrease sfbs, with vx swap.)

The reason why I made Nerts is because Sertain's right index is somewhat underused, and I was curious about alternatives that maintained low redirects whilst having a balanced right hand (which is quite difficult, because any mixing between consonants and vowels is generally quite dangerous). At the cost of a few sfbs it seems this was possible. This also fixes redirects involving g and p from sertain.

Another small thing to note is that alt-fingering many of the sfbs on these layouts is quite easy (particularly kn on sertain and ps on nerps).

Smol note about my "credentials", I have 180wpm on workman (on mt) and 110+ wpm on 6 other layouts total, and have been learning about layout creation for about 5 months now, in case that matters (idk).

((I'm currently ~145 wpm on sertain, and ~40 wpm on nerps (after a few days of passive practice), so there's also some actual experience with these as well)).

Non angle modded versions (should be ok for row stag / col stag / ortho):

Sertain:

x l d k v  z w o u ;

s r t n f  g y e i a

q j m h b  p c ' , .

Nerts:

p l d g v  z k o u ;

n r t s w  y h e i a

q j m c x  b f ' , .

Nerps:

x l d p g  z k o u ;

n r t s w  y h e i a

q j m c v  b f ' , .

Okay that's the end of this long-winded post, ty for reading <3

Hands Down

Love the name, Nerts! There are many tasty sequences there.

This is a really interesting read. You’ve sure learned a lot in a short period, and managed some impressive performance on many layouts. Satisfying when it comes together, isn’t it?

Glad you like the post :D, I'm surprised you like the name considering how unoriginal it is haha (just the home row with a vowel, made it super quickly just to reference it when I first made it before forgetting about it for a few months lol). :) I still feel like my speed isn't particularly impressive, so many people are so much better than me still haha, but I'm guessing that's always the case. I don't practice speed typing so much anymore lol

I think if I can main nerps I'd be really happy, so far I haven't managed to switch off of workman properly (despite trying with ~4 layouts so far) :(

Colemak-DH

Looks good. I wonder why you don't swap K with F though?
incompletetrembling

• Edited 2y ago

I'm assuming you're talking about nerts/nerps. Originally I did have them swapped, but later realised that "k" interacts badly with vowels when its on qwerty's "u" (super similar to colemak's "L"). Just now I looked at the actual frequencies and it seems my intuition was wrong lol.

(If you add together the frequencies of the bigrams where k/b/f interact with e/i, weighting e twice as much, these are the numbers: K: 0.300%, F: 0.644%, B: 0.706%.)

Time to ✨Change The Reference Layout✨, ty for making me look into it more lol (also edited the post for anyone reading)

u/strongly-typed, I'm curious, for an ANSI keyboard, is this intended for an angle mod, thus having the following finger layout?

B L D W V   ' K O U J
N R T S G   Y H A E I
  X M C Z Q F P , ; .

So, I've been using the layout since the end of November, and I've ended up making a few minor swaps to the layout since then.

~ ! @ # $ %  ^ & * ( ) { }
  B L D W Z  _ F O U J : + 
  N R T S G  Y H A E I ?
  Q X M C V  K P > " <

` 1 2 3 4 5  6 7 8 9 0 [ ]
  b l d w z  ' f o u j ; =
  n r t s g  y h a e i ,
  q x m c v  k p . - /

The are some reasons for the non-standard punctuation. For instance, I do a lot of programming, and I often have to type -> and => in my code, so having > on middle makes that a lot more comfortable. Putting " on ring fixes ." which compared to .' is much more common. I put , and ? to the right of i because it improves u,, e,, u? and e?. Also, putting . on middle avoids some clashes with right shift, since . is more likely to be follow by either a space and a capital letter (as in prose) and in my case directly by a capital letter (in code... for example Belt.Map.String.fromArray()). Lastly, having : on top does have some benefits in programming too, particularly for python users, you get a nicer ): for all your def f():

Next, I swapped k and f because k makes more awkward trigrams with the vowels, for example: make, take, like. Also, f often makes bigrams with o: often, of, for. Lastly, I'm a bit on the fence about kp vs pk. If you do kp, then you have a bit less stretching overall (for example in the word people), but a worse phy. If you do pk, then you have to stretch a bit more, but phy can easily be alted with index, middle, index.

On the left hand, the only swap I made was to revert v back to its original position which is what the layout generator originally spit out. I find I really don't like that top row corner at all anyways.

So, some thoughts for angle mod:

    If you like alt fingering sc, then I would suggest something like this for the bottom row: xmvcq

    If you don't do alt fingering, then xmcvq would be the correct angle mod.

I should note that about 2 weeks later, GalileoBlues on discord independently found nearly the same exact layout through manual swaps. We only mutually realized we ended up on pretty much creating the same layout about 2 weeks after that. He also took some initiative and added his version of the layout to monkeytype under the name gallium. Mine went through a few name changes (nerves, moyaimak), but the final name I'm sticking to is graphite (because it is a rock used for writing, and also rock beats scissors ("scissors" being a loosely defined term we have been using to describe a set of awkward bigrams, such as qwerty ZW, EX, CR, CT, EV, etc...)). There is also another variant called maya, by adi.lela on discord who uses it in an angle mod configuration. I'll post those layouts here as well.

Note, I think if you're dead set against e on ring (I used to be, but not anymore, I actually find it really comfortable there), I should say I think it might be possible to make a variant with heai or even heia on the right hand, but just note if you do that, it would likely require some rethinking of the punctuation.

With that, I leave you with a reference for gallium and maya:

# gallium
b l d c v  z y o u ,
n r t s g  p h a e i
q x m w j  k f ' ; .

# maya (intended for use with angle mod)
b l d g q  j f o u ,
n r t s v  k h a e i
 x m c w z  p y ' / .

EDIT: Formatting.

Thank you so much for the detailed reply!
I've been experimenting with layouts and, so far, was using Middlemak. However, I am curious to experiment with others. In the process of learning a new layout, I convinced a few friends to embark on the process with me.

I had created a short list, and both Gallium and Graphite were already on it. But, I'm embarrassed to admit I did not realize that NRTS was Graphite! Great work on it! I also did not realize that Maya was similar, so thank you for adding it as another great option to try.

Part of my testing the layouts is to understand what I like / don't like, and also to understand the "Why" for various layouts. Your detailed answer is extremely helpful in this regard.

The variety of layouts is quite large, and can be overwhelming. But once I better figure out how well I like or dislike using the top row, bottom row, or finger use, I think that the final selection will be quick. So far, I find that I like the letter E on the ring finger, as well as the feel of the various NRTS layouts.

The entire process of learning a new layout has been great fun. Thank you all for the inputs

I was adding Nerps to my comparison tables and saw your post.

Take a look at my new Middlemak-NH over at r/Middlemak. It accomplishes much of the same as Nerps and the one above, while keeping qwerty similarity. Nerpa looks good too though, I'll look at the others later.

Love this breakdown, greatly appreciate the detailed thoughts as well.

Nearly a year on, have you made any further modifications to this/your layout. From your channel, I think you favour Graphite/MTGAP more now; would be neat to know how your thoughts have changed over this time and transition.

I Just want to support u/strongly-typed's comment by saying that after discovering Graphite, Gallium and Maya two days ago I've reprogrammed my boards for Gallium and don't intend to look back (yes, I am that sure).

I think it's probably more of a personal preference as to what is "best". For me Gallium won out because I don't like the bottom-row that much and Gallium uses the least of it out of the three (at the cost of "c" not being in an altogether great position IMHO). EDIT: that bottom-row usage bit may actually be incorrect but somehow it felt the less distracting to me after trying each out for a couple of hours... anyhow. to each his own ;)

I've hopelessly been trying all kinds of different layouts but never thought of using one with "e" on ring. However, strongly-typed is right; it works much better than I would have expected and have never typed on anything this comfortable (mind you; I don't have any kind of speed at it yet, but comfort comes first).

Hi I chose graphite probably mainly because I felt it used the bottom row less than gallium and has nice stats. Why do you feel that graphite uses the bottom row more ?

Hi there, I'm quite curious to hear what you find problematic on Dwarf that lead you to look to make a better layout, given that the stats for Dwarf is really quite good? I'm wondering why it is not more popular...

MTGAP

I didn't really "make" dwarf, it's just a very slight modification of whorf, which was actually made by whorf. But it's attributed to me because I made the modification I guess?... idk lol

Anyways, yes, the stats on Dwarf are really good if those are the only stats you're looking at. After I learned Dwarf, I found some things I didn't like about it, in particular I thought that I had some awkward finger patterns. Eventually an attempt was made to classify the awkward finger patterns, and the term "scissors" was born. It seems not everyone agrees on a consistent definition of scissors... but I think a vague definition might be something like:

If you look at the positions of two keys on the keyboard, you can draw a line between them. That line has a slope. Furthermore, the the shape of your hand has some directionality built into it. Generally speaking, pinky is short, middle finger is long... so if you were pressing two keys using those two fingers on the same hand, you might prefer the slope to be positive on your left hand, and negative on your right hand.

I'm not saying scissors in dwarf are bad, because to be honest I didn't really look back after I switched away from it and I don't know whether they're actually bad. But my impression at the time was that the finger patterns felt a little awkward. That being said, if you are using Dwarf and it feels comfortable to you, then you should be glad about it. Dwarf indeed has some very impressive stats, and if your fingers find it more comfortable than my fingers did, then that sounds like a good thing to me!

Thanks very much for your response!

Yes I can see that - the most noticeable scissor I have so far on dwarf is the bl biagram in English (funnily enough when I look at graphite bl are next to each other, subconscious optimization from you? haha)

One interesting thing is that my indexes are much shorter than my middles, so biagrams between index and middle on the left is better negative (maybe, seems true when I air type), this could be why I haven't had much trouble with scissors on dwarf yet, though it could just be that I haven't learned it sufficiently.

If you don't mind me asking, what do you do then to figure out if a layout is more likely than not better for you, without learning it? More specifically, is there a tool you use to measure and reduce scissors? Is there anything else to watch out for, other than the well known stats (SFB, SFSB, LSB, finger usage etc)?

Do you use vim? I'm trying to decide between gallium, graphite, sturdy, engram 2.0, colemak-dh, and nerps.

I do not use vim but I think all of those would be about as good for vim. (Use a navigation layer to replace hjkl, relearn the rest). Right now I use nerbs which is a mod of nerps that looks a lot like gallium, so I would recommend gallium out of that list :) but they're all fine (except engram v2 which i'd only recommend if you have super specific reasons to prefer it).

Can you maybe post versions that specify fingering? eg on a finger-coloured keyboard?

I tweaked it from sertain2.

ks is slightly problematic but could not find better spot for k, and swapping s and r columns will likely be worse. The index fingers have n and c, neither want k.

Have finished running tests, now need to dump database and upload thousands of files. .... I should maybe demote sertain original to "dev" version.

Cheers, Ian

Where is sertain2 from though?
Also tbf nk/kn aren't terrible sfbs to have, you can also alt finger them nicely on sertain (as I mentioned previously).
To illustrate how non-terrible the kn pairing is, compare ks/sk frequencies with kn/nk frequencies. ks+sk is 0.087%, kn+nk is 0.103% (data from norvig). I'd take a 0.1% index sfb over a 0.09% pinky sfb any day lol.

Hi, I'm curious to hear your thoughts on Nerts:

    Swapping Z and Q: is there any clear downside?

    Why is there the rearrangement of the left index between the staggered and matrix version? I switch between the two occasionally and would like to use one consistent layout, which version should I use?

Sertain / Nerts / Nerps, low redirect, low sfb, low pinky layouts.

Small intro first: I started using workman in October 2020, and then learnt other layouts over the following months (DH, Colemak, Dvorak, Semimak). I then realised that there likely weren't any layouts that met my exact preferences (not a particularly novel realisation haha). After learning a few layouts made by Apsu, I started making layouts with genkey (made by semi).

Main goals were avoiding redirects (3 keys in a row on the same hand that don't go in the same direction, like sad on QWERTY), reducing sfbs/sfs (dsfbs) (not particularly surprising), and not using the upper pinkies too much (semimak does this quite extensively, which, while it isn't a complete dealbreaker, certainly causes issues at times (fr, ay, and you on semimak are things I dislike, for example).

Here are the layouts:

Sertain:

x l d k v  z w o u ;

s r t n f  g y e i a

 j m h b q  p c ' , .

(Roughly 0.86% sfb and 4.35% redirects)

Nerts:

p l d v x  z k o u ;

n r t s g  y h e i a

 j m c w q  b f ' , .

(Roughly 0.90% sfb and 3.13% redirects)

Nerps:

x l d p v  z k o u ;

n r t s g  y h e i a

 j m c w q  b f ' , .

(Roughly 1.03% sfb and 3.11% redirects)

Further explanation:

The layouts posted here are for ANSI + angle mod, if you are to use them on ortho/colstag/rowstag without angle, I'd recommend reorganising the index fingers (whilst keeping in mind certain sfbs, notably kn on sertain, and sw/sc/by/(ps) on nerts/(nerps)).

When compared to many other layouts, the SFB rates aren't great (Semimak JQ has around a third fewer sfbs than Nerps) but I think that anything that hovers around 1% is absolutely useable, and the other factors are important as well. In terms of redirects, they're all pretty great, most layouts seem to be around 6-7% so I'm quite happy with these layouts in that regard.

Nerps is one cycle (p > v > x) away from Nerts, it sacrifices sfbs for lower pinky usage. Personally I'm using nerps but it's basically personal preference. Something similar can be done with Sertain (to increase pinky usage and decrease sfbs, with vx swap.)

The reason why I made Nerts is because Sertain's right index is somewhat underused, and I was curious about alternatives that maintained low redirects whilst having a balanced right hand (which is quite difficult, because any mixing between consonants and vowels is generally quite dangerous). At the cost of a few sfbs it seems this was possible. This also fixes redirects involving g and p from sertain.

Another small thing to note is that alt-fingering many of the sfbs on these layouts is quite easy (particularly kn on sertain and ps on nerps).

Smol note about my "credentials", I have 180wpm on workman (on mt) and 110+ wpm on 6 other layouts total, and have been learning about layout creation for about 5 months now, in case that matters (idk).

((I'm currently ~145 wpm on sertain, and ~40 wpm on nerps (after a few days of passive practice), so there's also some actual experience with these as well)).

Non angle modded versions (should be ok for row stag / col stag / ortho):

Sertain:

x l d k v  z w o u ;

s r t n f  g y e i a

q j m h b  p c ' , .

Nerts:

p l d g v  z k o u ;

n r t s w  y h e i a

q j m c x  b f ' , .

Nerps:

x l d p g  z k o u ;

n r t s w  y h e i a

q j m c v  b f ' , .

Okay that's the end of this long-winded post, ty for reading <3

Love the name, Nerts! There are many tasty sequences there.

This is a really interesting read. You’ve sure learned a lot in a short period, and managed some impressive performance on many layouts. Satisfying when it comes together, isn’t it?

Glad you like the post :D, I'm surprised you like the name considering how unoriginal it is haha (just the home row with a vowel, made it super quickly just to reference it when I first made it before forgetting about it for a few months lol). :) I still feel like my speed isn't particularly impressive, so many people are so much better than me still haha, but I'm guessing that's always the case. I don't practice speed typing so much anymore lol

I think if I can main nerps I'd be really happy, so far I haven't managed to switch off of workman properly (despite trying with ~4 layouts so far) :(

• Edited 2y ago

I'm assuming you're talking about nerts/nerps. Originally I did have them swapped, but later realised that "k" interacts badly with vowels when its on qwerty's "u" (super similar to colemak's "L"). Just now I looked at the actual frequencies and it seems my intuition was wrong lol.

(If you add together the frequencies of the bigrams where k/b/f interact with e/i, weighting e twice as much, these are the numbers: K: 0.300%, F: 0.644%, B: 0.706%.)

u/strongly-typed, I'm curious, for an ANSI keyboard, is this intended for an angle mod, thus having the following finger layout?

B L D W V   ' K O U J
N R T S G   Y H A E I
  X M C Z Q F P , ; .

MTGAP

So, I've been using the layout since the end of November, and I've ended up making a few minor swaps to the layout since then.

~ ! @ # $ %  ^ & * ( ) { }
  B L D W Z  _ F O U J : + 
  N R T S G  Y H A E I ?
  Q X M C V  K P > " <

` 1 2 3 4 5  6 7 8 9 0 [ ]
  b l d w z  ' f o u j ; =
  n r t s g  y h a e i ,
  q x m c v  k p . - /

The are some reasons for the non-standard punctuation. For instance, I do a lot of programming, and I often have to type -> and => in my code, so having > on middle makes that a lot more comfortable. Putting " on ring fixes ." which compared to .' is much more common. I put , and ? to the right of i because it improves u,, e,, u? and e?. Also, putting . on middle avoids some clashes with right shift, since . is more likely to be follow by either a space and a capital letter (as in prose) and in my case directly by a capital letter (in code... for example Belt.Map.String.fromArray()). Lastly, having : on top does have some benefits in programming too, particularly for python users, you get a nicer ): for all your def f():

Next, I swapped k and f because k makes more awkward trigrams with the vowels, for example: make, take, like. Also, f often makes bigrams with o: often, of, for. Lastly, I'm a bit on the fence about kp vs pk. If you do kp, then you have a bit less stretching overall (for example in the word people), but a worse phy. If you do pk, then you have to stretch a bit more, but phy can easily be alted with index, middle, index.

On the left hand, the only swap I made was to revert v back to its original position which is what the layout generator originally spit out. I find I really don't like that top row corner at all anyways.

So, some thoughts for angle mod:

    If you like alt fingering sc, then I would suggest something like this for the bottom row: xmvcq

    If you don't do alt fingering, then xmcvq would be the correct angle mod.

I should note that about 2 weeks later, GalileoBlues on discord independently found nearly the same exact layout through manual swaps. We only mutually realized we ended up on pretty much creating the same layout about 2 weeks after that. He also took some initiative and added his version of the layout to monkeytype under the name gallium. Mine went through a few name changes (nerves, moyaimak), but the final name I'm sticking to is graphite (because it is a rock used for writing, and also rock beats scissors ("scissors" being a loosely defined term we have been using to describe a set of awkward bigrams, such as qwerty ZW, EX, CR, CT, EV, etc...)). There is also another variant called maya, by adi.lela on discord who uses it in an angle mod configuration. I'll post those layouts here as well.

Note, I think if you're dead set against e on ring (I used to be, but not anymore, I actually find it really comfortable there), I should say I think it might be possible to make a variant with heai or even heia on the right hand, but just note if you do that, it would likely require some rethinking of the punctuation.

With that, I leave you with a reference for gallium and maya:

# gallium
b l d c v  z y o u ,
n r t s g  p h a e i
q x m w j  k f ' ; .

# maya (intended for use with angle mod)
b l d g q  j f o u ,
n r t s v  k h a e i
 x m c w z  p y ' / .

EDIT: Formatting.

Thank you so much for the detailed reply!
I've been experimenting with layouts and, so far, was using Middlemak. However, I am curious to experiment with others. In the process of learning a new layout, I convinced a few friends to embark on the process with me.

I had created a short list, and both Gallium and Graphite were already on it. But, I'm embarrassed to admit I did not realize that NRTS was Graphite! Great work on it! I also did not realize that Maya was similar, so thank you for adding it as another great option to try.

Part of my testing the layouts is to understand what I like / don't like, and also to understand the "Why" for various layouts. Your detailed answer is extremely helpful in this regard.

The variety of layouts is quite large, and can be overwhelming. But once I better figure out how well I like or dislike using the top row, bottom row, or finger use, I think that the final selection will be quick. So far, I find that I like the letter E on the ring finger, as well as the feel of the various NRTS layouts.

The entire process of learning a new layout has been great fun. Thank you all for the inputs

I was adding Nerps to my comparison tables and saw your post.

Take a look at my new Middlemak-NH over at r/Middlemak. It accomplishes much of the same as Nerps and the one above, while keeping qwerty similarity. Nerpa looks good too though, I'll look at the others later.

Love this breakdown, greatly appreciate the detailed thoughts as well.

Nearly a year on, have you made any further modifications to this/your layout. From your channel, I think you favour Graphite/MTGAP more now; would be neat to know how your thoughts have changed over this time and transition.

I Just want to support u/strongly-typed's comment by saying that after discovering Graphite, Gallium and Maya two days ago I've reprogrammed my boards for Gallium and don't intend to look back (yes, I am that sure).

I think it's probably more of a personal preference as to what is "best". For me Gallium won out because I don't like the bottom-row that much and Gallium uses the least of it out of the three (at the cost of "c" not being in an altogether great position IMHO). EDIT: that bottom-row usage bit may actually be incorrect but somehow it felt the less distracting to me after trying each out for a couple of hours... anyhow. to each his own ;)

I've hopelessly been trying all kinds of different layouts but never thought of using one with "e" on ring. However, strongly-typed is right; it works much better than I would have expected and have never typed on anything this comfortable (mind you; I don't have any kind of speed at it yet, but comfort comes first).

Hi I chose graphite probably mainly because I felt it used the bottom row less than gallium and has nice stats. Why do you feel that graphite uses the bottom row more ?

Hi there, I'm quite curious to hear what you find problematic on Dwarf that lead you to look to make a better layout, given that the stats for Dwarf is really quite good? I'm wondering why it is not more popular...

MTGAP

I didn't really "make" dwarf, it's just a very slight modification of whorf, which was actually made by whorf. But it's attributed to me because I made the modification I guess?... idk lol

Anyways, yes, the stats on Dwarf are really good if those are the only stats you're looking at. After I learned Dwarf, I found some things I didn't like about it, in particular I thought that I had some awkward finger patterns. Eventually an attempt was made to classify the awkward finger patterns, and the term "scissors" was born. It seems not everyone agrees on a consistent definition of scissors... but I think a vague definition might be something like:

If you look at the positions of two keys on the keyboard, you can draw a line between them. That line has a slope. Furthermore, the the shape of your hand has some directionality built into it. Generally speaking, pinky is short, middle finger is long... so if you were pressing two keys using those two fingers on the same hand, you might prefer the slope to be positive on your left hand, and negative on your right hand.

I'm not saying scissors in dwarf are bad, because to be honest I didn't really look back after I switched away from it and I don't know whether they're actually bad. But my impression at the time was that the finger patterns felt a little awkward. That being said, if you are using Dwarf and it feels comfortable to you, then you should be glad about it. Dwarf indeed has some very impressive stats, and if your fingers find it more comfortable than my fingers did, then that sounds like a good thing to me!

Thanks very much for your response!

Yes I can see that - the most noticeable scissor I have so far on dwarf is the bl biagram in English (funnily enough when I look at graphite bl are next to each other, subconscious optimization from you? haha)

One interesting thing is that my indexes are much shorter than my middles, so biagrams between index and middle on the left is better negative (maybe, seems true when I air type), this could be why I haven't had much trouble with scissors on dwarf yet, though it could just be that I haven't learned it sufficiently.

If you don't mind me asking, what do you do then to figure out if a layout is more likely than not better for you, without learning it? More specifically, is there a tool you use to measure and reduce scissors? Is there anything else to watch out for, other than the well known stats (SFB, SFSB, LSB, finger usage etc)?

Do you use vim? I'm trying to decide between gallium, graphite, sturdy, engram 2.0, colemak-dh, and nerps.
incompletetrembling

I do not use vim but I think all of those would be about as good for vim. (Use a navigation layer to replace hjkl, relearn the rest). Right now I use nerbs which is a mod of nerps that looks a lot like gallium, so I would recommend gallium out of that list :) but they're all fine (except engram v2 which i'd only recommend if you have super specific reasons to prefer it).

I tweaked it from sertain2.

ks is slightly problematic but could not find better spot for k, and swapping s and r columns will likely be worse. The index fingers have n and c, neither want k.

Have finished running tests, now need to dump database and upload thousands of files. .... I should maybe demote sertain original to "dev" version.

Cheers, Ian

Where is sertain2 from though?
Also tbf nk/kn aren't terrible sfbs to have, you can also alt finger them nicely on sertain (as I mentioned previously).
To illustrate how non-terrible the kn pairing is, compare ks/sk frequencies with kn/nk frequencies. ks+sk is 0.087%, kn+nk is 0.103% (data from norvig). I'd take a 0.1% index sfb over a 0.09% pinky sfb any day lol.

Hi, I'm curious to hear your thoughts on Nerts:

    Swapping Z and Q: is there any clear downside?

    Why is there the rearrangement of the left index between the staggered and matrix version? I switch between the two occasionally and would like to use one consistent layout, which version should I use?

It an experimental layout with images, that let you remember grid positions and next you can associate it with letters. Is especially important when you want to learn various layers, so association will be better. Is still ned to examine. But worth to try.
