Intro
this is the plank ez an incredibly
portable well-designed and well-built
ortholinear mechanical keyboard that was
that was a lot of words basically this
is a beautifully minimal
small light mechanical keyboard that is
just a joy to use
a little disclaimer before we start i am
absolutely not an expert on mechanical
keyboards
this is only the second one i've ever
owned i've never built my own
so this is a review for more of an
average user than an expert enthusiast
i bought this keyboard as i spend a huge
portion of my life in front of a screen
and creating things on the computer
brings me a lot of joy
the keyboard is the main tool for this
creating so i wanted one that i could
appreciate the design of and that felt
really great to use
in saying that you absolutely don't need
an expensive keyboard it's very much a
luxury
but having this here to work on every
day pleases my inner design nerd
and customizing your workspace can do
wonders for your attitude and approach
to your work your play
and just overall productivity so what is
a plank
ortholinear keyboard well you can kind
Physical Overview
of see the main characteristics at first
look
namely there are a lot less keys on this
thing than a typical keyboard
and they're all in a perfect grid with
no staggering between keys that you
normally see on a standard keyboard
this means you get a much smaller
lighter keyboard and they say it's a lot
easier and faster to type on with the
grid layout as your hands and have to
move as far to reach all the keys
planck refers to the style of the
keyboard with the minimal keys and the
grid and while you can build your own
playing keyboard with individual parts
the ez is a pre-built fully assembled
version with a warranty support
all of that it's the less diy option but
it's perfect for people like me who just
want to start typing
so let's jump into the review and we'll
start with the physical appearance
this is a really stripped back look with
a single color and all the keys sort of
floating
above a thin board i love the look
function based design makes me very
happy
being able to see the keys and how they
connect to the board and kind of the
lights underneath and all the
that area there is it's really cool size
wise this is small
here it is compared to an iphone 11 pro
max this this could actually fit in a
large pocket
and it doesn't take up much room in my
bag at all when carrying it from home to
work and back
so we have the grid on the front here
with the keycaps we have the board
we have some rubbery feet on the bottom
and some of the logos and branding of
those behind the plank in this
particular build
and i love this quote they've added to
the back as well it really sums up the
idea and the philosophy behind this
keyboard
to wrap our tour up we have a usbc cable
here at the back there isn't a bluetooth
option for this but that's never really
bothered me and it would probably mean a
much heavier keyboard due to a battery
the planky z also has full backlight
functionality
all fully customizable i'll cycle
through a bunch now to show you they're
they're really fun they're really cool
and i kind of change whichever one i'm
using at any given time
based on my mood and uh kind of how it
all feels and fits together so
let's have a look at the lights
[Music]
[Music]
is
[Music]
please
[Music]
Typing Experience
okay so in terms of type feel sound the
whole experience this is only my second
mechanical keyboard so i'm comparing it
to the iq unix f60 here
as well as the standard apple keyboard
the main word i'd use to describe typing
on this
is light the keys aren't heavy the
priority here seems to be on portability
and minimalism so there's no metal the
keycaps feel light and easy to press
while it does have a plastic feeling
there's never a feeling of lesser
quality it feels very well made very
well designed and well built
i went for cherry mx browns for switches
as i sometimes work in a co-working
space and wanted something relatively
quiet
so here's a quick typing sound test
i'll also compare that with typing on
the iq unix i think that's how you
pronounce it
which also has cherry mx browns
Missing Keys
you may be asking one big question so
far in this video where are all the
missing keys
this keyboard it kind of seems to be
missing some pretty important ones
we don't have a numbers row we don't
have much punctuation here either
or other kind of essential keys like
media controls and other controls for
your machine
all of these are accessed through combo
keys you'll notice we have two layer
keys either side of the spacebar
you hold each of these down to access
the raised layer of keys or the lower
layer
for example if i hold the raise key here
this whole top row is now numbers being
one two three four all the way up to
nine and zero at the end here holding
this one then now your symbols and
punctuation
this does take some time to get used to
and for the first few weeks of owning
this i had the configuration screen open
for trickier things like shortcuts to
increase or decrease photoshop brush
sizes with the square brackets or
underscores and dashes um good to have
that they're referenced while you're
learning but trust me after a few weeks
things settle into memory
and i never really need to reference
anything these days it all just feels
very very natural a lot of muscle memory
there this configuration is done through
this website here and you can actually
remap
everything and then push the update to
your keyboard so this thing is
completely customizable
i actually haven't played around much
with that but it is there
so if you do get this keyboard bookmark
this page for the first few weeks of use
and i've linked it down
in the description as well in terms of
using this on a macro of windows the
keyboard is really well set up for both
operating systems with no specific
command key
instead a key that just says os as well
as the alt key for option
if you're on a mac okay before we finish
this is more of a fun one the keyboard
plays music
this doesn't seem to work well in a
standard typing mode only while in the
music mode so you can't have this arm
while working
uh i don't think at least it could be
wrong but this is just what i found
myself
but it's just so much fun that i had to
show you it
really feels like the old kind of i feel
like i'm playing
the old game boy or game by pocket back
in the day a lot of nostalgia feelings
uh with this sound here
[Music]
overall i'm incredibly happy with the
plank easy having a keyboard
like this small and light this portable
while also being fully mechanical and
just so beautifully designed it's a
fantastic combination
the only cons i've found are the slight
learning curve to get used to having
less keys
and also that your muscle memory gets
very used to typing on this ortholinear
style keyboard
so i struggle going back to typing on a
standard staggered keyboard now which
you know can be a bit of a bother
sometimes when i just set my laptop for
example
those two small grabs aside this thing
is awesome i love it it looks so great
on my desk and it fits so well in my bag
and it brings that little bit of joy to
my typing every day
when i'm working and using it so that's
it for this week
i have the link to check it out in the
description below let me know any
thoughts in the comments and thank you
very much for watching
i'll see you next week bye

### Accomplishments

The video accomplishes the goal of demystifying the process of building and customizing a custom keyboard, especially for beginners.

### Interesting Quotes or Insightful Sentences

- "Custom keyboards are the typing equivalent of the sort of person who whips out a Mont Blanc pen in a meeting."
- "It's a bit like dating... you're probably going to be tinkering and adjusting for years."

### Lecture Content

- Differences between custom and pre-built keyboards.
- The concept of 'thock' and its importance in the keyboard community.
- The potential financial investment required for high-end customizations.

This review serves as a comprehensive guide for those curious about entering the world of custom keyboards, emphasizing the joy and satisfaction derived from creating a personalized typing experience.

### Useful Notes from Comments for Keyboard Lecture

#### Insights on Customization and Preferences

- **ISO Versions Demand**: There's a noticeable demand for ISO layout versions of keyboards, indicating a preference or requirement for specific key sizes and arrangements, such as a full-size Enter key. This highlights the importance of layout customization in meeting user needs.
- **Customization Flexibility**: The discussion about replacing keycaps and accommodating different switches under a single keycap (like a full-size Enter) reflects the deep level of customization possible but also points to potential challenges in achieving desired configurations.

#### Cost and Value Perception

- **Expense of the Hobby**: Several comments touch on the high costs associated with custom keyboards, emphasizing the hobby's potential to become quite expensive. The mention of a heavy, high-quality keyboard like the Keychron Q1 Pro underlines the premium some are willing to pay for specific features, including weight and build quality.
- **Value vs. Expense**: There's a sentiment that much of the custom keyboard market is overpriced, suggesting that the perceived value may not always align with the cost. This is tied to the "Ikea effect," where individuals may overvalue something they've built themselves, influencing their willingness to invest in custom builds.

#### Community and Learning

- **Keyboard Meets**: The suggestion to attend keyboard meets indicates the value of community engagement for learning and experiencing different aspects of the hobby firsthand. This could be an essential tip for newcomers looking to deepen their understanding without fully committing financially.

#### Technical Advice and Modding Tips

- **Tape Mod**: Mention of the tape mod as an easy starting point for modding indicates a simple yet effective way to alter the sound and feel of a keyboard. This could be a useful tip for those looking to experiment with customization without extensive commitment.
- **Thock as a Buzzword**: The discussion around "thock" being a buzzword and not universally sought after within the hobby suggests that preferences for keyboard sounds and feels are highly subjective, and there's no one-size-fits-all in keyboard customization.

#### Segments within the Hobby

- Different motivations for engaging in the hobby were highlighted, including DIY/tinkering, aesthetics, engaging in full absurdity with extreme customizations, and vintage keyboard collecting. This segmentation could be useful in understanding the diverse interests and approaches within the custom keyboard community.

These insights from the comments provide a nuanced view of the custom keyboard hobby, touching on user preferences, the impact of customization on perceived value, the importance of community engagement for learning, and practical tips for newcomers interested in modding and customization. This information could enrich a lecture on keyboards by addressing the breadth of interests and approaches within the hobby.

Certainly! Based on the transcription and comments, here are some interesting facts that could enrich a lecture on keyboards, particularly focusing on the custom keyboard community:

1. **Customization Depth**: The level of customization in custom keyboards extends far beyond just aesthetic changes. Enthusiasts can tweak everything from the sound and feel of the keyboard (the "thock") to the specific resistance and feedback of each key, illustrating the hobby's depth.
    
2. **Community Engagement**: The custom keyboard community places a significant value on meet-ups and sharing experiences. These gatherings are not just for showcasing builds but also for newcomers to experience different keyboards firsthand, highlighting the community's inclusive and supportive nature.
    
3. **Psychological Investment**: The "Ikea effect," where individuals value something more highly if they've personally invested effort into its creation, plays a significant role in the custom keyboard community. This psychological principle can influence both the satisfaction users derive from their custom builds and their willingness to invest in the hobby.
    
4. **Diverse Entry Points**: There are multiple entry points into the hobby, from modifying pre-built keyboards to diving into full custom builds. This flexibility allows for a broader range of participants, from those with a casual interest to hardcore enthusiasts.
    
5. **ISO Layout Demand**: The demand for ISO layouts and the challenges associated with customizing keyboards to meet this preference reveal the global diversity of the keyboard community. It underscores the importance of accommodating different typing habits and regional standards.
    
6. **Sound Customization**: The pursuit of the perfect "thock" demonstrates the nuanced preferences within the community, with enthusiasts going to great lengths to fine-tune the sound profile of their keyboards. This aspect of customization is so detailed that it can involve adjustments to individual keys.
    
7. **Economic Aspects**: The discussion around the expense associated with custom keyboards highlights a fascinating economic aspect of the hobby. Some enthusiasts are willing to invest significant amounts into their keyboards, indicating a strong perceived value and a thriving market for both components and complete custom setups.

Intro
new feet just released their very first
custom keyboard and in this video I'm
going to take a look but here's the
thing I'm a fresh certified custom
keyboard virgin and if you're on the
verge of buying or building your very
first custom keyboard come on let's jump
in
together contrary to popular opinion and
my YouTube feed I am not a massive
keyboard nerd I don't know what lubing
is well I do but I don't ever do it with
keyboards I haven't a clue about what
all the different kind of switches mean
or represent beyond the classic linear
bumpy or clicky options and the last
time I saw this much foam I was on my
first overseas holiday in ABA and I
nearly drowned in this video I'm going
to be building and tweaking my very
first custom keyboard and sharing all
the stuff I've learned about this nerdy
little hobby along the way and if you're
thinking about jumping down that
particular Rabbit Hole I reckon there
are broadly three things you should know
before you get started firstly let's
The big difference between custom and pre-built
talk about the biggest difference
between a custom keyboard and a regular
good quality off-the-shelf keyboard like
this one this is the new Fe s75 version
2 by the way I reviewed it last year and
it performs really well as an allrounder
and here is new's first custom keyboard
the gem 180 and you're probably thinking
well why would I buy this that I've got
to build myself when I could just go and
buy this instead well the answer
probably depends on how fussy you are
for me it's all a bit like dating stay
with me here so first of all cast your
mind back to when you were a total new
be to the dating scene maybe you started
going on a few dates maybe you met some
nice people you started to get a feel
for what and who you're into and also
what you're really not into and both of
those things are a really important part
of the process in terms of deciding who
you might ultimately spend a big part of
your life with now it might be that you
go on your first date and you end up
meeting the love of your life and you
realize that they're the perfect person
for you and there's absolutely nothing
you want to change about them ever in
which case good for you stop this video
and go and get yourself one of these
instead what I think happens in a lot of
cases if people are being really honest
is that if you're lucky you might
eventually end up in a relationship
where the foundation is solid but deep
down you know there are a few things
that could be a little bit better little
insight into my marriage there this is
your custom keyboard type of
relationship you basically enter into it
knowing that you're probably going to be
tinkering and adjusting for years and
that's okay as long as you're prepared
to jump down that rabbit hole together
let's take the gem at for instance the
amount of customization is unlike
anything I've ever seen on a regular
consumer keyboard it ships Bare Bones
which means you get the foundations of
your keyboard all assembled and ready to
go you just then need to install
switches and key caps you can swap out
the switches of course this one landed
with these purple ones on but I got a
whole pack of these lemon switches and I
use the included switch and Cat puller
to swap out and replace everything this
is how it sounded before I
did and then
afterwards newy have collaborated with
gatron to produce a completely new line
of switches for this release there's
mint which is a Superlight linear switch
raspberry which is also linear but
requires a bit more force and has less
travel and then lemon which which is a
tactile or bumpy switch with even more
Force required all of these will give
you a slightly different level of
tactility depending on how you like your
keys to feel now if you don't fancy
these there are a ton of others to
choose from to and of course you can mix
and match so if you want the letter keys
to be one style but the shift key to
have a bit more of a bump to it that's
totally up to you in terms of the
foundation for my custom keyboard
relationship I went for this Cosmic
mocha color to tie in with all my desk
accessories and I'm super happy with the
quality of the frame the weight and the
these coffee and cream retro colors
there are plenty of others to choose
from including some that are a bit more
futuristic but let's say I didn't much
like these retro double shot PBT key
caps I can easily swap them out for
another set newy have made a bunch of
key cap sets to go with each of the gem
80 color themes but there are a million
and one different key cap sets that you
can pick up for this classic 80% 10
keyless layout and that is classic
keyboard nerd lingo for a keyboard
that's not got a number pad see I've
learned all sorts this week in terms of
further custom imization you can go into
software like via and then start
swapping around the way the keys work
it's as easy as connecting a cable
loading the software and then dragging
and dropping the keys with the commands
that you want this is a feature that's
also starting to be present on a lot of
non-custom keyboards now too which is
great but we can go further if I flip
this over remove the screws and then
start taking this to Pieces we can begin
playing with what's going on on the
inside in here you'll find a bunch of
sound dampening materials including
three layers of foam and a silicone P
base you can actually add more to this
if you like more or less bounce in your
keyboard or even change the Acoustics by
adding a different kind of plate
material such as aluminium polycarbonate
or pom or adding different types of
gasket like strips beads or more it's a
bit like having a custom performance car
but with this one you get everything you
need to tweak exactly how it feels and
sounds without needing to buy an
entirely new vehicle every time you want
to make a change on to my second big
What is 'thock'?
thing now I've just discovered that
there's a kind of Holy Trinity when it
comes to custom keyboards that I hadn't
really thought about until testing out
this one but before we go into what
makes up this Trinity we need to talk
about thiness now any self-respecting
keyboard nerd which is not me by the way
seems to be in search of the perfect
thock now there is quite a lot of debate
over what thiness really means but
simply put thock is a sound it's a deep
rich muted sound signature that's found
in certain mechanical keys keyboards now
if you're into ASMR it's probably the
sort of thing that will light you up if
you want to listen to it for a long
stretches of time and when you've heard
it I can fully understand why some
people go chasing it if you want to try
building a keyboard that sounds thy
you're going to be wanting to consider
three key variables this is the Trinity
I was talking about there are more of
course but let's start with three volume
pitch and depth now each of these
different elements can be controlled by
using different types of switches key
caps and material materials on the
inside and it's a bit like fine-tuning a
piano you can add a new Switch here that
sounds quite nice you can add a gasket
pad there it's even nicer let's try a
metal plate instead of a plastic one not
sure about that let's try something else
if we take the space bar as a single
example newy have added these extra
silicon pieces here which they call
their ghost bar the idea is that it
should sound like all the other switches
rather than Hollow and rattly like some
of the space bars do now with everything
on it sounds like this
now you might not be able to tell the
difference but trust me it feels really
different and you can do this with all
aspects of this keyboard now if you're a
bit of an experimental by Nature I can
totally see why a people get lost in
finding the perfect combination of keys
switches and more and B why people
describe this as a hobby you could conco
a kind of Sonic recipe that gives you
your perfect volume pitch and depth dep
that pleases you most and then spend
months maybe years refining that recipe
now I'm just beginning to understand why
people can and do become obsessive about
The cost of custom
this the third and final thing I want to
share about my Adventures into custom
keyboards is that if you take the red
pill and go down the rabbit hole this
hobby can get really expensive really
quickly now I went over to mod designs
page to check out their sonic keyboard
and this was genuinely like building a
custom car you can pick out pretty much
anything and just like a high-end car
what started as a Bas pric
$299 product quickly racked up to more
than $600 for a keyboard that will
arrive and I will need to build myself
you can go much much higher than that
too if you're a serious custom keyboard
Enthusiast I saw this video the other
day about
$35,000 custom keyboard it's making me
think that custom keyboards are the
typing equivalent of the sort of person
who whips out a mon Blan pen in a
meeting it can fundamentally do the same
thing as a 50 Cent BYO but the premium
build and feel and Prestige makes a
statement both to the people that see it
and to the person using it now
Conclusion - Gem80 review
thankfully if you're in off the-shelf
keyboard territory right now and you
want to level up your keyboard game
maybe you want to dip a toe in the water
with custom boards the gem at isn't
anywhere near that expensive this one
I've been using in today's video starts
at $149 but if you add on the
connectivity option options switches
themed key caps matching wrist rest
you'll be looking at just over $200 it's
not too bad if like me you're kind of
building your collection still
experimenting with your taste but don't
want to get into crazy custom keyboard
pricing territory just yet it feels like
they've made a keyboard specifically for
people who are custom curious and they
kind of know they'll need a bit of
handholding when they're taking the
plunge for the first time just in case
you're wondering by the way newfi aren't
sponsoring this video but they did send
me this keyboard to try out ahead of the
pre-order and the link in the
description is Affiliated so if you're
fancy picking up one of these for
yourself and you do want to support the
channel head in by the link below and
use my code and get yourself a sweet
sweet 10% discount on this or anything
else in their store enjoy folks if you
got any questions about this one you
know what to do maybe you're an
experienced custom keyboard person and
you've got some suggestions for me as a
relative amateur to improve my
experience if so great let me know all
your favorite modifications down in the
comments and maybe I'm make a followup
or perhaps there are some other big
things that anyone who wants to get into
custom keyboards needs to know that I've
not covered here drop a comment below
and let us know and in the meantime if
you don't feel like building your own
keyboard after watching this you might

Transcription:

Join us as we debunk 5 Ergonomic Myths and Misconceptions about ergonomic keyboards! We will guide you through the facts to help you make an informed decision on what's the best ergonomic split keyboard that can maximize and enhance your productivity and comfort. After watching this, you'll be able to answer the question yourself! Are Ergonomic Keyboards a Load of Bullsh*t? Are ergonomic keyboards really better? Or are split keyboards even worth it? 🤔

Intro

PERSON: What on earth are you doing?

NIX: Typing on my new  ergonomic keyboard, of course!

PERSON: That doesn't look very ergonomic!

NIX: It is, see...

PERSON: Ugh, ergonomic keyboards  are a load of bullshit...

Hey Dygmates, I'm Dominique Garcia,  cousin of the lesser-known Andy Garcia.

Today, we will dive into what makes  a keyboard ergonomic –specifically,  

busting certain myths  surrounding ergonomic keyboards.

We're going to coin them as.....*drumroll*

Ergonomyths!

You heard it here first.

But before we get "a bustin'", let's first  identify the true definition of ergonomics:

What is Ergonomics?

You'll find that across the majority  of definitions for ergonomics,  

a pattern of the same concept continues to arise:  

Working safely, with less  discomfort, and optimized well-being.

That's our primary goal, right?

You might think your primary goal is  to work faster or more efficiently,  

but how is that even possible if you  spend half of your day in discomfort?

So based on this concept, let's get a bustin'.

Starting with 

Ergonomyth numéro un: Negative  tilt is an absolute must

1 Negative tilt is a must

Most conventional keyboards have a positive  tilt where the back is higher than the front,  

forcing you to extend your wrists, which  creates pressure on the tissues and vessels.

A negative tilt, instead, allows the  'au naturel' neutral wrist position,  

which is generally advised when typing your  cute little derrière off for hours on end.

But is the negative tilt ideal in  all situations? The answer is no.

Despite being an excellent feature in certain  environments, it can become a hindrance in others.

For example, if your keyboard sits  above the level of your elbows,  

you'd find yourself in an almost  funky 'T-rex'-like position,  

with flexed elbows forcing your hands to scale the  negative slope to reach for those further keys.

Regardless of the model, it depends on  the distance between your body and the  

desk. If you can sit so that your arms are  parallel to the floor, you're good to go.

Something else you might want to consider is the  size of your hands. A negative slope makes the  

keys a little harder to reach. Meaning it may not  be the best choice for those with smaller hands.

However, a keyboard with reverse tilting really  shines in a working environment that provides  

an adjustable desk and chair. Though, we'd  always suggest a design with foldable legs,  

giving you a little more freedom with your  wrist position and working environment.

So Negative tilt is an absolute must - busted! 

Ergonomyth número dos: Flat keyboards are  always better than those with a positive slope

2 Flat keyboards are better than sloped

As mentioned, wrist extension is one of  keyboard ergonomics' most notorious boogeymen.

It's pretty fair to say that any aggressive  positive keyboard slope will only encourage  

some form of wrist extension, and nobody  needs unnecessary wrist extension.

So does this mean a keyboard with  a neutral slope is always better?

I mean, does this make a laptop's keyboard  more ergonomic than this keyboard?

Hey, hey, back over here!

Thankfully, no. There are a couple of things  to consider first... On a small side note,  

this brings us to an article written in April 2022  

by a little-known publication  called the New York Times.

Now, we were mentioned in this article,  but not exactly how we would have wanted:

This statement, along with the idea that  flat laptop keyboards are more ergonomic  

than the Dygma Raise, fails to take into  account our wonderful palm pad additions.

These elevate the palms to counteract any  problem that the slight slope may present.

It's also important to consider whether or not the  

user tends to float their hands above  the keyboard or rest them on the desk.

If you rest your hands on the desk and  your keyboard doesn't have palm rests,  

you'll get wrist extension  despite using a flat keyboard.

Ultimately, it's the difference in  height between where you rest your  

palms and the highest point  of the keyboard that matters.

This means that the height  of the keyboard can have a  

more significant effect on wrist  extension than the slope itself.

In other words, a tall keyboard with a neutral  

slope can be even worse than a thin  keyboard with a light positive tilt.

This ergonomyth has been busted. Ergonomyth número três:  

3 Tenting rulez, every other way sucks!

Tenting rulez - every other way sucks

Take a look at your hand, now back at me,  

now look at your hand position right now. Unless  you're typing... or riding a mountain bike,  

your hands are probably at a more  neutral 'handshake' angle, right?

When we turn our hands inwards to type –otherwise  known as wrist pronation– tension is created in  

the forearm and wrist as the ulna and radius  bones create somewhat of a scissor effect.

Well, maybe not death. But  injury is no fun either, right?

As a result, more and more devices are  being designed to relieve that unnatural  

wrist pronation, from vertical  mice to road bike handlebars!

That said, just like with the negative tilt,  it depends on your working environment.  

Naturally, any tented or vertical device would  lead to an elevation in that said device.

So if your desk and chair cannot adjust  to suit this new slight change in height,  

you may find the discomfort leaves your wrist  but ends up in your back, shoulders, or neck.

No bueno! ('tá mal)

Another thing to consider is the  vast amount of work on your fingers.

Think about it; you're the average  data-entry clerk typing 50 words per  

minute for 5 hours a day. That's  almost 70,000 keystrokes a day!

Gravity is working with you on  a non-tented keyboard if even  

just a little. Which means there's far  less strain on the fingers over time.

But with a tented keyboard, more effort is needed,  which could increase the workload on your fingers.

Although there's currently no conclusive research  to support this claim, it's something to consider.

Unless you're regularly performing the  first dance motion of the Macarena,  

it's best to keep your hands in as neutral a  position as possible. And tenting supports this,  

but it ultimately falls to you  and your working environment.

So what should we call this? - PLAUSIBLE 

4 Keyboards with a keywell are more ergonomic

3Ergonomyth numero quattro: Keyboards  with a key well are far more ergonomic

ANA: Now  

how on earth is that ergonomic?!

Well, regular keyboards often  leave us reaching for faraway  

keys like the number keys, F  keys, and Backspace or Enter.

Here we find our wrists deviating  away from the center of the keyboard.

Increasing a nasty little  thing called ulnar deviation...

Ulnar deviation, or ulnar drift, refers to  the motion in which your hand bends at the  

wrist toward your pinkie finger. This can lead  to wrist pain, joint problems, and swelling.

Keyboards with a key well bring the keys closer  

together to reduce the distance  your fingers travel to reach them.

They also look pretty cool, right?

I mean, what in Skywalker's name is that?  It looks like an inverted Death Star.

That being said, some negatives of  the key well arise when discussing,  

again, the size of your hands.

With the keys being so close together,  those with larger hands may find themselves  

compressing their fingers to reach the  keys on the inner side of the well.

Whereas those with smaller hands may be forced  

to overstretch and reach the  keys on the well's outer side.

Furthermore, creating a key  well requires a taller keyboard,  

which demands a higher seated position  allowing you to place your hands accordingly.

If you like the idea of a key well,  

be sure to test it out first. Or get it  from a company with a good return policy.

Keyboards are a bit like Cinderella's slipper;  

it'll either fit or not, it  won't be somewhere in-between. 

So this is - BUSTED!

Ergonomyth nummer fünf: Thumb  keys will ALWAYS be ergonomic

5 Thumbkeys will always be ergonomic

Back to our old foe, Mr.  

Ulnar Deviation. The primary goal of thumb  keys is to reduce this movement as much as  

possible by bringing those previously mentioned  outer ring keys to the center of the keyboard.

Better yet, we can place those keys to be used  by the true powerhouse of the hand.... the thumb!

Unfortunately, we've found that  it's not as simple as that.

There are three things to consider:  

the shape of the keycaps, how they are  grouped... and the pinkie's position.

Yes, where you place your  pinkie affects the thumb.

Let's start with how the keycaps are grouped.

There are two schools of thought regarding thumb  clusters: the thumb block and the thumb curve.

The first allows for more  keys to be close together,  

and the second follows the  natural arc of your thumb.

While designing the thumb cluster for the  Dygma Defy, we opted for a thumb curve  

but engineered a way to add more keys  with a second row of low-profile keys.

If you want to learn about the Defy thumb  cluster, check out this other video.

Another thing you'll notice in our thumb clusters  is that the keys are not concave (like most) but  

convex. That's because the shape of the key  also matters when using a thumb cluster.

So are thumb keys ALWAYS ergonomic? - PLAUSIBLE!

Like most, if not all, ergonomyths mentioned  today, it simply falls down to the users'  

preference. You might prefer having more  keys even though you need to stretch your  

thumb to reach them, or you want  fewer keys within natural reach.

Of course, no keyboard is  ergonomic if you're using  

the wrong setup or not practicing proper posture

And even keyboards that identify as having  

the most ergonomic features  may still have their faults.

It's ultimately about you, the user.

Your hand size, working setup, typing style,  

wants and needs all play a role in choosing  the perfect ergonomic keyboard for you.

Today, we only scratched the surface  of ergonomyths; we're planning to  

cover the productivity aspect of ergonomics too.

What other ergonomyths would you like  busted? Let us know ifithe comments b  

AND! If you liked this video, give it a like and  share it with every single person you've ever met.

They'll appreciate it the  same way we appreciate you.

Transcription:

My take on alternative keyboard layouts some things very simplified (i could go on about why i dislike qwerty), but this is for people that are interested in switching to a new layout that still unsure about how it will feel from day to day. i do a quick rundown on neo, colemak, dvorak, workman and a bit of rsthd and halmak. Switching my keyboard layout to neo was the biggest step in my keyboard journey as it would affect basically all my future keyboard choices.

Titles

[Music]

so in a previous video i mentioned my 16

Intro & Background

key layout and a lot of you really

interested in that and what kind of

things i'm doing to pull that off so in

this video i'm going to do a deep dive

and look at that layout in detail and

and um and hopefully it'll give you some

ideas and you may not want to go that

far and in fact i'm not quite sure if

i'm going to stick with this there's and

i'll mention this in the video but

there's a couple of sort of things that

i think another thumb key or two thumb

keys might be really beneficial so i'm

going to explore that in this video too

whether this is the point that's too far

or you know obviously i don't think

there's any point in going any further i

don't think i'm going to go any further

i'm only going to go back now but it's

amazing to have got this far and

obviously the benefit you know reducing

all that finger movement is fantastic i

you know just really hardly moving my

fingers now

and that's amazing that's kind of always

what i've really wanted to try and get

to with this keyboard journey so the

first of my kind of small layouts was

the 36 key layout and that was really

kind of intended for the gergoplex i

actually experimented with it on the

moonlander and the plank and then put it

onto the gergoplex and that was great

fun you know the first time i sort of

really created that layout where you're

only moving one key from each of your

home positions including with the thumbs

so you've got uh one key each side of

your home thumb as well and that was

fantastic to give me a real taste of the

what it's like to have a small layout

and then of course i had the issue with

the usb port on the gergoplex and that

led me to the ferris which i actually

built myself so that was the first time

i've kind of gone down this road of

soldering something a little bit and

using controllers and all the rest of it

but that was a 34 key layout so i

adapted my layout and made that work and

i'm going to link to all of the all the

files for these various layouts in the

description as well so you can you can

kind of see that journey as time's gone

on as well so after the ferris i got

involved with ergogen which is this

incredible bit of software and kicad

that lets you build your own pcb for

your truly custom layout just for you

and i've done a video on that and i'll

be doing more more detail on that

process as well because it's absolutely

amazing i think it's what it enables you

to do is fantastic you can really build

a keyboard exactly how you want it and

and you know you don't gotta worry about

filling up blanks and stuff if you want

to go for a smaller layout you can just

build a new pcb and it's so cheap and

affordable and it's actually not that

complicated to do so

that's all very exciting so as you start

exploring smaller layouts you get to a

stage where you're

removing so many keys that you can't

have every letter key on its own key and

you know the first thing that you might

think about doing which is what i did

was combos for those missing keys so you

would hit two you know two two keys at a

time to get the equivalent of one of the

other keys that's then missing

and that's pretty awkward for flowy

typing you know you can't really roll

and some of those if you're rolling over

a combo you might trigger the combo by

mistake there's lots of sort of issues

around that i think would fundamentally

mean you couldn't ever type very fast

using combos for some letters and i

didn't really like the feel of it either

i like the idea of rolling a whole word

you know and hitting a combo kind of it

makes it stumble and obviously as you

get to a certain stage you run out of

good combos that work for letters so if

you make a combo out of two common

letter pairs and you're normally rolling

very fast over those then it will

trigger as the combo and that that's a

problem so you normally want to make

combos out of letters that don't

normally come consecutively in normal

typing but i never really found that i

wasn't really enjoying combos and i

wanted to go a bit smaller as well

anyway so i ended up thinking of two

layers for all of the alpha keys so with

two layers it becomes possible to get

really quite small and in quite a short

space of time i'd gone down to 16 keys

i've stuck with the 16 for long enough

now that i can make this video and i've

What it Feels Like to Type on

got pretty fast on it you know i'm up to

80 words a minute which i think is

unbelievable and i think uh it has

potential to be even faster too you know

i'm not i don't think the layout's

holding me at 80 i think it's just you

know i've got to get faster with the

muscle memory i think it can go faster

and i'll be super pleased if i can get

this to 100 words a minute so in terms

of the feel of the keyboard it's

incredibly gratifying to type on a

keyboard where you feel you're really

barely moving your fingers there's just

those occasional movements

and you once you start feeling the

pattern of a whole word you get this

sort of idea in your mind of what's you

know when you type fast you kind of

almost it feels like you're memorizing a

word each time you know and you just

drill that pattern for the word and

that's how you end up typing really fast

and you're not sort of thinking letter

by letter you're thinking of the

patterns for each word or at least the

sort of chunks of letters that make up

the words and when you do that with a

board this small those patterns feel

incredible there's there's hardly any

any effort to them and i think i hope

i'm really hoping that that is also

going to enable me to type really fast

on this as well so let's look at all the

kind of features in this layout that

make it work and make it possible to to

be 16 keys overall so obviously first

Dealing With Two Alpha Layers

and foremost we're dealing with two

layers so you have

the right thumb key is the key that

switches to the second layer now i

started off using a normal sticky layer

key for this and that means that

basically you can just tap it and then

the next key you hit is on the second

layer and then it goes back to the first

layer now the problem with that in

reality is i was as i started typing on

it faster what i was finding i was doing

was my thumb hadn't actually come off

that sticky layer key by the time i

would go back to hitting say a key from

the first layer after that so it

actually trigger two keys from the

second layer when i actually only wanted

one and then back to the first layer

because i hadn't quite got my thumb off

so obviously when you start rolling

quickly that's something that is going

to happen

so i asked on the discord group if

anyone had any solutions to this so

basically what i was needing to happen

was as soon as my thumb is down on that

layer switch key the next key that fires

will force it back to layer one even if

my thumb is still on it

and someone had the fantastic idea of

using a macro for this which is how that

works you know so i'll put the sticky

layer switch as a macro and that

basically fires immediately and it

doesn't it doesn't matter if i hold that

key down it's not still going to work as

a second layer switch so that that

actually solved the problem it means i

can roll through to the second layer and

then back to the first layer as fast as

sloppy as i like with my finger hanging

onto that key

and it doesn't cause any problems which

is you know exactly what i want i kind

of want all of all of the letters to

behave that way including uh full stop

comma and apostrophe so that's kind of

my goal that i don't have to worry about

timing for any normal letter key and

that basic punctuation

i can roll over those in any speed in

any pattern and i won't get any issues

because the timing or you know releasing

holding down or releasing a key in the

wrong time so the right thumb is that

Thumb Keys

macro layer switch key and the left

thumb is just space but if you hold it

down you get the mechy which is

fantastic for using with keyboard

maestro on a mac and gives you sort of

so you hold that down and any key will

then switch to another application i use

that as an application switches so

basically super fast to jump between

applications on the mac with that mech

key on the thumb so obviously that

holding down the thumb key was i used

another layout basically the sort of

panic mode to get back to layer one if

you're if you use one of the toggles and

you're permanently in one of the other

layers so you can hold that down and it

won't output any characters uh and you

you know when you release it you're

always back in the layer one if you're

already in layer one all you've done is

just push the mech key which doesn't do

anything by itself

so yeah that's a really handy little

setup for the left thumb i find

The System Layer

so in the 16 key layout i've i've come

up with this system later and taken that

a bit further than i have in any other

layout

and this is really really fun really

fast really great for working with the

mac so with a three key combo i can

switch into the system layer and it

stays in that layer then so i can be

mousing with one hand and i can have the

right hand on the right half of the

keyboard where most of the system magic

happens so i can actually be mousing

with my left hand which is good because

i want to try and alternate i'm using

the trackpad but i want to try and

alternate the work between my hands a

bit on the trackpad as well so i'm

starting to use the trackpad with my

left hand and actually clicking with a

combo on the keyboard with the right and

that really changes the feel of using a

trackpad i think and that's a really

good a good thing to do if you think

that using the trackpad is causing kind

of problems in your wrists and whatnot

this is a good way of mixing it up a

little bit and changing the pattern that

your wrist is used to there so in the

system layer on the right hand they've

then got arrow keys and a command key on

your thumb so you can do arrows and

thumb and you can also do alt with your

left hand as well you can navigate the

cursor in text very quickly in this

layer now i've got some interesting

things that happen when you hold down a

finger on those arrow keys and the other

keys in this layer so copy and paste for

example tap is a copy and then hold it

down is paste and that means you can you

know sort of select text copy and paste

and then you can also switch

applications uh just with the right hand

here as well so you've got the command

key obviously with your thumbs to hold

that down and then you can hold down the

key above that with your index finger

which is tab

and that will then give you the

application switcher where you can then

navigate that using the arrow keys and

then release to switch into it i've

actually just added a q key for quitting

those through that as well so all that

can be done with just the right hand

which is brilliant because it means you

can do things like use the trackpad to

select a bit of text switch applications

copy and paste if you're doing a sort of

copy and pasting stuff from a document

into a form or something that it makes

that kind of workflow really really

really good so one of the key ways the

16 key layout works is by using home run

mods but not just for modifiers for

layers as well so it works in the same

way which means you've got to hold that

key down by now interestingly what

happens is you can actually do the roll

very quickly and so that's quite good

you don't have to sort of pause and then

hit you can roll as it's the release

that you can you can delay if you see

what i mean so that works really nicely

and i'm actually getting on really well

with those um sort of homeroom mod style

layer switches as well as for the

modifiers of course as well so in

Switching Layers

previous versions of these layouts i

think on the 36 key layout i'd actually

set things up so that most of the layer

switching was a permanent toggle so you

would hit a key you'd then be in that

layer you could do one or more keys and

then you would hit a key to come back to

the layer before so what i'm doing now

is using the home run mod style

switching basically for all the layers

except for that system layer it's also

used for the system layer quite often

but i can toggle into the system layer

and i do that some of the time that's

the only layer i'm finding that i need

to sort of go in and leave it in that

layer everything else is quite working

quite well just by holding down the home

run mod style key setup for those layer

switches so when i first started using

home remotes just for actual normal

modifiers on the home row as their as

they kind of intended i found it really

tripped my um rolling ability up you

know it was triggering the modded

version of a key we're not just rolling

through the keyboard and that was in qmk

and that's actually quite hard to set up

i didn't it wasn't obvious the best kind

of settings for qmk in terms of home run

mod style uh setup whereas with zmk it

actually clarifies what you're supposed

to do if you want to set this up because

obviously you want to allow for normal

typing to be a role but you you want to

obviously be able to go in reasonably

fast and it says the key is setting it

up so that there's a delay basically if

you roll on and off those keys within

the delay nothing happens you won't get

the modded version you've just got to

hold it down for long enough for it to

trigger the modded version

so that applies not only with just my

home run mods but also with these layer

switches and it works really well i can

roll as fast as i like for normal typing

i never never get a false trigger of

those

layers and like i said at the start the

idea all the keys that i want to roll

over i want to be able to roll on with

no issues are all the alpha keys and the

basic punctuation i'm not so concerned

about being able to roll through to sort

of random punctuation and symbols i'm

happy with the delay on that kind of key

and sometimes obviously i'm doing like

open bracket close bracket semicolon

javascript that kind of thing and

obviously for that i have a layer

set up in such a way that i can just

switch into that layer by holding my

finger down on the left hand and i can

do all three of those by rolling very

quickly on the right hand so there are

patterns sometimes where you work with

symbols where you do want to roll and

the this setup still allows for that so

Dealing With Capital Letters

dealing with capital letters is a big uh

big tricky thing with the two layer

keyboard i found so the first thing i

kind of set up was having the left thumb

key turn into a shift key on the second

layer so you can go into the second hair

with the right thumb hit the left thumb

and then the next key is going to be a

shifted version of a letter from the

first layer so originally i had the

normal sticky layer switch on the right

thumb so that meant if i did hold that

down i could still hit shift on the left

thumb and the next key would be a

shifted second layer key if i released

the right thumb obviously it would bring

me back to the first layer and shift

would apply to that so i could i could

get shifted letters from either of those

layers but of course that had that

inherent problem with preventing rolling

from one key from the second layer back

down to a normal key

so after losing that which i had to do

because i definitely knew i wanted that

rolling ability i had to think of

another way of getting capital second

layer keys

and so what i did is create a new layer

with all capital equivalents of that

second layer and then i was

experimenting with ways of getting into

that layer and my first approach was

actually to do both thumbs at the same

time as a combo and i just couldn't get

that reliable enough i could do it some

of the time but i'd miss sometimes and

it would just give me a space you know

and it would so it wasn't reliable

enough and it's just too too difficult

to get the timing because i had quite a

short delay on that combo because

obviously there is a valid role for

those two thumbs as well so as i needed

it to be a very short timeout to achieve

the combo and it was just too tricky to

do so what i ended up doing was changing

the right thumb key in the second layer

to go into the capital version of the

second layer so if i double tap the

right thumb i get capital second layer

if i do right thumb followed by left

thumb essentially i get shifted versions

of the first layer because the left

thumb is just a sticky shift key that

works really well i can now get capital

letters reliably without having any

combos or anything weird just by double

tapping the right or rolling from right

thumb to left thumb to get the capital

on the first layer so i mentioned before

Mouse Emulation

that the system layer on this keyboard

has a click on a combo and that's super

handy enables you to click with the

right hand and mouse with the left and

that's obviously particularly useful on

a trackpad where it's quite easy to to

use with either hand obviously a normal

mouse that's not going to work quite so

well

but i do find that's a good workflow

with the trackpad now when i switch to

the macro branch of zmk to enable the

macro layer switch on the right thumb

obviously lost that mouse key ability to

have a proper mouse click emulation on

that layer but i kind of worked around

it to some extent by using a keyboard

maestro

hotkey shortcut which gives me the click

on that combo the only thing is i can't

get it to behave in the way that the

emulation mode really worked well by

sort of clicking and holding so i can't

use it for clicking and dragging to

highlight text and stuff like that so

that's a little bit of a shame i'm again

just waiting for that branch to be

merged in with the main branch along

with the macro mode so i think once

everything is in the main branch of zmk

this stuff's really all going to start

coming together so in terms of the rest

Symbol And Number Layers

of the layout we've got the different

layers which you access with the home

run mod style buttons and i'll show that

on screen so you can kind of see how

that looks but essentially that's just

normal layer stuff there's not too much

wizardry going on i've got a couple of

keys that have an on hold function where

you get a different key on hold but

mostly it's actually just single single

keys per you know for all of these

things in those symbol layers so that

works really nicely so there's a number

layer as well and that's also using the

little finger

as a home row mod style button and that

works fine too

so basically all four home keys have got

a layer switching on hold so the index

finger gets you into that system layer

that i said with the arrow keys i use

that you know just for quick smaller

things but i've also got the three key

combo to permanently put me into that

layer and the middle finger is one of my

symbol layers ring finger is the other

of the symbol layers and little finger

is the number layer so you can hold any

of those down to switch the board into

that layer so obviously you're mainly

working with alternate hands here you

hold down the key on the other hand from

what you want to predominantly do so

it's a little bit different with the

number layer where the numbers

themselves span both halves of the

keyboard you end up using the little

finger to hold you into that layer but

you can then still do all the numbers

even with both halves of the keyboard

Punctuation Keys

there so i mentioned the ability to be

able to roll through all the main alpha

keys including shifted versions of that

actually as well as the basic

punctuation full stop comma and

apostrophe so i've actually had to put

the comma on the uppercase second alpha

layer because there isn't really any

space for anywhere else so that means

for a comma i am hitting thumb twice and

then the key to get the comma where it's

full stops just a quick roll from the

thumb to a home row key

and the same with apostrophe with the

ring finger and that's okay that's that

all works okay but the double tap for

the thumb to get the commas a little bit

too much i think it would be nice to get

that down to a single proceeding key

but i can't really see anything obvious

about how i'm going to achieve that at

Next Steps: Repeat Key & Alpha 2 Caps

this point

so where i'm going to go from here i'm

definitely not going to go smaller

because there are some obvious kind of

points where i could optimize this and

it would it would be optimized by adding

a key back so i'm kind of making this

trade off of whether i want to add a key

back to achieve a certain thing so i've

kind of worked out what i would add back

if i was going to do this and obviously

weighing that up versus the headache of

having to be moving the fingers more but

it would be thumb keys i'm happy with

the the fingers um it would be a

question of adding some thumb keys so

one of the thumb keys i'd like to add is

a repeat key because that would be super

useful for things like control and a key

in vim you know where you're doing page

up and page down with the control held

down and repeating that to avoid holding

down control all the time you could use

a repeat key which would repeat the the

modified version of the key so you know

if i do control u for page up in vim i

could then just hit the repeat key to go

bam bam page up over time so that would

be super handy to have on a dedicated

thumb key i think so i think the other

thing that would improve things is

having a dedicated thumb key to jump

straight into the shifted version of the

second alpha layer and that would

obviously then allow my comma to be on

just a single key and into the comma

because that's on that layer so

that would give all of my punctuation

within a single key so one thumb key

obviously gets my normal second layer

which includes full stop and apostrophe

the other thumb key would get my shifted

second layer including comma so that

would remove this double tapping of the

thumb which i think you either move the

thumb to get to a different key or you

double tap it out it's it's not that

obvious which one of those i'm i would

want to go for i think so i think

basically the sort of improved version

of this board if you're happy to add

more keys back to it would be an extra

key for each thumb so two per thumb one

on the left hand would be the repeat key

and the one on the right would be this

shift second alpha layer including comma

so i think that might work quite nicely

How Fast Will it Go?

overall

so it's going to be really interesting

seeing how fast i can get with this

layout because obviously i've got this

idea of changing finger movement for a

few additional key presses with much

reduced movement so overall which is

going to win i don't know in terms of

maximum speed i can achieve on this

keyboard i think essentially as long as

there's no penalty for rolling you know

and having keys overlapping each other

that kind of sloppy rolling effect that

you get when you type really fast as

long as there's no issue with that i

think this has the potential to be

really actually very fast as well as

Thumb Key Position

extremely comfortable to use because

it's just so small and your fingers are

so minimal i've just mentioned quickly

this thumb position because obviously on

the card that i've been practicing the

16 key layout i have the thumb key on

the same layer as the pinky actually

bottom row so it's the one key below my

home row

and it's very close so as a result of

that my hands are really kind of curled

up and that's interesting i vaguely

remember my piano teacher when i was a

kid saying i should have my hands

in such a position that a mouse could

run under them which is obviously

suggest that that is quite curled up

which would bring the thumb quite close

to the fingertips i guess so

that's quite interesting and you know i

find it very easy to type like that i'm

sort of pushing straight down rather

than having my fingers like that and

sort of paddling down i'm actually just

straight down i think i don't know it

feels it feels really nice i actually

quite like having my hand curled up like

that while i'm typing so i think when i

build a specific pcb for this layout i'm

not going to move the thumb key much

further away than it is now although

i'll try and do a bit more experimenting

with that as well to try and figure out

what i want there so it's pretty amazing

Summary

using this as a daily driver and up to

speed to 80 words a minute as well you

know when i'm now starting to feel that

i really have basic word patterns

memorized into my muscle memory and i

can just blast them out it feels like i

can get really fast with that now i'm

not thinking about which key i'm

pressing it's just sort of just

happening through muscle memory it feels

like i'm going to get quite fast here so

i'm excited to see that happening now

and it's the thing that's enabled that

has definitely been switching that thumb

layer switch to a macro so that i can

roll through the second layer and back

to the first layer it does obviously

mean i have to hit the thumb key for so

like if i was doing two keys in the

second layer i have to hit that thumb

key to get back into the second layer

for each one so i'm adding a few more

keystrokes but with the ability to roll

as fast as i like with any kind of

overlapping going on through that and

i'm much happier with it that way round

than having the system where it was it

was you could hold it down and stay in

the second layer but that caused that

problem with rolling through if you only

needed one key from the second layer so

uh it's uh hopefully this has all made

some kind of sense and it's there's very

complicated layout to try and explain um

but super fun i've really enjoyed this

whole journey taking me up to this point

so the next step for me is to actually

build this as a specific pcb using ergo

gen and kai cad with only 16 keys and so

it can have no blanks and it'll look a

bit tidy and be interesting to see what

kind of shape that that ends up looking

like and i may end up playing with the

position a bit compared to

those key positions on the card here as
