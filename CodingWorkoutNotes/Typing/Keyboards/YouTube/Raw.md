Link: [Are Ergonomic Keyboards a Load of Bullsh*t!? 5 Ergonomic Myths]()
Transcription:

Join us as we debunk 5 Ergonomic Myths and Misconceptions about ergonomic keyboards! We will guide you through the facts to help you make an informed decision on what's the best ergonomic split keyboard that can maximize and enhance your productivity and comfort. After watching this, you'll be able to answer the question yourself! Are Ergonomic Keyboards a Load of Bullsh*t? Are ergonomic keyboards really better? Or are split keyboards even worth it? ðŸ¤”

Intro

PERSON: What on earth are you doing?

NIX: Typing on my newÂ  ergonomic keyboard, of course!

PERSON: That doesn't look very ergonomic!

NIX: It is, see...

PERSON: Ugh, ergonomic keyboardsÂ  are a load of bullshit...

Hey Dygmates, I'm Dominique Garcia,Â  cousin of the lesser-known Andy Garcia.

Today, we will dive into what makesÂ  a keyboard ergonomic â€“specifically,Â Â 

busting certain mythsÂ  surrounding ergonomic keyboards.

We're going to coin them as.....*drumroll*

Ergonomyths!

You heard it here first.

But before we get "a bustin'", let's firstÂ  identify the true definition of ergonomics:

What is Ergonomics?

You'll find that across the majorityÂ  of definitions for ergonomics,Â Â 

a pattern of the same concept continues to arise: Â 

Working safely, with lessÂ  discomfort, and optimized well-being.

That's our primary goal, right?

You might think your primary goal isÂ  to work faster or more efficiently,Â Â 

but how is that even possible if youÂ  spend half of your day in discomfort?

So based on this concept, let's get a bustin'.

Starting withÂ 

Ergonomyth numÃ©ro un: NegativeÂ  tilt is an absolute must

1 Negative tilt is a must

Most conventional keyboards have a positiveÂ  tilt where the back is higher than the front,Â Â 

forcing you to extend your wrists, whichÂ  creates pressure on the tissues and vessels.

A negative tilt, instead, allows theÂ  'au naturel' neutral wrist position,Â Â 

which is generally advised when typing yourÂ  cute little derriÃ¨re off for hours on end.

But is the negative tilt ideal inÂ  all situations? The answer is no.

Despite being an excellent feature in certainÂ  environments, it can become a hindrance in others.

For example, if your keyboard sitsÂ  above the level of your elbows,Â Â 

you'd find yourself in an almostÂ  funky 'T-rex'-like position,Â Â 

with flexed elbows forcing your hands to scale theÂ  negative slope to reach for those further keys.

Regardless of the model, it depends onÂ  the distance between your body and theÂ Â 

desk. If you can sit so that your arms areÂ  parallel to the floor, you're good to go.

Something else you might want to consider is theÂ  size of your hands. A negative slope makes theÂ Â 

keys a little harder to reach. Meaning it may notÂ  be the best choice for those with smaller hands.

However, a keyboard with reverse tilting reallyÂ  shines in a working environment that providesÂ Â 

an adjustable desk and chair. Though, we'dÂ  always suggest a design with foldable legs,Â Â 

giving you a little more freedom with yourÂ  wrist position and working environment.

So Negative tilt is an absolute must - busted!Â 

Ergonomyth nÃºmero dos: Flat keyboards areÂ  always better than those with a positive slope

2 Flat keyboards are better than sloped

As mentioned, wrist extension is one ofÂ  keyboard ergonomics' most notorious boogeymen.

It's pretty fair to say that any aggressiveÂ  positive keyboard slope will only encourageÂ Â 

some form of wrist extension, and nobodyÂ  needs unnecessary wrist extension.

So does this mean a keyboard withÂ  a neutral slope is always better?

I mean, does this make a laptop's keyboardÂ  more ergonomic than this keyboard?

Hey, hey, back over here!

Thankfully, no. There are a couple of thingsÂ  to consider first... On a small side note,Â Â 

this brings us to an article written in April 2022Â Â 

by a little-known publicationÂ  called the New York Times.

Now, we were mentioned in this article,Â  but not exactly how we would have wanted:

This statement, along with the idea thatÂ  flat laptop keyboards are more ergonomicÂ Â 

than the Dygma Raise, fails to take intoÂ  account our wonderful palm pad additions.

These elevate the palms to counteract anyÂ  problem that the slight slope may present.

It's also important to consider whether or not theÂ Â 

user tends to float their hands aboveÂ  the keyboard or rest them on the desk.

If you rest your hands on the desk andÂ  your keyboard doesn't have palm rests,Â Â 

you'll get wrist extensionÂ  despite using a flat keyboard.

Ultimately, it's the difference inÂ  height between where you rest yourÂ Â 

palms and the highest pointÂ  of the keyboard that matters.

This means that the heightÂ  of the keyboard can have aÂ Â 

more significant effect on wristÂ  extension than the slope itself.

In other words, a tall keyboard with a neutralÂ Â 

slope can be even worse than a thinÂ  keyboard with a light positive tilt.

This ergonomyth has been busted. Ergonomyth nÃºmero trÃªs:Â Â 

3 Tenting rulez, every other way sucks!

Tenting rulez - every other way sucks

Take a look at your hand, now back at me,Â Â 

now look at your hand position right now. UnlessÂ  you're typing... or riding a mountain bike,Â Â 

your hands are probably at a moreÂ  neutral 'handshake' angle, right?

When we turn our hands inwards to type â€“otherwiseÂ  known as wrist pronationâ€“ tension is created inÂ Â 

the forearm and wrist as the ulna and radiusÂ  bones create somewhat of a scissor effect.

Well, maybe not death. ButÂ  injury is no fun either, right?

As a result, more and more devices areÂ  being designed to relieve that unnaturalÂ Â 

wrist pronation, from verticalÂ  mice to road bike handlebars!

That said, just like with the negative tilt,Â  it depends on your working environment.Â Â 

Naturally, any tented or vertical device wouldÂ  lead to an elevation in that said device.

So if your desk and chair cannot adjustÂ  to suit this new slight change in height,Â Â 

you may find the discomfort leaves your wristÂ  but ends up in your back, shoulders, or neck.

No bueno! ('tÃ¡ mal)

Another thing to consider is theÂ  vast amount of work on your fingers.

Think about it; you're the averageÂ  data-entry clerk typing 50 words perÂ Â 

minute for 5 hours a day. That'sÂ  almost 70,000 keystrokes a day!

Gravity is working with you onÂ  a non-tented keyboard if evenÂ Â 

just a little. Which means there's farÂ  less strain on the fingers over time.

But with a tented keyboard, more effort is needed,Â  which could increase the workload on your fingers.

Although there's currently no conclusive researchÂ  to support this claim, it's something to consider.

Unless you're regularly performing theÂ  first dance motion of the Macarena,Â Â 

it's best to keep your hands in as neutral aÂ  position as possible. And tenting supports this,Â Â 

but it ultimately falls to youÂ  and your working environment.

So what should we call this? - PLAUSIBLEÂ 

4 Keyboards with a keywell are more ergonomic

3Ergonomyth numero quattro: KeyboardsÂ  with a key well are far more ergonomic

ANA: NowÂ Â 

how on earth is that ergonomic?!

Well, regular keyboards oftenÂ  leave us reaching for farawayÂ Â 

keys like the number keys, FÂ  keys, and Backspace or Enter.

Here we find our wrists deviatingÂ  away from the center of the keyboard.

Increasing a nasty littleÂ  thing called ulnar deviation...

Ulnar deviation, or ulnar drift, refers toÂ  the motion in which your hand bends at theÂ Â 

wrist toward your pinkie finger. This can leadÂ  to wrist pain, joint problems, and swelling.

Keyboards with a key well bring the keys closerÂ Â 

together to reduce the distanceÂ  your fingers travel to reach them.

They also look pretty cool, right?

I mean, what in Skywalker's name is that?Â  It looks like an inverted Death Star.

That being said, some negatives ofÂ  the key well arise when discussing,Â Â 

again, the size of your hands.

With the keys being so close together,Â  those with larger hands may find themselvesÂ Â 

compressing their fingers to reach theÂ  keys on the inner side of the well.

Whereas those with smaller hands may be forcedÂ Â 

to overstretch and reach theÂ  keys on the well's outer side.

Furthermore, creating a keyÂ  well requires a taller keyboard,Â Â 

which demands a higher seated positionÂ  allowing you to place your hands accordingly.

If you like the idea of a key well,Â Â 

be sure to test it out first. Or get itÂ  from a company with a good return policy.

Keyboards are a bit like Cinderella's slipper;Â Â 

it'll either fit or not, itÂ  won't be somewhere in-between.Â 

So this is - BUSTED!

Ergonomyth nummer fÃ¼nf: ThumbÂ  keys will ALWAYS be ergonomic

5 Thumbkeys will always be ergonomic

Back to our old foe, Mr.Â Â 

Ulnar Deviation. The primary goal of thumbÂ  keys is to reduce this movement as much asÂ Â 

possible by bringing those previously mentionedÂ  outer ring keys to the center of the keyboard.

Better yet, we can place those keys to be usedÂ  by the true powerhouse of the hand.... the thumb!

Unfortunately, we've found thatÂ  it's not as simple as that.

There are three things to consider:Â Â 

the shape of the keycaps, how they areÂ  grouped... and the pinkie's position.

Yes, where you place yourÂ  pinkie affects the thumb.

Let's start with how the keycaps are grouped.

There are two schools of thought regarding thumbÂ  clusters: the thumb block and the thumb curve.

The first allows for moreÂ  keys to be close together,Â Â 

and the second follows theÂ  natural arc of your thumb.

While designing the thumb cluster for theÂ  Dygma Defy, we opted for a thumb curveÂ Â 

but engineered a way to add more keysÂ  with a second row of low-profile keys.

If you want to learn about the Defy thumbÂ  cluster, check out this other video.

Another thing you'll notice in our thumb clustersÂ  is that the keys are not concave (like most) butÂ Â 

convex. That's because the shape of the keyÂ  also matters when using a thumb cluster.

So are thumb keys ALWAYS ergonomic? - PLAUSIBLE!

Like most, if not all, ergonomyths mentionedÂ  today, it simply falls down to the users'Â Â 

preference. You might prefer having moreÂ  keys even though you need to stretch yourÂ Â 

thumb to reach them, or you wantÂ  fewer keys within natural reach.

Of course, no keyboard isÂ  ergonomic if you're usingÂ Â 

the wrong setup or not practicing proper posture

And even keyboards that identify as havingÂ Â 

the most ergonomic featuresÂ  may still have their faults.

It's ultimately about you, the user.

Your hand size, working setup, typing style,Â Â 

wants and needs all play a role in choosingÂ  the perfect ergonomic keyboard for you.

Today, we only scratched the surfaceÂ  of ergonomyths; we're planning toÂ Â 

cover the productivity aspect of ergonomics too.

What other ergonomyths would you likeÂ  busted? Let us know ifithe comments b Â 

AND! If you liked this video, give it a like andÂ  share it with every single person you've ever met.

They'll appreciate it theÂ  same way we appreciate you.

Transcription:

My take on alternative keyboard layouts some things very simplified (i could go on about why i dislike qwerty), but this is for people that are interested in switching to a new layout that still unsure about how it will feel from day to day. i do a quick rundown on neo, colemak, dvorak, workman and a bit of rsthd and halmak. Switching my keyboard layout to neo was the biggest step in my keyboard journey as it would affect basically all my future keyboard choices.

[Music]

so in a previous video i mentioned my 16

Intro & Background

key layout and a lot of you really

interested in that and what kind of

things i'm doing to pull that off so in

this video i'm going to do a deep dive

and look at that layout in detail and

and um and hopefully it'll give you some

ideas and you may not want to go that

far and in fact i'm not quite sure if

i'm going to stick with this there's and

i'll mention this in the video but

there's a couple of sort of things that

i think another thumb key or two thumb

keys might be really beneficial so i'm

going to explore that in this video too

whether this is the point that's too far

or you know obviously i don't think

there's any point in going any further i

don't think i'm going to go any further

i'm only going to go back now but it's

amazing to have got this far and

obviously the benefit you know reducing

all that finger movement is fantastic i

you know just really hardly moving my

fingers now

and that's amazing that's kind of always

what i've really wanted to try and get

to with this keyboard journey so the

first of my kind of small layouts was

the 36 key layout and that was really

kind of intended for the gergoplex i

actually experimented with it on the

moonlander and the plank and then put it

onto the gergoplex and that was great

fun you know the first time i sort of

really created that layout where you're

only moving one key from each of your

home positions including with the thumbs

so you've got uh one key each side of

your home thumb as well and that was

fantastic to give me a real taste of the

what it's like to have a small layout

and then of course i had the issue with

the usb port on the gergoplex and that

led me to the ferris which i actually

built myself so that was the first time

i've kind of gone down this road of

soldering something a little bit and

using controllers and all the rest of it

but that was a 34 key layout so i

adapted my layout and made that work and

i'm going to link to all of the all the

files for these various layouts in the

description as well so you can you can

kind of see that journey as time's gone

on as well so after the ferris i got

involved with ergogen which is this

incredible bit of software and kicad

that lets you build your own pcb for

your truly custom layout just for you

and i've done a video on that and i'll

be doing more more detail on that

process as well because it's absolutely

amazing i think it's what it enables you

to do is fantastic you can really build

a keyboard exactly how you want it and

and you know you don't gotta worry about

filling up blanks and stuff if you want

to go for a smaller layout you can just

build a new pcb and it's so cheap and

affordable and it's actually not that

complicated to do so

that's all very exciting so as you start

exploring smaller layouts you get to a

stage where you're

removing so many keys that you can't

have every letter key on its own key and

you know the first thing that you might

think about doing which is what i did

was combos for those missing keys so you

would hit two you know two two keys at a

time to get the equivalent of one of the

other keys that's then missing

and that's pretty awkward for flowy

typing you know you can't really roll

and some of those if you're rolling over

a combo you might trigger the combo by

mistake there's lots of sort of issues

around that i think would fundamentally

mean you couldn't ever type very fast

using combos for some letters and i

didn't really like the feel of it either

i like the idea of rolling a whole word

you know and hitting a combo kind of it

makes it stumble and obviously as you

get to a certain stage you run out of

good combos that work for letters so if

you make a combo out of two common

letter pairs and you're normally rolling

very fast over those then it will

trigger as the combo and that that's a

problem so you normally want to make

combos out of letters that don't

normally come consecutively in normal

typing but i never really found that i

wasn't really enjoying combos and i

wanted to go a bit smaller as well

anyway so i ended up thinking of two

layers for all of the alpha keys so with

two layers it becomes possible to get

really quite small and in quite a short

space of time i'd gone down to 16 keys

i've stuck with the 16 for long enough

now that i can make this video and i've

What it Feels Like to Type on

got pretty fast on it you know i'm up to

80 words a minute which i think is

unbelievable and i think uh it has

potential to be even faster too you know

i'm not i don't think the layout's

holding me at 80 i think it's just you

know i've got to get faster with the

muscle memory i think it can go faster

and i'll be super pleased if i can get

this to 100 words a minute so in terms

of the feel of the keyboard it's

incredibly gratifying to type on a

keyboard where you feel you're really

barely moving your fingers there's just

those occasional movements

and you once you start feeling the

pattern of a whole word you get this

sort of idea in your mind of what's you

know when you type fast you kind of

almost it feels like you're memorizing a

word each time you know and you just

drill that pattern for the word and

that's how you end up typing really fast

and you're not sort of thinking letter

by letter you're thinking of the

patterns for each word or at least the

sort of chunks of letters that make up

the words and when you do that with a

board this small those patterns feel

incredible there's there's hardly any

any effort to them and i think i hope

i'm really hoping that that is also

going to enable me to type really fast

on this as well so let's look at all the

kind of features in this layout that

make it work and make it possible to to

be 16 keys overall so obviously first

Dealing With Two Alpha Layers

and foremost we're dealing with two

layers so you have

the right thumb key is the key that

switches to the second layer now i

started off using a normal sticky layer

key for this and that means that

basically you can just tap it and then

the next key you hit is on the second

layer and then it goes back to the first

layer now the problem with that in

reality is i was as i started typing on

it faster what i was finding i was doing

was my thumb hadn't actually come off

that sticky layer key by the time i

would go back to hitting say a key from

the first layer after that so it

actually trigger two keys from the

second layer when i actually only wanted

one and then back to the first layer

because i hadn't quite got my thumb off

so obviously when you start rolling

quickly that's something that is going

to happen

so i asked on the discord group if

anyone had any solutions to this so

basically what i was needing to happen

was as soon as my thumb is down on that

layer switch key the next key that fires

will force it back to layer one even if

my thumb is still on it

and someone had the fantastic idea of

using a macro for this which is how that

works you know so i'll put the sticky

layer switch as a macro and that

basically fires immediately and it

doesn't it doesn't matter if i hold that

key down it's not still going to work as

a second layer switch so that that

actually solved the problem it means i

can roll through to the second layer and

then back to the first layer as fast as

sloppy as i like with my finger hanging

onto that key

and it doesn't cause any problems which

is you know exactly what i want i kind

of want all of all of the letters to

behave that way including uh full stop

comma and apostrophe so that's kind of

my goal that i don't have to worry about

timing for any normal letter key and

that basic punctuation

i can roll over those in any speed in

any pattern and i won't get any issues

because the timing or you know releasing

holding down or releasing a key in the

wrong time so the right thumb is that

Thumb Keys

macro layer switch key and the left

thumb is just space but if you hold it

down you get the mechy which is

fantastic for using with keyboard

maestro on a mac and gives you sort of

so you hold that down and any key will

then switch to another application i use

that as an application switches so

basically super fast to jump between

applications on the mac with that mech

key on the thumb so obviously that

holding down the thumb key was i used

another layout basically the sort of

panic mode to get back to layer one if

you're if you use one of the toggles and

you're permanently in one of the other

layers so you can hold that down and it

won't output any characters uh and you

you know when you release it you're

always back in the layer one if you're

already in layer one all you've done is

just push the mech key which doesn't do

anything by itself

so yeah that's a really handy little

setup for the left thumb i find

The System Layer

so in the 16 key layout i've i've come

up with this system later and taken that

a bit further than i have in any other

layout

and this is really really fun really

fast really great for working with the

mac so with a three key combo i can

switch into the system layer and it

stays in that layer then so i can be

mousing with one hand and i can have the

right hand on the right half of the

keyboard where most of the system magic

happens so i can actually be mousing

with my left hand which is good because

i want to try and alternate i'm using

the trackpad but i want to try and

alternate the work between my hands a

bit on the trackpad as well so i'm

starting to use the trackpad with my

left hand and actually clicking with a

combo on the keyboard with the right and

that really changes the feel of using a

trackpad i think and that's a really

good a good thing to do if you think

that using the trackpad is causing kind

of problems in your wrists and whatnot

this is a good way of mixing it up a

little bit and changing the pattern that

your wrist is used to there so in the

system layer on the right hand they've

then got arrow keys and a command key on

your thumb so you can do arrows and

thumb and you can also do alt with your

left hand as well you can navigate the

cursor in text very quickly in this

layer now i've got some interesting

things that happen when you hold down a

finger on those arrow keys and the other

keys in this layer so copy and paste for

example tap is a copy and then hold it

down is paste and that means you can you

know sort of select text copy and paste

and then you can also switch

applications uh just with the right hand

here as well so you've got the command

key obviously with your thumbs to hold

that down and then you can hold down the

key above that with your index finger

which is tab

and that will then give you the

application switcher where you can then

navigate that using the arrow keys and

then release to switch into it i've

actually just added a q key for quitting

those through that as well so all that

can be done with just the right hand

which is brilliant because it means you

can do things like use the trackpad to

select a bit of text switch applications

copy and paste if you're doing a sort of

copy and pasting stuff from a document

into a form or something that it makes

that kind of workflow really really

really good so one of the key ways the

16 key layout works is by using home run

mods but not just for modifiers for

layers as well so it works in the same

way which means you've got to hold that

key down by now interestingly what

happens is you can actually do the roll

very quickly and so that's quite good

you don't have to sort of pause and then

hit you can roll as it's the release

that you can you can delay if you see

what i mean so that works really nicely

and i'm actually getting on really well

with those um sort of homeroom mod style

layer switches as well as for the

modifiers of course as well so in

Switching Layers

previous versions of these layouts i

think on the 36 key layout i'd actually

set things up so that most of the layer

switching was a permanent toggle so you

would hit a key you'd then be in that

layer you could do one or more keys and

then you would hit a key to come back to

the layer before so what i'm doing now

is using the home run mod style

switching basically for all the layers

except for that system layer it's also

used for the system layer quite often

but i can toggle into the system layer

and i do that some of the time that's

the only layer i'm finding that i need

to sort of go in and leave it in that

layer everything else is quite working

quite well just by holding down the home

run mod style key setup for those layer

switches so when i first started using

home remotes just for actual normal

modifiers on the home row as their as

they kind of intended i found it really

tripped my um rolling ability up you

know it was triggering the modded

version of a key we're not just rolling

through the keyboard and that was in qmk

and that's actually quite hard to set up

i didn't it wasn't obvious the best kind

of settings for qmk in terms of home run

mod style uh setup whereas with zmk it

actually clarifies what you're supposed

to do if you want to set this up because

obviously you want to allow for normal

typing to be a role but you you want to

obviously be able to go in reasonably

fast and it says the key is setting it

up so that there's a delay basically if

you roll on and off those keys within

the delay nothing happens you won't get

the modded version you've just got to

hold it down for long enough for it to

trigger the modded version

so that applies not only with just my

home run mods but also with these layer

switches and it works really well i can

roll as fast as i like for normal typing

i never never get a false trigger of

those

layers and like i said at the start the

idea all the keys that i want to roll

over i want to be able to roll on with

no issues are all the alpha keys and the

basic punctuation i'm not so concerned

about being able to roll through to sort

of random punctuation and symbols i'm

happy with the delay on that kind of key

and sometimes obviously i'm doing like

open bracket close bracket semicolon

javascript that kind of thing and

obviously for that i have a layer

set up in such a way that i can just

switch into that layer by holding my

finger down on the left hand and i can

do all three of those by rolling very

quickly on the right hand so there are

patterns sometimes where you work with

symbols where you do want to roll and

the this setup still allows for that so

Dealing With Capital Letters

dealing with capital letters is a big uh

big tricky thing with the two layer

keyboard i found so the first thing i

kind of set up was having the left thumb

key turn into a shift key on the second

layer so you can go into the second hair

with the right thumb hit the left thumb

and then the next key is going to be a

shifted version of a letter from the

first layer so originally i had the

normal sticky layer switch on the right

thumb so that meant if i did hold that

down i could still hit shift on the left

thumb and the next key would be a

shifted second layer key if i released

the right thumb obviously it would bring

me back to the first layer and shift

would apply to that so i could i could

get shifted letters from either of those

layers but of course that had that

inherent problem with preventing rolling

from one key from the second layer back

down to a normal key

so after losing that which i had to do

because i definitely knew i wanted that

rolling ability i had to think of

another way of getting capital second

layer keys

and so what i did is create a new layer

with all capital equivalents of that

second layer and then i was

experimenting with ways of getting into

that layer and my first approach was

actually to do both thumbs at the same

time as a combo and i just couldn't get

that reliable enough i could do it some

of the time but i'd miss sometimes and

it would just give me a space you know

and it would so it wasn't reliable

enough and it's just too too difficult

to get the timing because i had quite a

short delay on that combo because

obviously there is a valid role for

those two thumbs as well so as i needed

it to be a very short timeout to achieve

the combo and it was just too tricky to

do so what i ended up doing was changing

the right thumb key in the second layer

to go into the capital version of the

second layer so if i double tap the

right thumb i get capital second layer

if i do right thumb followed by left

thumb essentially i get shifted versions

of the first layer because the left

thumb is just a sticky shift key that

works really well i can now get capital

letters reliably without having any

combos or anything weird just by double

tapping the right or rolling from right

thumb to left thumb to get the capital

on the first layer so i mentioned before

Mouse Emulation

that the system layer on this keyboard

has a click on a combo and that's super

handy enables you to click with the

right hand and mouse with the left and

that's obviously particularly useful on

a trackpad where it's quite easy to to

use with either hand obviously a normal

mouse that's not going to work quite so

well

but i do find that's a good workflow

with the trackpad now when i switch to

the macro branch of zmk to enable the

macro layer switch on the right thumb

obviously lost that mouse key ability to

have a proper mouse click emulation on

that layer but i kind of worked around

it to some extent by using a keyboard

maestro

hotkey shortcut which gives me the click

on that combo the only thing is i can't

get it to behave in the way that the

emulation mode really worked well by

sort of clicking and holding so i can't

use it for clicking and dragging to

highlight text and stuff like that so

that's a little bit of a shame i'm again

just waiting for that branch to be

merged in with the main branch along

with the macro mode so i think once

everything is in the main branch of zmk

this stuff's really all going to start

coming together so in terms of the rest

Symbol And Number Layers

of the layout we've got the different

layers which you access with the home

run mod style buttons and i'll show that

on screen so you can kind of see how

that looks but essentially that's just

normal layer stuff there's not too much

wizardry going on i've got a couple of

keys that have an on hold function where

you get a different key on hold but

mostly it's actually just single single

keys per you know for all of these

things in those symbol layers so that

works really nicely so there's a number

layer as well and that's also using the

little finger

as a home row mod style button and that

works fine too

so basically all four home keys have got

a layer switching on hold so the index

finger gets you into that system layer

that i said with the arrow keys i use

that you know just for quick smaller

things but i've also got the three key

combo to permanently put me into that

layer and the middle finger is one of my

symbol layers ring finger is the other

of the symbol layers and little finger

is the number layer so you can hold any

of those down to switch the board into

that layer so obviously you're mainly

working with alternate hands here you

hold down the key on the other hand from

what you want to predominantly do so

it's a little bit different with the

number layer where the numbers

themselves span both halves of the

keyboard you end up using the little

finger to hold you into that layer but

you can then still do all the numbers

even with both halves of the keyboard

Punctuation Keys

there so i mentioned the ability to be

able to roll through all the main alpha

keys including shifted versions of that

actually as well as the basic

punctuation full stop comma and

apostrophe so i've actually had to put

the comma on the uppercase second alpha

layer because there isn't really any

space for anywhere else so that means

for a comma i am hitting thumb twice and

then the key to get the comma where it's

full stops just a quick roll from the

thumb to a home row key

and the same with apostrophe with the

ring finger and that's okay that's that

all works okay but the double tap for

the thumb to get the commas a little bit

too much i think it would be nice to get

that down to a single proceeding key

but i can't really see anything obvious

about how i'm going to achieve that at

Next Steps: Repeat Key & Alpha 2 Caps

this point

so where i'm going to go from here i'm

definitely not going to go smaller

because there are some obvious kind of

points where i could optimize this and

it would it would be optimized by adding

a key back so i'm kind of making this

trade off of whether i want to add a key

back to achieve a certain thing so i've

kind of worked out what i would add back

if i was going to do this and obviously

weighing that up versus the headache of

having to be moving the fingers more but

it would be thumb keys i'm happy with

the the fingers um it would be a

question of adding some thumb keys so

one of the thumb keys i'd like to add is

a repeat key because that would be super

useful for things like control and a key

in vim you know where you're doing page

up and page down with the control held

down and repeating that to avoid holding

down control all the time you could use

a repeat key which would repeat the the

modified version of the key so you know

if i do control u for page up in vim i

could then just hit the repeat key to go

bam bam page up over time so that would

be super handy to have on a dedicated

thumb key i think so i think the other

thing that would improve things is

having a dedicated thumb key to jump

straight into the shifted version of the

second alpha layer and that would

obviously then allow my comma to be on

just a single key and into the comma

because that's on that layer so

that would give all of my punctuation

within a single key so one thumb key

obviously gets my normal second layer

which includes full stop and apostrophe

the other thumb key would get my shifted

second layer including comma so that

would remove this double tapping of the

thumb which i think you either move the

thumb to get to a different key or you

double tap it out it's it's not that

obvious which one of those i'm i would

want to go for i think so i think

basically the sort of improved version

of this board if you're happy to add

more keys back to it would be an extra

key for each thumb so two per thumb one

on the left hand would be the repeat key

and the one on the right would be this

shift second alpha layer including comma

so i think that might work quite nicely

How Fast Will it Go?

overall

so it's going to be really interesting

seeing how fast i can get with this

layout because obviously i've got this

idea of changing finger movement for a

few additional key presses with much

reduced movement so overall which is

going to win i don't know in terms of

maximum speed i can achieve on this

keyboard i think essentially as long as

there's no penalty for rolling you know

and having keys overlapping each other

that kind of sloppy rolling effect that

you get when you type really fast as

long as there's no issue with that i

think this has the potential to be

really actually very fast as well as

Thumb Key Position

extremely comfortable to use because

it's just so small and your fingers are

so minimal i've just mentioned quickly

this thumb position because obviously on

the card that i've been practicing the

16 key layout i have the thumb key on

the same layer as the pinky actually

bottom row so it's the one key below my

home row

and it's very close so as a result of

that my hands are really kind of curled

up and that's interesting i vaguely

remember my piano teacher when i was a

kid saying i should have my hands

in such a position that a mouse could

run under them which is obviously

suggest that that is quite curled up

which would bring the thumb quite close

to the fingertips i guess so

that's quite interesting and you know i

find it very easy to type like that i'm

sort of pushing straight down rather

than having my fingers like that and

sort of paddling down i'm actually just

straight down i think i don't know it

feels it feels really nice i actually

quite like having my hand curled up like

that while i'm typing so i think when i

build a specific pcb for this layout i'm

not going to move the thumb key much

further away than it is now although

i'll try and do a bit more experimenting

with that as well to try and figure out

what i want there so it's pretty amazing

Summary

using this as a daily driver and up to

speed to 80 words a minute as well you

know when i'm now starting to feel that

i really have basic word patterns

memorized into my muscle memory and i

can just blast them out it feels like i

can get really fast with that now i'm

not thinking about which key i'm

pressing it's just sort of just

happening through muscle memory it feels

like i'm going to get quite fast here so

i'm excited to see that happening now

and it's the thing that's enabled that

has definitely been switching that thumb

layer switch to a macro so that i can

roll through the second layer and back

to the first layer it does obviously

mean i have to hit the thumb key for so

like if i was doing two keys in the

second layer i have to hit that thumb

key to get back into the second layer

for each one so i'm adding a few more

keystrokes but with the ability to roll

as fast as i like with any kind of

overlapping going on through that and

i'm much happier with it that way round

than having the system where it was it

was you could hold it down and stay in

the second layer but that caused that

problem with rolling through if you only

needed one key from the second layer so

uh it's uh hopefully this has all made

some kind of sense and it's there's very

complicated layout to try and explain um

but super fun i've really enjoyed this

whole journey taking me up to this point

so the next step for me is to actually

build this as a specific pcb using ergo

gen and kai cad with only 16 keys and so

it can have no blanks and it'll look a

bit tidy and be interesting to see what

kind of shape that that ends up looking

like and i may end up playing with the

position a bit compared to

those key positions on the card here as
