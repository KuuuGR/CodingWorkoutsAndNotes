Transcription:

hi friends today I am sitting down with Michael kazoo who is the CEO and founder
of brute strength training and two times CrossFit Games team champion he is also
the man behind Brooke ence Jacob hat nur Kara Webb and the winning team from us
J's CrossFit Games - Wow such brutes what makes his story so compelling is
the fact that he does not come from what you would consider to be the typical
perfect environment for an elite athlete or a fantastic businessman he's an ex
drug and alcohol addict he's been a rehab a number of times it is apparent
that he has suffered with some really dark places in his life and yet he's
managed to come out the other side and be this incredibly well-balanced very altruistic very shrewd intelligent and
compassionate guy who also has an unbelievable capacity as an athlete and
as a coach it's definitely one of the best conversations that I've had I found
it incredibly empowering a lot of the conversation isn't about sport its to do with his approach for how to mentally
overcome obstacles within your life he's been to a stage where he was smoking
heroin and injecting cocaine which I didn't even know that you could do and out of the other side of that he's got
this fantastic life where he's flourishing and he's doing something they really cares about and is well
regarded within his field it was a wonderful chat and I feel incredibly
fortunate to have been able to sit down with him so that's enough for intros here he is the man himself mr. Michael
[Music]
so mr. Michael cashew welcome to modern wisdom thanks for having me brother I'm
Michaels background
excited yeah me too me too so CEO of brute strength 2 times CrossFit Games winner and all-around
good guy how are you doing today doing great man other than the fact that my water got shut off they sent me they
sent me like three warnings but I thought it was all spam so I just threw them away
and today they shut it off and my wife's family is in town so we're we're having to use the bathroom and stuff no way
house that's pretty funny that's funny well I think it's a great day though yeah
so Howard self to give a little bit of background I think pretty much everybody
in the CrossFit community will have heard of brute strength brute body in one form or another but I think it would
be interesting for you to give us a little bit of a background as to what you did as an athlete when you were
younger I know that you said that you did a lot of sports when you were younger so if you could try and just give us a little bit of background to begin with
that'd be great yeah I I grew up playing as many sports as possible I play
football baseball soccer basketball golf I did powerlifting weightlifting and I
was above average at all of them kind of naturally but I never applied myself at
all I loved competing I love playing games and I just didn't see the value
and practicing as a kid so you know and I never really developed much in in my
younger years in high school until right before I left for Utah I started I
started to see that if I practice hard I would get better at hitting I would get you know better as an outfielder and I
started to practice really hard and then I moved away and took a couple years off of sports but yeah I was very active
loved sports and was just not a not a very hard worker yeah which is
interesting when you manage to make it to the elite in a sport as well as appose it's an interesting dichotomy so
the other day I had dominick mcgregor who's the CEO of social chain and he was
very candid about his problems that he'd had with substances and I think it's very
humbling and quite eye-opening to see stories firsthand of people that you
operating at such a high level but I've also had such problems that serious
problems that would break a lot of a lot of people's spirits and yet they're
still able to perform a level that most people would consider to be they've made it up the hierarchy and and you know
they're really successful could you take us through your problems with substances
and and how that came about and then sort of where that where that took you where you ended up what do you mean what
what problems were substances if you you just matter with you yeah and I'll start
out by saying it was because it broke my spirit that I was that I've been able to
have the success that I have it's because I went so low and so deep that I have the ability to be so grounded and
be so passionate about you know the different things that I am passionate about today my the the journey kind of
started at nine years old I had my first drink of alcohol by myself on my ninth birthday and I remember
taking a shot of whiskey and just feeling like maybe for the first time that I was accepted and feeling really
comfortable in my body I didn't realize until much much later that I was a very
anxious kid and I wanted everyone wants to be liked everyone wants to be cool I
really really had to be liked and I had to be cool and I was willing to go to
much greater lengths than my peers to be accepted by the time I was 14 I was
smoking weed very you know very regularly at my house by myself every
single day that led to pain killers and benzodiazepines I was taking that those
every single day as a fifteen-year-old around that time my parents started to
catch wind of what what I was doing I started to fail you know drug test for for just about every drug on the panel
and so they started taking me to a a meetings as a fifteen-year-old Wow and I remember sitting in there and
really really feeling for these people you know these are people that were
either homeless or they had lost their families or they had gotten some kind of severe illness you know alcoholics very
very chronic really yeah exactly like really bad liver issues and I really
developed some empathy for these people but I wasn't one of them you know I I'm
gonna guess the one very many of the 15 year olds that were in AAA meetings there were none there were none and so I
thought that I didn't belong there yep and I really got nothing out of it for
myself I was in complete denial that I had any problem I just thought I was having fun and I was in complete control
by the time I was 16 I was using ecstasy and cocaine and very very serious
painkillers but you still go into the AAA meetings at this time still going to AAA meetings and actually I started to
go more frequently and I started I started to have these kind of different
lives where I would go to AAA meetings probably two or three nights a week and then another two nights a week I would
tell my parents I was going to a meeting but I would just go get loaded but I really and I this doesn't have a ton to
do with my story but I think it's really interesting and I think it's really interesting I started to have this different life where I started to
develop these true friendships with with these people naa people that were
roughly 10 years older than me that would that I just learned a ton from they were they were much more mature
than any of my friends they they cared about a lot of different things they
were really happy and carefree they were having a shitload of fun completely sober and I loved that
and I and I made some good friends out of it and I was high a lot of the time that I was hanging out with them you
know there was there was I was still in complete denial that I had any problem with it I thought I just had to convince
all of the authority figures that I had it under control or that I wasn't using
drugs and that it would all be okay you just playing the game just playing the game I'm a great great
player of the game by the time I was 17 the first one of my good friends passed
away he he went to sleep next to another one of my friends they both took oxy
cotton and xanax that night and one of my friends woke up and the other didn't and instead of going to this guy's
funeral I chose to shoot up oxy cotton and cocaine for the first time and that
that really shows you that kind of person that I had become I just I didn't
care for other people I started to steal from every single person in my life my
peers my family businesses know no one and nothing was off-limits I just
thought I was entitled to whatever you had waiting old from everyone what do
you think that was born from where do you think the this detachment from
responsibilities came from that's a really great question I think it I think it just started kind
First time he stole
of as a seed where I made one decision that lets take I can't I I definitely
can't remember the first the first time this ever happened but I'll say I
started the first time I ever stole it was out of my mom's purse and it was probably something like five or ten
dollars to get a couple pills or maybe a dime bag and I just I didn't see it as
that big of a deal I saw it definitely didn't line up with my values that I had
been raised on but I didn't think my mom would really miss the money I thought if
she doesn't find out you know no real harm done I'm not gonna do it again yeah and it's just a small the small lie like
a small wrong yep and so it didn't seem like that that big of a deal it happened
again and it happened again and sooner or later I start doing slightly bigger
thing slippery slope exactly slightly bigger things I start stealing from other people and I just
start making these compromises where I'm ding out of line with my values and I'm
not just like someone losing weight can't really see themselves losing the weight I couldn't really see myself
changing because it happened so slowly and over such a long period of time yeah
so it was just one compromise after the other I understand so 17 friends died and you detached away
from that then what happens why'd you go from that February later that year in
Going to rehab
February my parents chose to send me to rehab and I absolutely needed it and I
even knew that I needed it at this point I knew that I was just I was just really
out of control and I was kind of scaring myself with some of the decisions I was
making I knew you know this guy had just died earlier that year I had totaled the truck I had gone gone through four lanes
of oncoming traffic and totaled the truck and so I was kind of scaring
myself and I knew I needed it but I thought I had just read the book scar
tissue by Anthony Kiedis and in that book he goes through like I don't know half a dozen short stint rehab centers
like 30 days and they're all in Malibu and he talks about like meeting meeting some fine chicks and stuff so I'm kind
of pumped yeah I'm going it sounds like a holiday yeah I think I'm going to a cush rehab center I might meet some
chicks yeah and I'll kind of I'll just regain control over myself
that's that's my thought process my parents had a totally different idea they sent me to not a let's see nine
nine or 11 months of inpatient treatment a couple different facilities and then I
did another nine months of a halfway house and that was it was absolutely
crucial and it transformed my life how so the first two months were in a
Wilderness therapy
wilderness therapy center and it was in the middle of the desert with 15 other
adolescent boys and really what that time did was it helped me to
it helped all of that chatter in my head you know I had some depression and anxiety and my mind was just chaotic and
it helped that to really chill out it helped me to detach from a lot of the
bad influences in my life it helped me to detach from a lot of my my desires
and just that that internal chatter that never turned off I didn't really get
much good therapy done there that started in the next program so this was
a like a lockdown facility you don't leave for several months at all and I
had a very hard-nosed therapist that called me on my [ __ ] and this treatment
center in general really encouraged the the a lot of the therapy to be done by
the peers and again going back to me just really wanting to be liked and accepted that was by far the most
powerful thing is that's not what positive influence exactly yeah and I mean they had guys just saying I would I
would be thinking I'm sharing something really vulnerable and I'm being authentic and they would flat-out call
me out like that's that's [ __ ] [ __ ] you're telling us like five percent of the truth passing it off as
the full truth yeah and man I just I I had to learn to go deep for a long time
I just completely shut down and I refused and I withdrew which is kind of my that was my MO if things got tough I
would just withdraw at some point I got over that and I really did the work I got vulnerable I contributed to other
people's recovery and I accepted other people to hold me accountable to love me
and I just learned a shitload of lessons man and it really changed my life that's fantastic so I definitely think that it
makes sense you'd absconded from responsibility for your own actions a
Vulnerability
little bit and you were obviously able to outwit some of the people in your life that were questioning whether or
not you are actually being truthful and I think that a lot of people can probably relate to that it doesn't necessarily need to be with regard to
drugs but vulnerability with a partner telling them that you actually don't feel comfortable with that guy or girl
that they're talking to or whatever and it manifests itself in another way in resentment or in level of mistrust or
whatever it might be and I think that there's a lot of people that will withdraw in that way play the game up
until the point at which the the problems out of the way and then they can kind of get cracking again on their terms without actually having to make
himself vulnerable so I think that's an extreme example of a situation that a
lot of people probably go through so you're nine months deep now you've gone through you're nine to eleven months of
rehab and then where are we then I start college I go to a halfway house and
College
immediately after I get out of that inpatient treatment I'm rockin and rollin man I'm so motivated just so high
on life I start running for the first time and real quick I try it out for the
University of Utah baseball team couldn't quite hack it so I start running and I train really really hard
for the Salt Lake City Marathon and I ended up winning my age division no really well I'm pumped on it and at
the same time I get really burnt burn out on running so at the end of that I suddenly don't have like a physical goal
and I also didn't have many friends yet I was in a in a new city for the first
time and a lot of the people in my halfway house were actually you know smoking crack and drinking and it was
just not a very positive environment so you've gone back to maybe a negative influence from the paid group again well
I just didn't hang out with them at all okay okay so you've learned that you can segment your life a little bit
absolutely and I was I was definitely gung-ho on staying sober and I started
to meet some friends through Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous but I
didn't make any real deep connections in the first six months and so when that when that marathon was done didn't have
a goal and I just I had really started to isolate myself
just because I didn't have anything to really look forward to I didn't like college at all I did I didn't have any
deep relationships and suddenly I don't have this physical goal and I was always really driven by physical goals even if
it just be playing games really hard right I I always loved to play and it
didn't have any of that and so long story short I isolate myself for about a
month start smoking cigarettes again kind of get caught well not kind of I get really sick I get a really bad cold
because I smoked one of my sponsors my AAA sponsors like roll your own
cigarettes and it's really harsh and so I get sick and man this seed of a
thought gets planted in my head where I've gotten kind of depressed didn't
have any good friends and this just seed of a thought pops in maybe I can go get
loaded right I can go get some codeine syrup and I can get loaded and it won't be a big deal and I push it away and I
actually I talked to my sponsor about it I talked to my therapist even about it and I decided I'm not gonna do it
but that seed of a thought grows really really rapidly because I'm still sick
and it just it feels really shitty and I'm depressed it grows really rapidly and within a week or two I decided that
I was gonna get [ __ ] up and within 24 hours I made the decision that I was gonna go to the hospital the University
Hospital I was gonna get some codeine syrup and I knew that I could lie to the doctor and say I was in a lot of back
pain because I was born with a genetic back disorder and so that's what I did
I went to the University Hospital got the got the drugs got in the elevator of
the pharmacy with the drugs and by the time I reached the bottom floor I had taken a bunch of pills took a big ol sip
of coffee syrup yeah probably eight hours later I'm smoking crack and shooting heroin all over again and
you've tumbled straight back in yep luckily for me that lap that only lasted a week and
some people in my halfway house told my therapist that I was using again and
they and they pulled me back into the program and that I think it was June
maybe 28th 2008 or the last day that I used heroin or smoked crack okay and
then was that from there is that full sobriety from that date for five years I
was completely sober and a but yeah roughly five years later I made the decision to drink occasionally and smoke
weed occasionally and how have you found that effect on full sobriety and what a
lot of people attach their their recovery to is being teetotal and yes
it's all or nothing and it definitely sounds like that's a theme in your life
as well I did a podcast not so long ago I brought this up with Dom with a friend who said that he didn't believe that
going completely teetotal is conquering an addiction he said as far as he's
concerned it's being able to stop your use of the substance and then the reintroduction of the substance on your
terms or a substance there's some that are too difficult to be able you can't have a little bit of heroin but right
specifically with alcohol his point was that it needs to be a reintroduction on
your terms and if you can then control the usage so how did you find having your first drink after you'd had such a
long time off and were you scared we concerned that that was going to be the beginning of something yeah worse
Smoking Weed
really really great question and I I love what your friend Dom said and I
would agree to a certain point but everyone's different and there are human beings that I believe are so they've
they've used for so long and just literally rewired their brains for so
many years it it's not even safe to ever chance reintroducing anything
for me I thought that could be the case and I thought about it for about six
months and talked to my entire support system other than my parents because that really scared them but I talked to
everyone else therapists mentors friends etc and then one night a friend came
over and he had a big bag of weed and he went to the shower and I've been thinking about it and so I
just grabbed this little this little nugget and later that night I rolled myself a joint and it was it was
impulsive of me right I couldn't say for sure that nothing bad was gonna happen
but I had been thinking about it for so long and I was pretty damn sure that I
had overcome the issues the challenges that led me to the place that I was in
the first place and it felt really confident and so I made the decision and smoke some weed and nothing bad happened
and so it was it was really scary in the beginning and I kept I kept kind of like
looking and waiting for things in my mind to change like for me to develop
cravings and they just never came but though the one promise that I made to myself and I will always keep is that if
I feel any kind of emotion like negative emotion any kind of real challenge in my
life I'm very vigilant that I can't medicate with any kind of substance I
have to deal with it healthily like a healthy human being by doing some introspective work by sharing
it with someone I trust by just literally working through it and I use I
use those things too as a you know to have fun with people as a social event
not as a coping mechanism anymore I understand I understand completely were you proud of yourself refa
Achievement Guilt
referentially after the event after you had you first spliff after you'd had your first drink was there a sense of achievement that
you knew hang on this was something that I used to like I was never able to clean
140 kilos and now I finally cleaned 140 kilos like was there a sense of
accomplishment having done it and then not tumbled down the rabbit hole so to
speak no I was it was a feeling of relief and a feeling
of guilt Wow because for a full year I didn't tell my parents okay because I decided and who know I don't know what
the right decision was but I felt so much guilt because I knew if I told them
at a certain point they would be just so terrified and I didn't want them to feel
that I wanted to get I wanted to have done it for long enough to where I could
say hey I've been doing this for a year I'm happier than I was before right
I've prioritized my mental health still and I'm even happier and I just want I
want to let you guys know that I'm okay but I've made this decision so I carried
that guilt with me for about a year well that's a heavy burden to carry especially when you know for sure
potentially using substances as well even in moderation it's still a pretty
silly pretty big burden to boil sure it was worth it to me though because one of
the biggest decisions I chose to not be completely sober anymore was because I felt like I was expending a lot of
energy trying to protect this this sobriety that I didn't really identify
with anymore I didn't identify with this sense of being powerless anymore so I thought I was spending energy without
needing to means that make sense yeah willpower is a finite resource there's a interesting study by dr. Roy Baumeister
with radishes have you heard of this I know I know of the concept powers finite
I don't know if I know of that study so basically put two people in a room one had radishes and cookies and the other
just had cookies the radishes group were told that they could only eat the radishes and the cookies group were
allowed to eat the cookies then after they'd both been in the room for a fixed period of time both groups were given a
tough mathematical test that I think couldn't be completed within the particular time frame it was a long time
frame the group that had the radishes gave up 50% quicker than the group that didn't know B that is fascinating
because their willpower had been reduced already so when it came doing a cognitively demanding task they had nothing left in
the tank or their last [ __ ] less left in the tank that's cool it is cool isn't it I think it's um
it's a big we'll get on to in a second but you're a big advocate of morning
routines and of taking things out of choice and into habitual the habitual
domain and I think that that definitely is if anyone who's listening that doesn't have a good morning routine for
a start up like that that's all that you need to know if you if you spend your time in the morning choosing which
cereal it's gonna be or what meat you're gonna cook or whether you do meditate or
don't meditate or do have a shower don't have a shower that's a decision later in the day that you need to make do you
can't you can't make with as much efficiency so you're now clean CrossFit
First Workout
how did you get into it and what was your first ever workout can you remember oh absolutely
so I had just run I had just run the marathon and it was actually before I relapsed my a guy who would then become
the best man at my wedding you know what seven eight years later he I met him through my chemical dependency
counselor the this gal knew that I you know loved to be active and had didn't
have any friends so she hooked me up with this guy Bryce and we started snowboarding together he knew that I was
kind of looking for some kind of fitness to do and he said hey man if you want come come try this new thing I'm doing
and he said I was healthy CrossFit 2008-2009 nine nine so this is early days so let's see mm yeah eight I think
it was nine so that would mean that that's the that's the year that the relapse happened so he he brings me in
and I'm thinking I'm in phenomenal shape man just one my age bracket I'm gonna
kick everybody's ass and it was fight gone bad and I did one round as hard as I
possibly could and III halfway blacked
out from there come out that looks a little bit quick exactly I was sore for
probably ten days after but I absolutely loved it oh and I and I
came in dead last in the whole gym I was not naturally gifted at CrossFit at all
so I just felt I fell in love with that feel that transformation that happens
throughout that that hour-long class right you get your your ass absolutely kicked everyone's doing it together
everyone's suffering and giving all of the effort that they can and on the
other side they come out a stronger human being mentally right I loved I loved that process and you know it I
said I did it for a couple weeks that relapse happened and then I found it
again probably six months later okay so the class is a bit of a microcosm for you overcoming obstacles elsewhere I
suppose as well the classes go through something that's difficult you come out feeling better at the end I suppose
that's a theme that you'd been through several times back and forth over the years preceding that as well certainly
and I couldn't articulate that at the time I just thought I thought it was a great workout it was some it was very
positive people to be around and I just loved being at that gem what had you
done before with regards to training that was similar had you obviously you've done sports that were athletic
but had you done anything in the way of weightlifting or something similar to that seriously I competed in
powerlifting a little bit I did a couple weightlifting competitions and I grew up my dad started bringing me to the gym
when I was probably eight and I did it I didn't take it very seriously but at my school I probably took it more seriously
than any other kid I not not because I wanted to get better at the sports just
because I loved I love to lift weights and feel like I was getting stronger I loved the feeling of putting 135 on the
bench press for the first time 225 for the first time it was just a it was just a good feeling I like being in the gym
the addictive personalities showing through a little bit as well I suppose but not sure not know in a positive light so how do you go from being dead
From Dead Last To First
last in the gym obviously you've got work capacity you've completed a marathon so endurance wise I suppose
there's a good there's the beginnings of being able to grind it out but there's not very many
CrossFit workouts that take between two and three hours so you know you've got all right you've got some big holes in
your game what was when you were starting out what what were you the shittest uh what was really bad for you
honestly probably my strength because I had I was really strong at one point in
high school but then I got really into drugs and then I spent nearly two years
without touching a weight and so everything was heavy for me and I I
wasn't even someone that took to the gymnastics techniques very quickly it
just took a lot of practice or anything particularly easy running right okay so
if you've got if you've got some running in it then you sweet and if not well at the time at the time I'm a completely
different athlete now and I yeah just like the running okay so tell me how you
get from there to being the the number one team in CrossFit two years in a row
at the games what's the level of work output that you needed to go through to
get yourself from that guy in the first workout to standing on number one podium at the games so for about a year I
didn't even hear I didn't even know that like a competition like an official
CrossFit competition existed and so I just showed up at the gym nearly every
single day and just went as hard as I possibly could and I had a different points I just had different people than
I was chasing right different levels of people that I was chasing and I said if I can beat that person then I'm getting
better and over the course of the year I worked my way up to chasing the guy that
got the best time every single day his name was Rob he became a really really
good friend of mine and I just started I started chasing him and and
just putting in time in the gym yeah at some point I started adding a little bit of strength work before my workouts a
little bit further I was doing a little bit of strength work and I was doing a second metcon either right after the you
know workout of the day or I would come in a second time to the gym and just put in extra work in the same probably a
year after I think it's a full year after I started I did a competition where I competed against Tommy
hackenbruck who would later become my teammate and I was beating him for long
enough in the day I was in first place in this competition for long enough that I really got his attention and he ends
up really kicking my ass because in the beginning of the day there were no strength events and so after that he he
just destroyed me but after that after the event he comes up to me and Rob that
was at my gym and he said hey y'all are both the other both great at this why don't y'all come to my gym and we'll
start a team and so it was at that time it felt like one of the hardest
decisions of my life to leave my first gym yes it felt like I was breaking up with my family but you know over the
course of a couple weeks I made the decision to leave and that year we we had a team that went to the games and
Tommy wasn't a part of it we had a team that went to the games that place ninth and that's the first time that I
followed a structured training program we all just followed Tommy hackenbruck training program okay and it was a lot
of twoa days there was some mono structural work like running and rowing
but not a ton and I would actually skip a lot of that and it was a you know that
was the first time that I really took it seriously so would you say that that's a lot in terms of sophistication the
What Is Typical In The Community
programming that you were doing that built the basis upon which most of your work time was done in the build-up to
you winning the games how would you compare that in terms of sophistication to programming that both yourselves do
now and I guess what is typical within the within the community at the moment what is typical in the community I would
call it as sophisticated if not better really the the guy that did it his name
is Rob McDonald he was the general manager of Jim Jones for a long time he has he's coached dozens of professional
athletes fighters NFL players NBA players and he just really really gets
strength and conditioning at its core he really understands the principles of shrinking conditioning and he applied
all of the work that he's done with professional athletes for so long and just added a CrossFit twist to it with
with a little bit of Tommy's help yeah so even in the infancy of the sport you've got someone who's yes so far
ahead of the game and that was huge for me I started to see I learned the the
correct way to train like really really rapidly the the next year this is really
what what change for me and what had the biggest impact for me is we decided that
we were gonna take the best people of that team and we're and Tommy was gonna
join the team is he really in three at this point is it three and through it yeah exactly we decided that we were going to try to
create a team that could go and win the CrossFit Games and so we recruited people and at that time people were
still talking about recruiting like it was like it was a sin you know and I just laughed I'm like this is every
single sport recruiting yeah there's nothing absolutely nothing like
ethically wrong with recruiting we literally got people from other gyms to start working out at our gym yeah and we
got some savages and what changed for me was seeing how a couple of my new
teammates trained specifically I'll talk about Adrienne Conway who I still work
with to this day he did every single thing on the program
he slept eight to nine hours a day his diet was on point
he got body work done on him several times a week every single thing was on
point and that's the first time I closely observed someone training like a
professional and it inspired me to do the same so he's not doing more and he's
also not doing less exactly yes doing exactly what his coach is telling him to which is what a professional does he's
doing everything that he can to set him up for success and so I wasn't perfect
but I I got damn near close to doing the exact same thing and it what did what it
did is it obviously it helped me progress physically at a level I just
was not used to I got better at everything very quickly but it just changed my mind it changed my mindset I
was putting in so much effort and so much focus that it it made me mentally
tougher so when I'm in the gym you know doing a really grinding workout I had
this new this new feeling of strength in me and this ability to push because I believed in myself a little bit more
it's like an echo chamber isn't it yes and it's not a tangible thing you have
to you have to do it and experience it to really understand what I'm saying but
it made me a mentally stronger athlete just by doing what I was told
The Slippery Slope
yeah the slippery slope runs up and down doesn't it when you brake when you brake
the discipline in one direction look at what happens you've got a number you've got a number of years of examples of
that and then when you break the discipline in the opposite direction and you start pushing beyond what you thought was was capable then you benefit
exactly it's all about integrity you know as a drug addict I had zero integrity with myself so when I when I
would tell myself I want to accomplish X goal I didn't believe it yeah because I
could not be trusted when I started to do everything that I was told when I
started keeping promises to myself I started to really believe in the things
that I was doing I started to really believe in myself and workouts and it was a very powerful experience
Coaching
I agree H each step that you make is built on top of the previous one exactly do you think that
you would like to coach yourself if you'd had the mic kazoo athlete in 2011
and you were the coach now do you think that you would like to coach yourself as
an athlete I think I would actually uh-huh at that at that time yes but by
the time I was on that team yes I was very I would do anything that my coach
told me all of the all of the things in and out of the gym and I think it would
have been it would have been fun for me and intellectually stimulating to be challenged so much because I always
wanted to know why we were doing what we were doing not to not to call him out
and and argue with him but I just wanted to understand I wanted to understand how the body worked and how kinesiology
exercise science works so I think it would have been fun for me yeah that's a good question I love that yeah hunger
Brut Body
for information I guess that's laid the foundations for you to be able to make what is as far as I can see one of the
premier programming outfits that's in the community at the moment so to give
you a little bit of information from my side I started the Brut body program what do we we start week five this week
five days I think so yeah one or two today and I decided that at the beginning of the year some friends have
given me some some really good feedback on that and for anybody who's listening who doesn't know what Brut body is it's
I would describe it and I might do this wrongly as a physique focused CrossFit program I suppose what's interesting for
me seeing someone who has been to the pinnacle of the sport stood on the podium twice at the CrossFit Games and
typically the I think physique and aesthetics in CrossFit can be considered
a little bit of a dirty word sometimes I think that Fitness comes first and the
over the tribalism that occurs between the global side and the CrossFit side
sometimes means that if you see someone who's doing bench press or is doing some
extra girls in the gym you know that that's very unlikely going to be for functional
reasons and I think it's really really interesting to see you guys having set
up a program which is esthetics conscious so let's fast forward and
let's talk about brute strength and what you guys do and I can actually comment
on that absolutely because I think that's a really interesting point and I want to be clear that I so believe in
the CrossFit ethos and that and that every human being should strive for fitness at the same time brew body is
not meant to be done for one's lifetime it's meant to be done for like three to
12 months some people will choose to do it longer but it's it's to be done for a short period of time and to teach you a
new way to train and to add to your training vocabulary we've had so many
people that have been doing crossfit for seven plus years that come in and say i've never felt better or I've never
been this strong or I'm having so much fun with all of these new movements so
it just it exposes people to things that they're not already doing yeah and it all of the accessory work in it has
amazing effects on people's bodies that they're able to go back to their regular
you know CrossFit programming later and then add in some of this stuff on the side to keep themselves healthy to just
keep things spicy and entertaining and exciting right isn't it isn't it interesting that you've got people that
CrossFit
have been doing crossfit as a sport and you're having to teach them things like one and a quarter incline DB curls and
like Zurcher curls and stuff like that like the typical approach to gym bro
lifting would be coming the other way it would be I can do supinated bicep curls and tricep tricep extensions for days
but I don't know how a clean-and-jerk I don't know how a snatch yeah and I think it speaks to the dominance of CrossFit
as a methodology and a functional fitness that you can actually you can you know teach people there's a you know
eight eight to 14 is an acceptable number of reps to try and do right right and you yeah and you
may not do that every day yeah but that's a great way to train sometimes I think you can get some great adaptations
that way okay so I think from what's interesting is that you see the guys in
the gym especially the CrossFit gym we've got our gym in Newcastle is split in half so there's one side that's the
global side and there's one side that's the CrossFit side and I'm definitely seeing an evolution I think of CrossFit
in that there is complete fluidity between both mmm there's the guys that
tend to spend more time on one side and tend spend more time on the other but there is a lot more movement between the two do you think moving forward that
we're going to see more of that do you think that you can see CrossFit is who are going to become increasingly focus
or less focused on being able to work capacity and more focused on aesthetics
as the sport becomes more inclusive and wider or do you still think that it's all moving in the same direction and
it's kind of just extra arms and extra extra armoury being added in to an
existing body of knowledge so to speak it's an interesting question I think for
sure the only thing I know for sure is that CrossFit coaches are becoming very
very competent they are there they are learning all types of different
methodologies and so I think what we will see is a lot of gyms with just a
lot more variety of movements and a lot more variety of even methodologies but
right we might see people go through different phases or we might just see a lot of different movements that you're
you're not used to seeing mixed in your training either before during or after
your workouts as far as the the camp that people are a part of I think people
just love to be a part of a camp so I think they're going to remain a little
bit divided so that they can call themselves a meathead or call themselves a hardcore crossfitter
people just love to feel sturdily a part of a certain tribe of people I agree
Identity
no I couldn't agree that identity the group identity that's fed through from training method
methodology is absolutely correct we've got Thursday nights at six o'clock is Gun Club which night which is an hour
of unwrapped curls and superset benchpress with a plank rows and stuff
like that and that's really really cool and seen some of the guys eyes open up if they come in and they've done they've
done bro lifting for a while and then they come across to the CrossFit side and they kind of suck everything pretty
much in the same way as everyone did and then they see the Thursday six o'clock class and they look at that and they
think I can actually this is this is my jam again I can go in right I can show everyone that I have all of this
training has been for something and it's between 8 and 14 reps usually right and through that I love that through that
experience you're able to have liked it you're able to be on another level of consciousness where you you all of a
sudden see okay CrossFit may be like the best way but you can also add in these other things
and it's not bad what's bad is it's focusing solely on isolate isolation
exercises right that's just not that's not a functional way to train your body and it's not good for your health
long-term some isolation exercises sprinkled into your programming can be a phenomenal thing I agree
Business acumen
so moving forwards brute strength to me
it doesn't sound like it doesn't sound like naturally you've had a massive amount of opportunity to develop a
business acumen maybe apart from when you're trying to negotiate the price of
drugs run in your life it doesn't seem like you would be top of the list as
someone who would become a clever businessman and will be able to move forward very quickly with that so can
you explain about how you commercialized your passion so I was really lucky to be
a part of the very first barbell shrug mastermind and I went into that event
literally knowing nothing about business and I'm not even I'm not exaggerating I
I was about to buy a gym from Tommy and I was about to start Brut I knew both of
those were happening and I had absolutely no idea what I was doing and I went into that event knowing nothing
and I came out with just my mind exploded with different ideas so first
off I was very lucky to have Mike Bledsoe and Doug Larsen and those guys
as some mentors and they've continued to mentor me throughout the years and I
think one of the biggest gifts I was given and skills that I created through
my time in rehab was the ability to just ask for help and not be afraid of
looking like I don't know anything I have always but since I got out of
rehab I have just been such a sponge for information and just always asking for
feedback asking how I'm doing where I can improve what other people are doing
and just really being vulnerable in the sense that some people might think some
people might think that's a that's a sign of weakness or they they might think I'm you know I really don't know
what I'm talking about and I'm fine with that and it's allowed me to learn I had a really rapid rapid rate and you know
steal a lot of ideas absolutely you know what I mean one of one of my favorite
Jordan Peterson rules for life
youtubers anyone who's listening y'all know who I'm about to quote Jordan Peterson one of his rules for life he's got 40 rules for life
and one of them is assume the person you are speaking to know something that you don't and listen to them hard enough so
that they will tell you and I think that that is so many of the things that we've brought today number one is tell the
truth number three is act in a way so that you can tell the truth about your actions and you know so many of the things that
we've gone through today principles that appear to manifest themselves in different walks of life it's interesting
that you say that you're showing vulnerability now whereas the first portion of your life where you were
struggling you were hyper owner of unburnable or at least externally whilst in are now in
so now speaking the truth forward definitely appears to have done wonders
for yourself so you know that brute barbell at the time what was it what was the first
brand Bruce barbell Bruce barbell yeah so my partner Matt Bruce yeah he
just had to have his name in there somewhere and then in the rebrand and so we combine Bruce with you to CrossFit
uh-huh brute cause you barbell might've been as much as some people to pronounce yeah right so why does it go from that
from right right when we started yeah oh let's see we start we start programming
for people that want to compete in a very very high level for crop in CrossFit right and we've basically
exactly so we I start basically giving people the type of programming that I
was given tailored to their weaknesses
somewhere along the way they actually very quickly I learned the concept of in
business you don't really want to work on your weaknesses instead you want to
highlight your strengths and then hire people where you are weak and so I started to create this team to come that
that really complemented me and so you know I had people that paid attention to detail people that were process oriented
people that could create systems what are you that what are your
strengths and weaknesses in business my strengths are getting ideas right making
making new ideas or taking an idea and getting it started like rapidly fast
I don't need hardly any information to you know to have the confidence to start
moving forward that's also a real big problem sometimes because I don't quite
get enough information so my one of my intentions this year is to take like a sixty second pause before every decision
I make and I'm gonna be way more accurate because of that yeah what some of my weaknesses are it's
really painful for me to pay attention to any level of detail I hate that I hate doing anything more than once
I hate repetitive tasks those those are
by far the biggest oh and an organization in general it's real it takes me a lot of energy to keep
schedules in place and and different people in place and managing people
those are those are just not in my wheelhouse and so over time we just hired people that love to do it and are
great at it yeah it's weird isn't it because the same way as a football team or a CrossFit team needs guys who bring
Being OK at everything
different strengths of weaknesses in you know you can be even more specific with business and have such a type mandate
for a particular a particular employee or business partner to look after and
exactly I think I'll you really correct doubling down on these strengths in any
sort of commercial pursuit it's the best way to do it because being OK at everything means that you're not really
very great to anything and right loads of people out there that aren't tremendously great or anything but
there's very few people that are particularly great at something so I think you've definitely stumbled across
something that is a really common route to business success there so you're now
dealing with I wouldn't like to guess how many clients globally it'll be tens
of countries thousands of clients and you're now dealing with some of the best athletes in the planet as well so we're
talking about hypertrophy based training where you're taking people who maybe just want to look better and then you're
also taking people to the games as well right exactly for sure so you're going from bottom to top can you name some of
the top level athletes that you're working with at the moment we work with Jacob Hebner Brooke ence Cara Webb
Christine and Dolly George Sanchez Adrian Conway who was on my team we had
a we had the winning team from last year the Wasatch brutes yep so those are some
of our heavy hitters some big name yeah so one thing I wanted to move on to
Rock bottom
was I've heard you talk an awful lot about you hitting rock bottom allowed
you to spring back out in terms of your development and your motivation I think
the people who hit absolute rock bottom oh by the by the very definition they
are in them in the minority there's a lot more people who are wallowing around
in this kind of two thirds bottom of a squat so to speak to use the squat
analogy and we all know that if you're there it's a lot more difficult to spring back out because the the
beginning energy that it takes for you to see everything has gone this is a real life-changing epiphany moment
allowed you to say right this is enough I'm knocking it on their heads are there
any things that you think that any principles are any advice that you think you could give to people who maybe don't
have it that bad but also kind of don't have it that good does that make sense that it's a little bit of a no-man's
land where it's not bad enough to make it super bad to spring you back out at the bottom but it's also nowhere near
really where you want to be and there might be people who suffer with depression a couple of days a month and
they have an anxiety and they have problems that are left unchecked well
it's not chronic severe life stopping they're not in an extreme amount of pain
that almost forces them to change I totally get that survival mode yeah yeah unfortunately a lot of those people they
they aren't even aware that they're in any pain and so they're not even gonna hear this but it's all it's really all
relative like I could have gone so much deeper and so much further I could have
kept digging kept digging kept digging the best way to get out of a hole the first step is to literally just put down
the shovel right stop digging further and decide that you want to change for
the for the people that just aren't stoked about their life right maybe they're a little bit sad maybe they're a
lot sad but thing horrible is going on you're
literally your life is at stake right now you have you know maybe 60 years
left 70 years left and then it's just all done and you're not gonna have another chance and so you're your entire
life is at stake and the only way that you're going to have a positive experience in your one chance on earth
is if you take a massive action towards a different type of existence so first
off identify and accept that you are in a place you don't want to be and realize
that that acceptance is not weakness is actually courage and even vocalizing
that is is Kurt is courageous because you're letting people see the the real
you and that's uh that's just an act of courage yeah so first off reframe it
from a sign of weakness to a sign of courage and then a couple helpful things
are don't be afraid to ask for help ask you know if you if you see a person living the life you want to live asking
them what the the basic principles the most important principles are to follow that that they use in their life and
then just focus on trying to know yourself better and better through
becoming more self-aware you're you're going to intuitively know what the right
decisions are for you and it takes it takes time it takes consistency and it
takes hard work to really know what's underneath all of the all of the layers and the ways the defense mechanisms that
we absolutely cultivated over the years but it's possibly the most important
work that we can possibly do well you've only got that one life right and I don't yeah one of the one of the big things I
think that to come out of this is taking responsibility for your actions I think that you do have two choices you can
presume that nothing you do matters and that every decision that you make is
whether there's someone watching others someone not whether the coach in front is in front of you or whether the coach isn't
even there on your training on your own whether you're in rehab or out of rehab however it might be that the decision is
ultimately meaningless or the alternative that's good right because it
means well I don't have to take responsibility for anything I guess that's quite a that's not a tremendously
bad price to pay but the alternative is everything you do matters every single
decision that you make whether you make your bed or you don't make you bet whether you wash the dishes up or you don't wash the dishes up whether you
keep a promise to yourself or someone else or whether you break it and I think that the echo chamber the self
referential building one brick at a time mentality that you've definitely had and
appears to have worked in you know bounds for yourself certainly it's certainly an inspiring
story for other people to hear and I know that like you say it is all relative and for someone to hear this
kind of a story and think well that's not me I don't have it that bad you know if it's not wouldn't believe
would be good then it can be better if it's not absolutely perfect and there's more work to be done and I think that
hopefully some people will hear and think well actually yeah I could I could make that bit over there that bit of my
life doesn't need a little bit of work I shouldn't leave it by the wayside so the
what I want to finish with is some discussion on meditation and I've heard
you talk about it for a while and I'd be really interested to know what your typical practice is at the moment super
super simple I sit down in a chair I said a 20 minute timer and I focus on my breath every single time I catch myself
lost in thought I just bring myself back to my breath that's my sitting meditation practice
and I've been really really consistent with it for a while now and what I've
noticed more than ever and I've had this insight over the years but I'm really
I'm seeing this on a very frequent basis now where I am just the watcher of my
thoughts and the watcher of my feelings rather than being my thoughts and being my
feelings so somebody cuts me off in traffic my untrained mind I am just
immediately pissed I may be thrown the bird I speed up I you know I get in front of him and slam on the brakes I am
just I am angry right through the consistent practice of meditation I've
come to understand that the real me is just the watcher of those things and if
I can develop the in in the more I am I
am that watcher the better my life is right the more I have the choice of which thought to believe and and I have
control over my thoughts and my feelings so it basically creates like the circumstances in our lives don't change
they're going to happen to us right that's just life but what happens in
between the time that that circumstance happens and you have a thought that's
where the magic is and consistent meditation can create this gap between the circumstance and the thought and the
bigger that gap the more choice you have so it goes circumstance happens in life
triggers a thought triggers an emotion triggers a behavior and gives you a result that results at the end is always
directly related to that original thought that you have so if you have a result that you keep getting in life
that you're not happy with then reverse engineer it figure out a thought that
you need to think to trigger the right emotion and behavior and then result and
then notice that you you're just in control of which thoughts you believe right what one thought in relation to
getting cut off in traffic is that [ __ ] is such an [ __ ] like he
probably does that to every person I've got to teach him a lesson yeah that that is believable like that
could that could be the case right Alleva but not beneficial right one that serves me is something like man like
that kind of pissed me off but he's probably having a bad day I really have no idea what's going on in
his life maybe he's actually in the middle of an emergency that triggers a very different type of emotion which
triggers a different behavior which results in me just chilling having a good day yep
no I couldn't we we're we have access to that in every single area of our lives
so you're doing at the moment mostly one guided meditation yeah all all unguided
have you done any formal practice have you gone away and been coached by anyone or ever had a meditation teacher yes
I've done a lot of different a lot of different things with teachers I've done actually a lot of guided meditations I
did headspace for a long time and I think for beginners that's hands down or the best way to
learn oh babe it's fun it's phenomenal it's very cheap and it and it's the most kind of like compassionate way to learn
right we're using that where you don't beat yourself up for being quote unquote bad at meditation yeah he takes that
away from you Andy is the nicest guy ever that voice is the most comforting
thing I actually bought my mom a year of headspace yesterday it's nice her birthday's not for like two months but
she managed to download the app I've got no idea how because as I write her iPod usually defeats it but yes here she
managed to download the app and had done the ten day and I was like right you've got you've gone this far like I'm gonna get you the rest of it I'm at Carl I
mentioned this on one of the life hacks podcasts that we did but you might be interested as well Aubry Marcus who
won't on it mmm he has a fantastic guided meditation series and it's
complete with binaural beats then come along with it and that course is called
release into now in its six weeks half an hour a day and some of the stuff that
he does in there so you're talking about detachment from thoughts and watching the watcher there's an exercise in that
where he asks you to visualize a video camera three feet away and two feet up
in the air and then you watch yourself through the video camera the inside
reduces to leave the outline of the body and then the outline of the body reduces to leave nothing and that exercise
that's only on week two and that exercise was so difficult to do it's a very
different kind of meditation it's not emptying the mind it's very focused so rather than it being floodlight it's
spotlight borne some of the some of the ways of thinking that that developed me
that forced me to develop were the way that you feel after doing those is very
very distinct in the same way that I'd say working up to a 1 rep max back squat
is very distinct from going and running a 10k right it's still physically exact
fascinating really check it out you should do it's really really interesting so I think the meditation side of stuff
definitely appears to match in with your desire for bettering yourself all the
time and I think it's it's really inspiring to hear a story from someone I said this to Dom you hear this all the
time from people in the news that too much too soon and the stories of people who go from
rock bottom and do manage to make it to a place where they feel valued but to hear it firsthand from somebody who is
part of a community do you still do still coach you coach at a box or are you I don't I don't I travel too much to
commit to coaching in person and I actually don't coach anyone remotely anymore as well okay we have we have
coaches for all of our programs now okay do you miss up a part of me does for
sure and I think I'll probably revisit I'll probably go back to it at some point in my life but I feel really
energized and challenged by working on
the business rather rather than working in the business as much yeah and so I'm I'm just really enjoying it for now well
there's only 24 hours in your day but when I'm when you write a program that can be distributed by however many
coaches that can reach more people right rap just to finish I want right in saying that you compete in the open last
year was that the first time in a little while it was it was the first so I had a
I had back surgery in 2013 I had a lumbar fusion done and I thought I was
done forever and then this past year I started going to this really kick-ass
gym called CrossFit your car whoo just phenomenal competitive environment and
they it really just fired me up so I started in January and I went to their
level two class so they have three levels that they're level two is like sport which is a like a regular CrossFit
class and then level three is like your competitor class I just wanted to do to do regular CrossFit classes and I went
that went in there and just went all out and I ended up getting in really really
good shape for me right relative to my best and I decided to compete in the
open and ended up doing really well you came 327 was it 3 top 300 I'm not
sure in the in the world but I got like 19th in the region yeah so having had a
disc fusion in your back and that was the reason that you exited sort of full
competitive CrossFit a few years ago and you still managed to get so high up the
rankings in the open I mean does that tempt you do you do you hear the the CrossFit do you hear Dave Castro on your
shoulder just sort of teasing you to come back definitely definitely it's very very tempting but I had this really
powerful realization a few months ago that the only reason I still want to
stick around and compete is because I think other people will like it and I will get attention for it I really am
not passionate about competing in CrossFit anymore I love I love doing the
regular CrossFit classes with you know with a like a big mixture of people yeah
just like I started doing in the beginning but I just lost a passion for competing so and at the same time I've
been really really wanting to get into jiu-jitsu and kind of like dipping my toes in the past few years and just not
sticking to it because I keep kind of getting back into CrossFit yeah and so I've decided this year I'm not gonna do
the open I'm going to put my ego aside and not go for that thing that I know
I'll get my ego stroked you're gonna do well it right and you're gonna and it's almost definitely you're gonna suck at jujitsu
exactly exactly and by making that I haven't been more proud of a decision in
a while because it's really it really is so tempting to want to do that thing
that I think people really like yeah you know and I'm gonna suck at jujitsu for a long time I might never be good at it
but I really love it and I love the feeling of striving for mastery and I
just kinda lost that in CrossFit and so now I'm just using CrossFit as a way to stay in great shape and just getting
passionate about this new thing fantastic Michael I've really really enjoyed this man can you tell us where we can find
you online you can find me our website is brute strength training com
I am completely off of all social media for the time being so you won't find me there that's really interesting why is
that yeah uh I recently read a book called deep work by Cal Newport yeah we
heard of it yes I've have you read it yep you know for the listeners it
basically explains that most of us spend maybe all of our time if not the vast
majority of our time spent in shallow work which is not cognitively demanding
not very meaningful work and although I wasn't spending a significant amount of
time over the course of a week and I tracked it I wasn't spending that much time on social media but I was spending
it in the times where I was getting uncomfortable and I was starting to do deep work and I would just just want to
distract myself full butt right again yeah so when I was like like really getting into preparing for a really big
podcast or I was writing an article for a manual that we were working on I just
found myself wanting to distract and I I don't like feeling controlled by social
media I also realize that I don't really use it for much positive I don't post
much we have a social media team that does our social media for the company I
was posting much personally and I was just spending my time looking at people and
kind of feeling shitty about myself because I'm seeing all of the best of
everyone's week or everyone's day and I could always find someone in one like
social media session that I could I could say oh my god he or she is better than me yeah and I would if I would
really like it wouldn't be anything significant but it would be this little sting of I'm not doing enough or he or
she is better than me and I found myself we're like kind of wishing not wishing
poor poor absolutely the word it's difficult don't want people to succeed yet I don't like that that's country
that's country to what we've literally just discussed we're talking about compassion virtue integrity wanting the
best for everybody else and exactly in the same hand it's so strange that on
your footnote for this podcast that we've stumbled upon this so I did ten minutes Dom from social chain these guys
have 400 million reach on social media which is a significant proportion of the
globe right and I asked him about the ethics of Technology about whether or
not he feels that people need to be more mindful with the use of tech I'm not sure if you have to know that you're a fan of Sam Harris
do you follow his podcast I don't man I'm going to get into it so episode I
think it's episode 71 I keep on drilling this I promise I'm not on a referral code for some I respond yes boring
Tristan Harris from time well-spent this podcast basically talks about how
cognitive biases and persuasion techniques are used by companies like
Twitter and Google and Facebook and Instagram the dopamine release the reason that candy crush was so
successful all of that sort of stuff and you've stumbled across everything there the fact of the matter is that on social
media we see the best of everybody else's lives yeah whilst only in our eyes through a lens of resentment and
complete awareness of our own cowardice and stupidity on a daily basis we only
get to see the worst of our own we compare the best everyone else's lives with the worst of our own and it inevitably leads to feelings
we track the wrong things absolutely if you do get back on your phone download an app called moment which will try have
it you've got it that's all you know so it's Tristan you when you listen that podcast you will you will calanque
you will thank the fact that you decided to put the phone down and I think so
interesting that that's something that you've come across I've also got man and I do wanna I do want to note that I
don't judge anyone for using it I just realized that for me it wasn't serving
me right and I want to regain control I want to be more mindful in my life and
what I've what I've noticed is that I am significantly more present in every
single thing that I do because I don't have you know I could open I could open my email or open Google but there's not
that many like fun things that I want to go do on my phone anymore right so I don't I spend like like a tenth of the
time on there it's awesome what's the strategy if you just gone up free have you just deleted everything it's social
media app free yep yeah yep so nothing except for stuff that you need to work and I message and what's up
and stuff like that exactly and I'm very I'm not perfect with this but I am
careful about when I when I check and respond to email and I try to do it in
Windows throughout the day so even even email is limited fantastic well I've got
coming up soon I've got this CEO of the light phone calm which is a really
interesting device which is discussed by Tristana and he basically it's a phone
which allows you to call nine numbers and it forwards on him it forwards on from your other phone it tells you the
time and who's ringing you if they ring you don't need a new SIM card you don't need anything you leave your phone at
home and you take that one out and it's if you're doing a weekend away with the family it'll last for four days because
it doesn't do and yeah I think mindful tactical mindful tech is definitely going to be an emerging field I think
it's really really cool that you're you've stumbled upon it yourself I think that's that's yeah that's definitely
very admirable so we got halfway through you saying what your Instagram is that you will check at some point in
the future probably yeah probably but the but as it says in the book if
nothing bad happens as a result of you stopping just stop altogether but it's it's my full name it's at Michael cashew
that's CA za y OU u X send me a direct message if I if I open it and there's a
bunch of them I'll probably answer them all you can you can also find my wife's
company at working against gravity I am also a team member on that company as well that's a nutrition consulting
company fantastic Mike thank you so much for your time I really appreciate it dude good luck with you Jiu Jitsu as you
chase thank you for our next few weeks and good luck to your athletes as well I appreciate them in season yeah this is a
real pleasure I love how how conversational it is and how you just go deep it's awesome thank you very much
cheers dude

Transcription:

right so like facts number two number
two you're waving around what you wait I don't know I'm just making peace a peace
listen this piece okay so I'm gonna open up on the last episode I mentioned that
I will be talking about sleep cycle and that is gonna be my first one today so sleep cycle is an app that used for
tracking sleep you set an alarm last thing at night and it presumes that
that's the final thing that you do so it calls that your sleep you're going to bed time it then tracks when you wake up
on a morning set an alarm off you can give it a window of time between an hour
and 10 minutes during which it uses the motion sensor and your phone to detect
your muscle sensor or the microphone to detect the depth of sleep the airing and it tribes to find a time to wake you
when you are closest to light sleep that feature for me I don't use an awful lot
but I know it can be pretty effective the thing that I like the most is just tracking the amount of time that I've
been asleep I've used it for 1,200 plus nights now so I've been doing it since
2008 the collection there yeah so your correlates will be will be very accurate
nice well it wouldn't be are you still using it not recently right okay so in explain
what the car let's are I suppose well yeah so the amount of data that it tracks to do with your sleep is unbelievable so via associate to the
weather the air temperature the pressure the moon's position hmm the location
that geographic location that you're in based on your phone's location services it literally uses everything and then
plots it against how good was your sleep so it uses the length of time that
you're asleep plus the depth of sleep determined by either the microphone or the motion sensor and then works out a
quality of sleep that's based on a percentage that percentage then gets applied against all the other bits and pieces and then it shows you an average
of your time over the last week of a month over and it also tells you people in your
country what their average is so on and so forth so if you're a bit of a the sort of person who likes to drill down
the data on that sort of thing you can really get into it and even if you don't it tells you how long you've been asleep and what the effects on your sleeper so
I know that when it's a non full moon
whatever the opposite is like non-existent moon what is it presently nor like no lower than that
path moon no blowing horn mean [ __ ] me [ __ ] me knowing when there's no me my
sleep goes up by two percent believe me no mo that's twice in the same month and we think we've had two of them this yet
so we had one since blue live but that's not phrase what is if we moon blue moon
is when we won that one full moon occurs during the same month but this year it was a red moon and and the super moon so
it was a blue blood red super moon that was the final one with a lunar knowledge
is incredible I like the moon bought my mama moon food what diamonds what my
business partners kid and moon for his first birthday I'm eight no no I'm still
going coming David's just having a little moon shrimp through so I mean David do you like the
moon yeah good so sleep cycle see cycle it you can get free version it's an app
your phone available on Android and on iphone if anyone follows me on Instagram
it's a screenshot of it all the time because I no doubt on it it's really really useful and I recommend that you
try last episode we talked about meal prep this is the man that got me into
that the slow cooker currently practice meals earlier and he's reaping the
benefits not what a nice to you there so it seems like a big fan of as well do
you know just a quick point in it you know so like all I would look at in the page hours really I kind of take with a
pinch of salt the whole that'd be great I the the whole light lunar cycle compared to asleep I agree
nice to have but it's a bit like you know being told the world's going to end that was not much you can do with the
information is that my anything that you do look at or is anything you've changed
or like added stopped a solid routine in
terms of in terms of the native options on sleep cycle no however you cannot sleep notes I mean in terms of your
sleep routine yeah I'm going to add these sleep knots it so sleep nuts are more conditional options that you can
choose before you go to bed so for instance you could have a sleep note which says had caffeine after 6:00 p.m.
today spend more than five hours at work work the night had alcohol didn't have alcohol felt stressed did meditate
didn't meditate did went to the gym did whatever and the choral up between bunches of those mean that you can
perform an experiment on yourself with any variable that you want so for me I
know if I have caffeine after 4 p.m. in the day I'll have 5% were sleep does it then lock that as something you can
enter again yes across time the study
just building your own day or on your own sweet place if it is so I've used that as well and it kind of tells you
like caffeine worsened asleep melatonin increases you improved you speak like things you think things it expects is
there anything that's unexpected they came out of it for me yes but I think my
sample size was too small and what was the unexpected thing said I'm a reduced sleep quality little bit and that's
quite a common concern yeah common complaint was oh my I can't remember the other ones but they it changed over time
so I was like probably it's not the affected melatonin house if I have three milligrams of melatonin a five milligram
thing that's the strongest thing for me unbelievable and 10% to thing improved sleep I was having that you will never
reduce you sleep requirement by an hour you will become dependent after a little oil yeah but right okay
scope so another sleep one and now it's time for you to set aside the ones that
gives us forgiveness and allow things easy to be easy the body take care of
the rest if we didn't ever know develop that if
pieces it's a like guy with a delightful soothing voice and some soundscapes to
lolly went to sleep and there's something really Pavlovian about it that when you start to hear the voice you do
just get knocked out so I sorry but just the end and it plays again when you wake up but gently brings
you back up so it's Cabul it's a very similar sleep cycle but sleep sucked like a literary sleep cycle kind of it
doesn't track anything so if you maybe if you if you're gonna use pieces and you want trucking data as well you'll
probably need a Fitbit or a bit you could easily use both could sleep cycle
doesn't wish you much better fit yeah bit fit just directed what's your I can enjoy but but can you imagine how hard
you'd have to google search engine optimized to get bit fit above Fitbit if there's anyone that can do face up face
but but but I developed a negative
relationship with it I've realized this diseases yeah so I had it it was
initially something recommended by a guy called Dave Asprey when I used to listen to his stuff back when I was Bob down
Tino and I used to listen to it when I
would struggle to sleep so the noise the voice is associated with me is with
nerving in asleep that's it that's reverse conditioned them hmm classical but wrong yeah I wasn't written that
first one I'd kill I mean honestly I can now like a line I can't fall asleep when something's up really
music audiobook or TV I can't force I think for me I like for my falling
asleep to not be the focus of what's going on it's not that I like this you know if I'm if I'm like oh my [ __ ]
god I need it for it's like if you listen you're hunting a small woodland animal and you if you look directly after its gonna run away see gorgeous
yeah you think that's I'm thinking far too easily stimulated probably an excuse
to Johnny oh my god I didn't talk let me
think let me think ah thanks my uses just turned a list of
over 30 okay it's probably more than thing so again I'm very theme based
rather than specific apps but you have got Hobbit bull written on that something will have it both which is not
for building momentum with habits something that for me has been the only
thing that allows me to do or build and yet bend it build any kind of habit or
break any kind of habit is direct one-on-one accountability some kind of
challenge with someone else and it's something that I originally heard from Tim Ferriss there's apps and websites
where you can give an amount of money - it's like held in escrow and then if
you fail to do the thing or you hit in the table fail to like continue with a
habit or fail to break the habit you lose the money that you're creating loss aversion to that thing and so having
some kind of competition or looking bad in front of someone having that accountability for me has allowed me to
be consistent with meditation journaling sleep um it's like all the asleep because closes up you do that by having
a Google Drive document where it really makes multiple people have access it's a spreadsheet that Elstad online yep both
people have access you log whether or not you did the thing that you said you were going to do and can see whether the other person did as well - its exact
external accountability is a big thing huge huge and obviously that's the
service we provide but it's some youssef a night for those people listening but
yeah I think that because I've tried so many habit apps yeah like this coach
taught me all lift puppet bull there's loads of level of my way of life
reductant I think I've got at least three and I've never used because they make sure you get the habit of
downloading it yeah this is going to be the thing that that you know changes and
I've got it now like how it's not gonna be a problem I've got this new thing or even like people who talk about incrementally adding in habits and
things like that yeah it's something that a meditation is something that we all do the thing two things got me
meditating one was performers you surf challenging me and then the other was being involved in a challenge yeah of
daily like if the back of your head someone else is meditating someone else
is gonna do that thing today yeah I'm not going to be the one that gives up I'm knocking you on the brakes the show yeah and having it just
generally on like these these these ups and that the process of building habit as being like start with two minutes a
day build it up a three minutes a day formula today tried that you got to like three weeks in you're doing six minutes
a day of meditations on the site or something in consequentially is still below the tipping point of actually feeling any kind of benefit yeah and I
was harping on about this to yourself one day one a course in Liverpool that he just goes just meditate for 30
minutes a day for 10 days and tell me honestly they don't feel anything I'm like fine Mike but that's what's
required for me to get lazy see I told you son I told you an attention isn't anything then that's
what did it that's what broke a seal yeah right really interesting there's two things there if like the negative
feedback from pieces causing you to sleep worse because you only listen to it on the days when you slept
Britany weren't able to sleep and the negative feedback of meditating for six
minutes a day and been thinking like well this is a waste of time and actually like if anything doing that
makes you meditate less I'm - first one is getting things that will
play on your mind out of the way early in the day so for me if I don't meditate before I leave the house it will stress
me throughout the rest of you lay that I know I still need to meditate mm-hmm and I'm like oh [ __ ] [ __ ] I didn't get it
done so what I've done is I've programmed in that I can have I'm allowed to have in my own mind a three
minute this is our headspace which is going to be my next one a three minute emergency session which is like you have
three minutes getting a car before yourself you have three minutes just drive a bit faster like so and that
three minutes at least means that I still need to come back and try and do a 15 minute 20 minute a half an hour later
on by like right the anxiety of the fact that I didn't do my morning my morning
thing that I said I was going to do mmm that's out again another rhyme irony the not meditating makes you more anxious
than if you just didn't meditate as a person yep but yeah a little bit if you
build a very very high wall that you then throw yourself off the top so yeah
next one's gonna be headspace I guess when I first heard about was probably
what 18 months ago and it seems to have just got everywhere since then and II put it come the guy that owns it it just
released a podcast it's massive they're working with Nike now there's a night pack like he's working with huge NBA
teams like these these teams so the best in the country in America at basketball all sorts of stuff just been on a couple
of famous podcasts as well he's again everywhere at the moment he was with Russell Brand the other day I saw it was
Justin Russell Brand's podcast he's fantastic it's anyway headspace it's an app for guided meditation if you haven't ever
done meditation before you will hear a speak about it a fair bit and you might just think it's all a bit whoo I've got
some friends who know it isn't for them John Wallace owner of Reebok CrossFit outside for him meditation is not for
him and I actually completely agree based on what I know about his personality and I do genuinely think
that there's a lot of people a large minority of people should I say for whom
meditation isn't correct however I do think it could benefit an awful lot of people but the same
said in the last episode when we were talking about people who want to get into mobility but don't know where to
start you need to find the training wheels version you don't go into a gym and try and pick up 200 kilos off the
floor immediately in a deadlift when you don't even know how it perform an empty bar deadlift you're going and you do the basics first and you get coach guided
meditation is an easy way to start off that journey you sit down you press a
button on the app and you listen to what they say exactly the same way as you would do with the rawad that we spoke about last time that you go through the
poses these are mental poses or mental states that asks you to go through thought experiments and over time as you
move through different packs you are given less a fewer and fewer cues and
you allow yourself to be more in control of your brain rather than the impetus
coming from outside it it tracks stuff like daily streaks there's loads and loads of different packs there's ones
for anxiety small performance creativity at work family relationships all manner
of different things and you can choose between three minute and that 3 minute
and 20 minute sessions for the most part for me I've moved through different guided meditation courses or the one I
keep coming back to the most has been headspace and I think the length of the
sessions is good the fact that there's so many and they're all different with a little bit of different introduction is
really good and I like the visualizations that he uses a lot of the ones I genuinely do feel so he does some
about warm once so I'm filling up the body there's a lot of check-ins with the body as well which is nice yes it's it's
definitely definitely one of my favorite resources and it's free again as well you can get free trial so you can see whether or not you like it
meditation ups what's your two things just on what you said I think having thing you mentioned about having a
backup of the meditation to fall back on something else that I do with the with the habits TRUCKING is hot wok every
habit I do as a scaled version because I think having being able to maintain I think the psychology of breaking your
streak with something yep it's really negative again negative thing like because you've skipped a day
you're less likely to do it again the next day is that how got that wave of you get the catastrophic thinking right yeah well I
think my face again I'll finish the packing exactly whereas if you meditate for five days in a row you're more and more likely to hit the sixth day seventh
day yeah seventeenth day yeah meditating I think I also started of headspace did the zip
1010 take ten yeah it is a great introduction I think I've since moved
away from it I fraught from what I did I don't I can't speak of what it's like now when I was doing it I feel like he
made a big deal about you know it's day three you feeling anything yeah yeah yeah I feel that it was like you've done
100 minutes of meditation by then detective take ten you know that's enough to change your brain and things like that and I remember thinking I must
be doing it wrong because I don't feel any changes I think it vastly a lot of the apps calms the same soft ride and
some of the Karma subscriptions they've asked the underplay the time it takes
the investment it takes to actually get to the point where you're like okay I'm really great I can feel some change from
meditation so that's what I said I see why they're doing that like if they just delivered this negative like guys bubble
valve you don't know me I don't never know if you don't have an hour to sit down you can just [ __ ] like unless unless you've got at least 200 hours
like what's the point you know obviously that's not going to get people to subscribe I don't buy in no it needs to
be inclusive I guess is what so another one Aubrey Marcus has done a fantastic guy
that owns on it he's done a fantastic course called release into now and I think we've all done have you donuts
come you haven't done the full but you've done a bit to that is is the meanings if you've done yeah if you've
done a if you've got yourself into meditation and you've realized that it's for you or if you're looking for a new guided meditation I strongly recommend
that you buy release into now probably the nicest most complete meditation course that I've ever done like that's
not speaking from a massive pool both options and it's in high enough doses as well as
two minute session or an hour session over there that's what makes you stand out I think yeah yeah you can't mess a
balcony there's no ass graces ya know so very much agree with both of you that
headspace is a great intro to meditation if you have decided the Dennis you are
somebody who would respond well to it just to quickly touch on that you mentioned not everyone is a large
minority laughs AG you mentioned that before as well yeah what's the how I'm
sorry I've never met meditated before how might I begin don't don't decide straight away some people are not for me
right and probably if they're deciding early on it maybe probably yes that's
what I find so interesting young people like Jordan you know how how do you arrive at that yeah you've got to give
it a solid shot at 1500 hours before you start and actually if you find it really
challenging and really unpleasant that's probably a sign that you should bring it again and if you if you're like well
actually are me I'm able to do it but I I get more out of a physical practice or
with it then you may have a different sticking point and we move through different sticking points as we evolve as not as if we have a static problem so
right now my sticking point is the body it's not the mind but that's just because I've now outweighed my physical
spiritual practices by I've outweighed them with the amount of meditation that I've done so which is a [ __ ] man how
much just to give cuz again so scale like I I think I've I've slowly tiptoed
into this world the doors were opened my [ __ ] me oh this is [ __ ] cuz I you know you do a hundred minutes enjoying idea
I've done a hundred minutes how many well this is now away just before I say this okay I think the criticism that you
said of headspace is really important that it does try to kind of push you along and be like oh you know this is it
it's the ten minute abs Beauty blaster Hamdi or the meditation absolutely 100%
and so as soon as you have to add the intro to meditation from the guided attention now move away from guided sessions you
they can be they can be done as a crutch a stabilizer yeah but really if you
start moving beyond it then you can start to make some progress but I think the analogy is that if someone's been sedentary on the couch and not exercised
for four years Charlotte Crosby's at home who you asked to work out the ten minutes on DVD is not a bad start
yeah gets them off their feet yes and then yeah and so there is a tendency
when someone's like oh I'm gonna start meditating it's like okay I'm gonna get a nap it's like the app isn't the thing
the practice is the thing so do whatever is needed to establish it to be clear
all to get by it right yeah to get by and get practice on it and I'd say we read a book on meditation that there's
many very accessible ones by monks the the best one that I found this is well the most accessible one is mindfulness
in plain English by Hennepin look around to know us like just because and as it
says on the tin it's like very clearly written gets by in and teaches you the method very clearly and doesn't give you
too much more to sittin ruminate to think about as you can imagine a lot of monks that are writing about meditation
can go mmm d-ring them doing what we talked about it's fairly esoteric because you haven't
realized you can't get that much and I think it's better to save the esoteric knowledge and wisdom for your own
experience because all of the stuff that they talk about that is very esoteric comes from the deep states that they've
achieved in meditation so you may as well achieve them yourself rather than read about them and then try and imagine
what might lie yeah yeah exactly okay so let's do you still use an app for meditations during that but the app
is completely minimal it's just a black timer use at the time you say start will stop
that's insight timer right insight timer now I do use a little crutch which is a
the sound of a wooden clave every five minutes just like okay gun stock at the
time so me I was gonna ask you was someone who someone hears that I've done ten in ten mm-hmm it's take time right
I'm not sure okay whatever whatever it is you need to take both sides were in
the arms without a leg if you've ever heard ugly protocol before you'll know exactly what we do there's any sounds
side of the road cars game there's a
really small chance that you might be listening to this
so you've done that you listen to Andy say and you're trying to do it
unguided so I sit down for ten minutes mm-hmm all I think about is emails
shopping Netflix there's stuff that floods your mind and I go to the end of
the ten minutes well I have a long I'm trying to do and it's annoying it's frustrating like I've just sat there and
thought for ten minutes yeah do you just persist with that or in that instance is a guided session so I mean
to bring you back yeah I think if you're really [ __ ] then you need you need guided sessions which have the only
difference there is that you're still applying the same method and I don't think I think pick one method dig one
deep hole rather than lots of shallow holes but the guided session will just
give you frequent prompts and as Chris said the progressive overload element of it is less and less frequent prompts
until you maybe have a prompt every 20 minutes or every half an hour or whatever the back end of most of the
parks if you're doing a 30-day pack on headspace the back end of most of them will have Andy introduce you set you
down and then it will be probably about every five minutes throughout the ones who don't know yeah
you will never get to the point where you sit down and you're like oh that was incredible I was just I was so focused
for that entire time like the whole if anything do start so for anyone who doesn't follow us directly we I've just
come back from a 10-day meditation retreat where did sort of 70 75 hours during that during that time and the
predominant sense is you realize how insane you are you sit down they've got right okay
let's go follow the breath IV under my nose barely two breaths in you're thinking
about lentils or you think it yeah you just say it makes me feel so much better that that happens to you oh so much
enlightenment and so that the reps are bringing it back to the object each time
and you do get longer and longer periods but there's so many times where you decide in a long session and you'll be
like twice like the last and the guy
says like that's okay like mmm that's not yeah yeah don't judge your success
by I like the idea of Mentors I like the idea of the little Gong every five
minutes because I'm not like it yeah very subtle just like a clock tick or something yeah right okay so we'll do a
quick a quick little loop around what have you got it's like timer insight timer oh do you want another loopner
that's for yeah yeah I'll go again you know what muse news going deep in
meditation right so I got a message I got a message of someone on Instagram the other day after I uploaded a screenshot from muse saying can you
please tell me about that app that tracks your naps in the middle of the day it looks really good because it's
got about a neutral and calm in it Oh is he having an amputation having an
active nap what is that it's not just a wait I'm not sure yet moving I mean what amuse it is a little headband that you
wear on your forehead portable EEG yeah it basically measures your brain
activity while you're meditating and it translates the electrical signal that I
picked up into audio in the sound of either like a busy park or a beach and
when you are calm for extended periods of time it plays the noise of birds when
you are less calm they get the weather picks up it gets more noisy and basically you meditate through that
process and it then gives you a compa centage it's actually really clever how it work it gives you school based on how many birds he had
how calm you were how many recoveries you had so as soon as he sleeps I caught it yeah yeah so for me I'm very numbers
driven yeah date orientated and I love seeing I love being able to chart my progress i quantify exactly you're a
power that you were power lifted that this is life on percentages and RP as an accountant yeah so yeah I'm yeah so when
I heard about it it's like 250 quid if you me like free if you user I got the
18 film so I was sat in the car on the way to work as an accountant at the time
and Paul Mort was the first person who had ever heard and he was like I've got
this headband and when I do really well I get birds and I was like right yeah
it's fantastic and I use it I've used it I've done over a hundred hours with it there's no verified birds or when you have a sustained amount of
time with lo with lo brain activity or calm you both start tweeting as the I
found the last aside I also got a headband all three of us have gotten johnny paid full price for his I got mine brand-new but secondhand on eBay
and you see flash to get his for free by shweta hero and Sweeney is an interesting point who do you think's had
the most benefit out of the news headband from the three of us of the head but definitely not me after this is
Ron sang - I paid full price you know I think most of it you've racked up so you thought it reduces the cos here because
it was free use it right fine did you
use it once I see what you mean right isn't it correlated to how much you spend for it what's the scale but I'm saying I like
benefit yellow benefit / price which is infinite but yeah but in that place the price is irrelevant if the price isn't a
factor in it there's no way it's irrelevant that's it I see your point but the total amount of benefit and so
if you if you have to if you quantify benefit by saying I was used rightful are you then I win yep I just
Camille just literally agreed the you definitely did with Johnny posted a spray the other day which is it's fantastic
isn't it this morning which was how many it was the his score basically comparing
a few weeks ago to now on Muse and it's unequivocally better and it's amazing is then if you are numbers driven in your
life I'm not fully sold on whether this is just a waste of time with us it's all one big prank it's again it's it's sit
and listen to my breath across my mind yeah well you know our so easy to podcast on this yep on the profane
podcast about your experience and I said I raised you know what if isn't it all just a load of who was said before give
it a hundred hours before you decide it's a hundred hours you are never getting back yeah if you get there exactly in a load of bollocks so having
some way like as a you know anything else you do like whether you if you were saving money every month but you never
looked at you savings be pretty dreary existence like you see if you trauma lose weight that you never realize your
good example never measured your weight and there's no way around it and this is why you need buy-in because it really now oh here 450 hours a my people said
you're pretty convinced unequivocally you're asking if you're asking we come back to stay and train here right
because you definitely feel better while you are meditating because you have a
level of calm that you wouldn't have when you're not meditating I think getting a trait change which is
outside of the meditation is affecting your day-to-day headspace for lack of a better word that's a lot more difficult
to elicit I need a lot more difficult to measure and interestingly I'm noticing the trait change now but I'm less
interested in the state change whereas earlier I was chasing the state change yep just because it's really like it's
due for a penis if you want to find out a little bit more about what we're talking about here a couple of podcasts that probably do you very well
sam harris nearly as various yeah this is ham so with he was going to it ah to
goes to researchers in 111 i don't know much about cast episode number hundred
and eleven of sam harris is waking up podcast through the two membranes bulb ask on I'm gonna love that would
actually be the word titties [Laughter]
Audio mom Tigers peeking send all of them popping peas right so let's do one
quick round result there's the quick simple ones yeah quick quick simple ones let me think
about a quick simple one Hey I hope my quick some put one ready for you guys need some time go on that
go sir I stole this from Chris Chris is probably going to think of this one so he'll be annoyed now but this was from
the founder of WordPress Noah whatever no I told you Bertha's yeah what is it
look so you set your trackpad speed oh this is such a good entry and then you set your mates trackpad scroll to the
opposite one of those is correct and the
other one is not the other ones being nasty yeah good to me you know where some
people scroll the correct way way I thought you're gonna explain the trackpad we're doing it quick circle
scroll the incorrect way Minotaur Youssef scrolls and then everyone else uses the Apple standard settings and
Scrolls the right way right way so speed up your trackpad incrementally say self
reminder now every month for the next five months
speed up trackpad speed by one setting if you do that in five months time you'll be at the maximum setting that
you can get to so that's the [ __ ] approach but the lot that was the [ __ ] approach your approach was put it
directly to the fastest why it would overshoot for the next three weeks as
you fly around the screen and control computers having a panic attack
I think I'm just go Bulls in anger the ones I couldn't have maybe you're like peoples yeah okay well go out your fries
where if you track where they are put them with a I'm what was like what was the argument that within you you become
10 percent more efficient in every task on your computer it's hard to say whether that's happened
but it does feel yeah because when you whatever even now you're limited by your
trackpad in a way that you can't comprehend so I've got an analogy everybody here has observed their mum
tried to Google something they move the mouse down to Internet Explorer and
you're like ah it's like even Internet Explorer and and they type www.google.com type Google into the
Google search bar and then they'll move the mouse up to the edge click sometimes
like yeah and then move them ask to that little triangle at the very bottom right
press the down button yeah you're right
that's the best argument you've ever given real free for a month accidentally right Johnny Europe um this is it going
to be a very specific one to people who film themselves training okay which is might be a lot people might not be very
many people for a long time well so I did power lifting and for a long time I
wasn't able to film my set while listening to music so I even got went to
the extent of buying an iPod touch to film my training so that I could
continue listening when you're doing like a wander at Maxell another media monster which is a an iPhone app lets
you video while listening to music through the app which was like honestly
Game Change [ __ ] game changer for me while I and I remember it so I saw it on Bryce Lewis's Instagram story Bryce if
you're listening thank you for this but I remember because he posted a question saying like what camera should I buy
what camera should I buy to film my training so I can listen to music at the same time and someone was like matrices
media monster save them how long until your music library in media mods know it picks up Spotify unbelievable yeah our
game changer I thought you have to jailbreak your phone no no no picks up and you can even set it so that it's
there's a song that I play all the time for a top set and it's just
whenever I press play media monster that's a summer place that's also mmm it really is that's really cool right to
media monster media monster I think my last one is going to be my fitness pal
now I'm not going to go through everything from my fitness passes you can use it to track you calories your
color of caloric intake in also do it to track water intake as well as even a water bottle but if you are not will fit
better up what a logged water logged is it that's a really really really good
name I'm gonna [ __ ] why didn't we think of that along with the log lets you take photos of the water and then photos of
their like the fluid you drinking such as that kind of coke yeah and then you should press that and it tops up a little human to the amount you taught
your targets the for my photo full version as in you take a photo lock the
quantity so that when you're logging you just press the photo of the thing you rather than like I've had eight cups so
that's like alidade my horse-pond at my favorite start for logging your weight if you are not prepared to spend 80
pounds on the winnings scale its fair not think it's a no-brainer spec policy you know you're never gonna
win that continue I haven't bought a winning skirt for most of these things
we've all ended up in the same camp now whose headband we're all using like some
form of sleep art so there's it we're all evens that I see something that I think is valuable and I go out and I pay
for the recommended retail price for it youssef then acquires it in a snidey way
for free and then you get it through some mate who works for the night dissing up a discounted rate I'm not
that thing is a really representation of everything that happens absolutely every
when you're over six-foot life is just a little bit harder all of that benefit
you got of being able to call yourself tall I have to bend down that a little bit further
no but you everyone else is like told you're tall aren't you nice and me and Yusef kept called short us because we're
under six foot but it's okay because you gets a free because we are not paying our RP it's all of this
the failing is mine for not is it again for being so why do you like solo well precisely
well why this oh well I'm finally the same reason why Youssef gets angry this
is - time travel again the reason you have got angry the guys using Word documents I'm that guy you are yeah
Youssef excellent goes absolutely not there's gotta be a way around that and I
go well words on my laptop so I'm gonna use word that's the price so I'm gonna
pay it Youssef looks at it and thinks that's not the price it's a proposal what I
might have to say yeah mmm thank you very much thanks for your time I think
we see you life hacks 3 coming up soon excellent we've got so many more splendid many
more many many more hi

Transcription:

this is because we've done it lay on a red horse man we're gonna do that we're gonna fill you full of blue Smiley's
that we're good this isn't tonight it's too late for this
okay now Louisiana get whatever you want mate yes I'm sure got these simple healer in there as well just you treat
this as well to try anything to make you
feel if anyone's a youtuber sweeties got more money that is Lord to do with no he's robbing a brand new hat this
morning would you dropping them or saying walk dogs dropped in the morning me you almost looked at it you owe me
some that I found out today you've got hurt joggers they've got semen and blood on them as a diet as a picture
no the Gospels oh man select Brittany say is the sentence correct or not Paul
has a pair of joggers that have got someone else's semen and government that's correct that's right friend but
you say it's it's a sense of fact though yeah but it's it's the cover off the Metallica album the one it's like a weed
graphic me only with the details details details we've got different islands
didn't he have some lucky
[Laughter]
I'm just saying you either by order by
about 15 seconds you should know this but no [ __ ] major fire safety at old
hope what the difference between phone and what was the difference between phones a lot better
walking Swiss Army knife between
survived almost any like like
your Scottish version of meat recipes
and anyway she's bigger than it's or nothing today
so basically she's like just hammering all these sponsors
basically with you yeah so I guess by
way of introduction what would be probably quite nice with Lisa here I'm gonna guess how the three of us are
on the table you've been involved across the longest yeah the long we saw me an important and probably Tim so can you
tell us a little bit about your introduction as well yes I started back in like 2009 2009
I did like running before that so for about six to eight weeks before monie
cross managed to do my long-distance running so not super long distance at what you did but um like 10 miles half
marathons things like that yeah but basically I had like a goal that I wanted to achieve and which I did
and then I just go so he's ruined the greatness of 120 and so I ran it in hell
I run it in 120 but I was awaiting on the whole you know I was like 70 a lot smaller and smaller than no smaller than
Oh Sode imagine but so I did that and then I just I was just bought of it really
that kind of obviously training for like that sort of distance he had to put road two miles in its me at the time yeah so
I just got bored saw something for something else to do so I was messing around there like kettlebells and stuff
and then I read an article which if it wasn't like men's fitness on men's
health what you're like 2009 mm like late 2009 early 2010
so I read an article in I think it was meant self immense fitness about the 300
the the and the 300 guys yep how they training CrossFit we've mentioned it and I thought what's up right like Google
CrossFit and and just fun goes to those two gyms and the Northeast so there's
one called CrossFit northeast England yeah which is just up in there working for you and then it was cross the tank
side yeah so um I went to both of them across the North East England the guys
were great brute was just too far for us to travel yeah cross the tines how he was pacing and no shield so it was a lot closer that's what for me so I went
there and after about a year not even after about six months I came the by on
the gym so I ended up buying the affiliate just through circumstances obviously at the time it was a lot different to him but it is now something
is like no equipment like literally like one bar jump on the plate and some cattle wells and some mutton not was it
something cost a long way and that was it yet had bought up and then just kept on training and kept on me kind of
trying to grow the business no we moved to Benton and we had a money
Newton been and they're not the kind of interrupts well intrude on what falls in the saber back in like 2013 moves 2040
Paul came on full-time and has like our head coach yeah we booked us for time so it so and then had to be him since then
so for me really by God but I got into it back in 2009 and started trying to compete with 2010
and then just compete it all the way through that and when you say stop sort of started competing you mean it was I
made it to regionals like however many years but it was a lot different than also like the first year that I went to like
the wasn't in Auburn so it was a sectional slightly you just put your name on the half either region paid and
you put your name and a hat and you turned up and competed so there was no qualification process you for the
Senators like this is kind of like a like a sedum would be for a local cottage yeah yeah so you basically paid
him money you rocked up it was like three workouts in one day and then from there it was
like the type of time there was three sectionals so it's like one in the UK UK
and Ireland then there was one in like Western Europe one Eastern Europe and then all those three was three people
from each I think went no sorry 20 people from each went to a regional and then from the regional thing that was
three people from that then went to the games and then so this was before the old I was 2010 yeah and then after that
2011 that worth looking on so this was like pre open so that was the first proper Competition Act it was sectionals
so I think it was twenty qualified for regionals and I think I was kidnapped I first had just missed out on tuition was
that good yeah and so you mister take me to taken to it pretty quickly yeah well again at the time when it was
super low skill so like not yeah that 2010 was the first year that due to the silks and just about politics came up to
work so I wanted that competition I did not just blah blah so it's basically stripped like strict pull-ups and it was
booze we had one on the basketball court was like in the middle of a park yeah
it's like totally different to what it is now when I'm at a stadium makeup judges and it's all online and laughter
it's like completely different world yeah so back then it was like literally just on a school field in a pod it was
cool we talked a lot less polished yeah it was just make it up as you go
huh trying to get it in before my dark soap all over you actually some of its bits in and Jordan in the sense they're
probably the 300 yeah that's probably a very big moment for most people and fitness when it all wasn't CGI I think a
lot of you know matapedia Jarrah but this formed the basis for a simple business and he
wasn't even really did they prosperity him same so I've been that I kind of
watched a film I'd already realize I was pretty over where and I've already started trying to let go of all budgets
and things to try and change that and as a result going to the fitness side I like got interested in the Venice I'd
lost quite a bit away and then I think when the 300 went like you know I don't
know whether it was in the internet all the DVD extras or something like that there was an interview matt white he was
jim jones yeah at the time he did it and he started talking about functional
training and functional movement and training with cow bells and ropes and sleds and all i can it all that kind of
stuff so from that and I actually bumped into a friend one night a guy called Finn he was doing some strong run
training kind of with job and at the time all in the facility Sylvia yeah in the same facility and he was
like ah man I was like a cowbell seems like oh you should come down try this gym so I kind of went on the
Internet so I was run by this little kid who's like doing double unders with an infidel teacher I was like okay I'm
gonna I'm with her right I'm gonna go see what this is about drop them a message and and that was it
went down and got through it through like a seven-minute workout which like ruins life time I asked ollie like I
signed up the next day signed up there and then actually I was like I put the money in the bag
this is the movie had the money in my
bag there and there now literally it was just like I'll pay per month and candy
just went went from there again like like he says I I eventually it was kind of got more involved he was really
involved in the compare side yeah and I think like he says like it was easier it gets the competitive side of time and
even I did okay in the first yeah it's
like the guys got more interested now I got more interested in the coaching side I didn't listening to the max whites and
reading and all hosting class so yeah I just kind of kind of naturally wanted to go across that okay I we program for
people so we just kind of like his he grew as an athlete I kind of just
focused more on the coaching side I interested me a little bit more than being an athlete personally I wanted to Train I wanted to do it but I just
wanted to I was interested in how things work together and what we're doing so how are you some minds a bit of a weird
one so my friends started it just started doing Crossfit in a global gym and it's garbage so I started just dealing with it right
tygo I'm joined in and um I was like 18 at the time since 2012 yeah it wasn't
really much going on like we couldn't do any wall balls we couldn't really lift heavy you couldn't go overhead
especially his garage if it rained couldn't stop so we've never done a wall ball or snap tree
we've done some clean but like horrific cleans and then he started to open his
own easily then we kind of traveled from that Teesside every now and then until
he opened up his own 2013 k times up for uni and from that
bit like history yeah so she started training try and train twice a day between uni
between choose case even there then I'm just humble Estrella yeah got one Paul quite well did my level one sucker train at my
friend's gym back home yeah then the air off there just kind of stuck hey that's
right it's at the coach time site every Wednesday yeah Wednesday and I understand a little bit with Paul on
Monday symptom Wednesday Cynthia Wednesday's yes I died of the narrow you just kind of like you just kind of call
coach for me for a bit video and it was like okay Wednesday's Wednesday's already I think one of the things that
struck me when I started was CrossFit as managed to brand itself so effectively
and I think when anything's that polished there's an element that people have got that makes them feel reserved
about something you know the the style looks so good that the substance can't be up to scratch does that make sense
the people sometimes a little bit suspicious when it looks and using the tag the fittest on earth like it sounds
it sounds impressive and also unbelief listen yeah yeah so in your opinion are cross the athletes the fittest athletes
on the planet now I do think it I do think they kind of print like trying to produce the fish on earth in the sense
of it's such a broad broad spectrum and it's the only thing that's really challenging or testing this broad broad
spectrum there isn't anything else that is if there's no go around isn't it yeah I think they look around a bit and I think the people is producing who
are like you know pretty damn awesome weight lifters I'm pretty dumb we're pretty pretty strong power lifters and
can run man can run half-marathons yeah can do all of that stuff I mean there just isn't a testing like you're talking
about a terribly atomic EFI to last not this year ever see what you want with the air before like did the CrossFit
Games came second and then went can't be any real the Olympics [ __ ] unless you realize that enjoy this thing yes
come with it at the highest level in two sports within two weeks of each other she hasn't chosen peaked for the work
for the Olympics you know like Dave
Castro just right what can I do to make me feel like you want to die yeah so like when you look at it like that from
that point of view yeah it fits on earth but it depends what you define for yourself because you know nothing if the
definition of fitness that CrossFit is used seems quite appropriate to me yeah
like it's worked pass of you across broad time and modal domains right yeah yeah I supposed it based on that
definition of fitness and I can't think of one that's better like they treating my area of expertise or petros of terminology you know you
could have like you know you can add new semantics or whatever I even beyond these people who can just delve into it try and pick it apart he's just making a
point about you should be very tired oh man it's different a lot of different law domains different movements you know
different plans of movement functional stuff I mean that's pretty I mean it's pretty broad I mean it's a broad
description and you can argue it and you can go into it and you see people a lot of time trying to pick it apart I think
that's what it is I think the main thing it was like there should be anything that you can't do yeah you know me like
I think that's where the broad thing comes and I think like with Dave Castro obviously other games like he's
constantly trying to test up and then it like blows the lines of like competitor
in terms of you don't deserve to be the fittest to be the best at the sports or like what I mean by that is like Cameron
in 2000 whatever when when there was a pegboards he was on the paper smashing himself trying to get at the top and
failing she just rested she was about she knew she was but she wasn't gonna make it you took this on I is like yeah
rest yeah so it's like that lots work and you got anything else she's not actually the face because she can't do
it what you want so you only mean it's like Rose goes mine's a little bit I
think what's interesting watching from there open to regionals to the games is
that there's actually a lot less CrossFit that goes on the higher up you get yeah it's a lot more CrossFit II at
the local level than it is at the top level yeah at the games as well that's so
unlike look II obviously for that for the open and regionals in some respects
you're pretty limit of what you can do was like in the open you can't expect people to be like carrying D walls and
run up hills and stuff like that because I just can't how can imagine like how can you make a run at you if I what you do within those
four walls and with kiss as well and then regionals it gets a little bit more kind of out there but still I mean this
year that like the deep walls but in the past it's really just been dumbbells barbells kettlebells Ram Ricky yeah
ropes you know what I mean and then the games it's like right any sense yeah hey yeah yeah I think what's the new with
the new arena I think it's only gonna get like more I think the starter or anything to get better because obviously
the map from a little yeah it's nothing nothing it's gonna get even more different things I think it will drop
down as well I think will feed down to regionals a little bit yeah I think the swimming is going to be in there pretty soon more on objects and it's kind of
gonna challenge everything oh how have you care about that does care originals I said 1930 heavy nikitos two
or five I think each one so at 93 it's having one and a half beats no one wants to pick though so this is press fracking
you'll be shopping though yeah numbers
actually the exact same and I stood back for life oh yeah but you won't get started yeah
well so anyone that's tried CrossFit has done a few of the workouts like hey
regardless of whether or not people like or don't like cross now I don't think anyone can deny that really [ __ ] hard
like it like this some of the workouts that want to ng world I'm I'm really
interested in that we've got three guys who understand the physiology and with the standard training methodology as
well I wanted to see if you guys can try and explain why CrossFit is so hard
like why hurts doing a workout to the level that it does and if you can try and take us through maybe some of the
workouts and what it is about there that just wreck your world because obviously people can go and run a marathon and
they can come out the other side of it and maybe the next day they're out there aches and pains and it's not new that with during a marathon that's a lot of
people would perceive you know a pinnacle of realistic yeah local level of fitness like you know if you gave me
the option of doing that or doing a couple of the really nasty hero workouts and like give me the marathon you know I
mean because all the way to use it I don't know I just think because it's an honor it's just should be okay maybe
know me but do you understand mom I know what you're saying yeah thinks I'm like not from like a science he point of view
Tim's probably best to do that he's not with the degrees degrees bad memories
put like from degree to Omega from like
a practical point of view I think it's like so there's so many different aspects on it so like same with a
marathon it's one foot in front of the other that's it like if you can keep putting one foot in front the other even if you're walking it you don't even finish
it yeah where it's like with some of the woods some of the hero workouts like some of the stuff and that's pretty
challenging so for example like a lot of them are combining movement saying that
a normal person in the gym wouldn't combine so I like this one called mr. Joshua which is like runnin and heavy
deadlifts and then ghd's helps and it's a pretty simple workout I think it's like five rounds 400 meter run 15
deadlifts at 1:15 and 30 ghd's it's like it's a world beater it kills you know
it's like the extension of the deadlift and then the deflection of that and it's
like through a full range of motion and then obviously you're running after that so you help with breath coming in
picking up a moderately heavy load and then jumped on the GG set which in itself is a pretty brutal movement like
it's a massive range of motion and it's not really something that a lot of people have done before anyway and a great way to get rhabdo but I think
those types of like combinations of movements I just brought just Brule you
know it's the same in fact there's another one called bull which is like a mile run 50 overhead squats I think at
6,200 double unders and that the 50 pull-ups I think like all that overhead work and then double unders and then
running into your shoulders gonna be tired on that and you're like so think of the squats it's like the combination of movements are just bro
throw a line with like the attitude of the environment you're in as well even if you're not training with other people
it's the environment that you know other people of doing this workout will handle is what so you notice times to beat the stars to
be you're not going to drop you fall and you meet your running pair so you're going to keep the intensity diets or psychological aspects of it throw it in
with the sort of like that competition environment you know and I'm not saying
that the competition is good or bad and people are comment about that but it is you will maintain a high level of
intensity to not work out as a result of like external factors it's irrelevant whether or not other people in the class
are doing it there's a heritage of other people that also is a hero exactly
someone's died they say that's like paying you're paying tribute minutes a
hero we're gone even we don't believe in that type of stuff you start gonna go high so think you know the reason I call
it a tribute so CrossFit this new Lawrence but you went out doing that long run against somebody you're doing
it against your previous Scott you know you're in a 5k going to get your previous score doing it against Timmy
and it's super wide running get and leg Johnny and you do it up off when you're doing in case during the hill or like
the sixth day and so your intensity is going to be high like your intensity on
that 5k you would apply yourself but why appeared argue people that were informed
and meters that I think I'm right in saying that 400 music quite commonly known as the worst running distances yes
yeah then you've got to go pick a bottle up yeah right okay but my point is that if someone's got the exhaustion or 400 on a
400 movements like obviously you can add load and you can do all the rest of the things is it is it the combination of
movements is that what makes it so terrible it takes it yeah with the muscular like let's put out there as well like
newbies go anaerobic quick and trying to breathe when you go out of row but it's
not gonna hop excellent miles so you just go really hot and hot right to
through the reef try and hold something on the front rock compressing you breathing and for you trying to breathe
when you had a row of it it's not gonna happen like Jordan these they can master it pacing he doesn't go out of robic at
any point all the road yeah it kills me so he saves himself like oxygen flowing
through his body it's not restricted at any point so he can move throughout it
whereas say your first session yeah I put you on the assault bike to start off
with yeah you're probably gonna go out the Cape pretty hot yeah then you've got your deadlifts then you got your burpees
yeah yeah do you know what's coming well I think the thing is he told me you
don't even know what going on aerobic means yeah like it took me six months to find out that you're supposed to I'm
right in saying you're supposed to try and right unless you sprint you're not finishing right dribble on the other than yeah where everyone will be freshly
yeah right okay so what for anyone who needs advice on how the pace what is the
I have a threshold and how definitely the wrong patient like so I was like
yeah I bought an aerobic net in a wall so what happens what what is it that causes you to go on a road with and what
is it so I don't anaerobic is literal definition without oxygen so your body
doesn't have oxygen so it's trying to contract the muscles here in there so this it can do this is what you've done
too much work is a shorter space it's yeah and yeah now working instead of being a roaming which are more efficient
yes yeah you're not being the presence of oxygen now you look in anaerobic so you basically don't know you're in emergency mode
Yeah right here so how is it why he's pacing in how do you do it I think a lot
of it it's like knowing what you can do so like in a lot of the open workouts
people will be like with me especially possibly go faster go I'm like no I'm Nolan David I've got on my pace
I don't wanna go at your pace I'm on my face because I know on this place and go hard for 30 minutes yeah 40 minutes
whatever it may be yeah if I go a little bit faster now no that's the workout like let's talk let's
take what 17.4 is at the dead with one yeah the 55 mean you did that I've got a
funny story about this that I'll dip in very quickly I got off the 55 that list
of 100 hundred two hundred two kilos yeah and you programmed this me earlier
in the week Vinh Phuc there's hundred two kilos and then straight out of the walls I've chewed 55 moles at nine kilos
and I broke on the wall balls at 32 here you're going to you 28 29 I was like oh
my god we just allow so much like go
past do not paste ahead of Jordan exact idea
so yeah you were saying in that so it's like like on those deadlift Tom chef did not work out before the three times
before because it was a repeat that did it twice in 2015 I think it was 2060 and
then I did it once in training on the build-up to the last year's open yeah so I did not work out and I knew how to
paste that work out so I knew that the $55 million in the certain time the 55 I'm not very good at wall
balls so I can push a little bit harder on the deadlifts and paste it on the wall and then the classic thing with
George's trips people up which is one thing that where I was trying to communicate across to people is the roll so like on the rower you could sit I'd
say like 80% effort and pull say 12 and recoveries on the omelette on the mono
1200 calories so that might take it let's this is not the exact number that's it degree minutes our fault
that's it takes you two minutes 32 roll 55 calories yeah or you can sit at 95% effort and have
enough 1400 calories and finish it in 250 but then you need to take 45 seconds
after I have a rest before you get on the handstand push-up so it's like no one we're pushing weight or not yeah does that make sense yeah they'll be
like certain movements within a workout where you can go hard on my max basically and it's just through
experience just like anything through experience of knowing where pushing weight relax so like in that workout that's actually
quite a good example to use for me personally so the deadlifts are quite from floor with obviously small like
short range of motion the wigs not like heavy it's quite to moderate and the walls kill me I'm a [ __ ] and a tire
target the roll not great ass because I'm small and I've got small range of motion again so obviously a
continence the handle as well as someone who's taller and then the handstand push-ups are really good because I'm
it's a short range of motion again yeah and I'm white so it's like it's two out of the four that are good Intel for that bad and you
need to know where you go exactly blazing capitalizing weight Kong again with that too should be there's two others on that that you can catch your
breath more by going more easily on the movements that are easy to you you know and pushing Otago do this is this
just like like you've gotta find it for yourself yeah yeah this is like stimulus
like babes though based on like that's competing yeah you know like we do
workouts they're anaerobic on purpose yes because you were trying to trick train all the man's right so we've got
strength workouts we've got the power workout so we've got those anaerobic efforts the spring months oh I wanted to
ask this question do the workouts there in CrossFit as far as for why no split
up in two broad categories yeah break it down into three we brick probably break
it down into it for two maybe through them so we're talking like strength work so we've got like a maximal ethics
usually like a compound movement or we might train Olympic lifters that so
you're talking like you have any box what is the channel powerhouse Krim work
outlet and glycogen work Michael so there you go all right now it goes so
our anaerobic capacity work so these are the short shaft workouts so five minutes so three hands so more than bikes to
less than that even like five seconds to work why can't any work this is the remember this is just true yeah this is
just training so this is training adaptation so these are general Fridays when we put you in teams so when you get we die and what we like we try and force
you into breaking it down it does these ridiculous little spritz which really new yeah you know I've done it with you before a couple of times yeah yeah what
it's like I don't development I mean it just looks like camaraderie and good fun but it's actually an entire day
exactly and like the boiler in your team nah people in your team the more rest you get the more the more maximal your
effort give me on yet so the better adaptation we get then we've got the power endurance work so they have robic kind of like high in the robic work
which is more like your four minutes your eight minutes your twelve minutes like Helen it's like a wave form to me a
run 21 couple swings 12 pull-ups three rounds of time so it's a really quick nurse used to break really and should be
like Soviet minutes this is what we live sport as well yeah we so we call these [ __ ] like play across pit but that's
because in the open typically workouts are between 5 minutes and 20 minutes long so we've trained up some mixed
modality for like at five times I think there were cops five minutes cleaning jokes well snow there's so many cameras
we need like 2010-11 to visible and then workouts typically now like 20 minutes
kind of vibes these are where you're like 80% be working aerobic Li I think if you go into I never think in those
workouts that's when you've gone off too quick and you spend the next so is this one point when hazing would be yeah I said it would be okay but obviously but
then this you're not going to be pacing if you get to a barbell and it's at 80% of your warmer at max clean because
you're doing a sport that's you know they've still they're aware and I'm not like you know the top-tier athlete yeah
although I'm sitting you're gonna hit that barbell and you're not going to be tapping into the same net energy system is the big strong guy who's got 120 kilo
snatch you know you're going to tapping into something a little bit different the workouts and it feel different you know that's when it's like game all the
time and then we've got our aerobic development work so the pure aerobic that's our M Jane Fonda long workouts
kind of like you know the knee big long runs and things like that so we've got these domains that we're hitting all the
time so the SIP here thing is is relevant to where you are because I make sense yes and that's when we program as well but
what a program that we do we just have like a tick list you know just tick one
of those off yeah depending on the period elevation of the year now we're getting into the sport neck of the woods
with the open seven weeks away so we're totally by Cigna I did a minute work that 12-minute not 20
minute work because that's eroding people in but that's because it has become approach of the open now we're approaching for the people were working
with who with flight decided that I compare this yes they're the people whether like okay you guys need to be practicing your spot we need to be
working in that domain that you're going to be using because we get you to just before the open and we've never had you
hitting that high end like aerobic work and you don't know what that feels like
then you know you're going to go into the open the super revved up super excited on Friday night light so they were cheering for you you're going to
don't even I'm a big Jordan you're gonna get the Dennis before I before you hear it you know I think what's really
interesting pokey said there about the multiple body types thing and I think this is what for me makes it a really
interesting spec to explore that it kind of feels you know a little bit like we used to play Mortal Kombat attacking and
everyone have their special moves each each character had their own special move that they can see each character
was equal and also unequal the N different ways and I think that watching the games and watching it generally is a
sport and also even though you have the guys in the gym there's the levels of because the characters within the gyms within
everyone's a local affiliate that have got these how he's the strong guy is there but Thompson he's the gymnastics
yeah for sure yeah and I think what's really interesting is the fact that you have these people because this sport is
still relatively young they're coming to it from so many different disciplines that it's some people have got unfair
advantages in some areas that lead to chronic weaknesses another year I had something yeah so at the moment like you
know watching Zack George who is a you Catholic between exhorting local cops at the moment but he's [ __ ] huge is it
then he must be what 220 230 pounds big lad yeah you've gotta be hundred kilos
always tall as well no he's not got long link so things like handstand push-ups and stuff yeah they're not gonna be
great from I'm gonna put this out there we programmed the worker the comp II he was at last it was a weighted bar
muscle-ups with the vest yes I still cannot do one of these
throw that out there as well as fall for like six years yeah he's done one ever this this love
it put one on now it's to the side I was thinking it's not gonna make 9 on bro
witness best so that saves 100 kilo so that's 110
yeah strong boy so he was my point right that we've got these people that come
into the sport from multiple different disciplines yeah as the sport develops what's going to happen is that people
are no longer going to be transitioning from a background that background is going to be CrossFit yeah there's no
work like a under 14 this club enemy there's like a juniors at the games like well to touch on that like under
strength and depth earlier in the air with Reebok there was a guy young like that we compete with called Reese
Mitchell he went to the games I think he's in there for for 1516 age category I think yeah I think it came
second or third yeah legit like I'm ridiculous but it's 33 bomber slots are broken like snatches 70
kilos clean and jokes one on 560 like Luke when I was 16 I was like running
just running you know this kid's got like so much potential to get to where I
want to be but he's also so far ahead of like looked across first you only think about normal in James yeah
but people in gym you know someone in our junior snatchin 70 kilos and clean joe 105 pretty decent a sling you know
or pretty good capabilities is kids 60 so much of my swing like when he's my age yeah it's 25 well you got to think about
coaching as well like when I started at 18 it was just jump up he did I'm sure it's
the same with you guys more just go do it now the coaching above this guy is just huge bet like he loved a dedicated
Olympic weightlifting coach he's CrossFit coach your life programming on the side of everything on the plate for
him yeah which is gonna make him even better yeah I mean I think back to some of the stuff I used to make Paul do oh
my god I'm surprised to sell our life so this is something else that I wanted to really touch on so I've seen like some
throwbackthursday images and stuff from late 2010 can you give me a rundown of
some of the most CrossFit stuff or some of the most stupid CrossFit stuff you've done because what's happened now it
feels like 2017 2018 with the sporting maturity now it's the s like the sports
in maturity yeah and although that's fantastic because you can live stream the games on Facebook and it's it looks
like the Olympics and there's a I'm sure that there will be a full opening ceremony very soon it's gonna have to be
yeah they're not I mean like there's gonna be all manner of different bits and pieces what you don't get are the
mad funny [ __ ] mistakes yeah that occur during the adolescence sort of sport I
say I think we were super lucky we were super lucky they you know what yeah you met like you know the stupid stuff we
don't we did ourselves yeah pretty like I've been really lucky better be surrounded by a lot of really good people so like I had a coach called
Kyle stem and Adams like for I think it's Microsoft for off years yeah him engage now see both super knowledgeable
guys Island a lot of the stuff off them too and that has helped me so much like a lot like
one thing I was gonna say was I used to just think that more was better like the
more you did the better you'd be yeah and then I remember like volume volume
is king I remember like probably about six years ago now call said it was like more than that that was just more you
know intensity always Trump's volume so you're better doing less well then doing loads crap yeah and that was one thing
I've stuck me for quite a long time and but I mean I think back to some the stuff that I used to do like I don't
know how I did it but tell me and tell me so tell me some of the stupid cross mr. Ellison I did like all of the girls
in one day so that's like 50 female workouts just like Nancy on my Nancy
Kelly all those things did all in one day how much work volume was made too much second thousand pull-ups
like reading Solomon say 1200 like all day yeah that's just a different day this is just stupid by itself
yeah that was a bomb on my own I think that's very envious at the time did you
do what do you say I was doing what every hour or something whatever I can't except one every hour are the short ones thinking did every half an hour's like
grace Isabelle somewhere and this isn't this isn't it just fell crack literally
just because it's not a crack it did you not extreme enough to ridiculous number of burpees once did thousand take the
Sun every yet four years running tenders every year Christmas Eve you did a thousand birthdays on Christmas the
Christmas Day this bad Christmas I think let me look at the person may not accident in Christmas Eve once but fat
Clovis was mere Alex might do them half Martin rule straight into Clovis Clovis
is a ten-mile run 150 per people that was pretty partition 2197 2197 day they
got twenty-one thousand ninety seven years so that took like an hour and twenty five we did bring a TV into the gym and we watch God the galaxy about
doing it finished it but that was great but then when you go on a 10-mile and I've seen hanging on your ass because you've just ruined half marathon and
someone saw me running down the street and starts saying that you were you would well so I at the letters like like
about eight miles in and then I got to go [ __ ] me i sat in the office for ten minutes and they in there all of but run
back out it's working then got in the shower with wash our the old place just sat in the
shower and the hot water and then I realized I didn't bring a towel like a dragon self a blue roll completed stays
well I'm corrected I'm glad to see I mean some of the guys we went to Vegas my business partner stag do and we
create you know we thought we create the sit down shower they're working on I do this a lot of set up the sit-down shower
it would have here is so versatile yet yeah I need anything is applicable for Vegas
hangovers yeah for doing - throwing a stupid stupid CrossFit workout I mean if anyone is feeling bad at the
moment all they need to do and then there you can know looking that which is the live out shot weight needs to be
mace down face down base which end face down so you get enough he's not a level
of torture no face your face down fix time yeah but I'm sure that's fine it's
a great thing that's nice did you do you did you do one one hour three minutes
forty seven minutes it's I believe you could have took three minutes up like that's the slowest I've gone I've got
like I've got less bit every year
coach advisor yellowest yeah what's all this Wow stupid thing I've ever done is
uh trying to do a clapping strict on pushup nothing strict hands up there but
I'm sure that everyone can imagine what happens when you don't make that element
of risk involved I'm pretty sure I lost an inch pipe would be lucky I think like
injuries and stuff in the job of being minimum minimal yeah we'd be like the CrossFit just got a really bad name for
like injuries and stuff but I think it's like anything but any training gym I have pertaining to any commercial gym
and show you the loads of crap Petey's who don't want to do it people went Frankie left right and center they say
was CrossFit like the will be coach is out there that all Korea what you're gonna get out and everything we like to
think that work what what decent what good you know obviously there's all those things that we can improve on but
we try and do our best with everything the thing we do a good job or agree it's
just it gets a bad name through so it is my sort to pounce on it someone who's not being in the sport for a year and I
did around about ten months ago so just as he open started after I've been doing
the two months I went did a podcast with the guys for proper fit yeah and we kind of reassessed it everything from there
yes and really tell you to call this mantra
spitballs I think you should dam and rename a podcast we just did you know
anyway so I went in and they as bodybuilding and powerlifting background
you have a bunch of questions and you you are right that CrossFit gets such a bad rap and we tried to dissolve now why
it is that we think makes CrossFit first so polarizing in terms of opinion and
then kind of what gets it the bad reputation and we can't win number
conclusions one of them is the fact that I think a lot of people that go in the gym now especially you guys are in bludgeons they're conflating an interest
in exercise and sport and fitness with going into bodybuilding they think that
the only thing that they can do is to go in and do the curls and do the rest of it because that has been the prevailing
training methodology for the last thirty years and the other side of that which
makes it super attractive is it's got mega low barriers to entry so bring us back to my industry it's like club
nights if you have a thousand pounds and the DJ and a venue that's prepared to let you in you now have a business you
know you cannot go and start the new iPhone with a thousand pounds of announced active so anyone can I since
then you know where as you can go in with a PT for five minutes in a global gym and you can master a souvenir bicep
curl to 80% of the standard if someone's been doing three years can do so when
you go into a CrossFit gym and someone says right okay we're gonna try and do is snatch and yeah is such a technically
complex movie that the Murrays to entry is so high that people's egos get shot
down very quickly people don't like to go and do things at that matter right they don't want to go in and have but do
something that's difficult they're happy with difficult but within the parameters of not necess yeah yeah feeling like it's unachievable
I think a lot of that comes down to several factors so first of all the person's attitude we've got an eagle
cross was probably not the right support for me it's about an eagle whether whether think that they should be able to do everything that's never gonna be
lifted there's people who just do those two lifts snatch and clean and jerk they spend their entire life getting better
at the snatch in the collegiate from being a verdict for effect so how does Jimmy who's 53 in an accountant so he's
gonna walk in and be perfect that's not to knock out you've got except that you're never gonna be you're never gonna be perfect like I've been doing what no
the eight years now my clean jerk and my snatch still proud you know I mean it still needs work everything does you I
think that I think that that's does what's interesting the fact that I think there's across food documentary for my 2014 yeah and I can't remember who the
narrator is a tempered citizen voice up from Dave Castro where he says that very very soon we're gonna see someone who's
got like a 500 pound deadlift in a sub 5 minute mile and this is the listener this and that it and he was explaining
this the fact that the sport in terms of progression for athletes reaching a ceiling is still yes infancy which I
would absolutely agree with well yeah I think the that was one of the first
things that I was like I think that it gets a little bit of a bad rap from some
people because he's daunting because there's a sensitive elitism associated with the people that can't do it because
there's a little bit of jealousy and this is there's a quite rightly like if song can walk into a gym and do a Muslim
and you've been training bracelets for six years and all you can do is a really well
controlled controlled eccentric on a seat it's like shoulder practice yeah there is an element if you think like
you look people look that looks good yeah that is cool and irrelevant of how you look you like that looks like that
looks really like and you know it is for me t to look it cross there's a training methodology last year if you told me the
star the year that I would've seen the progress I've sought physically from a bodybuilding program
yeah I told you a lie yeah and I don't know exactly why is that was the
difference because I've been training to ten years before that run about in varying degrees of cerebral innocent
games wrong an awful lot but you know I mean you the enters away in your heart and you're going you go in and lifting
things moderately regularly you try to eat some protein like it just gets bro science and Muslims yeah moderately
better as you have towards a little bit and I think what was interesting was that you now have formalized progressive
overload you're a formalized amount of intensity like you have in a basket all of the
things that everyone's trying to achieve on the other side of the gym in any case yeah I think what our gym in particular
is quite a good example of it because we have obviously like three areas large of our global gym on a regular two of the
box and those are boot camp area which is like you know it's like it's like CrossFit button CrossFit like not as
much kind of yet it not works like complex movement so you know we know it's all pretty simple you know not all [ __ ] way to clean your jokes not doing
King muscle up sinister laugh but if you look the cross bars look the best they
do the lads a big the shredded a jacked and they're not doing bicep curls like
the guys in there and in the global gym but they look the best and ultimately that's everyone's cool
it almost looked good there said the guy who was sneaking in the bicep curls and the Bevin of what like too much bench press for the guy who was still
crosshairs of the guys who come in and their soul King comes to snatches a [ __ ]
you literally go up to them and you're just like dude you big body building up in you and you're like just a little bit
that's always the same thing and that doesn't mean they can't become compatible you knows a lot of people who
are doing that now and that's like the new trendy thing isn't it like everyone's like functional values you're looking
look at look at fruit strengths through body I just think as well on you that's
like the evolution of eyes that people have started to admit that the fact it's all K again to say that I want to look
good yeah yeah because I think all that I CrossFit and like people working their way through CrossFit I think a lot of people were yep I'm quite nailed on yeah
and a lot of people were like don't look good but fit the new or I don't look great and i think i think that i think
now what's your front i think about a lot of people would say it look like maybe a door need to be maybe i'm not
going to be like a retronym and maybe I need to just step back on the volume and I do want to just look back and the Sox
you know honestly when I still want a train and I think they don't want to actually be able to do the [ __ ] you you were able to capitalize on the
methodology whilst not wanting or necessarily but I haven't have the competition like outside of necessarily
a class like within a master class and be compared I was also like a common misconception I think with CrossFit everyone thinks it's competitive it's
not no it's only competitive if against yourself is if you do a crisper loosen
and give a big lakes it's gonna be I'm only joking I'm gonna be proud but not of you if you want it to be competitive you know when
you seek out making make new decisions you can make it competitive but if you just want to turn up train and go home
it can't just be not as well that's why we did all that people look at why bother right yeah and that's why we don't force workouts like the night
before because we don't want people being like it's like turn them do the class yeah that's it no I know each
other things work out in I agree so yeah I think I think what's really interesting is that you've got this
you've got this training methodology which appears to be producing guys that have got bodies year round they're
better than the physique competitors or at least on part the only difference is the fact that then maybe need to go
through like to step on stage if you have to take this need a walker James call scum
so when Lauren came to train with us like what 18 months ago she'd never just gone for back of doing all the bikini
stuff on stage she's in good Nick something wrong but she was lean but she
was like weak yes a week weren't you no idea why she is now she leaned all the time she's lot stronger
yeah she looks Jack yeah a good way yeah you know like she looked better now when I did there and showed not you can do in
a physique for now look it look it so I'm like done baby like if you peeled down baby down a little bit and did or
two and Digger two months ago you won't have a hard two months ago you just sell me some so you step on stage it classic
bodybuilding yeah you wouldn't step what you'd be too big to step on the stage magazine yeah and you like I think I may
not people are like that and this guy is well renowned as the fastest man in CrossFit the most in terms it's like
straight line speed or a short other things the mill means a still cross there's lose your games yeah like do you
know I mean which is so here's the thing right this is what we drilled it down to there is not a brand behind a push for
leg split no no one hashtags which puts more legs today like in the Instagram
thing and people love to hate on something that has an identity yes and this is this is what we think and it's
different as well is it is different yeah like it's it's definitely high visibility
yeah you know I mean like people can see when you doing it rebo meal
but people love it because it's cool yeah it's good but it came from as well
the whole thing like it's like they totally call the wave right I mean they be doing it really long time but with the social media thing yeah so they did
it all of all that websites when all this went online thinking you found out through like a chatroom or whatever
I found out through I just went online yeah put chat rooms in support I myself
also office Suffolk but it was your office all this for the government but and off the back of that that means that
a lot of people poor stupid [ __ ] on Instagram and tagging across better you do I mean and then all of a sudden that's the stuff that gets the attention
yeah you I mean not the not the thousands of or care but mediocre like Lord it
snatches that like people have done really well on our pbteen or improve that technique but the one where alas gets a ponytail car in it gets dragged
across the gym now I do really good job I think of bringing that perception of
it back around so they're not really on kosher calm now post in like elite level
CrossFitters that post in your everyday across Paris yeah the Pope seem like I said Jimmy who's 53 it's very inclusive
is like by eight hours and then goes and does a little work out that that's what
the books now so it's making it it's showing people that it is accessible and not that it is achievable for them to be
able to like go and do a class whereas in the past it all needs to just be games games games games games nothing
elite elite guys and then again look at what we're talking about now they wouldn't surprise me in fiber turning a son could you see there being different
drivers of CrossFit gyms would there be ones where you've got the guys that are probably compete kind of rustic physique
do you know I mean like CrossFit hounds and stuff or maybe classes though you know you guys read my proselytize side
of got going club right yeah we know which is like a sort of hypertrophy based eight to twelve
fourteen rep kind of but still using the methodology right yeah and still kind of like compound be functionally it's
definitely less functional you know you pick stuff up off the ground
yeah around you curly you'd waffle up here your buddy who curls for now yeah
just girls I mean it's an arm wraps its
massive community there's gonna be people in it that you don't like are people whose opinions people don't agree with yeah I know and whether you jump on
board I mean I can imagine Pete it's some pts I mean not so much now you know we went because in a weekend cause
that's always a big deal on everyone as if the city of the personal training course is that [ __ ] difficult either do I mean like people just pick up on
these things at all well they bought with up a gym no yeah I was like yeah we opened up a gym or Jordan or doubled up gym and then we spent the next seven or
eight years going on every course we might be single coach like traveling like working with people we're gonna be
the high level to get where we are do you I mean and you know then you did a level whatever PT couple years ago and
you're still joking himself over it like step out of your box me a good point is
well pause which I was gonna I was actually going to mention earlier on which is reminders of is like with
CrossFit now there's so many different like certifications that you can do the certification where everything yeah does
not mean physiology certification is the winner from certification this you know kettlebells nutrition there's all this
stuff that a lot of cross the coaches are gone and do it like I'm not saying that there isn't there's not many
PT's who work in the commercial sector without going away on weekends and doing extra courses but it's a better level 3
yeah you stick that actually spending I think I think the I think the fact the matter is that most of the most of the guys
that are doing a PT stuff have got one thing on the minds and that is I need to maximize the money I can make
ready yeah how can i how can I get as much as there's need for as little as possible I think that's going to be
anyone in any job there's going to be other people because that's like saying that the keys are bad because like there's some incredible we're looking up
to where people are across the coaches who really could have been incredible pts yeah but you know we're looking as
well that they're around us so the more our combined it about what we do yeah they know that we've got our jump and they know that they've got their job
yeah if I wanted to go do a physique type thing or a bodybuilding thing then you know those are the guys I saw
getting coached and slice you know I so boy and put in you know that's people are gonna be good in it whatever they do
and I just think you know you can't God's prophets got a brand it's easy you
just tied one of the needs like I know this without the bands are push-pull leg your right and then I've sunk into that
get a date on should we just put it down there should we make one of push/pull legs there that's just up or on the
tables buy the domain now it's get it ppl ppl dot-com I'm gonna guess that a
typical CrossFit memberships probably somewhere between 50 and sometimes a month well it depends when lobbies okay
so you said that's a good thing to say so I we when we first opened down I'm she before we quit now daily quit
yeah because times have changed or offering more service there's more competitors where you know we're still we're still reasonably priced within an
investment in the gym you know exact my point is that for so that even
at the absolute top end like even if it was a hundred pounds that's three hours of PT yeah yeah and when you think you
seriously going going comparing everything yeah exactly every day you know this shouldn't sing like
sort of CrossFit is the end that the only solution to the problem of trying
to get yourself in it but I do think that there's a number of elements in that external accountability a level of
intensity that you do not get when you stay in the gym and then the main thing for me or one of the main things for me
is that when you see a global gym now having being in a CrossFit side for so long you realize that someone's stepped
in with Jim but the headphones it on the wrong even if they've got a training partner the headphones are in while they're doing the snap they start
looking in the mirror themselves yeah lifting weights steeping
in their own neuroses just wallowing in it and you just think oh wow like it
doesn't have to be this way genuinely does not have to be this way not only can you achieve more in less time that's
exact say it's the time don't get in and out and I'm 50 my job public is in it in and out within an hour even like
competitive athletes that we have at the gym they're not and that's one more than like two hours to enough hours maybe
have a push you know like I've watched people in our
gym who come in and train on like the global side the benefits rounds yeah what'd you do three hours it just say I
don't know like it seems like there must be a paradigm shift coming soon as far
as I'm innocent and I think one of the things is that you have the z0 that I don't even know what were you ever what
is easier exactly I kind of know it right okay like the county feels this
vibration who was an Aussie fitness model yeah dude who's really charismatic
a big YouTube channel I was like [ __ ] cool guy shredded bit but was come the
the ultimate bro you like the tiny nothing with it within that even but
this is this whole sort of not like Nike bodybuilding.com forums like he ran his name on bodybuilding.com at forums and
there's me and all the rest this stuff of bits of pieces suddenly died actually like five years ago and but that was the
beginning of like the aesthetics roll era like kind of coming back around as
well so as well oh it is trendy to be in good shape now do you think it's like like you can
have a jolly show as much as you want thinks I'm totally shot all the odds on that good with Nick now everybody wants
to be in good shape it's trendy it make you cheap but when you look at clothing if you get muscle pick clothes yeah or everywhere the whole I think the
parrot I think you're right isn't the paradigm is shifting but not just in like Fitness in like culturally as well
look it's now Frank want to be out of shape absolutely absolutely is so I think one
of the things to bring that back around again is that those guys that were watching Sears and were like part of this whole like tiny short string event
long back like Mozy and dancing on the beach nothing wrong with our gathered in Gaza
[Music]
flick down fired up you'll see you find
someone but every video and so you had this you had this kind of era of guys
that was me right so that was me 20 to 23 years old that was me that with those
of the guys I was looking up to dance the training methodology of reading stuff like T nation bodybuilding.com
and all the different bits and pieces like that and then those guys now as far as I'm concerned you get to your late
20s and you hit a fitness menopause and I've been saying this for as long as I can remember now you start to realize
that being leaner all costs is not the only goal in there yeah and you start to
think [ __ ] chronically away ywír of my own mortality is over here as I reach their ear like I need to be able to bend
down and touch my toes yeah I need to be able to get upset stairs without being
out of breath and it wasn't so long ago that I was reading stuff from guys they're doing comp rap and stuff like
that almost take pride in their lack of fitness yeah yeah and they're like oh do me like I put my socks on this morning
after arms yesterday and you like dude like that is that is that's not
something to be proud of I'm glad that you understand you're wearing not like a badge of honor yeah but it is your body
telling you that you [ __ ] it either like I did it I enjoy trying to get fit but when I was in Globo gym what didn't
anything about Fitness I didn't really have the guts to go speak to a member of staff David Dube is he speaking of the
girls or the Jew stuff guys the Jew stuff guys were just doing their own thing I was scared to walk me in the way tell ya like it was it was
terrifying and though I was in on my own the only thing that had was a copy of like reading the net waiting for the next issues of men fitness or men's
health to come up to read and like try and figure out what many be doing sure I mean it was like that wasn't social at
all I was pretty lonely one thing why I think like CrossFit does so well is because like you accommodated
and you get told what does you you're not having to go in and think what am I gonna do today I'm gonna do back in arms
I'm gonna do yeah sure there's in legs or whatever it's like we come in you get brought in you get warmed up so you got
give me specific warm for the class that you're gonna do you then get total you're gonna do Shore movements you get
run through the class everywhere it's a high five and they're out the door like all in an hour so you're getting you're
getting that mega high level of service and you're not having to think about it I think that's a big that's definitely a
big deal for me that you can talk yourself out of going to the gym an awful lot yeah like you know talk about
it what are we January seventh today like a lot of people will be in the party already broke in the New Year's
resolution they'll be in the midst of like first week down [ __ ] like this
isn't as easy as I thought it's gonna be too crazy on fire now probably if the problem is this isn't as fun as I
thought it was gonna be people probably trained on Mondays still yeah absolutely
yeah so I didn't go like Quito basically
just ate no cops but I wasn't eating the strip in advance
in fact I was basically just eating protein why [ __ ] you gotta [ __ ] Gotha
Jordan Wallace golfer mega fat [ __ ] I mean I was rock a bit of a dad bod but
I was wrong like super dad bod so I was like Brian I'm gonna sort out Jamie first I'm getting done sort of came in sorting
Timbers on my nutrition Tim Paul doing my training and then I was like right Tim I'm on detox getting sword so that
was Tuesday by Friday I was like Tim I'm awfully sorry I trained on Wednesday and
Thursday and that and Friday can walk just like broken but totally broken just by not
eating enough food so um yeah muffler detox detox is a bad man yeah
good does it see again with that like I want to do another another podcast that
we focused solely on this but we can touch on it now about using performance as CrossFit being able to use
performance as a metric for everything else that you're doing in your life
because your performance is mitigated by all of the other influences the app yeah
if I you sleep when you die on your mood and you rest and your mobility and yet everything is tested by it yeah whereas
if you're feeling under the weather like I had that stomach burger to start the
week and I went in easy yeah I had full-blown yeah we get one
saucy all right that's right yeah so now spread that spray and you go in and
you're like this is a really quite a lot harder driver feels like so much we haven't as usually but if you're hanging
up your ass or you hungover or whether they say use your hangover is a really good example if you if you're hungover and you go in you have to do a class
you're going to know that you're over the only over you have to go in and Dubai's by surprise and apps on like
exaggerated body building cetera you can just dial back the level of our course efficient example wherever you need and
I think what what's interesting is that if you were to do if you use CrossFit as
you were growing up to just judge how you get an on the rest of your life I must say even all right yeah it's my relationship with my bird okay like
because my state of mental health when I get into a workout I have these net like a lot of negative self-talk that comes through is that maybe because I've got a
little bit the negative a home at the moment or when they're stressed at work because works going to bother whatever it is
like you use the performance as a barometer how everything else is going which is really really useful as opposed
to going in and going light I look to the Sun Lena today I never got two
percent leaner yeah and I think one of the one of the key takeaways for me from CrossFit has been externalizing your progress
yeah externalizing the progress so usually what would happen like you could be doing a cut through a physique
competition and wake up one day 10% lazy right ask you're right
wake up one day attempt somebody flat and be in a bad mood and think that you
look really really [ __ ] put to 2% body fat on and be in a better mood three
weeks later and think if you look good I think what you're saying there look Chris was just is cool but all those things are like subjective completely
subjective where is it CrossFit was totally a bit subjective like it is it's completely and you know you can actually
look at the numbers these numbers there that show you that and that's where they open that up there yeah exactly
exactly like you can do the open and 2050 and come you know whatever like say
top 10% you do it two years later if you cover top 8% guess what you've got
better like it's why we do and that's why we do these benchmark workouts in the classes like Helen and Fran and all
these things because you can see that you're getting better and it's you know nobody can lie about it if you've got
three minutes off so you got five minutes month one you do again 112 on your three minutes you got two minutes
better it doesn't matter what they've got a bad day but an arguably missus you've had a Burger King whatever you've
got better like and you can't tell me that I haven't because the proofs in the pudding it's there five minutes three
minutes they go in underneath where is all the stuff that you've mentioned like about deal lock any lien and you know
the guy any bigger it is really very subjective well that's why I think it's that's why I think it's so unhealthy and
it leads to people having jaded ideas
about what they should should be doing with regards to the training yeah that is so subjective and then let's take it
to the nth degree say you're going to do a competition you're then externalizing that's subjectivity yeah because it's
Alonso on is objectively bigger objectively leaner because its aesthetics which is very nature
subjective yeah and you think well that to me just leads to like I'm not surprised to so much [ __ ] anxiety
yeah like the it studies the cookie cutter for how they create anxiety and
so on I don't know if I look good enough I hope that I do yeah you can see on there Johnny normally if you if you know if you know
that you can deadlift Sundance or knows you can deadlift 600 pounds a deadlift ladder comes up there top weighs 600
pounds he knows that you can pick it up yeah okay there's mitigating factors on the
deadlift so would you rather be sticky
or itchy sticky sticky sticky sticky at
least you're sticky you've got you know religious then just eat junk could just get worse yeah it's you're only gonna
your own asset stickiness where CrossFit restart unwrapped scratching we're going in
exactly right okay would you rather fight 20 duck sized horses or one
horse-sized one horse-sized the damn right 20 duck sized horses you know I was the
absorb it easy I want a big don't one big BB fresh duck sir really does not a
small I thought I just got four legs what [ __ ] wait go go for is little legs straight in there like a [ __ ]
kick 20 horse sized dogs all over the shop as long as he stayed below your
anaerobic threshold you'd be able he's gotta face it me you gotta came to spread about follow them follow them any
23 Imam three well three a minute every minute doesn't it yeah how are you how
are you gonna attack it I've got parent willing good how are you going with that's the way ago right how are you going to attack it though what do you what's your strategy with this
horse-sized do your agent if you got big
dogs or the other wanna see the bingo why do you make me zero I have to fight
this do what circumstance clues there I would probably run away at 30-second intervals for the one outfit it resting
tiger out a bit but you can do some pause stop horse
tiger out it would get its massive it so much muscle that's going to get how I'm
gonna guess the products are you must be like wait when you cook what are tasty there's a lot meaning that those going
lock dick to be fair not so much money you get my horse I don't make a wrapped with a day
then little pancakes you gonna be loads but you need a whole cucumber knee drop
just like the second tortilla ah yeah cucumber dope either side know what you
think but many kids Tesco is doing those Hausberg isn't they so naturally a
miniature like no money to be made there anyway there is would you rather be able
to attract any lady you want by wearing a special magic fedora and saying the
words milady or be able to run five times your current speed but you have to put your
arms behind yourself like panic and make airplane noises I do the bathroom Oh Sara yeah I just first rep you think
yeah but you can have to go five times
what's supposed to Fred some which you will indiscreet to the lemon or airplane
noises is worth talkin babies I mean that's gonna be you gonna be quick imagine beating everyone in the gym
every time on every wall but it looks like you're taking the pizzas oh yeah
can you imagine right if that actually happened and there was a whole school of coaching that you came out of it
yeah other people will try every night yeah yeah Finnick pullulan all over again do you think that it definitely
seems looking for me outside in the specialists don't you never see well I
mean looking like Matt Fraser for example like his first and like 2 or 3
years of CrossFit he wouldn't a lot of competitions but he also didn't do very well in a lot of competitions because
his things played to his strengths you could dominate but then if things didn't he was crippled but then you saw what
he's done is he's taken that and he's basically worked at those those elements in the singularity to make them a lot
better so you spent a lot of a lot of time on the roar a lot of time that I did it to get better at the sport
it's all transferred over into CrossFit I suppose the fact when you're talking about programming is that there's
already a model in place for how to become a good role yeah we become good within each of the four areas of fitness
I suppose other categories within which the workouts go into is how we get good at deadlift in how we get rid of all of
the different bits and pieces so really the programmer doesn't that
that's not anything special in terms of specialist that's just knowledge deployment like yeah read it read it and
boots inaudible point it together yes I think it's like okay so you got that then it's like okay so you've got client
taking a typical like a standard person we've got period idea so it's like where are we going to focus on those single
aspects and how we're going to progress through the year focusing so for us we start the year with like hypertrophy and
move mechanics cuz we believe in quality of movement we'll talk and you have to do veneer after the orbit quality of
movement joint prep because we're going to load you up in the next cycle and we need you get strong you know quite far
away from the competition which we know is like a rocket power and the best thing it's like then we're gonna load
you up so that's what we're going to hit you but also we know that we need to continuously working that Robert bearson exercise getting all these parts of when
they're suit together an important up there and then you've got the athlete who comes to use the individual well it's okay well where do they need to
bias this where do we need to bias this cycle or get this guy needs a lot more strength work so yeah actually this is
going to be a stronger future throughout it and where something goes in some it needs to come out so you just need to
balance the program is based on where that goes in direction for that that client and athlete or people are or as a
population if it's like a general blog or something like out the hall the gym so you need to just look at all those facets and say actually this is fine so
now we're approaching the open a couple of those blocks are taken up with spot now yeah because we're like we've got
three or four spot blocks but we've still got one block which is like aerobic power which is single modality
because we still want to be developing that that but we need to try and fit all that in with everything else at the same
time yeah Adams going and putting and pairing movements that are appropriate
it's like cleans and cleans and their weave like in a lot of workouts we were there with like a ring dip or horse to
bar on our bow also puts a little make quick pull lay dead look good hands down
for juice get lift enhance my push ups get it like if you if they thought I mean they might change it before if the
wimple has some push-ups in it would be with with that lift yeah honestly I am and all these other movements and yet always always like paired up with them
so it's gonna say dunno something to be em tuition what what are the particular pairings of movements that tend to go
together throws of those polyps those birdies while it doesn't because there bro it's a it's there in the same plane
so like a foster and pop they're in the same place for a trap front squat into
an overhead press and then a pull up as they pull up so you have in the same plane but then went in different
directions so yeah basically can't smash from both ends that's that's what's happening you don't mean that that is
what it is full an eyeful yeah roof it through squats matches and snatches a
Muslim or slopes demo just a little high skill high skill and as you pulling in
that direction mr. Joshua deadlift two extension into flexion movement some
burpees no it isn't just the bar all those different combinations it's like it's the way that the body is moving off
see anything with a burr be in if you're moving your body through the largest range of motion possible Liberty bone all the way down to the
ground and you're getting all the way up and leaving the ground to anything with a it's gonna be around if it's a
thruster a gun it slows you down to his eyes again yeah it's gonna be good so
what we're talking to bring it back to one of the points that I brought up at the star but wise cross I saw why does it look so much like the feeling you're
going through during the workout let's say that you're doing something like front which is 2159 of thrusters and
potholes yeah that I think the best times on the planets are between two and
three minutes for that right now I was like stop tuna yeah like I'm in 52 typically to be in a
box you probably put Y like a 10-minute time company or an 8 minute okay well we drop it down more like 6 minutes
everyone can kind of get it done enough she was super short space of time yeah providing the scale properly yeah
is it like because you love her in an awful lot so your heart rates high so that's one of the things that we
contribute to the pain I guess like fronting for like me for example now front doesn't really hurt that mouth
because I'm efficient with both of us that under pull yeah so like when I first did from I couldn't do 21
thrusters and Logan yeah so 21 thrusters and broken brutalised this now I could manage to 40 or 50 reps and broke me
I'll put the bottom don't don't call me on that but would you know like so it's not that bad 21 pull-ups might be my Mac set of
polyps now no it's not so it's like I could do Fran and let's say like 2:30
comfortably yeah but it's that little extra at the end to get it down like 210 or whatever same what was there much a
roller yeah which is what brutalizes it and it's that it's again it's like just the efficiency of the movie how well this if
you were to put that flag in the ground that which is being the workout you felt
the worst in and your entire across the career can you just want come to mind or Chrisman element okay so the worst or do
some I like the worst ones by far are basically being the final workout of the
Oakland so 2015 I was like a newer wasn't gonna qualify but I was I was
just outside of qualification for regionals as an individual and the last workout came out I was 27
21:59 thruster calories on the bra and thrusters so did on the Friday night and
then it was hard but it brutalized it wasn't that bad did they get on the
Monday got like 10 seconds fast step but kill this like I was literally spewing all
over the shop yeah after that same thing Buster's and burpees spewed all over this year's first
double unders spewed all over it's just that last workout is just so bad and I think it's like the culmination of the
holes five weeks coming to an end all the pressure and stress and all that stuff it just kills me like absolutely
what we saw I was watching you do 17:5 this year which was nine thrusters I
think this was it said thrusters thirty five and nine yeah at ten ten rounds of
nine thrusters 35mm this yes versus a point two and Iran saying he'd be due to
Icelandic girls I think I came like second in Europe on that only thing like
the second the second quickest in Europe yeah that particular workout yeah like watching that to me was just like I
don't know it was like there was another gear that I didn't think that people were able to get to reach with regards
to that's just one of those things but that's just a good workout for me yeah you know I put me do 140 kilos
quadrillions in it that died and happening you know what I mean but then you can watch someone like and you know
I've been don't even we've got the gym Sean boy can pick one for you like this no yeah it's just it's things that
people go to am lucky that the open tends to be ninety percent the time to things that I am good at yeah that's it
it's always it could be anything that as you start to move towards regionals the way to get a little bit heavier a lot more complex the skills get harder the
movements get harder the way to get heavier and it's a lot it's a lot you know it's not it's great for someone
like me but then it's better for other people mmm-hmm that must be difficult there must be some athletes than floating around who would be great or would be
good regionals in games athletes it's not just can't break through the open because they get the quickie but it's
the same thanks for you pop you can play something League who are great you'll probably go play in the Premiership but just caught before yeah
it's the season the season starts with the open like you don't mean like if you
can't get through the open there's a mile what else you get out because you pray either it's clearly a domain and without in a
bunch of movements nobody sit there going up on the strong guy yeah you're the slow guy yeah need a [ __ ] slow
guy get get faster get more efficient and moving you know the things jobs are all fundamental movements a thruster is
a squat yeah impressive yeah fundamental movements like you need to be able move quickly through them so if you look at the season as in I need
to get this to get to that the season isn't that the season is the open into regionals into the games and some
athletes know they're going to get there because they're already got like all the stuff in the back yeah and they just carried out further people I think
there's no point talking about what you would have done if you got past stage one should know what a cutter isn't yeah so many people post awkward it's a k-12
yeah the regionals but also although you can don't take it what you want but then
what people don't take into account is them like the fact that not regionals it is entirely different to do an end the
gym like you know you get your warm via warming up you've got me no sale next year like do you realize how
intimidating that is to have like someone who was the fittest man in the world at one point warming up on the Royal exit there's not you gotta contend
with and then you've got the fact that you've got to go in and sit and sit down for 15 minutes before you go on the
floor so it's like stuff like that that people don't realize that you have to do you have to be there time training I
can't do the money can't do the money on the ground like just get a coffee and have another milk or whatever it's like
Nana you will be there at this time you will perform at this time like enjoy
your American no installation if Castro for anybody you know what I'm saying you going on at that time that's it so it's
like all of those things it's it's the classic the instagrams fall training complete it's just full of people they
were like the originals what our context who want regionals what and say how would it come this that no you would have done because you have no idea what
the people who were there are going through and how hard then how hard that and harsh the environment is in such a quality way I mean it's like frickin
amazing to get there and to go through it all but you know it's the context is completely [ __ ] different let's totally do if you in Madrid you flan or
whatever are in Copenhagen you flan whatever they're you're in a pressure cooker of an environment meetings in
here to treat so yeah and everybody is like all out giving everything it must
be a very intimidating atmosphere to be in and I think what's active maybe there's an atmosphere but I think it's just very different to you know people
saying oh if I get there I'll smash it yeah you've got to get that first and then you can go and see if you can smash
it okay I think what's interesting is that there's the parallels that you draw between power lifting like if you've picked the way to good power lifting
before or in weight lifting or whatever it is you know that you can pick it up again yeah I think what makes CrossFit
such a good observers for is that you can see the narrative of the suffering
going on within the person during the event you know hey I likely see some you're on you've got such a short window
someone saw someone running deadlift 300 kilos at a local comp and they either
get it when they don't and it's bring Joe yeah like within a couple seconds got three attempts yeah and you like
write a book then you watch someone do CrossFit and the the spectrum from them
failing or succeeding something it's so drawn out yeah and
there's such a narrative that's attached so many variables in there yeah that's what makes it compelling watch it right
I've also done a very good job of like how the changed is falling away because like it used to just be it was a bit of
a [ __ ] show like everyone would just be doing stuff at the same time you know where anybody was and someone would finish it that will finish until
you win whereas now it's like this clear hair is on the floor why people do things so you can go how about least 15
reps ahead because they roll the belt and also like they talk about the commentators I always talk about the
game just like you've done front now you know when you watch them on do front again yeah you know what that feels like
you know what you felt like when you get that workout or you get those exercises and you can like completely relate to
someone who even if they're in a completely different level to you like or share up in that workout like that guy except me how the [ __ ] did he do it
five minutes quicker than me yeah I mean and I'm good work and but you can relate you can see you okay sure because you
even even if nothing else if you compare your compare alongside our person even if it's a different part of world and
like it didn't believe I think that's one of the views of the olden day the
work now is issued and every one person who just started two weeks ago to the best guys on the planet have to do it
and to me always seems impressively I mean how many people to deal with over half a billion it was like four hundred
thousand things not falling on that around either four hundred thousand people did it worldwide and the guys that came top it
Matt what all renowned names yeah you don't mean like Noah ohlsen is always going to be tough I'd like and you think
out of all the variables that are going on in life and he's such a wide net of things that can go on and it can go
wrong and these guys are still so dominant with what they do that you can give them
this time we air maybe it's well within their capacities or whatever because it's a it's a easy workout there's so
much further they're meant to be at the games they will do granny open that people that people not do well at the
games tend to do well in the open and do well at Regionals like and it's really
it's really a final round from the open the smashes the fittest people it does
especially now that the man who didn't like the heavy elements and the master used to all be liked and it didn't find
the fittest people because like for example for me in 2015 one max clean and I came like fifty three parts of the
workout first workout I think I came ninth the second one I came back 400 yeah I'm not fit it's not easy I'm just not
fit enough they go you don't mean that there's no it's black or white I'm fit or not and I wasn't so then I didn't go
that yeah but then 2016 came along and there was a heavier workout but it was blended with other skills so it was like
heavier work I happy a lift but with inner work out so it was a blend of your
ability to touch the ball double under and then wrap a heavy barbell and when that came out I was able to I still had
a terrible finish that came back hundred knees and Europe or whatever but I was still it that was still high enough to around meter then I guess the next day
something that's slightly less partitioned will weed out people as
specialists a little bit more active as well so the point I'm trying to make there was it found the fittest people
you know you complain about and go well it was a heavy work aren't prepared for it well know how to fit there I you
stronger my fitness was more rounded I wouldn't be known right yeah so identified a massive gaping hole in my
fitness and people find that every year you know like the dumbbells totally trip people up this year but I said you know
people spent all last year doing percentage lifts percent it's not super percentage queens 20 kilo dumbbell
master mom still hundred and fifty reps of the most natural broken people getting like 20 minutes on that first
workout people who would previously be in the regionals previously competed at a high level just got right on the bus
not sure what you do it's a muscle that's a massive everything you get messages like would accrue [ __ ] without
a barbell and I was already killed up you know it wasn't like 22 and off you
know flew you back off your boo-boo you know I mean get a group I think I think that what's what's really really funny
to see is that this the really isn't know where I hide is that now with regards to like when people have
underperformed like I guess bad judging like if you get absolutely nailed by a
judge who doesn't understand standards but that doesn't seem to really happen all that much and regionals and every games aside from
that like that goes both ways though I
mean you get that off your stuff as well yeah you get penalized first you win that nobody's they wouldn't we lose this is business right leg in the turn we get
what you saying is really right that if someone [ __ ] it did [ __ ] it like you think about the dumbbells like I'm right
saying there was no barbells even in regionals either well the only barbell workout in this year in the open was the
deadlift yeah and then there was a Scots
national someone's not yet correct the last three year yeah and regionals it was it was all done yet that was it was
a region regionally to the diamond Obama deep wall as well so I've had to put the ball in those heavy cowbells heavy has a
little emotion which is [ __ ] and he saw someone like Alec Smith who has
struggled all the games in the past when that stuff comes up that he's really good up blends his region bitties
brother Ben Smith he was like the first Mountaineers in 2015 because he's good at that stuff and so it shows you that
like even though you have to be good at everything if you've got specific things and you will excel in seven years it's why
someone like frohnen and Fraser was so impressive because they win year on yeah doesn't matter about the program yeah
they win you don't I mean all we do is with all these will win them our guys
very much look anyway we're gonna do this again a number of times but thank you very much for you time we don't make nutrition in
Reebok Russert I'm side Phillip North morning programming all those bits will be in the description and thank you go

Transcription:

so Dominic McGregor welcome mother wisdom Hawaii go to Frankie are you for a drive for you yeah if you could drive
down from Newcastle to Manchester in the Ray which is a typical British weather so it's it's crazy to come into this
office which is several thousand square feet and it looks like a labyrinth with sleeping pods and a bar and a fully
functioning kitchen with a chef in and all the rest of it and this is where memes are made that run around the USA
writes the meme factory oh yeah I don't I don't I didn't like that title it was
a gardenia and it just covers the mean factory which we are you know we we make a lot of of content here but yeah a
little bit about us so we started in the room next door with like a white table
which like the same one that we're on here there was thinking as it was far enough on for every single person and we
were sat and I think these are very similar to the white tables we had we thought there was a little bit memory
and we working in the room to start in
social chain which is in a marketing agency and it took us you know three or
four months to really find out that we're actually on something and what was different between us you know any other marks agency is we don't big communities
so we owned big social media pages from student problems Spa love food beef
motivation and we work with brands on them communities so I'm right in saying that you guys have got access to about
400 million people is that right yeah yeah the total combined reach across the
place for 400 young people yeah yeah cross the world which is we have followers in like Taiwan looking to you
every like who's got 400 million of anything it's just crazy when you find
into a graphic it's like ridiculous that's terrifying both sort I found out
about you guys about two years ago from one best mates have actually worked for you yep and what he explained to me about
social chain at the time felt absolutely groundbreaking that you guys have access
to the network you understand the platform yep and then you do the creative yep and for me I was like how
has no one come up with this before because influences have been around for what like 5-10 years
yeah yeah oh really prevalent yeah yeah I think I think the reason we we fell upon it is that and we we had influence
Student Problems
I guess book our influences wasn't our faces mm-hmm so we had to we had to fight it what was the first page that
you started off with student problems was it really yeah who started me you start you know way so I was I was a
University in Edinburgh and I went out one night but I honestly was like a
really heavy night was like awful faith its [ __ ] think you are I think it's exactly five years ago today no I think
I think I'll double check I think it was the 7th of February that's fantastic so I think is it went out and woke up the
next day and have no toilet paper in the toilet so instead of you know unleash
him that the shop was down the bottom of the street I could what about it so instead of going getting it I decided to
start to a page and tweet about my life who did nobody told up if I had no paper
yeah and then for the next couple of weeks just tweeting everything that I was doing listed up my life through my
eyes so like realizing how expensive cheese was for example which is very expensive imagery but will you move out
I love cheese and then just nothing like that and then it got to like 20,000 followers in the space of two weeks and
then Steve Bryant touching me because he was ruining the website which was like commentary for students okay it was
called ballpark right and he was kind of just doing a traditional not traditional
marketing methods by leaflets and nightclubs and yeah everything else before dates training with students and
took a step back of it and actually realize that so that social is where students has been in their attention absolutely looked on Twitter for
students shared problems came up emailed me we met in vodka reps in New York for
about an hour HR and after that conversation I dropped out University moved to Manchester start
looking at wall parking with him and then we built more and more social media pages to the point where we've got about
10 million driving traffic to wall park realize that you know what one day we're
going to get money from appetizers we could drive many people to wall park we've got 10 million people on social
whywould advertisers want to be on the website when they can just be on social media nations or directing car the
middle exactly so we start putting brands on social discovery that website travelled the world found more people
who run big social pages like Hana who run Hogwarts logic which is the big Harry Potter page yeah got them all
together put them in the warehouse here and and just we just tried to see if
Social Media
this was something and it was it definitely feels like it is isn't it mm-hmm it's great it's absolutely mad that you
guys are the forefront of a wave sort of social media not in terms of adoption
but more in terms of how its how the use from marketing is being delivered to
people yeah I think that that organic genuinely creative adding value kind of
content yeah yeah I think I think it's meaningful yes people people we as
generation and pretty sure everyone's got ad blockers young they're up top they're sick of telling being told what
to do by brands you know how our whole thing is now how brands can actually form a connection and care about their
consumers and we know as people individuals ourselves what we purchase
now actually depends most wrong what the brand says about what's rather than anything rather than quality rather than
costs instruments and so self brand with them exactly that's interesting coming at it from a club promoters perspective
because everyone goes out to a club event on the night and everyone listening all know you get tagged in the
photos yeah and then the next day the album goes up and they get tagged in them and that tag stays in your facebook
profile with the watermark at the event at the bottom yet and that means oh I'm a I'm a voodoo girl like I like this kind of music yeah and
immediately as soon as someone sees that on your Facebook profile they can make a whole bunch of assumptions about who you
are and about the values that you have and they're not normally wrong no they're not which is I guess the same
way you could probably do it free look at someone's YouTube history which is I
always say that if you go on someone's YouTube's just their videos yeah that is
how you find out who they are that's a really really good point honestly works just as well it's just a together history isn't public is it
girls on this is the worst one honestly go slot zero because a lot of them
murders and mass murderers and serial killers really yeah because they're just think really interested in my crime and
Social Chain
stuff my ex was like yeah try and find out all they ought to be detectives zero in for some reason
Fahrenheit and so you've got yourself into social chain yep is that where do
you when did you begin the actual brand or social chain when dude does yeah so
we are at wall park for about Steve Steve Saturday when he was in eighteen so he was doing it's about three years
out about a year and then when we saw that back to the investors we have it time out went traveling the world we
have who is this kind of talk of social chain we came up the name pretty early on when we sort of ballpark button it
didn't mean anything yeah and we got this is like social chain to chain of pages you know just
this this is what is our social change what's driving people to walk back and then we went to Thailand I went to
Brazil New York did it you know bit living life iPhone no not bad no we were
doing market research 21 Tony we'd actually spent some time in Silicon Valley do you do some work yeah we did
do some work yeah and when to the World Cup in Brazil which is called that's it that was really good yeah and but I
thought it was gonna be full of girls but it was the World Cup it was just full of bugs everywhere
Argentinean that which is cool but yeah well thanks for a while when 2020 2021
you got to resolve Sam expecting like something different yeah then we came back from that because one
of our clients who we were doing consultancy for wanted us to launch their new product okay
so we've launched their new products and they tend around the office investment well yeah so did really well got to
about four million users they invested and that's when social chant became a thing okay which was third in November
2014 so that's not long ago at all no talking about three now Fiorina not well yeah
three four yet show period that's crazy and to get from there to now accessing
Top 3 Favorite Campaigns
four hundred million people can you think of a top three favorite campaigns
that you guys have done anything that springs to mind of people might not yeah we did one most people know is we did a
campaign when we hijacked a billboard in Manchester and put welcome to that on
Wednesday and even have it signed for Man United yeah I was pretty well-known we've got some really cool things in most of I
like that we've done is a little bit more underground so we've done some really cool campaigns you Skype that and
where we filmed 2 grands doing taking part in super six which is pretty cool
it's kind of showing the use case of the app and then I think you know that's the crazy side of things we blew up a VW
Beetle super dry on Halloween right pray for that on Facebook like yeah is that
one of the ones were prepared to do okay I see it I saw did you guys do the one was it
pretty little thing yep yeah which was like it was that maybe a balloon yeah yeah I've seen I saw the one for that
yeah we've learned a couple things up and that's like one of the most highly engaged live streams yet ever yeah 2.5
million views about a million comments in probably a couple of hours yeah yeah I mean as soon as I saw that go out I
then saw ones where ice creams were melting in the Sun and people had to comment on what was gonna melt first yeah if that kind
of was the first foreigner yeah and that sort of stuff go out live so we were the first people to do
produce live streams yes so there's no phone up in live stream like the drummer
put off yes yeah yeah yeah you know German drum and central is just running yeah that's funny I was the first ever
use of live stream on so Toph was it really yeah well the first was accidental it was like but it's really good but like we were the first ones to
do a can orchestrate it yes planned produced live streams which when we do
Social Media Principles
more things up and did some quizzes but it's been that kind of like fast fashion space super dry whoo-hoo pretty often
successful so everyone that's listening on use social media to some extent and a lot of people will use it by in one form
or another to either raise their profile which is brings them some sort of equity back or like myself it becomes kind of a
little bit more of a brand and is directly associated with what your company is doing yeah are there any are there any principles
that you think that you found out that people should be using on social media because it's very easy to get caught up
in the air and this in a second it's very easy to get caught and distracted on social media cuz that's the purpose of it yeah but in terms of trying to use
it effectively I mean I'm gonna guess having a producing content that adds value
whether it's a personally or yeah actually I think I think and research malaria to like personal branding
everyone's really got to understand way of social fitness their life and it's like a short window for who you are as a
person so you reader if you want to so people don't want to do this but if you want to like use it to your advantage
and really like showcase you as an individual odd you know what you're trying to achieve in your life and a
journey you've got to just think about what you want it to Tyumen to come across and I think some people are on the other side of the
climb knows when I use it to if you things up to the friend indigenous I thought well yeah my mum does it she's
got one friend of facebooking to me is it and she she like will message backwards and forwards and send video
usage of it will be really heavy but it's be incredibly narrow my grands the same as you've got faith
likes 30 friends which is old family but every time post anything I get like 10 likes because I've got my mom my dad my
grandma granddad my answer it's like all right so you straight you're already boost it looks like a really engaged
post yeah yeah got it yeah I think the key is like really understand like auditing yourself and why why you should
be using it it's difficult once we say this we say it's from so I always feel like saying it's from someone who like
knows the world like I will go into the mob like what would be both being proved
Social Media Ethics
a little bit older it's very difficult for 17 16 year olds 3 understand to have that perspective yeah you know I agree
so I think one of the things I want to talk about today is the ethical use of
time on social media it's as far as I'm concerned an emerging topic at the
moment yeah I wouldn't say that it's been tremendously widespread yet but Sam
Harris and a guy called Tristan Harris who is product philosopher at Google did a really famous podcast about three
months ago he can find it on some Harris's podcast waking up on iTunes if you wanna have a listen yourself and
time well-spent calm is Tristan Harris's website and on that what he discusses is
the cognitive biases that are being leveraged by apps and by developers in
order to keep people's time on site and they say that there's only so many hours
in a day and that YouTube is competing with Facebook is competing with Netflix is complete with everything to try and
maximize the time on site so I wanted to ask yourself as someone who is driving
engaging content online which means that people's time on site and time on screen
will be increased do you have you got any concerns about this yeah I think I've taken step back
also is we are very humans or animals so
we are very influenced by like social and you can see on games like candy crush the way they reward their kind of
though the mid-levels with their hits and they're like you know all that is designed towards keeping people
addicted and I the strong belief that
from two sides of the coin really as a publisher people always conceived content it's
always been the same we've had the same issues with with TV to an extent not more of the addiction side of things but
the kind of I guess you have got smaller blessing with TV you know you've had
Social Media Addiction
people who have very sedimentary because they're always on watching TV but I think with what is the important what
social it's stage people again a younger generation these people a lot more
highly influenced and not as developed they're not as assured of themselves let
alone that their surrounding so yes I do feel kind of responsible in that
instance and I think more can be done to educate young people but again it's very difficult cause they're in a young girl
often it's interesting because you guys have got you've got the access yeah which is from knowing what the company
is about I definitely say that everybody here as far as I'm aware and the company culture is an altruistic one now if that
sense of genuinely caring about people's well-being is to the contrary of what
advertisers want I guess therein may lie a little bit more of a difficulty but certainly for me it doesn't feel like
coming into the guys who make global trends and social medias office it doesn't feel like I'm stepping in this
underworld yeah like people trying to desperately core young kids time and
make them feel incredibly self-conscious online and like desperate for lights and
things like that there's definitely an argument to be made I think that you know student
problems was born of a genuine care or a genuine interest in the topic could you
argue now that that's been monetized and it's being used as a commercial vehicle
but the argument is that you're still making content that's even better and is still providing the same
same end result for you yeah completely and I think we vacuumed his massive
responsibilities on the other side for us to be able to educate people so we've recently done a documentary on mental
health on student problems well we've been gone to Bristol University where last year there was 8 suicides an app
Suicide
year like I had very high number of suicides with some number one on the one killer of men under 40
yeah it is absolutely terrifying topic yep but yeah so and you go to university
to narrate the best free is your life and you know a lot of people a lot of you know students who wanted to get
suicide so we we have a responsibility from that side of the fence yes provide content which is
entertaining and relevant also to act as the voice of a generation where we educate them on life from the topics
that they really need to know about as well so yeah we feel like we've started to feel that responsibility a lot more
and I think the fact is that it's emerging right you don't know it's like
when a new drug comes out onto the market we don't with the side effects of it until it's been in circulation in a while yeah and the same thing with
social media that we only realized what it was and we it's still emerging as what actually social media is and how
all the different platforms work before you then move on to tech addictions yeah and then everyone's different there as
well ever has different relationship with it absolutely so it's very difficult to thank knows anyone so it's
like and I guess if you ask someone what their relationship is then always going to tell you is healthy they're not gonna
really like because of the thing is you instrument so high that real you know you run Instagram you call your friends
posting there might be no holidays to get the feeling that you're sat there at work not doing anything so that that yes
use social media but it has a bigger impact in your life than just the actual addition to the phone or that you know
that excite of things it has a longer lasting effect so it's interesting because especially with Instagram I read
this quote online which I thought was really timely and it base said that Instagram specifically you
compare the best of everyone else's life with the worst of yours yeah because you view your own life through a lens of you
How we evolved
completely understanding of all of your things you see you see the blooper reel and that's what sticks yeah because I mines a Teflon for good thoughts and the
alcohol for bad thoughts that's how we evolved yeah the person that the
Neanderthal the human that was living in a cave that decided that they weren't worried is the one that got eaten first
okay they were the least risk averse yep the ones that are risk averse were the ones so it means that we're hardwired to
think about things negatively and you're right when you see the best of other people's lives but the worst of yours
it does lead with a very very harsh crunch and it's funny in this space I think that influencers need to be more
accountable because they're create an unrealistic expectation of life which is more detrimental then as posting videos
of cheese on a page I agree so I think that's that's where I think a
bigger issue lies with the responsibility bad influences to to really like know the other ones are
damaging it because they're they're showing unrealistic well that's more if you're an influencer it's a lot more of
a surreptitious delivery of the brand message yeah because it it comes about
irrelevant of whether which brand is tagged in your outfits or what supplements at the front of your
training session or who it is that's paid for the video production or the photo to be taking it people don't see
that they see look at the condition of this particular guy but the ass on this particularly oh look at how a site in
the holidays or cheese on a boat again on yep and they always all say and through their experiences and they've
had hard times we're not like probably having it mate I may be doing it just this custom and probably have but
they're having working influences they've got quite easy life they don't know stress I just didn't know straightness and they they painted an
unrealistic expectation to young people so there's maybe there needs to be a code of ethics that influences should be
thinking about using when the it's tough online yeah I think I think so I think it'd be interested to see the
Influences
difference between so wanted to follow influences and someone who doesn't follow any influences absolutely let them search things like Emil out or a
holiday or like an outfit because if a girl notice a lot more in the female
States because they are the ones that not to sound sexist or anything but they are marvered users of social media for
certain types of I mean it's just you're you're exactly in the position to know what the stats are yeah yeah yeah
exactly and to handbook they were private users in them if you compare the girl who dis employing
influencers versus someone who does for influencers and you ask them their ten favorite brands you probably get a very
different answer I agree and then probably satisfaction and like you say you're going out for a meal yep and if
you've previously in the days seeing that someone was it blue marlin Dubai yet one of your favorite influences of
blue marlin - by having teriyaki salmon and black cod and surrounded by million
pound yachts and then you've gone out on Valentine's Day to somewhere that doesn't fulfill that expectation you're
right it's it's not not tremendously positive environment at times is it yep and these are people you never you'll
never meet and that's that what they're making you feel through in your relationship it's ruining friendships is
ruining everything it's making such so I
think anyone so if you've got affiliations with influences and stuff like that would you be I'm gonna guess
the answers yes to this but you'd be maybe pushing them to think about might be a little bit more mindful with the
content and trying and difficult because that's their livelihood as well say
you've got you've got a great balance and I think I think it needs to be something that comes iconically from the
influence of space they need to realize some of them need to realize what they're doing would be nice wouldn't it
maybe that maybe maybe that happened over the years maybe so moving on to another topic that both of us are really
passionate about I want to talk about your problem with substances that you've had over the
Problem with Substances
years could you give us a bit of background on that yeah it's always a fun story to remember yeah I guess I guess my life
started like so that anyone else's you know you go to university spend three nights a week drunk is life then it was
a good night out my so I think why not why not why not I used to finish football training at telling go straight
to I not know RJ glass and the max wins yeah yeah they're still they're still
doing it he's still killing it like it why not if anyone's going to wedding Brooke why not Michael what eight years in a row I think it's one like that yeah
Monday nights that's the one it's got him there are suddenly it's complete redesign yeah
let's go in led the room to is LEDs LED walls it's fantastic anyway so yeah I
live a normal life and I would describe myself the reason I think it's you know problems was successful it's because I
was just sheet average student I was completely straight in the other line you know I'm not got a privileged background I'm not I'm not from I've got
very middle middle of the road you know representative yeah everything's about can relate to everyone so that's why I
was a successful because it was it was just what you'd expect the student to be like and came to social status chain and
and you know what we we had a very a lot of success very early and you are what
age Ramona I'm 21 21 this point C 21 and a lot of success and a lot of spoken
Lincoln and really no responsibility to anyone other than yourself and a lot of
spare time a lot of selves bedtime but you know units and that's art so you've got a concoction now of four elements
which fuel really a lot of partying
because you 21 the hedonic lifestyle right you get the means and the ends to do what you want exactly and so it
starts out like that it stop celebrating you know that we've got some big client wins we have a lot of success early on so we all go as a team we've spent a lot
Cash Flow Issues
of time together having meals it is a genuine eight at first it's celebrating its this is fantastic and you know first
flash 14 years a year into the business when you started rocky patches you can't let other people
know that there's a issue of cash flow and that you know you looking tight for the wages next month you can't have that
on you've got a straight face in here and you know business as usual and but behind that kind of good face I'm
struggling really struggling and so with 22 number 22 yeah yep and the
celebrations continue because there's still success but every single time of
these celebrations and partying I'm drinking to excess and doing drugs
because you know we both spent on the cash flow Cassius this miss Donnell and
but I'm doing it to Muscat feel I'm doing it to escape I'm getting away from the stresses the anxieties of what real
your pictures and it's almost this oxymoron of where I celebrating everyone
all the stuff all the team was celebrating because we've just done something spectacular but I know deep down that things are not rosy and yay
happy and on the outside on the outside and they kind of allow any the substances to carry that through and
play the role exactly exactly you know be that person that continues for a bit
I mean how were you able to function at work because it's not bad at this point but it's it's no different than what the
everyone else would be doing it's just the nice how it's the same it's the same it's but I'm starting to feel like I'm
becoming the lion on that lifestyle and
that's what when I start to feel
something no just my whole life would start turn into that kind of thing and
Breaking Up With Girlfriend
I've got God girlfriend he was really bad for me really bad for me she created
this picture that social change was wrong and you know mean her we're going to live a free life and that it was just
a horrible relationship and stresses at work at all not stresses
but the situation that it's a lot of tighter and more responsibility more people join their numbers we start talking a bigger you know we're talking
million pound contracts was talking you know couple legal battles come our way as well which is which is you know all
adds up to it and then you know I think I how am i Tony for yeah so there's a
kind of a three-month period when I break with this girl because I get rid of her and then the next three months is
worth Cheerios for me I I start drinking on weekdays that's when and why I always
dreamt mine some red wine so I've come across a wine you know became a reward for a hard day I've got a white and it
got to a point where minute alcohol passed my lips it would be above maybe
to Hobbs it would stop yeah and that were gonna wait day and I get okay and a couple of things happened
that really hit me hard so it was Thursday night we went to
neighborhood open in here it's good night yeah and I got absolutely off my head and it's the first day and I go
home and I fall down the hill and my house and Britt Malka it's a Wednesday weren't Lisa Friday more than any
possible sites out there in a knee she's going on at work I'm like what the hell doing this yeah what [ __ ] I don't the
spot and that's what that was like straight one stroke and then like straight to well that was my birthday
right 7:23 a birthday I go out everyone it's
great it's gonna be a heavy one heavy one obviously but the death words which is natural Bertie has been they out I
spent like my 25th birthday locked in a dark room watching a movie
Dark Room
ain't life hating life everyone wait like let's go for a mirror to birthday come on let's go I'm just know that my stay here I spent
the whole day in a dark room my birthday yeah and I'm thinking about everything
we've got my life and that's when I gave up substances that I can k strokes it has to be drunk now I can't I can't be
like this on weekend this is ruining my PC room so I think you know I'll be fine so I do I do six weeks about any
and he drugs and then I was still drinking still drinking yeah yeah yeah go to the races and I have a Great Dane
honestly every day I'm loving more happy and but I come back home like 6 p.m. you
know off my head I've been invited there by a friend in a sponsors box I've got no alcohol all this all day and it's
nice day and I've still got a problem where about a touch alcohol I wouldn't stop drinking I have one in my hand and I my behavior up day was I
got thrown out of pickle a nose you know edge first stealing the bottle of wine from someone's table and shouting abuse
of people well it was a different person yeah and I said some mean things to some
perhaps bad things to a good friend of mine yeah and it was the first time I've ever hurt somebody else yeah in a minute I hurt somebody else
and you I need to stop because I'm lost not me yeah I could deal with her in
herself I was beating myself up not I enjoyed that a little bit because it was punishing myself at catharsis
yeah but I couldn't deal with that hurting somebody else I would only got
run over by a car once yeah a couple of things they really region when I was drunk but I could deal with it was
making you it was me but the minute it moved into me doing damage to someone I cared about
and you had to stop and then I woke up that day had a very very frank
conversation with Steve who wasn't there daybook heard about it and I said that I'm going to stop I'm not gonna drink
How Long
again never gonna drink again so how long so bro you know 20 months 20 months
20 months yeah from that day from that day never gone back call turkey call turkey and what
was it like the first couple of weeks it's tough it's change your life it's
not it's not true the alcohol the first I always have this funny the first weekend I woke up however I think the
body a body would say nice recover is so it was is the problem of energy drinking
your body gets used to the shock in his system every five days you know
a functioning organism is used to repetitiveness yeah I work what I woke
up however because my body was it goes dehydrated because it was probably producing more things in the liver
pancreas to break down the art fault and it wasn't that it wasn't that you alright Don what's going on I need some
white yeah that was weird to the first weekend I felt hung over so you don't
anything the benefits it wasn't so this is my problem I try to try genuine you don't feel benefit since like week six
so he's tried on Ruiz greatly the real benefits that comes afterwards cheeky enough to it
exactly and they felt difficult because I had to change my entire lifestyle it wasn't the alcohol it's my lifestyle I
had to remove myself we've taken far beyond social drinking here haven't you this is habitual needing drink yeah
Jordan beats and makes a really interesting call about people that have got substance abuse addiction and he says that the addiction isn't a problem
a serious problem but until you need to take the substance to deal with the withdrawals from illness yeah and but
none of your tape until you're drinking to cure a hangover because you're always hungover yeah you kind of in a different realm
and as soon as you cross that line nothing and that's what and my weekend was cuz I someone broke it down to me
Friday like what he used to get them ready either used to feel it and ready for it to be this is it honestly you
The 7Day Cycle
should feel like it was going seven-day cycle hey guys getting ready for alcohol to be in it so I'd get this like natural
high come Friday life free o'clock right get energy and knows that it's going awesome yeah yeah and I was going for
you coming for it yeah so free o'clock I'm like yeah come on you know Fiona yes it's kind of like because my mind News
I'm away from and then there we come away from this dress I think I'd have to reply to emails awesome April days
yeah so I'm putting it excited so that's Friday yeah that's Friday like 3 o'clock so you might have a few Minds already
somewhere else you got you got a Friday Saturday run off kinda during today yeah
Saturday so if some day recovering from some recovering from Saturday at a diner
Friday and then you know what I was seeing this girl you know we invented tequila sundaes fantastic fantastic so
we had a couple of tequila Sundays so you cannot fix the hangar and is taper it off a little bit exactly so we had a couple of drinks in the
night together yeah and that then it's Monday you Monday you're recovering when they stuff
so you go have a glass of wine at the end of the day because I got through a date on over exactly and then you know maybe not choose it Wednesday because
she your love it especially and then well why don't you mind your back up for
the weekend exactly it's interesting it's really interesting I think there'll be very enlightening for people to hear
someone who is from the outside looking in definitely made of the dominance hierarchy has got an awful lot going for
them but has struggled with something that most people elect to do and find
and find enjoyable and I think one of the key one of the key problems when
you're talking about sobriety or when you're talking about trying to control alcohol is that every drink that you
have makes the subsequent drink more difficult to not have yeah yeah it's like a feedback loop yeah you have one
and you're in a mission below and then you have another and your inhibitions lower and then before before long like
oh well like what's what's getting a bottle of wine and if it's you know you
honored now what's again about you drugs it what's getting this what's getting that and you know I mean and then who says no to the after party at your house
The Bad Food
who says no to telling you friends something the Turk for doing whatever the inhibitions just continue to get and
then I'm down and then you also go into the bad food yeah and that's a whole number calif ish yeah because you just
then you see look at what you put you know and when the guy said it here is your brain cells are made up every
single thing that you put into your mouth yeah yeah that's rain so you've heard that yeah that's really true
that's gonna change your mind or things but I'm like okay everything that goes with my mouth makes my brain okay you
know cause my brain buildup I probably overdose in Turkey yeah that's what sort of what sort of
life is that going to be I think it's really interesting might it's very very insightful to hear from someone can you
hear these stories of like child prodigies and you know Macaulay Culkin asked characters that too much too soon yeah but it's very
interesting to hear it firsthand from somebody who definitely did have that yeah and I think that alcoholism is
usually perceived by people to be or a problem with alcohol is usually
perceived by people to be mid-50s guy with the bottle of scotch whiskey ever
laid on his couch sipping it from that is one employee these are benefits is this than the other but it's not a
problem with alcohol is that you cannot deal with what alcohol does to you in
your body yep if you have I've got a number of friends that range from introvert to extrovert from depressive
to happy and the guys that are depressed or that have a depressive personality they need to restrict the drinking
100% is that you saying that they need to it's me you don't need that they're speaking from personal experience I do
not deal well with hangovers and then if you throw into that mask if it mix if
one of your personality traits is being industrious and you've got high goals and you have high standards for yourself
they say the ultimate pain is when the person you are makes the person you could have been yeah and that that's the
The Ultimate Pain
difference in pain of what you feel yep like if you set your goals very very high and then you start to bring
yourself down in your performance others performance at work performance in relationships or moments with everything
if you do that to you so you're electing to make yourself slow yeah and one of
the mad things I always use this example especially about people that use like that you've really really heavy drugs so
if you talk about pills or MDMA that kind of wash a sequence or a night's experience with the same flavor so you
hear guys that go out and go on the stag do they go Vegas you travel halfway around the world to go to Vegas and they
get absolutely blitzed out of their mind can't remember half the night and then they'll take a drug that is so immersive
that they literally could have gone down the road to the bill and have the same experience yeah the only difference that
you choose when you go away on a holiday and you decide to fill yourself full of alcohol and drugs is what environment I
want to have my come down and hang over it yeah that's the only thing that you change completely I play and you know what I the perfect
come down and I the dark room which is like cinema
room a dark room full of snide blackout blinds block out everything honestly pitch
black so you know that's the dream yeah I used to I used to remember planning my
Sundays yeah other dominoes this the weekend our honor roll around and come down this is there this is the treat for
myself and mentally rewarding yourself of a comedown what how I ever gonna get you to where you want to be you're
completely right and the point that when you get to when you get to the pain of
staying the same you know you something like this isn't me this isn't who I want to be I don't want to be a person in five years the
person I want to be in five years is doing it did dirt I need to do something
to make a change yeah I mean there's absolutely some people who don't have a
problem with substances I have a I'm a club promoter right that's why I did for a living like we see this we see every single
Whos Suffering
person strata can you see the people who are suffering are John and I are not and
I don't know because everyone on a night out again you've got alcohol bring the guys that are on a night out even the
ones that have got depressive personality are the ones they're suffering it needs to be chronic like read a fear for someone to be in the
middle of a night out ten beers deep and still not happy because again the
alcohol in the drugs they wash the environment with the rose-tinted colored glasses and then everyone's having a
good time and that the life and soul of the party but a lot of time it's the people if you want to try and identify the people that are struggling the most
with the substances look at the ones that the most now coming on and I yeah yeah Nick Joe my mind got bad my
scientist drink alone yeah that was the winner that's what I knew I'm sat there i call the nice right just like I
remember he remember drinking come upon the wine I heard later on Saturday I
wasn't going out I don't know why yeah and I left at 45 minutes away and I text
a friend to ask me bring some coke yep the house an hour away on our way on
your own oh my god so you can just rack up line since the other way can you imagine that and that's it you know there is a lot of
side that there's absolutely people for whom substances aren't a problem I have a wide range of friends who party to
different differing degrees yeah people he would go out and a sober because they choose two people who go out sort of
consciously to know it's bad for them people who drink and pick apart your excess and within each of those
categories you have people who are able to recover from it and for whom it is absolutely fine yeah but you know if
you're one of those people you know if you're not you absolutely know for me if you are waking up the next day you might
not know it's because of the alcohol but if you're waking up the next day and you feel worse than a hangover should make
Being Selfreferential
you feel and you know what the cut I think you you know how I hope it should be but if you start becoming self-referential yeah and if you can't
get out of bed for the day and if you start thinking that I'm not actual izing my potential all the things that you've
identified that's you know that that's a highlight yeah so talk to me about what
sobriety stuff what I've lost
rat free enough stone we see a picture you see a picture I gotta help it up on the screen hold on
the screen but this is this is all three-and-a-half stones so that's like what like 18 kilos 15 kilos something
like that 21 21 kilos yeah I was yeah that's that's me me oh well that photo
looks like it's been stretched yeah I thought it looks like it's been stretched in widescreen but it's not you
just massive just muscle so this wasn't
me you're completely spherical I know all right but isn't it which is crazy absolutely
crazy and that one that oh wow yeah
that's um that's a different guy than the one that I'm looking at at the moment yeah it's a different shape face you know
some clear as well yeah for sure so you take on sobriety and
I get to either changes at that time I acquired myself a loss but a lot more
time no you're not spending a game not spending smashing okay so yeah it's to interject at that point on the time
thing even if anyone that's listening even if you think that maybe you don't
have a problem in terms of being self referential with your own opinions on your own sources yes if you look at your
year time - only thing we can't get back right yeah if you look at your year as a set of year and accounts for company
yeah and you want it to maximize profitability which would be available time to do with what you value
yep what you would do is you would look at the biggest costs that you could get rid of on that time and if you look
Time Efficiency
through that and every single week you go your accountant looks at you says what's what's between 7:00 a.m. and 4:00
p.m. every Saturday you do [ __ ] all and then on a Sunday you're working a lot of
50% capacity and then in one day is still only 8 percent capacity what the [ __ ] you doing and you think right ok
even if I don't have a problem with it just from a pure time efficiency perspective if I want to maximize my
experience of life in the mirror 80 years that we've got on this planet I need to make sure that I'm not
spasticated myself on a weekly pieces is the problem that things it's the routine is if you do it every week that's when
it starts to become like question last thing I think someone should question themselves because there's so many so
much more things to do out there you know we do what we do live busy lives you know we do work hard everyone does
work hard and so having that sense of doing something you want to do yes and
it's new despite what people think it's not going in that mess up with our friends all the time there's all the things they will find that they enjoy
absolutely so I found I love running I love working out you'd have known that
the guy in those photos loved running honestly genuinely doesn't look like he could have ran a Burger King away I would have run too baby I wear no runs
very big your flights into the dealers examine every their daring face eleganza yeah so
fun out of work I loved running I got it and I guess I replaced one addiction with a number but I loved how really
magic made me felt that were in the time yeah it's true runner's high is so true because there's
an element you run away from problems as well a little bit but defeating them as well with every step exactly so you've
got live polished tips as well so I fell in love with that I fell in love with the outdoors just in general being
outdoors being being around em and then you know other things like writing right
now I've got a blog and posh tag yeah I
just talked about my day and then the running there inside of things take me all over the world I wanted to go see
some places with it so I'm going to Lisbon next weekend to tell me how many marathons have you got planned I've got
I'm doing 12 runs one-on-one a month build a lot different sizes like 5k 10k
yes I'm doing a half marfan neck smoking next week in Lisbon okay I'm doing running Aloha in Scotland I'm gonna go
up to Edinburgh gonna be called so everybody called you and then I bring along the marfin in April nice and then
I'm very nine-month no way where's the Omo Barcelona that's sick it was just for why the
worst place yeah for sure this is a couple better swim in a bike ride didn't run that's amazing I mean you know
lastly there will definitely be people listening to this who think that's not me like I don't have a problem with with
substances I like to go out with my friends and that for me is what I want to do in my weekends and that's sweet but I said during a podcast I did with
the CrossFit guys that I think they're on about 25 it's like a fitness menopause yeah cuz yeah you stop being
concerned if you've been like a gym bro for a while you stop being concerned with leading us at all costs and you start to realize you're chronically
aware of your own mortality as you as you approach the yeah and you think I need to be from I have to be able to put my put my socks
on and get up the stairs without getting out of breath so you start to think about more functional stuff with that and I think that the same you can go
through a party menopause as well and it's delivered at varying ages you know you've you've maybe had an early
indoctrination yeah you went straight to pro you went straight to pro level yeah kind of yeah I went from student to
professional yeah yeah professional mixed out everything came between idea no there was no Club games no that's straight to welcome yeah and you know I
think that as well people realize and like for some people it's like being in a relationship right like that kind of opens people's eyes because the
girlfriend does one you going out and get me act all the time you and the boyfriend feels uncomfortable about you being in clubs with the guys or just
More To Life Than Going Out
generally you want to spend time together because you've got someone around yeah but even without that I
think that it is really important for people to realize that there's more to life than going out and getting leathered and yeah you know I'm saying
this from under guy that makes a living yeah mother one could meet 100 people in
the clubs every weekend what can I say it's you know my business partner of 10
years had a chat with him you'd the day he was talking about he's gonna go and see one of his friends who was in rehab it was 44 now and he was thinking to
himself at the time like what is it that we're doing to people when we get them to go out on a night out like what you
you hit the nail on the head that the problem is going out and getting blitzed every weekend yeah some people can go
out and they can have I've got a number of friends that can do it that are in the division 2 Division three parties
and they're able to go out they can do a five-point night they can wake up the next morning and maybe they shouldn't
drive but after they've had a bacon sandwich there's way to go yeah but you know I mean yeah that's fine yeah things about
everyone really needs to ask themselves their relationship with alcohol what do they think it's helped me it's a hard
question to ask yourself because you don't never want to sell analyze negatively and I do think that there is
a subculture this is this is not this is thinking is that there is a vegan trend that's come up with the last couple
years is being started really grassroots it really is from run by leaf people
yeah run by the you theory I guess passionate about and a protection but honestly what being a vegan dispute you
know there's a lot to be here oh yeah I mean I may end up being a vegan no no that's Sharon no neither I've
tried I'm aware that I definitely don't need anywhere near enough vegetables so I need I need to push that one of my
friends for an interesting Facebook States up the other day talking about it's trendy to be vegan at the moment it
is really trendy but the same people that are giving someone grief or any
Self Branding
Canada Goose jacket will also be the same one that will spend a hundred quid on two bags of coke that's been done off
the back of dead children in Colombia yeah you know gang wars and all the rest of the stuff that get your get those
drugs up your nose yeah I just is damaging and to a lot more sentient beings than the coyote that's died to
make a jacket or whatever it might be so but again without what people doing that being very selective about what they
want to be self referential though exactly and also works with social media for how they seem absolutely the self
branding if that's fine yeah you're never gonna put the video of you snort in a line but you can definitely put a video of you saying that it's bad - yep
share a video of someone trapping a coyote for a jacket yeah I I think I
think I think the tea towel so movement will come soon I think they'll be a rise
in young people which you've always seemed to see that universities actually a decrease in about time students go out
mainly because of money but I think there'll be a little bit more education on the space that you'll have
generations of young people who choose not to generate I mean my Master's dissertation was the effectiveness of
Antioch aha advertising on students at Newcastle yeah and it basically found that none of it was the people were the
crazy stories as a badge of honor they literally say like how was your night out man he was crazy and woke up in
hospital yeah huh like you think reframe the conversation that you're having that
they did the same thing with smoking when smoke my own place yeah they they try for years and years and years to get people
to smoke less said how I was going to do - you think material in DC hat it wasn't until smoking was banned in
clubs and you had to go outside smoke that became uncle and smoking stopped yeah
because suddenly this is Barrett's entry but go outside and leave the pipe so people stop smoking yeah it's
interesting I think it what specifically interesting about this conversation is that we've got two people coming a
sobriety from opposite ends and spectrum so for the people that don't know I did six months sober last year which began
Sobriety
December 2016 and finished in May 2017 and then I did six months of partying
again and drinking but after my six months of sobriety which I only did to
see if I could do it I knew that I based on the time availability set accounts
that I came up with and knew that if I waited to be really successful for a period and I had some plans things that
I wanted to achieve I needed to get some more time up I need to squeeze more time out of my day and that sobriety enabled
me to do that but we're coming at it from someone who has used sobriety to
stop an addiction or to stop a habitual problem with substances and then someone
who's coming from it who I wouldn't have classed myself as having a problem with alcohol and I've only drank can maybe
once every two weeks but the times that I did it wasn't good for me yep so I guess you've got a fairly wide
spectrum of people there that covered yeah for whom sobriety so you were talking really interesting where you
touched on about the six week point so I didn't track it at the time I should have written a diary and I did about
what the sobriety was doing to me because I think I guess a lot of what sobriety fee you would have meant would
have been not doing negative things before they start to do positive things yeah
whereas for me I was kind of starting I guess from a baseline of okay day to day and then improving from there yeah but
I've always said to my friends that to talk to me about it after about two months my mental agility and my verbal dexterity just went
through his ruse ridiculous yeah and on that point is think people everyone less
nothing is think deeply about when was the last time you can pitch yourself go
alcohol from being 16 years old I use this story all the time
you can't I couldn't I couldn't you know you do address if you do address if you
Dry Run
do a dry run your rank yeah yeah hungover so you have our fire system to
the second or third and then you know what you'll give in the last weekend because it's still January so you only do like free fall away to Humble
everyone that's just completed try genuine dry generators dry three weeks if the dry four weeks you know bit of a
refresh my get back into the gym it's not long enough to really know it's a difference I drink I think six months is
a really intimidating amount of time but for me the changes that it made for me were absolutely fantastic like verbal
dexterity mental agility quality of sleep ability to regulate emotions yeah
energy absolutely yeah and what it does is I think it it starts to let you deal
with some of the things that more more chronic birth being around for a little
bit longer the problems that require a deeper look at yourself things to do
with your values and whether you living with virtue and what what values you
want to be cultivating in the long-term as a person because it's very difficult to think about oh no I'm gonna live in a
virtuous life that is actuated my potential when you're hanging out of your ass filling your mouth full of
d'arnot's like Saturday or you waking up with some girl whose name you don't know it's competent compatriot because the questions you ask yourself in them
situations are very small you don't ask yourself big questions you know you're when you're in a state of on over your
body is telling you honey food they drink I need sort of showing short-term
gratification urges this is what I need to get over in the corner situation and then let you say when you've got a bit
of head space and a bit of mental bandwidth to ask yourself these difficult questions I
never ever fall of what my values what what if I use someone how we actually
did see a therapist strip it to track over it and why things request accepted me as you sir I don't values and all
your actions need to be in line with your values of who you want to be as a person as I've got the hello my values
Values
I'm going about clean it's all being washed under the rug man and you're right like if you're if you're from sixteen and spending time recreationally
for you is going up and getting blitzed with you mates which you don't actually know what life is outside of them no and
then all that you need to do is add in a little bit of vicariously living your
life through other people through social media through TV and all the rest of this stuff and before you know it like
you beat yourself up over over where you are yeah you you're causing the problem
or you're you're creating you're building the wall that is so high you can't climb over anymore and you want to see the other side yeah
and I think that that that level of sort of helplessness or just decisive action yeah it's just decisive action and I
think that it's it's something that people don't have to deal with and I
think that's that that's the key takeaway from this is that you don't have to go out and get absolutely blitz
because again like we say this differing leaves apart yeah right yeah there's there's the ones who've gone to the
absolute extreme and there's the ones that have that are able to manage their alcohol use and for the ones that do
then you know cracking on sobriety will help and it will be a really really good
test for you in terms of can you win something can you win a battle that most people couldn't dust that's the big
thing there it's like proven to you so that you can do so you know that 99 percent the rest of operation can't and
I think that is is it's a big thing because a sense of achievement it's not like he's like a it's real to badge of
honor yeah I'm yeah yeah not that I work with hospital but I'm sober yeah and and it
is an interesting thing I met a guy who I've known for years from New York who's probably like probably the footlong like
the face like best body guy and often Chris I know you body builds and I met em when
People are people
I must be like month friends have been sober and he was like okay I could never do what you do I was like for a minute
like so disciplined with his fitness this guy's so disciplined in his life he looks like a god he lives and you could
never do ideas over that was like I'm one minute I'm doing something here that
is so far away from norm but I'm just like I'm gonna discover new things
people are people that do it's really rare for people to take notice of much of what you post online if it isn't
something that's really monumental about your family yeah like if it's not I'm having a kid I'm getting married I'm
moving away like for the most part unless it's something really funny that the bags yeah like it's like a 300 like
hear about someone that's parked on the street even follow my way except me okay yeah unless it's one of those ones like
you don't and you don't people don't come up and speechy both I only cost about maybe three or four times last year the number of people that came out
to be right and said may you see still do not six months other thing yeah four key now like what's going on
yeah like but it's it's not that big of a deal minivan out how are you do you know it's just like it's just one of
them things like you've got you know how do you not like and after a while when people search our drink and you can know
and you can say to you this without being twenty I'm doing six months sober arm and doing a period of sobriety so
and on that point as well the biggest reason why people say they could not do
it is because they don't mean it could have fun what I and your you are there
in a situation where you still out with people your friends you going out to eat in then I out you're out later probably
than any ever stop and you're having more fun yeah and that's like the biggest the biggest thing I hear from
people is I can never do it to feel like I'm a boring I don't my friends I'll think of me so here we go
people use alcohol 100 percent on an eye out to mask the fact that they're not as extroverted as their friends the
that they are yeah then that they're worried that they're not as good so that is the equivalent of taking a
performance-enhancing drug to be able to perform at an adequate level in your sport of choice yeah so if you are on a night out and
you don't you've got approach anxiety as bigger pies so we call it they're going up and speaking to a girl I'd remember
when I was in uni I'd be like I like can't go talk to that girl knocked back five Jager bombs and then you wake up
within the next morning yeah because he like oh I don't know why I said right so it got rid of the inhibitions got lower
than the approach anxiety went away and the same thing goes for being with your friends like there's this funny quote that I know from one line that
says nothing good ever happens after 2:00 in the morning and you're like the last hour of a club night unless you're
in somewhere like that a late night venue during a typical Club that's ten to 3:00 or 11:00 till 3:00 the final and
I watch it like I sit and I look like if you want a bit of advice leave the club at 2:00 in the morning like leave the
club at 2:30 in the morning because nothing good happens in the final half an hour or the final hour
it's people strongly now it's issues at the bar it's people getting in scraps it's this than the other like you can
have the lion's share of the night with non of the regret the next morning and none of the problems the next morning
and on top of that you can remember it yep and you know if you drive it's cheaper yeah because you drive they grab
your friends drop-off you're going you want to and you know I've been out I caught as much now as I did then another
bet time and I'm sure I completely agree the point - because the moment right
when you were your friends okay and it's it's it's not about 1:30 2:00 o'clock where things deteriorate for that they
go from having normal conversation to just being a mess and it's you sit there and you're completely fine it's like
they're calling them so is the next point and we did this discussion once I
completed the six months sober with a guy called James Bailey who is from Basel and he brought up this really
really interesting point do you thoughts on here he said that curing an addiction doesn't involve to
on cold turkey it involves the reintroduction of the substance on your terms hmm so can you ever see yourself
in the either short medium or long term reintroducing or attempting to
reintroduce alcohol if you can tell me one reason reason why if anyone can have
a wrong reason why I just have in my body okay so because alcohol and other
substances yeah as much of a part of the experience of life as anything else is yeah now you could say as I do to people
when they ask about why I'm are not drinking as much my main reason is I've served my time yeah like the same way
you do you have you military service yeah I'm like I've served my time pi and I did a decade of partying yeah and
right now I don't need to but you could argue that by not reintroducing alcohol
or by not using alcohol that again you're now living in limit and limited limited yeah life on one side cuz don't
get it wrong like I've had some [ __ ] wicked night I played out of my tree like I have had some really really fun
times yeah and that's not to I absolutely would not have been able to achieve those nights out sober yeah
there's an element of the night that we can sing the praises a sobriety all we want but there's some nights out that
just get going because everyone's blitzed yeah completely and I think
definitely definitely not for the very foreseeable future I don't think I don't
think it aligns us with with me and my values are all the same and this ago somebody stupid the same way same way
some people vegetarian this soon doesn't something I I don't I honestly feel that I don't need it I think I have fun I
guess on the second part and maybe I'm not over the addiction interesting I
think I think that this definitely it shows
the fact that you're able to make that admission show us how much time you've spent being self reflective yeah because
a lot of people wouldn't have even been able to identify the addiction in the first place or the other habit was a problem yeah that a lot of 20 months
down the line to be able to say I've still got more of this journey to go before I can actually consider going
back in your direction yeah my I I lived my life we ran away from that moment
where I knew I had to stop like I live did not never thought I ever again so
there's a an interesting thing I'm doing Jordan Peterson day at the moment there's an experiment was done with rats
but rats of who achoo yeah and they hadn't been fed for a while they touched a spring around the tail and they put
cheese at the end and they washed it the smell of cheese in so they could smell the food and the rats pulled a particular force when this spring then
what they did was they wafted the smell that cut in from behind them I need a thought the rats are starving they're
gonna pull as hard as they can already but they didn't be my fourth thing so it increased and what he says is that in
life you don't just need to run towards something that you want you need to run away from something that you fear yeah that's why I mean so much don't man I've
really I've really really enjoyed this I would love to do it again I'm gonna put the links to Tito Runner and everything
else yeah social chain guys if you want to check out Hogwarts logic or just look on your
Facebook feed or your Instagram feed there's probably gonna be something from you guys the heads up on that I really appreciate your time yeah thanks Cheers
thanks Polly

Transcription:

speaking of which Yusuf and Johnny from propane fitness are here today I hope you look colleague the camera it's
possible because I was smelling my armpit that's really not the worst thing
you've ever done a podcast is it so yeah we're talking about life hacks today those of us who addicted to trying to
make our lives more efficient and optimal we're going to try and come up with some interesting resources that we
use that have made our lives a little bit more efficient I think that we all come from different kinds of backgrounds
with what we need and what we choose to use but then there's a lot of stuff that we've crossed over with as well so it'll be a combination of workflow tools apps
a few mobile phone strategies that we use for making you like more efficient
and then probably quite a bit of stuff that not none of us realized that the
other ones did and then we're gonna just mock each other paint especially let's go where he says yeah let's go up there
so most especially excited to would like this who would like to open up the first resource right sculpey Yuka's go ghost
okay well I'm just gonna begin very basic and just say Apple products yes yeah this is Johnny's as well because
Apple contains a suite of syncing but the problem is you roped in as soon as
you begin you get a MacBook you have to then get an iPhone and you get an iPhone you have to get a Mac but otherwise you
just you're in the sink nightmare between a annoyed or a PC device and
then something I am uncomfortable with you looking at camera okay I quite like it I ate makes me uncomfortable
right sorry guys that's just how I feel Johnny is uncomfortable so well because
it's it's been like you all speak you're over there you buy on their bucket the
camera I think not and smile at me and then look at the congestion to the camera yeah imagine that you're Alan
Shearer doing the Saturday afternoon football okay talking into camera but you Jess cheering to the lads the way the lots so
the port you see I've just made the lot so just I think it's a it's a fires around up it's a round table okay
continue so such a rocky start to podcast or the smoothest art we've ever
done maybe maybe so yeah Apple products the main things that I use them for the main things I use the
capture tools for so I Carl reminders and Siri so hold on Siri remind me in
ten minutes whatever and you have at least in either a section of reminders or a note or something that's just your immediate capture that stuff that while
you're on the go you just capture things that may need to be done later and then certain point in the day later you go in
bulk and take one of those things and to capture and allocate them to a specific time in your calendar so that's David
Allen's getting things done right exactly get it out of your head get it down on paper as fast as possible yeah exactly to get it out of your head don't
let your mind hold these ideas because so often what happens is you've got something you think oh I need to fix that nail in the fence which was his
example and then for the rest of the day even if you forget what the thing you had to do is you've still got this
general stressed thought of I need to do the thing there's something I've got a same thing that's left here and then
you're having a terrible time so I agree yeah I think Apple products fantastic like being over the sink just stuff like
your notes make me know when your phone and then it appearing on your laptop I think 10 years ago 15 years ago
the phones were the thing but that syncing also wasn't a thing and then when we do when you first get it's just
such a game-changing I don't understand how people don't live have an iMessage what's up web uh-huh yeah I mean like I
I was to joining the laptop it's probably one of the biggest massively shifts in instant shift in quality your
life how much do you text on your phone how do only other like if I'm on my laptop though because you're on your
laptop a lot yeah well you will yeah I'm not gonna behind always something so
unlike my big Arab thumbs to huge eyes does it do that so I'll just
like not dexterous enough yeah I just don't bother with texting warfare I'm not like excessive you need the accessibility mode that my dad's on the
verge of needing big numbers I love it when I see people this is like the terms
of phonemic calculator it's got its got the keypad entry system from a Nokia 3310 with something like worth a
thousand yeah yeah right Johnny Europe what's next well it's Apple was
technically money Apple is it's to
really cover all the things it does for you you'd almost have to think about this for an entire day because there's
so much stuff like even even things like do not disturb mode for example note
syncing the availability of like so many different apps can be on your phone and
on your laptop Evernote meditation apps like I could run we can run propane I
know you can't because you've deliberately remove things but if I had to I could run the entire business from my phone but I do I wouldn't live
business from my phone pretty much the necessity for me to go on my laptop is very very right really rare so what why
do you have a laptop but small convenient that can work quicker typing as soon as you give me quicker I don't like the angle that my necks out when I
look at my phone like yeah you hunched over irrelevant of whether you sat up at a desk it's not good and I found that
what's this on the back of my neck what are these muscles video traps is that
tractors run up to the backup is here okay so I've found that my traps getting looser at the top but my SCD and yeah SC
n which is what runs on the front of your neck is getting tighter and I'm absolutely adamant that a lot of that is
due to spending time with my head tilted forward looking at my cell phone neck yeah yeah for sure were easily naturally
with the laptop you are levels brought up a little bit I think there's problems like more
probably more so if you use a mouse but people still sit and slug should sit but you have their shoulders pillow
well posture when you posture 101 drop in Fitness comically it's really good crime it's not common for
slash posture great help I'm surprised it didn't just quote a bit ly link right
come on after farmers use so I'm told Gugu doji ELLs are all safe though is
that right yeah I he's taught me a few good what's first of the other I'm gonna
say that the theme or the concert which encompasses loads of things but the
concept of having a series of things that you do in order every morning
before you do anything well in a morning routine yeah but like it doesn't have to
be like a it might just be one thing okay like it's it's I think for me having rather than just saying I've
every team like things that I do it's specifically like because I in the morning I'm so open to I'll pick up my
like half asleep you making coffee pick up your phone check email before you
know you've been sucked into this situation at work or whatever if I just make things as baby simple as possible
for myself okay so give I got give me a minority so okay wake up downstairs
coffee general Fong's still upstairs phones actually with me right so I'm
trying to to put less like physical Aria
isn't just I'm just not gonna look at it okay Journal do the work meditate
downstairs make my girlfriend a cup of tea make me potentially another coffee depending on how far they're back
upstairs roll my yoga mat out in the bedroom well back is getting ready
mobility do wrong would shower downstairs what's wrong what Johnny that's mine
this way it comes to so many things it's fine prioritize who they start with okay
so your your concept that you think that everyone should be doing is having your morning routine like a like it's like a
launch sequence for the day okay I think how do you briefly in 60 seconds how do
you design one if you don't have if you don't have to be mobile if you don't have to run your own business so you
don't have to do but if how do you just get up and get your day going quickly I think trying to not find a point where
you get stuck in inertia is a big one and the song is probably the worst for that and the TV is probably up there as
well I think things that make you feel organized and productive like I I feel
so it's it's all a half of it may even be perceiver but if I've done those things by the time I'm like stuck
working my mind is not thinking like I said I was gonna blow a lot this morning like I said I was going to meditate or
something's bothering me because I've kind of dealt with that first so try and get out in my own way mentally yeah
before doing things that require me to sit and focus and be disciplined I think that you can quite easily work out what
it is that you need to do in the morning it's less about the things you need to do and more about the things that you
shouldn't be doing as far as I'm concerned there's certain things that you can do on the morning that will make
you feel better mmm but there's a lot of things that you can do in the morning which will make you feel a lot worse yeah like if you
there's so many so many of my friends that I know that will get up on a morning and they'll spend 45 minutes cycling around all of the apps and their
phone clearing off all of the notifications from the day before like purely from a time efficiency perspective as soon as you're traveling
to wherever you need to go you can do that then yeah presuming that you're not driving and therefore you're doing two
things at once as opposed to one thing at once such a good point is I think if you compare the worst case scenario
morning where you wake up and suddenly your agenda that you were planning to do in the day it gets absolutely sidelined
by all of the weather the urgent the urgent but not important stuff yes no
comes up and you end up yeah cycling through the apps or just complete and then two hours later you're like well I
have plans for the day but I've got nothing done that I needed to and I'm pretty certain that we could do a full
episode on morning routine journaling it's a big part of what I think all three of us rely upon to get our days
moving correct and I know that it's a case don't happy for me if I have a good morning they're likely at me having a good day's by a
factor of 10 more likely so if you want us to do one on morning routine drops a message or give me a tweet or something
and we'll put that together I think there's a little bit of a finishing point for that the phone thing it just
comes back to it we will be doing a number of episodes on how to might use your phone but the main the best thing
I've done is that I don't sleep with my phone next to me anymore my phone is on the opposite side of the room next to the window so for me to go
and turn my phone alarm off I have to get up and out of bed go turn it off at
the window then pull the blind in the window till that light into my room and then even if I get back to bed I can't
go to sleep again like as long as you're happy with the way you feel like a [ __ ] for going back to bed I don't
mind it I think I can go back to bed for like five minutes boom I didn't I mean bright daylight now so you can always
just face off can you justify it that way no no I I need this extra 15 minutes absolutely
that nice that voice that voice in your head goes and then we could soon as you're asleep you don't have control over how long you're back back in bed
mm-hmm it's just such about it's a bad bad way to start the day like citing it with TV or started with your phone
it feels like what's that thing um Brian Johnson sites where he says that someone
smoking a spliff drops the right cue by 15 points but someone on the phone drops
it by 25 so like in terms of the IQ effect that being on your phone has dudeney much stimulus you brain output
suffers larger than if he'd smoked a joint that's put the phone down pick the joint up is crazy there's a lot of things like that way so
when they say driving while texting is equivalent to driving under like six units of alcohol yeah sleeping with your
phone in the room that you're in is equivalent to like psychologically or to the to the the impact that it has on
your quality of sleep is equivalent to sleeping with your front door open we've spoken about that yeah I see the
point but if does anyone else feel up do you feel like when your phone's the room you we're probably not as attached to it
no on it's an honest in the room I don't but I definitely notice a difference when I'm sat down and I can't see my
phone like if I can see even if it's I always have it face down phone is always face down now you want to get into a
meeting phone always goes facedown but when I conceived even up the peripherals in my eyes from start watching TV or and
start reading a book if the phone is face down there I can see the black in it it draws my mind towards thinking
that's another thing so in social situations they said I can't remember the number but it's if a phone is even
visible on the table even if it's not in use it still diminishes the scent that
perceived sense of connection into interaction by telephone I think that you can get away with the phone what
maybe yes that's probably okay I'm gonna do my first phone which I think we'll
all agree with which is rawat actually Scobie you might not agree with this but I think you said back up so robot is a
daily range of motion programming website every single day they release a
roundabout 20-minute routine of the mobility to do it's based on yin yoga which is a slow slow long-held stretches
essentially it's mindful stretching the reason it's so good I think is that it's
so prescriptive and it's something that everybody almost universally and whether
you're an athlete or not whether you do a lot of physical exercise or not almost everyone would benefit from having an
improved range of motion from doing some stretching day today there's so many people here that said look you know I'd
love to do some stretching but I just either can't find time or don't want to do and the fact is that Ron Wood makes
it so easy for you to do it you put it on either on your laptop or on your phone there's a good mobile version of
the site and put either headphones in or play through the speakers and a guy talks you through the movements that
you're going to do and some good-looking guys and girls on-screen demonstrate
them and they stay in the poses with you for the entire time and then sometimes it's controlled breathing that you have
to do along with it the it's it's just fantastic it's such a good result you
have access to every workout that they've ever put out before and you can refine those down by what's tight so you
got by back you got a bad neck we've got about you've got tight hips you got tight whatever you can put in the things that they bothering you and it will do a
meta search there everything else and then come up with a routine that it thinks it's good for your selection of routines and um yeah I think when I
started doing Crossfit which is functionally and more demanding sport in terms of my range of motion I my
mobility it's still not good enough but was terrible from years of not looking after it and now if you can imagine the
stretch that you do that used to be able doing school where you put your hand one hand goes up and behind your neck and the other hand goes up your back and I
was never able to get my hands to touch behind my back where is now quite easily from cold I
can fall into it if you're just listening you'll have to imagine how lovely that looked but you got really I can't get any doing Archer arms I'm
suing this morning straight in my so if you were miles away right no was it the start you know what I still can't do is
Eagle arms yeah yeah I think that's because the dimensions if he's teased so long titanically must get off your
[ __ ] huge no it's my it's mint irritation on one sides worse is oh yeah
my right I think for me wrong wad is the same benefit as having is outsourcing my
training in nutrition to a coach in the sense that like I think mobility because
there are so many different ways resources methodologies and like schools
of thought and how you should manage it it's so easy to get caught up so much in it that you just don't do anything or you do something and overthink it and
worry it's not the best way to do it so for me it's having someone else has put
at least some level of thought into it there's some kind of I can feel some kind of progression so the poses get are
getting gradually easier than we were discussing and crucially for me I think it's not it's not intrusively
painful or really challenging it's quite relaxing it can be challenging it's the exact right level of charity exactly I
said you don't come away from thinking like that daeho or like dread doing it I got quite like having this part my
morning there's a couple today the first post was if you can imagine the side splits basically it was straight into a standing straddle which
is your feet as wide apart as you can standing up straight and then lowering down on your hands and to go into that from cold mmm it's not it's not horribly
challenging but it's pretty tough and you have to kind of really focus on your breath and the benefits that I think me
and to you Johnny of syndrome and I think scum your I think your benefits
from yogurt like there's a microbes good it's gone it's just this girl isn't it crumbly old school this going this go on
the lemon yeah I think I think that the benefits that all of us have seen from the ogre mobility over the years justify
doing this you can get a seven day free trial at the links to everything by the way links to everything will be in the
description below where we can find discount codes we'll put them in if not then grit your teeth and and buy all on
one so cheap before you get but it's seven dollars a month for $14 it more you know a type of ten having quit but
ten power ten pounds a month for you to have basically someone delivering you a
fantastic yoga workout using you and I would pay what 10 quid a yoga session per week yeah so we're paying forty
pounds a month for four hours of yoga and now we pay 10 pounds month for daily it's not the same it's not exactly the
same and you can get free yoga online yes but I think the how easy it is how
accessible it is the level of programming involved and it looks good as well nice yeah yeah nicest thing to
use it's a good experience and that's part and parcel a bit the platform's simple so yeah you should you should
definitely check out it's got 7 day free trial for sure and then every so often they might even bump up CrossFit open is
starting soon I'm gonna guess that they'll probably do maybe a 14 day around about them so if you wait until the back end of February that they'll
probably be a good show do you want to give the anti wrong would I originally didn't like Ron would because of the
lack of focus on the breath and the lack of the flow between poses since then
Ron what seems to have improved that and they've taken more influence from yoga but the biggest thing is as Johnny said
is there's value in just having a prescriptive routine to do regardless of what it is
you're just gonna turn up and do it and it's the other value in doing the yoga class rather than trying to yoga on your
own where you're much more likely to give in quicker or just be paralyzed by
choice and justicar I'm not gonna bother exactly he said like people are oh I want to go into some stretching but I
just earn all that started you know what to do it's like if you just like will watch this video and do what the man
let's do it yeah exactly I think there's an underlying assumption here or an underlying problem and you guys propane
Rob an article just stick to the program and I think the point is that I don't remember writing that but I'm more than
happy to take credit I did write it past Johnny edit I must say I mean I must have done and yeah it was a it was
really good basically what it says is that if you've got something which is a system which works or something which is a system which is prescriptive and laid
out stick to it long term because people are too too prepared to flip between
different approaches to anything that they're trying to achieve and within the space of two weeks so they didn't see
progress mm-hm well there's entry barriers to everything that you're doing well we get it with clients a lot and
they complain about the results they didn't get from the program they didn't follow we go that's just like well if
you start to something enough to see the result you'd be able to make the decision yourself as to whether it's working for the other the place to be in
is to be able to say that didn't work or that did work and if you can say knife
chopping and changing doesn't give you the privilege to say either so I actually gave up Ron want Chris I
remember this day that's a message ever I was like Chris there was some terrible news and I stopped doing wrong one and
it was just I think probably just I would have not really seen much benefit from it after six months changed did
something a little bit different and then decided to come back to Ron Wood and funnily enough another two or three
months and sort of all these improvements have come through once mm-hmm and that just shows that like it took me literally new to me a year of
doing it but suddenly a lot a lot of the poses feel much easier mm-hmm I start to
see improvements fairly quickly I'd say although they manifested themselves in my performance a lot later but Ron what you should dry if Ron Mott isn't for you
or if for some reason can't access it then find yourself a similarly prescriptive stretch and
routine that you did consistently but ROM odd as far as we're concerned has been the most effect upon them by I can't do because I know your suggestion
is like find a yoga routine online and follow that I just can't do that I don't find a good deed but I think the best
thing go to a class because it's just the most foolproof iya way but a lot less convenient you can't do that
especially because I like doing rock my first thing in the morning upon waking it's a lot less appropriate I think
they're trying to do different things I don't know I think Ron woods is 20 to 20 minute maintenance for a team yeah Ron
water seems more performance specifically and I think if you're doing it for performance benefits and you are
a lifter weightlifter crossfitter a power lifter a bodybuilder then definitely Ron what is the one right
what's next for you let's go so I've been I've just have a look through my list and everything falls into capture habits or media consumption
okay so let's go media consumption I want one I want one one from the top and three from the bottom consonant and a
vowel media consumption so you know what I'm gonna have to kind of capture first because you can fit bands Mesa Carol
Carol I said so the way that you know
which media to even consume is through your capture process so I use either stuff that trusted people send you and I
know it's gonna be good I put it in resume to abuse which open to accuse but I'll put it into a play cue is either a
read cue or a play cue this is done through Toby which is a Chrome browser extension you then can split things into
libraries of things to watch things to listen to things to read you can then if
you want to allocate them on the top of the bottom as two different varies varying grades of procrastination either
it's full bait like really procrastination really progressed so frustration cross in my worried yeah I
didn't understand you installed Toby on my laptop a night I'd still didn't understand what it was until the other day toby is basically
it's kind of like a bookmark manager so it's a combination between the bookmark finding during a reading list that is
displayed nicely and visually on our new tab page yep so every time you open every time you command + T a new tab
open on Chrome you see the things that you potentially should be doing or some other things that you can do to stop
yourself from doing the things you should be doing yeah exactly so the purpose of that is that you've captured
and you've eliminated the decision of what should I read watch like watch whatever is you sit down you you've taken that micro decision out of every
moment and you just have it there you have a cue that's getting out of that again it's a melon all over again
yeah it's only the brave the brain isn't tremendously good at remembering things it's good at decision making and doing
hmm so it doesn't want to have to store the reminder of the memory of this is
why like what should I be doing it's get it in front of you get out of crack on totally and the other sorry how
do you so you talked about CAPTCHA yeah how does it go from so Chris sends you
funny cat video mmm how does that end up at Toby so copy the link add it into
Toby okay so that part you have got anything just manually collect that automatically correcting things and you
I have with with some things where if I'm listening to actually this is kind of the next stage so so see you have the
capture it also means that it minimizes your but your procrastination because you're not going to be just randomly surfing the internet because you've got
a list of things that are vetted and you want to be reading or listening or watching so lectures audio books that
kind of things what I'm into as I so Toby is for stuff on browsers mp3
audiobook player is something that isn't a phone app that that sounds really
snide it is very snide isn't it that's why it works it works very well there's many mp3 audiobooks you can get
or YouTube has a huge number of audiobooks for free and if you use youtube to mp3 converter you can
download them into an mp3 put it on your phone when you play it'll store your
spot and there's also a sleep timer you can adjust the speed as well says it's a fool it's neither audible for
when you've downloaded it yourself exactly it's neither audible and I use audible - so which is accident so is
there anything on it's not inaudible that you can go on mp3 there you know if they suppose unless there's a number of
things that you character or the world's only got two hundred thousand titles I'm aware that they're the main two hundred thousand anyone who's releasing a book
now is releasing inaudible as well but two thousand titles in the entirety of our literate literacy history mystery is
not tremendously like your comprehensive is that I would just Whittle the limitation for lies that they aren't an
audiobook rather than they aren't an audio combination movie combination
that's the most of the reason I called herbal is for modern titles that wrote harder to get through tonight recharge
YouTube will tend to have classics so if you want to listen to like Aldous Huxley
or you know any kind of old novels or anything like that there will be some
stone school British man reading it out on there so you've got taught you've got Toby for capture I hope you for capture
what's up what's up next Johnny what's your next one oh yeah what why'd you get
Toby is it just Google like Toby Chrome extension yeah I had a really good one a
second ago I thought oh it's a linker to that which is is just something that I
decided to do what was the thing I was going to say ah but OOP
so with CAPTCHA and the David Allen thing there's there's definitely and
this is this applies to anyone I think you have stuff that is just accumulating in your life every day all the time
someone says something to you message pops up email whatever stuff to do and I
think like as much as we'd all like to always have something there to capture it and write it down we don't always
have that so there's a there's two things there's a PDF and there's a
podcast that David Allen's done which is a guided Brenda guided mind sweep
there's a podcast of him literally just talking and he goes through things he's like okay professional life think about
things that were said to you yesterday look at your calendar over the last week and it sounds weird but if you sit with
a bit of paper or like a blank document and just listen this stuff that comes out of your head of like like something
that someone said to me ten days ago that I would have completely so either the sort of thing that you just start watching TV suddenly goes
like ah I'm heavy yeah prevent that on I think a lot of time when I'm meditating I'll sit down to meditate and I'll have
an idea they'll come to me or a memory of something that I need to do for later in the day and it's that silencing of
the amount of stimulus that we've got going on so suddenly it yeah I got mine and you go hmm and then once I finish
meditating it's there it is still that and I think spending a little bit of time with a with a bit of silence or actually rechecking through the last few
days of mini pots it's probably pretty good idea if you don't get that stuff out your head it does create this
background hum definitely keeping a few accumulators just there's something that I need to do my caramel what is yeah
it's just right it's just a chronic version so doing doing that like a couple of times a week I think just really helps working people find that if
you search David Allen Google David Island guided mine sweep okay is it as literal as a PDF that I've just got
saved on my desktop and just look down a list of things and you're like [ __ ] and it makes you feel so basic because
you're like that's obviously just sat in my subconscious ready to ready to pop up
at some point but they just need a trigger okay next up I'm gonna do
optimize Hey so optimized on me is a
website by a guy called Brian Johnson who is not the lead singer of ac/dc he
might be he might be pretty certain he's not unless he's leading it outlandish
double life as a bald American guy that's a life coach trip and also all old American
raka from Newcastle so it's it's a website where he summarizes books and
concept there's so much I think he's taught 500 book summaries now yeah
there's a lot his intention is to do a thousand that's his goal to do a thousand he's done 500 a lot of them are
nonfiction self-help personal development spirituality but it goes
full range of topics used on ones on breath methods endurance running
bodybuilding a lot of stuff like all the classics in terms of personal development David Allen's books on there
we've been talking about how to win friends and influence people by Dale common master classes as well as nice that's what that's what's really good
nothing Johnny that when you were on optimize that's what you liked so yeah if you can imagine that this guy is
doing around about every week to every five days is releasing a book summary
and then around about every month to every two months he will compile ten around about ten key concepts within a
field and he'll then release a master class so if you can imagine that he skims that the top filtering of the best
of out of each book and then skims the top filtering of each book into a concept and that is what creates the
master class so if you're the sort of person who maybe struggles to read or
stick themselves into a book for an extended period of time this switch was me is me still was me
specifically a year in a bit ago and still is me now this is really really useful because you just get the key
take-home points with some really really good examples so go through ten ten key
lessons within a particular concept usually from ten separate books maybe a couple they don't cross over so that's a
breathing 101 nutrition 101 sleeping 101 depression 101 how to make a habits
anxiety everything and all of this that's backed by whichever book he's been in so you get the best of the best
displayed in maybe a 90 minute either mp3 or a video and the amount of
resources that you get with it is really impressive if there's a workbook that's attached with each master class there's
a pollster that comes that's attached with each book you can either read a blog version of most of the book
summaries which is the transcript from the audio version there's also a video version there's a mobile partner arc
which safety position that you have if you're doing it on desktop desktop things really good it really is a it's a
pretty powerful and overwhelming resource once you get into it I do feel like his demeanor is probably a bit
testing at times and that might be one of the mitigating factors in why you stop doing it I'm not sure yeah I think
his so a lot of the books that he covered not really of interest to me
like he studies recently he's done every single one of the Harry Potter's alright really interest that's not what I'm you
want to be the summary offer is it maybe it is obviously this otherwise you've done it I'm not sure but like I think
there's a lot of sort of very niche diet books that he was covering yeah like that was a lot of solution yeah and like
things about you know movie or DNA and all this sort of thing like I I get why he's doing that but it's just not
interesting to me and then the I found that a lot of the master classes so this this is gonna be my next one but except
there's a lot of a lot like a tidal wave of information yes doesn't like like and you watch a master class type [ __ ]
how like it's gonna take me a month to just apply all that to disseminate 90 minutes and it's all it's like it there
almost needs to be a syllabus in the curriculum to sit if you want to actually Universal do stuff with it yeah
yeah that's like a three year course isn't it realistically this is we come back to watching things on multiple
times speed which is yeah we can go through that so might well my point about Brian Johnson which is also my
next thing which is the I so I signed up for optimize as well I think we've all gotten account at what we will have me out absolutely his demeanor is a bit
difficult and the master classes is too much of a wave of information and that's which we need to say that for you to say
that this image information yeah made it my business over the last five years to inseminate large amounts of
information it worked not by choice I just so for anyone is literally in business I I am a medical
student and people describe studying medicine like drinking from a firehose so the goal is to try and just catch as
much as you can and it's very stressful but yeah the problem is every book that
is summarized we have to remember that somebody's life work somebody's life the
research project or whatever and he's trying to buy ten of them into it now or
you know the last 45 minutes and they'll be like eleven points that each have
four or five books disappear so what happens is you don't get the time under tension you don't get the time of
exposure when you're listening to summaries to really fully assimilate the
information and integrate it into your life and that was the it's great because in here oh wow these are all fantastic
ideas but it's if you get stuck in that it just quite masturbatory because you're not really it's just a bunch of
like inspiring self-help stuff it turns into it turns into cliche sayings and
and headline concepts rather than understood octuple habits and changes
isn't it exactly arm and that that's interested so what's up next so my well so my workflow to solve that is I've
gone back to listening to full audio books giving myself full time under exposure I'm not doing two times speed
as much or three times you're gonna say while you were even doing that in the first book just simply the mindless
acquisition of efficiency and cramming more information into one so I think
YouTube YouTube natively has a speed up speed right yeah but I've got it I've got a little hack for that as well which
moves it up to four times speed below what can you learn the whole bottom speak could you actually understand
you're dependent depends on the speaker some people normal very normal normal
Hayden's could any could you understand anyone at four times speed not only non-technical information when you start
learning about like trying to do like physiology [Music]
so you being beaten by urination the
flatmates would always like they've come in and just here like we take this verbal diarrhea and so things down yeah
audiobooks I then take notes and summaries as I go along just in the middle Apple notes file on my phone or
whatever just some of the key points put that into an Evernote file and then set
a reminder through Evernote which gives you an option to certain notes to have a date to remind you and send you an email
and a push notification to then be the review and so then you can take the
actionable points that you've taken in context and you've learned in a bit more of a structured skeleton and then try
and action them individually and once you've done that you clear the reminder and you move on to the next thing and I
think Johnny is the best person I've ever seen just implementing information I just mindlessly index information I've
got hundreds of book summaries hundreds of stuff that I've summarized never seen anyone anyone's collection of work that
they've done themselves there's so much yeah it's crazy fast and it's helpful it
sometimes you know with Q&A with my clients for example I very often this I
can't think of many times where I've not had an answer for a question their client has asked yeah because it's such a broad field yeah which is helpful but
tomorrow any notes topic 2300 notes on Evernote how many notebooks let's see you might
as well do Evernote straight after this display this hello into Evernote because if anyone doesn't know however that
works oh go ahead we complete it's a it's an external brain it's a prosthetic brain
yeah it's a USB Drive a bit for you your thoughts is the exactly 58 notebooks
teeth are two three four five notes how do you feel in a in a single word if you
can if Evernote went down forever it has
in the past so you have to take backups okay so let's say irreversibly all of
your backups and all of them I was gonna have to start again like how would you feel that doesn't it's the same way to
let your house burning down Marcus would you rather your house burned down or
your Evernote obviously I think when you
and I travel together we both have our laptops with us hmm I don't know anyone else who feels like I won't leave my
laptop in a car or carry my backpack with my laptop in you're worse than me
and it's because there's all of your Evernote in there as well luckily Evernote is backed up when it's on the
cloud everything right take this take us through do 120 seconds on whatever no is
going okay Evernote is a way to it's a word processor but also a way to index
any of those documents into folders subfolders tags there's a you can find
any of those notes in very quickly the search function is very powerful so so
most people have been exposed to notes on iPhone or whatever the equivalent is on Android right and it's a very very
very effective version of that right it's a very very indexable and effective
form of that and the thing that blows my mind is you have people who are otherwise seemingly intelligent that are
so basic [ __ ] with collecting their notes you talk about guys that are into your universe alright I'll be stuck in a
lecture and there's three four hundred medics in there who are all supposedly people they've been selected for their
academic aptitude and they're all sat there with a flipping Microsoft Word document for every new left you're like
open new savers really upsets me it's just like so if your student
like never know in Google Drive right even everyone who I've told to do it there was on you you never knew doing
and then they'll get it and they'll be like oh my god I wish I'd go evidence it's synced across if it's synced across you phone your iPad your laptop it's all
things I thought you can put images in it's holding this Evernote Web Clipper as well so if you are other workers
photos and you're like oh I want to save that articles press one key and it saves it to your Evernote and it'll detect based on the words in the note what
notebook it should go in based on the context of the other notes or you can change it quite easily that's one feature over know that I don't use TF
it's fun to us I just never I don't ever find myself in a position where I look at something and think I read that way except what I do is I a lot of time I
sign up for things that a member on the access and then cancel within seven days and snip them into your Evernote and
then I've got one more thing I'm sorry go ahead scannable see yeah that's a
much better service and I'm just how often have you been asked to like provide proof of address or what's the
NHS number in fact today I've been asked to proof of address Anna NHS number both of which I've got within five seconds as
a junior doctor who's an Arab that probably happens quite a lot whereas in
the past this you know to try and get hold of though gonna hold you birth certificate or something like that
you have to go through the special drawer find the thing whereas if you just have all of your admin documents in
one thing you can get your National Insurance number or any of our stuff just and you hold that in Evernote right
you can do like you know is that where you hold it yeah accountable will allow you to know blood
struggles fantastic I use Microsoft lens which is the same thing but scannable by Evernote yes it just puts a strange
revenue yeah yeah little bit more so I when you say fist so I think the first thing you mention is probably a lot of the stuff you not have it's because of
you sir yeah absolutely like we again we have trickled down productivity tools yeah because what
you're saying there about like people sit sign lectures on with Microsoft Word all the difference between that I knew
is you just have a question in mind when it comes to that thing you look at that and think there's got to be a better way
to do that I'm gonna bloody I think I was really intolerant like well I open a Microsoft Word document and that 15
seconds of is absolutely absolutely a fine dinner and a good a good point dad the story
that I love about what you did before you went to go and do you medical degree was that you absolutely pounded that like rushing oh god memory system or
whatever that way you've got a mind Palace now that was a big undertaking now one of one of the hardest courses do
60 seconds on that so if you go in mind puppy yes so the is a Russian memory system
that allows you to geometrically increase the capacity for the problem is
it's not like are you retail improve your memory it's a technique so it's not like a what's learning how to bench it's
not getting a 300 kilo one rep much yes exactly but there's a lot of tools in
there but it's just it's very laborious and how many volumes was it was in multiple vote yes I retreat 30 40
volumes or something like this isn't gonna this isn't presented in like nice polished Vimeo videos there's not any s
old Russian text dusty sell us some yeah it's very very good stuff though it's so
okay I'm gonna run through you and the listeners through this quick experiment
so I want you guys to between you think of 10 objects so one to ten before you
do I'm going to give you a skeleton to hook these onto bun shoot tree door hive
sticks heaven gate pine hen okay you can remember those words because they are
rhyming with 1 to 10 yeah this is know where it's at one bun two shoe 3 3 4
five 5 six 6 seven 7 eight 8 nine 9 ten
10 okay I've already forgotten yeah remember that one door no bun I do it's
in free door okay I'll get three and five so just just so they can it's just
so that I can explain what happened we went extinct we went to David Lloyd we needed to remember the code to get out of the road in the bug is gone what
it was and he just shouted two words at me what was it it was 23 yeah and you just
shouted is it zero to three yeah and they shouted tomorrow probably because
that's when you you convert the the numbers to syllables which but anyways you ever feel like you're around right
now no back on the number tomorrow with
a loud meeting with the human but that's a different system that's a bit more upfront learning investment just
explained as a as a concept there's that's your framework okay and then a bun there comes a lumpy what's the legs
number alone what's the reason for you touching something visual to it because memory works on resonance
whereas we think it works on just sheer attrition or like repetition falls yeah now even repetition or even stuff that
you think you learn an isolated fact is always hooked on to some existing thing
within your structure of your brain so the way that you have like an electrical circuit or resonance so you have like a
guitar string and if you play a frequency that's the same frequency as that the guitar strings start to vibrate
as well so you need the existing thing in your brain and then the trigger to go
and retrieve that okay so just a more efficient way of finding yeah what's
that's it you're looking for now you already have the numbers one to ten in your mind you already have the ability to rhyme in your mind
mm-hm so one and bun so that's conceptual that's yeah that's conceptual you can generate that at any time
whereas you you want the trigger to find out what the object one was and so you
say okay one bun that's the hook that's the retrieval system and then that will
resonate with the image that you've created over vlaka with the lamp on and then that comes back and clip it completes the circuit okay so that's
okay so that's you have ten things you want to remember ten things yeah that's a framework you use yeah do you always
use burn for one I don't use that system that's just like that's the base that's
the entry that's the entry level once we've got you forth done degree black
you actually forget the numbers altogether well location there's a good way to do it so you remember you think
of a room that you know so you come into the room you walk clockwise around the room identify 20 objects have been in the room the first object has identified
five pieces within the object so like let's say it's a laptop you think like the top bit the camera the screen the
keyboard the trackpad and the USB port so those are the different objects you then zoom in you attach another object
to each of them and you create a chain for each part of the object so then one
object has the capacity for 125 bits of information and so that's one object
within a room of 20 objects and so then one room has 125 times 24 a lot capacity
for bits of data and then tell us about the time that you entered the gym with you balland oh so to bring everything
back John said yeah I had some of that
shorts that doesn't really have a proper fly so it's very easy to just slip out
and so I walked into the big crowded room in the gym for it I was in that for
a good 10 minutes now I realize that I'd come out to play that's not really about
was not a life hack was it and just to tell me I'm not I really go luckily you're fine
yeah cuz because he would have had to have notified it for podcast again because you're both vulnerable adults
the inappropriately right John Europe
vortex hmm so relate okay again related to consuming media I see all the time and I
nearly did this for myself people setting a goal which is like I'm gonna read this many books this year or I'm
gonna do this listen this money whatever like consume this amount of information
and I think something that I a question that I have used to have which is related to Esau was just saying it's
like read this book you take these notes they're like what do you do with those notes or what's the point of that
unless you're reading it in in some way like unless the book is in and of itself just a pleasure read like most people
read self-help books because they want help with something to do with himself so not having a way to apply that was
something that I struggle with a long time so the way that I changed reading is something right it's something that I
got from a guy called Garrett white which I'll talk about in the next the next round but it's simply just reading
to the point of having what he calls a revelation which is just something and you have this all the time when you read
or consume information of something that for whatever reason make has an impact on you resonates with you makes you that
like triggers a chain of thoughts you raise it to that thing and then once that happens once might take two minutes
might take 40 minutes stop reading go to Evernote and I have notebooks for themes
so like fitness and training mindset exactly yeah and in each of those
notebooks or in each of those notes is just a series of pieces of information I write down the thing that I heard in
bold and then just a few notes in my own words beneath that and then I'll put if there's something associated what they
usually as an action associated with it like for example today it was change
some changed the about page on program fitness calm lay it to a podcast it was completely unrelated to marketing in any
way but the amount that goes in my trailer so I added tomorrow reminders which is synced with if this and that
through trailer and then I know that I have a process in the morning when I prioritize my day that i'll at some
point get through that I was still talking about getting things out of my head again there you know if the set is the same thing but it's a way of making
sure that things that I put into my head done so they stay stuck in there absolutely the what was interesting did you see the Tim Ferriss thing I think it
was what he did last week and he talks about how he deals with information overload and one of the things witness
says it uses this tagline the good [ __ ] sticks mmm and it's like you do consume a lot of information if
you in any way inclined to reading a lot or chasing down the sort of self-help
rabbit hole so to speak is I guess we are that you do end up becoming so overwhelmed with information you can't
pull it back out and you worry well I've read this book and it was a thousand words a thousand pages long and I think
we're all glad what have I got out the other side of this and Tim Ferriss is piece of advice was if it's not if you
read all of those pages and nothing comes out the other side of it then don't worry and if you read one book and you get ten concepts out of it then
that's fine because the good [ __ ] sticks I think that's a really light interest I
really agree with them I think the only part of it that I disagree with and this might just be his ability or my
inability is this definitely notes that I've made on previous books I look back over and gone like oh yeah
and so what I try it what I'm trying to do is just by the time I've finished a book I've either already applied
everything that I've learned from that book in some way or I have you know at some point in the next couple months
they will be applied and far rather have like one book a year it's totally improved one part of my
life like relationships yeah productivity what I've sleep whatever then have ten books that I forgot about
tell me that's an important thing like making this balance between acquisition of information and application hmm and
some people are too far one way some people too far the other way either too far in the acquisition not in an application some people read a book
every five years and so maybe they need to obsess over yeah let's do let's do a full round we'll do a final round for
this episode okay and we will do a full round on the most basic one that you can think of so my most basic one to get
started would be prepping your food every day and it's something that not everybody does but the benefits of
prepping your food are so ridiculously large from an economic perspective from
a time perspective from a dietary control perspective from a mood perspective if you get up in the morning
and instead of eating your breakfast whilst watching the TV the time to eat your breakfast I promise you if
you have a coffee wait for the coffee to cool and have a normal-sized breakfast that doesn't take too much cooking you
will be able to wash up yesterday's washing up cook your food for the day and pack it by the time you've eaten
your breakfast and had your coffee takes about for about half an hour to 40 minutes or so and by that time you've
done two things that you needed to do on the morning but one of them will benefit you for the entire rest of the day so
batch cook your food together make sure that you've got chicken defrosted in the morning or you've got your meat for the
day you've got some sort of carbs or potatoes or whatever it might be and then throw some vegetables in and you
can just boil everything away while you're thinking about your day and your cooking your food doing what I really
admire how consistent you are with us it's just habit it's just force of habit for me now and
it's been so drilled into me that when I see people some of the guys will have to leave the office at four o'clock in the
afternoon to go cook to go out to go to go to a restaurant have food that's sweet if you're eating out that's fine we can also plan to eat out and yeah
maybe you're going to end up wasting some food every so often because you've cooked food and then you end up going out for a meal but the price that you
play over the net the price that you pay for for wasting the food that you may be not going to be able to eat and you're gonna have to throw away it's far lower
than the price you're gonna have to pay by not cooking the food and then all you have to eat out there your dietary
controls a lot less so yeah just in whatever to whatever degree that you can
try and prep at least one meal a day even if it's just your lunch let's say that you that you're working a more
typical job daytime job you can eat your breakfast on the morning you can prep your lunch and come home to cook and eat
your tea it's to me it's just such a no-brainer I know that you guys are on
and off with your food prep thing is like that that's just our failing because it's I'm completely sold on the
idea like it's a money saver time saver and eliminates the possibility for you
to go off the rails with your diet because the decisions made for you at the start of the day like it's such a like why how come how come how come you
don't tend to do it the reason I don't do it knows because I I do the next best thing which is ready meals plus like a
protein booster or a veg Buster or whatever which works for me but like I very much want to get back into it
like I do prep occasionally like every third day but it's not as clockwork
because like I would do y'all put things in a slow cooker put just chicken lemon rosemary and sweet potato into it slow
cooker leave it for 12 hours it's tender and ready to go yeah okay so have you thought of a basic one yeah shoehorn
sure can you remember your facebook stay
that's right years ago so if you consider the time that takes to put your shoe on with the shoehorn and then
without a shoehorn so and the the amount of skin that you lose on the back of your thumb as well trying to thumb you
some of theirs and try these um it in try to thumb there's a shoehorn help you swim it in so much better really yeah
thank you thumb for it um so the way that we is it amortize the the cost over
shoehorn is you you work out the amount of time the number of times that you put
your shoes on every day four times a day on average yep number of tomber a mount of time that it
takes to put your shoe on without a shoehorn 20 seconds total well let's say 20 milliseconds between two shoes or thinks
for a second between two shoes now the saving will be about 17 seconds x 4 x
reads by a year at your hourly wage the cost of the chute one pays for itself
the 69p that you pay for a shoehorn on ebay will pay for itself very quickly so
I like it really like on day one it'll pay for itself maybe the early is that amortization yeah what's yours I want to
do two things but both you laugh oh maybe both of them fantastic I love saris is that this is for people
who work in an office okay picture was you did I did I think so something I've used to observe and I was the same a lot
of people would have liked coffee with her breakfast in the morning and then against about half 10 or 11 o'clock and
there's a bit of a like whip around to go to the local cops Nathu yeah like I was a coffee man
outside and his little van or like a local Starbucks and people do that every day for example and so what I
was started realizing was actually like the coffee that you get is normally unless it's like an iced coffee shop
artisan is normally pretty [ __ ] and like two or three quid the coffee that I make
at home is normally pretty nice I've bridesmaid blended - exactly how am
I like this how I like it cuz I've done it yeah and I know what I like because I'm me yeah one of the benefits of being me so so what I did was buy two
thermoses that are identical aha contigo which i think is Spanish for
with you you spell this cont I Gio wasn't as complicated as I thought and
so I taught me telling people about it like I would arrive at work bring two services up my bag putting on a pillow
like put me quit but actually if you add up a saving space of a month it's in
mint found I keep I run the numbers on that on one of our articles and every it's like if you get Starbucks coffee
and a biscotti every day of the week Monday and Friday every day for ten years
it works hard to like 14 grand and then if you could interest us the thing is
have you heard the argument against that okay which is like so people worry about
that and then trash their credit rating and like if you flipped it have a really
good credit rating and managed the macro aspect of your founders in coffee the 40 grands like it relevant in the context
of like buying a house mmm - a credit rating right now anyway okay so we've got so unless that's one of them
automate that part of your life just have an iced coffee for much less money yeah second thing is which is
technically two things within scale or a Wi-Fi scale yep another example of upfront cost and it's similar situation
the moment we get our clients to way up when selves every day the number of mornings you wake up
it's on the scale you're downstairs [ __ ] like forgot her a coffee caramel number
scale syncs wirelessly with the cloud phone it's just logged and graphed and think
so this is a winnings winning I think they're now owned by Nokia yeah there you said got one for free that's just in
front of the theme of the wedding is sweet for free this week you have as well watch and there you go to watch off
maintains an active I suppose of watch is an activity tracker so that's the next thing which is a Fitbit or some
kind of fitness watch yep mine currently wearing doesn't tell the time but just
it's just accumulating data and want me just in case I need it so sleep activity basically got me a
some watch that doesn't tell the time it's yeah yeah and actually really later so the watch that does this Fitness
watch made by Fitbit that doesn't tell the time is actually the cheapest on the bus one it's cream wear it in the shower
can you can you do you like to know what you're doing in the show but it means about heart rate so the time that I used
to it doesn't track re the time just doesn't do anything the time that I used to forget to put my Fitbit back on again
who's always in the shower in the morning do you find that the number of steps that you take is an important part
of your training as a powerlifter yes the hmm is that because that's the
only cardio you it's an easy way it's an easy way to average out Tara I'm doing 8000 steps if
I do 12,000 tell you what's crazy on the next episode the first one that I will do will be something called sleep
cycle and the data that I got the other side of that is insane and I have a look at a graph that it shows as soon as I
break eight and a half thousand steps for the day I sleep increases by 10 percent or more that's cool crazy thank you very much
for your time and we will be back particularly with a new episode

Transcription:

so missus you're welcome you're right oh you did very good thank you good fantastic yeah so we're gonna need
to listen either yo now through we've got Tyneside and a few of the bits and pieces as well yeah and since I met you
you've had a an idea that I think is probably one of the hardest things I've ever heard it's a sort of the sort of
story that you hear about in the news but you never actually know anyone who's going to go ahead and do it so I guess
in short what what's your next three months gonna look like what you do I'm gonna row wooden rowing boat from
Portugal to Venezuela which has actually never been done before by anybody so no
it's been done by a team five guys before but never done by someone on the right so I'll be like the world's first
so you're rowing across the Atlantic Ocean yeah on your arm yeah from mainland
Europe from mainland South America which is important because there's a race that exists where people go from the Canary
Islands to the Caribbean so it takes in sort of 80% of the Atlantic Ocean and
it's long story short it's 20 grands later and there's more kudos attached to
go from mainland Europe to mainland South America right there's about a thousand miles longer I have been there
the race so that's the reason for choosing that mm-hmm and then also the
fact that no one's ever done it before so there's not many things left that no one's ever done yeah there's no
especially an exploration and stuff in adventures so it's one of those like
last things to grab and it just sort of built that's it you know as it evolved its sort of built
into what it is now mm-hmm the initial intention was to just throw the Atlantic and in design in any way possible so
again in any way possible yeah ever bit to whatever videos and being kind of naive to it I was just like well I want
to roll the Atlantic what's the most common form of doing that and then outsider and then looking into it human
back the ladders you sort of figure out what's on offer and then through a bit
of sort of bucking against the rules and so they're not wanting to conform I
ended up getting my own my own route so basic is this company called Atlantic campaigns you could run the task or
whiskey Atlantic challenge and it's the sort of the standard bearer if you like
an ocean rowing and it's 20,000 pounds to any of that race is that solo as well
oh yeah they they take on sale when trees pears threes fours I think I might
have done five but I think fours actually the highest they do and basically I looked at what you get for
the 20 grand now I'm not putting it down towards a fantastic organization it does great things but for someone that
doesn't come from particular background and then 20 grands like quite a bit of cash just to find to enter a race
especially when you spend upwards of 70 grand to buy the boat in the kit and all the stuff you need yeah so I basically
about seven years ago I set the scene so about something a little yeah it's I was
living in London working private security and basically got invited to a dinner party and one of the girls at the
dinner party was a film director right so I'd asked if she'd worked understand recently and she'd just finished a film
on a guy called Charlie picture right he drove the Atlantic on his own independently so I watched that film and
sort of transfixed by it everyone else it has been a part you didn't really want to you know think about doing that
yeah it was I don't think there's anyone that really think so doing that right yeah yeah it's the sort of thing that
you hear other people talk about but yeah I don't know it just look for me that's exactly how it was so but it you
know like most things the curiosity got the better of me and I sort of I email Charlie to find out the ins and outs of
ocean rowing and how someone goes about that planning that sort of thing and so
he sent me all the links to the Tallis chorus and through that I figured out it was gonna cost nor that sort of stuff
so I had set aside a bit of time to save for it and then like I said in in
researching more about ocean rowing I came across other people that done independent rows right and there's a
whole community right yeah it's huge once you give scratch the look like the layers away absolutely over the last
year just seeing stuff that you like in sea and there's you know ice rowing all over the place yeah and it's almost like
it's like when people get into training like we've never been exposed to like gym life before and as soon as you think
up all the lingo and all that sort of stuff so it's a definitely like a subculture that people pick up on a
notion Romans that way as well but more people have climbed Everest than of wrote the Atlantic and then again if you
look at the Pacific or the Indian Ocean the numbers are even smaller again that's a thousand at the moment I think
the figure stands at about 500 yeah but the talisca race it's grown in
popularity so this year the race is actually happen as we speak is 75 people
in the race it is again exponential yeah so maybe 50 people all complete it and has already beaten some dropouts and
stuff alone yeah a couple of rescues and that's not an arrow and that's quite humbling to see from my position like
I'm setting off in three weeks people given up but as well as that there's a guy called Damien brand who's a former
rugby player and he's basically setting an example of how to tackle an ocean road like he's got the former yeah and
if he thinks like kind of the way I like to think about things so if you take an event or something that happens to you
in your life if you can react to it one of two ways but that doesn't change the fact that that event has occurred so you
can lose your temper or you can laugh it off but the event is still there to deal with so it doesn't really matter how you
react to something you're there and you've got to get on with it but there's a few you know in times gone by there
are people that have sorted for whatever reason withdrawn from the race and I'm I'm starting to to change my like
- reaction to that like mayor Shaw reaction on hearing that sort of news would be there I they can hack in it wasn't for them and all the sort of
stuff but a few of them have raised safety concerns that they perhaps didn't think about when the lead up to throat
there's so much that goes into the planning that I totally understand that from their position they might have got
to a point where they hadn't really considered what they were getting themselves into yeah I know that sounds daft because it's rowing an ocean but I
think it's easy to get caught up in the hype and sort of find yourself in a position if they don't really want to
work prepared yeah so tell us about your background what's what's your what's your parent so basically I grew up and I
really like to sort of transient lifestyle so my father was in the Armed Forces I was born in Germany and then ended up
living all over the place and then when I was 18 I joined the Marines on a dare
yeah so basically was a TV program on while we're at school and everyone was
talking about this TV program sort of would they fancy doing it and all that sort of stuff and again another situation where I
think I was the only person that wanted to yeah and then later that day I was stooping the queue for some food at
school and I overheard two lads talking about the fact that I want particular to
go write one whole holt's I was like 17 or 18 right it's like a levels yeah and
I even heard someone saying they didn't think I could do it and not being sort of that academically minded and not
knowing what I wanted to do if I got the university you know that sort of stuff I just decided to run it by a man or old
man first yeah saying when they drop out of school and doing the Marines what do you think and he was like yeah go for it I guess with his background that would
have been yeah so did that left the Marines got into private security did
that for a few years and you know just I think you can tell from that background I've always been a fan of like
challenges and figuring out who I am and how they acted like stressful environments and sort of extreme
situations and I just feel like it's been a few years since that's happened so the roofs are coming in a good
mm-hmm so this has been a concept in your mind for about seven years yeah I think six or seven years see
there 2010 or 11 I watch that that video did a party yeah since then it's just sort of evolved but obviously with the
amount of money involved and obviously with the age I was like bang how it isn't you know get a car and a nice ass
at 70 grand is like hard to come by when you do it all that 70 thousand pounds is because I probably spent so far about
seventy thousand I say so far because it's still more stuff to get for sure yeah so it's just it's little things
like there's probably a katniss with two or three hundred items on that you need to do the road Wow
and most of the items cost a couple hundred quid so you can you know gather from that how much stuff and then in
amongst that is a bowl in amongst that area yeah that's all is it but either or like it's a rowing boat or a vessel
because they're the things I think because of the stuff attached to it it gets called the vessel because I have like a radio and a GPS and I got me it's
basically a wooden rowboat with it account smoking yeah so it's pretty good so you've got you've gone through the
Marines you've gone through your private secure you've come out the other side now yeah I've seen you just over the last year I've seen you run coast to
coast of Hadrian's Wall yeah that was them so that that wasn't really a big
thing for us and his absence I saw my own a big-headed and it's not meant to sound that way it was the equivalent of somewhere in the region of three
marathons back to back and what exactly what well it's actually 328 mile runs back to back so I'll set the scene again
Josh rose and I did run in November just off the cuff to see how like fit we
thought we were and it was a trail runner Wooler which was 28 miles and then we literally finished it in ten
minutes our foods were talking about people that do all the marathons and stuff like that and I just 101
I think ultras anything over a marathon to be honest yeah alright so if people are doing 50k in call it an ultra okay
well I'll do 100 K in court or whatever yeah Josh and I were basically saying do you reckon you could do that
back-to-back and I was like I don't know and then just off sort of googling and flying around Facebook and stuff I found
two guys that had ran Hadrian's Wall and it was 84 miles and it just jumped into
their head that that's pretty much they're back again and there again and the wrong we just did yeah she was the
biggest distance either over self-edit that I've ever done I think up to that point and only ten minutes after you
were already looking for me yeah so I just jokingly said to him what do you reckon about doing this and he was like yeah that sounds pretty good
and then though I've always been a fan of if you tell people about it then it's happening yeah so I think we posted up
an Instagram that day and then to sort of train towards it as I external
ability coming in a little bit yeah and it's just sort of like I think it's good to test yourself now and again of stuff
that you don't know you might be able to do otherwise it isn't a challenge to many people these days do you like a
marathon which no offense to anyone that's proud of what they've done but it's not hard to run 26 miles no matter
what your background or even if the training are supposedly training for a marathon I've seen some of the training protocols and people are working up
towards 20 miles like 10 and 20 miles beforehand but unless something goes wrong the race is all right you've
already run it which is actually the edges to my heart of the training right yeah the point of the training is that you should be able to complete the run
comfortably yeah but I think there's a difference in trying to complete an event which you've prepared for and trying to test yourself in a way that
you can only prepare up to as well as you can do for yeah that makes sense yes and I think also if you apply a
timeframe to the market and then it becomes a challenge yeah but for most people they just want to do it and it's more possible than people think it is
yeah and I think there's loads of stuff in life that's like that it's way more possible than you think you just know
you haven't tried it before and the run the hecklers were all run was definitely that like in February we failed it well
I failed it because I got a shins what do you call it a stress fracture a machine right so that stopped us at
about the 65 mile point still which is a long way it's not just
exactly double ya marathons and so that was that but then because of kind of
kind of people Josh and I are we were like wolf we've got to go back and finish it I think that day the Instagram
bell see you put apply instead they asked I think yeah yeah fun announcing they hadn't happened yeah this is a
pretty much it was the announcement like what yeah actually so to speak and the date was good because it was the rerun
was in August just gone and it basically for me was more of a test of like where
I was physically and mentally because it it was a tough test in that like you had to apply a better mental forward to get
through it because it's a long way to run most people unhappy drive in that distance but to run it we self at like
fallen them all and they finished it 10:00 at night and let's like coast to coast of the country so it was quite a
deal and but also for me it was good because on the roam I'm probably going
to be working out for up to 18 hours a day and the run took around about the same time right so the thought of
getting up the next day and doing that all over again it was more preparation and because I could turn around go world
it's possible but it's gonna be bloody hard yeah and to string a hundred days like that together it's really gonna be
the test so go back to the role you've you've got your prep you've started to get towards it something what's the next
step in terms of you've started to think about the idea where do you go from there you need to find the route you
need to find someone with specialist information yeah exactly that is sort of it's like most ideas that you know you
don't think you're gonna be able to achieve just as soon as you start on the road it just starts to evolve and I've
never really been someone that like plans everything to an absolute tea and then goes and executes it I can sort of I trained myself up to a
point where I think I've got all the skills I need to you know be able to take on the challenge which involves the
whole planning phase as well yeah and then I'll just react to the situations as they as they come
yeah and as I'm going down that road so basically like I said I emailed the guy Charlie picture found out about costs
and you know required courses and like the navigation that you need to like
pick up and a lots of stuff and then just let me start going about doing it but the real sort of the
emphasis was like injected into the projects back in 2016 right because a team of five guys had completed that
route that was on about three of them were friends of mine from the Marines right no way yeah so I called one of
them up and just said like what's what's the score with this how do you go about planning in except we just picked the route and did it
so I basically the same sketch as the run I told everyone I was doing it and it kind of like forces you to make him
happen man for sure and also thicken of date was important because it's something to work toward and it's
something that like you're then accountable for because people know you're like it's January to Morton's
many be going often it's real absolutely yeah markinson's a lot of the work expands to fill the time that's given
for it and if you just at some point in the future it would be five years ten years before you know yeah I can't do
any more exactly so know if that's I mean so moving on to the actual row itself am i
right in thinking the red that 1.5 million or strokes around that yet I mean it all depends on like the distance
it takes me but as a rule that's gonna be about one and a half million Oryx yet which just sounds like yeah the sort of
thing that would take its pace or do you know I mean maybe of millions of anything yeah millions of repetitions of
anything just sounds absolutely insane yeah it's one of those weird things like
the closer you get to it and the more people I know you've actually done the road the more you realize that it's it's
everything you think it's gonna be it's like incredibly monotonous and boring testing and all this and you can have
music and sort of films to keep you company and everything but at the end of the day there's there's no getting away
from the fact that you've just got got to get on the oars and pull and also
it's so much more different to anything of them before we're on the run that
josh mike did yeah if we fail that it was like the offer and ben was driving the car next to us yeah so we could jump
in or we could like get our iPhones out and call someone and they've come but this is not like so what's the
support structure that you've got there's no sport is completely unsupported an absolute emergency I can
set off one of the many beacons I've got on board and through the different coastal agencies around the world
they'll sort of try and affect the rescue the majority of the time use
rescues if from passing ships because there's quite a few shipping lanes on my route okay so there is the opportunity
to be rescued but that's if you're in an emergency situation yeah it wouldn't be
looked upon very well if you sell few beacon just because you're a bit tired yeah yeah it's a weak feeling a bit
sorry for yourself and then failing that there's a life raft grab bag of
emergency kit and then the current to take me to the Caribbean bloody there's something probably about 150 days maybe
okay that's definitely last resort yeah it is a resort yes I guess if you've got
to have planning for every eventuality like he said there's a lot of things that could occur that you wouldn't know yeah so when do you set off what time of
day and what date so you set like a general date that you're aiming at which
for me is the 18th of January for no other reason I've just plucked out of the air yep and then through the the weather
eaten guy my friend foxy we're just going to look at the weather around that we can see if it's a viable option
but generally January's a good time right yeah it says of something going on with currents yeah the telescope sets
off in December and I'm gonna start from January basically for the same reason that the trade winds come from Africa
Thord South America right and they're at the strongest point at that time of the year and also the hurricane season stops
in around November December time so if you self obviously after the hurricane
season it's gonna be you know what quite a few favors so you're gonna get an assist at the wind right yeah at least a little bit
yeah so this not to get too much into it but there's two classes of boats there's
the pure class in the concept class the concept class is basically like the newest design which is an incredible
design and not to sound like I'm sort of like hating on it it is a nominally
design but a kit and the people that make them run ik definitely the best boat builders out there but it's widely
known that they get huge wind assistance because they're designed for that so the entrance to the cabin is at the front of
the boat for the main cabin whereas mine's at the back of the boat yes so as the wind comes over the back
of the boat it doesn't hit anything your mind it just drifts off into the energy whereas it's a flat surface yeah so it's
like a sail and because of that run I could set these blistering fast paces
across the ocean any of the world records that held are currently held by right boats so this is there now two
classes yeah so Guinness were like well that's not fair now we'd have to have two classes so I looked at who holds the
record for my row that's an old-fashioned pure class boat right so I only thought it's fair if I'm going to
try and beat though like the record that already stands yeah then I've got a good has got the room you've been drinking
you're doing is never been done before no and that would say irrelevant of which side it was in which boat you were
in yeah I'm gonna be what specifically for country to country I'll be the first person yeah but for continent to
continent yeah someone's done it before okay and the guys called scene half a Norwegian that said it in 96 days right
and so if I beat 96 days I get the records as well as being the first person to go from Portugal to Venezuela
I'm the first British person and all those sort of yeah all the sort of all the sub years man
not very good I mean it's just it just boggles the mind really so so I think about this sort of stuff like on I can't
imagine what the experience is gonna be like to go across so you I mean what's the estimated time you hopefully send
off January 18th is yeah well in the winning a morning thing is it the sort of thing where you going to be able to have only one to see you offer than a
support crew like yeah so foxy the weather written guy he's going to come out to Portugal with me
and then my friend Pierre is gonna help me drive the boat down and then those two basically I want as little time as
possible in the marina and Portugal right why's that just like there's a mental thing I think it's way better for
like say your buyers code for on at home yeah drive down put the boat jumping journey else begins as yourself in the car
exactly yeah do you K yeah and also you know like I said because we're getting the weather and all that sort of stuff
you don't want to miss your other window so if I do leave al you want to get down there sure a two days like delay might
end up being a four-week delay which I can't really afford so for me I just want to get the boat in the water
himself plus it isn't like a challenge that I've ended up doing that I don't want to do
like I've been this like a dream of mine for six or seven years so I'm like chomping at the bit to get out there and test myself and all that sort of good
stuff yeah and I think like the solitude something when you enjoy like the adventure side of it you know putting
yourself at the mercy of something you can't control isn't something people do very much these days absolutely and I think that's where the
test comes from is like I'm not in control of my environment and I can only react to it so it's much the same as
like normal operations and the Rings like it's a good test with who you are or what you're about especially in this
world where people are so bothered about sort of money and status and celebrity you know that's for stuff like that
stuff doesn't really impress me I like the only idols I have of you know they've got the work done and then they
get the plaudits for it rather than telling people what they're gonna do and expecting some sort of for sure I mean
you know a lot of people I think would be primarily chasing the titles and the
they want to do it the quickest they wanted to yeah the fastest the best yeah and get the most renowned out of it so
maybe that bonus is the truth is the test itself yeah and if it takes me only 20 days I'm not really bothered
the the records like a nice to have for the sponsors and stuff like that something that they can sing about and
say that they were involved with but for me I don't really care about that it's nice to know that you know you've you've
earned something and you've achieved it because you outwork the other guy in all that sort of stuff yeah but for me that
the big test is can I deal with what's thrown at me like the conditions will probably be different to the other guys
as well and the distance is so vast that you can't do the exact same group anyway
right so the parameters of like well he did it in this time and he did it in that time they're hard to sort of you
know there's no direct comparison yeah you can't create like that level playing field works like a football match where there's two goals in 19 minutes and off
you go in Fisher and so yeah it's just it's a weird one because the records
mean a lot in the build up you know getting funding and sponsorship and all that but when it comes down to it I
getting from A to B safely's number one I think that's what that's what grabs attention isn't it yet that this is
potentially going to be a world record hmm all right but as you say that for you is below secondary yeah it will be
cool I mean like that the whole ego side of things that'd be nice to be the first person to have ever done anything
because you'll never lose that record absolutely whereas if you're obviously the fastest you're the fastest up till someone beat
see yeah yeah and with the way that the boats are going as well it'll come to a
point where the pure class folks no longer no longer built yeah or they're too old to be recycled so it's only a
concept class boats so then it would be nice to be the last person to have done something and all that sort of issue but
definitely I'm open to the thought of after the first one that's done maybe doing it again and a concept boho right
now but I've obviously got to do it first and see if I like it let's get over here so you're gonna sell off
January 18th and then I'm writing saying that you don't actually steer is that right it's
GPS that does the the majority of the steering in terms of directions in the air so you can have what's called an
auto helm and it basically attaches to the rudder and it's a digital steering
device so you type in your bearings of the GPS and then you can get it done
automatically or you can sync it yourself as well you'll put the bearing into the auto help and then it basically steers for you so you just get on and
you just pop yeah and you just pull but if that breaks you then go to foot steering or hand steering which is as
bad as it sounds yeah whilst whilst also trying to pull your oars yeah and you're constantly like readjusting it and sort of making
sure you're on the right bearings so if you have you set your course no do you know yeah so I went through it with them
foxi we sort of sat down the other week spent about eight hours picking the
course so have you done it what are you dinner recently yeah I mean that you've had a lot of good ideas everyone knows
that I'm going from Portugal to Venezuela so that's pretty obvious yeah I just head west yeah but the
intricacies of sort of getting out of Portugal and like breaking away from the land so you can afford to get your head
down without like drifting into anything yeah so the first sort of day will be the first week it's going to be hell
because why is that you're just into everything it's the first week where you're like aware of what the routine is
going to be like is the first week where your body's getting used to that workload all you had like the blisters
and stuff in your hands are gonna form and all that sort of thing like you can train them to a certain extent and like the nice comfy confines of a gym and my
view but when you actually get on it you can't really train for an ocean road unless you're on ocean yeah for sure
suppose that you've touched on it there so I'm going to segue off yeah just take the three training take us through what the training is consisted of um I think
that's always a hard question to answer because you know chunker society that trains all
the time and they have goals outside of these big projects so like I train most
days and have done since I was 16 or 17 but the rose specific stuff I knew I had
to get fat and you had to get strong and I knew I had to have a pretty good engine lucky have had a good engine for
a while and so that kind of took care of itself here and that run was like confirmation of that yeah and then I get
fat get fat to be really weird really weird it's gone really well but it's
been really strange obviously most people that train a train to go looking
good or be nice when you look looking good when you're naked and all that sort of stuff and I've had to do the opposite
of that yeah I've had to eat for a purpose which goes against everything that like I people I stay with like stand for so
that's to be really weird but um it's it's doing I'm getting better in it now
because I know that it's gonna like it's getting better a big fat yeah but I'm getting better at putting the food and
not being that bothered by it because I know it's gonna like serve me well one there the time comes but ya know it's
really weird how I have our strength so this is probably I'm gonna guess that this would be the heaviest you've ever be yeah 112 kilos at the moment from 85
in August oh my god so that's quite it quite a game very sharp and it's not like you know
obviously you can judge for yourself but a lot of people have said that I'm carrying it pretty well like a regular claimant so if I was to do it again but
I think that comes from the strength training that I've been doing so I've added bulk as well as fat definitely
with my top off and stuff I'd look flabby and I've got curves where I don't want them that's what was definitely but
working with Tim Briggs who does we don't need nutrition we were like well
the first part the first part part of getting fat is just eating more than you
need to get fat doc yeah it's been
emailed so we just overloaded on carbs and like ate a diet where my body got all the
nutrition it needed yeah like so a lot of the stuff that Lauren cooks I believe the same set yeah and then on top of
that there's been like pizzas and ice cream and chocolate okay whatever you want to do to get calories up and then
recently maybe three or four weeks ago we switched to like a keto diet okay so
the idea is that my body now is going to be better at burning fat round and the transition happens now rather than on
the rope okay so I've already experienced sort of like headaches and you would you say you've dropped into
ketosis now that it's probably saying so yeah another cuspid I'm feeling better in on it now yeah and I did get sort of
quite a few headaches and was feeling like dreary and a bit hungover in the mornings and stuff and then also you
yeah I was just you know it's been nicer on the based diet rather than like that
car be sugary stuff because I think that you're awful really yeah and now I'm coming out with the transition as well it feels I don't feel a lot more
energetic and so healthier um because I think that's I mean for a lot a lot of people who have had to suffer the pain
of fat and protein diet that's for most people really uncomfortable mm-hmm they
don't like the fact that they don't have that starch yeah and if bulky satiated feeling that you get that comes along
with having carbs hmm so that's the that's the diet side so yeah I said of training what have you been doing to
prepare a lot of time on a concept to I'm gonna guess yes there is that I mean it doesn't really crossover that much to
ocean rowing so really yeah and the two hours set on a concept to I can pull the
fairy commas which is a good pace but then when I first got my boat I rode it
from the time bridge to the Royal Keys which is eight miles and it took me two hours oh wow so the weight of the boat
how slow she goes in the water and all that sort of stuff like it makes it so much different to the concept to you but
you're not going to do any damage beyond the concept to so it's a nearest you can get to it without getting on the boat so
a lot of to our sets one-hour sets rode through the night one time did like 70 K
in one saying that was it the gym across a time side yeah and then most
the time it's just sort of general prepared Fitness with Lauren so training most days together in mornings we just
didn't like CrossFit Li silver stuff so a lot of functional movements and so that I thought I was obviously thought
there'd be a lot more row specifics about genuinely thought he would just be yeah just spent the last six months our
concept to and then some accessories work but it would appear that yeah they cross over from doing more functional
stuff actually appears to be more beneficial in yeah I think so I'm looking at like that talus the race like you like going back to you people take
that pretty seriously and people train for it or have training for it with this
like the thing you've just said they're like sat on the concept to you yeah most is a trying yeah and then doing a little
bit of accessory stuff and it hasn't really worked as well really as people that have come in recently with like a
endurance sports background who have done more so the functional training and then they've done a bit of little bit so
well-rounded azar Feliz yeah so I think it's more like training for the Marines world she like you've sort of ready for
anything like they were good sprint no you strong gym nasty and all lots of stuff in there and I think you know
that's definitely worked well I've been into robust as you can possibly be I suppose it must make the training as
well building up to something that is going to be a bit monotonous the fact that you can go in and one day do rock climbs and one day do pull-ups or one
day do concept too and then yeah I mean like it yeah well my thought is to save the monotony for the after all the event
itself it sounds like it's gonna be a little bit yeah yeah I'm a happier that I could sit in a row before for like 14
hours or whatever I've done it before yeah I'm happy I can workout for 18 hours having done it before and like I
said the Rose more mental than it is physical like it's gonna be debilitating and hard work and all that sort of stuff
but I think like the overriding rule or mantra in my life is is always somewhat worse off than yourself yeah and yes I
think whatever situation you're in is not that bad if you keep our minds I'm not sure there's gonna be very many people on the
planet they're gonna be doing as many hours day Niyazi self during that period yeah there's a crazy crazy thought he thinks
seven billion people on the planet and you will be easily in the top not 0.1% of people working out for three months
yeah it's nice well there's a famous Brad Wiggins explains the Tour de France
by saying it's the only sport event on the planet wait neither hair hair cut halfway through like 93 also but it's
also apart from the working out side of things like I have to be a carpenter an electrician a water make it specialist
all these different things because if anything breaks on the boat there's no one to fix it but me you've
said to me that one of the first things that you said about the race was you need to be able to take apart and put back together every single element yeah
it's upside down in the dark so wow it's pretty stalkers to talk us through the vessel of the boat talk us through what
is so she's 24 feet long there's a cabin at the front and at the back that are
both enclosed in airtight right the one at the back is the one I sleep in it's about there's basically coffin
dimensions it's like six foot by two foot built for you how many much else means very much yeah and in in the cabin
I've got sort of food a memory foam mattress and sleeping bag and then I've got like the GPS the radio the thing
called a is which is like an indication system that tells me and other ships who each other are right and I should say
stay away from me your release yeah then the forward cabin front of the boat is
where I'm gonna have it's mainly for storage you can't really get in there and it's just going to store things like
the parachute unclear and all that sort of thing right and then the deck itself has got to Rome positions and six oars
why that's it why two wrong positions just sauce basically so Mike boat can be
rode by one person or two people right and and there was not to you to like condense the two positions into one just
as a sake if I miss early or over so don't mean to but then we talked about with a project manager that when they as
I get halfway through and I've eaten half of the food and obviously half of the the weight of the boat was disappear is yeah it would
be nice to have the opportunity to either owe more forward or more back at the boat so I can affect the boats to
believe in the water yeah because ballast it's like a big thing with those boats so that's the
reason we kept the two positions and also just to break up the monotony a little bit yeah I know it sounds really
they're really like a foot apart from each other but just a holiday in the front and one thing in the back I
remember one of the first questions that I asked you and I'm sure that some of the listeners are thinking this as well
the guys the boats that have two or three or four people in them you would
think would be able to get across quicker mmm done a bulb that only has one person in them you have more people
more horsepower yeah but you said that that wasn't strictly the case no and it's been proved in the last two talisca
races so it's all like power-to-weight ratio so they can go faster but they're
carrying more weight and they're doing it in two hours sort of sessions so if we were doing it air for example like
I'd be Roman while you're asleep and vice versa but the pace is pretty much
the same because our boat would it would weigh what it would wait for two people
whereas my boats only gonna have 400 days worth of food instead of 200 days yeah so only one person yeah I've got a
shift less weight so effectively I can keep same sort of speeds yeah over a 24-hour period as we could do in two
hour you know similar segments yeah so in the last two tasks oryx's last year my friend Gavin Hanigan came third
overall as so liberal right the teams of two and three and four Wow and there's a
guy Marc slats who's doing it this year and he's third as a solo and a team you
know never a full of fours and threes which is which just seems so coming Jeff I suppose book yeah when you've got the
amount of food for that many more people and all the rest of it yeah I mean that's just and they're rowing probably
20 hours a day those two server guys just mentioned 20 hours a day everyone about 20 hours a day yeah so what's the
logic behind because obviously that's going to cause I guess a little bit more yeah he ain't playin our next day by me
mark at the moment they've been going two weeks he doesn't seem to have slowed down any yet obviously you can't keep
that up forever so yeah everyone sort of stuff yeah so for me for example I I'm
just gonna road see how I feel and judge everything off off that there's no point in me making like a schedule now that
I'm gonna have to change when I get on the road so I'm just gonna sort of Rover an hour or two in see how it feel if I
feel like you should rest a little bit I will get some food down me the water and stuff and then I feel like I want to
carry on and give it a big stint I will so in for the rowing aficionados out
there have you got an idea of sort of cadence of stroke rate stuff like that yeah so it's a very basic sort of
measure you'd be doing around 18 to 20 strokes a minute and to be honest with
you that's all that really counts for the aficionados out there because the boats like I said before if I do two
hours on a concept to you in two hours on my boat the distance is like half two basically so it was that was a big
eye-opener because obviously you spend the whole time looking at your screen on the concept to think and write if I pull
130 per 500 that's awesome yeah doing really good yeah if it's to blah blah and you're doing all this mass in my
head and then as soon as you get on the boat that just all those other windows so it's just efficiencies and guided by
your stroke rate and 18 to 20 sustainable for 100 days and that feels
about right to you as well yeah it feels nice and also because it's an ocean and not like a river boat a lot of river
rows have talked to me about sort of how it feels now I'm training and all this sort of stuff and it's it's different again from those guys because they're
generally racing on really flat sort of glass like rivers or lakes yeah and they
don't have to deal with whether all that much yeah whereas I'm constantly moving there was fairly rare go in the water
super clean and come out super team so you might put two wars in one you know you catching crabs straight away or yeah
your guests pull back hands or pull down onto your thighs since I think trolls rough a lot of
people that we've seen rowing on what before it'll be Oxford Cambridge Boat Race stuff like that which is like yes
like as flies [ __ ] yeah yeah and guys displaying like amazing balance and they're both super rigid and they don't
move around at all yeah and I've seen a video of one of your friends recently other things out on the water at the
moment yeah I saw the video they eat uploaded from the cabin looking at him yeah and it just looks like hills it
just looks like a crazy golf course that yet that he's wrong over the top of mine yeah it's not so for instance I'd like
to describe the conditions he recently woke up in his cabin with his eyes sort of all blackened and cuts all over his
face right because why he was asleep he capsized and it's like a washing machine inside the cabin most of the time so and
it's you said it was sealed right so yeah so he was just backing around with this sort of coffin I woke up with his
eyen sort of bad order like but he's he's the guy I mentioned before Damian
he was just sort of an example of health tackle it so he just sort of laughed it off took it for what it was and he's
just cracking oh he's just cracked on yeah Wow and then later that day I think he was on the deck and it capsized two gaps I was twice in a day man and he said he'd
just sorted it you know he was prepared for that because he'd heard of it before so he's he's like he's how I sort of
like to tackle it and like you look at him and it really sets you up well for for what's coming because he doesn't
like sugarcoat it and make up it's easier than it is at the same time he's just honest like he just says what a bit
it's also glorified yeah and he's not saying are the hardest thing I've ever done in my life and all this sort of thing you're gonna if you go into it
thinking it's not going to be the hardest thing you've ever done you're an idiot so I think as long as
you are aware of how difficult it's going to be it's not gonna be that many nasty surprises but also I think the
amount of people that get into this sort of thing they're not going to do it lightly because they've already filled it out an awful lot of people just
through the madness of saying you're gonna do it I think yeah I think yeah that that video scenario always
explained in full of is a good a good like litmus test I think for the general are no one in the room you know monitor
even we're going crazy and I don't like I know I'm not normal like them against
the grain of what makes people think is you know normal or whatever like that but I just like I said before I I find
value and other things that some people don't and I think that sort of you know as much as people want to progress in
business and see how much money they can make and all that's for stuff that's admirable and its own world but I'm not
made of that sort of stuff like I want to see what I can put up with and why can achieve in other worlds and it's
just so Howard bred I suppose many people read differently yeah so going back to the race so you've got yourself
out of Portugal hopefully you managed to pull yourself away so that you can't drift in of things yeah it's gonna be
finding your feet for the first week to ten days yeah and then what happens ten days in where are we there ten days in
is hopefully set a rhythm I know what in the scenario what my shed you are on the
boat is gonna be more like so maybe roam three hours and rest them for one hour or row and to rest in teeth and you know
although all the jobs on board that you do while you're not rowing say like cooking and cleaning and maintenance
small that sort of stuff hopefully on top of all of that by ten days in and
yeah and just sort of you know making good chunks into the distance so the
guys on the tasks are eggs for example they've been rowing for like two weeks now and they're still only halfway through right I know one that actually
has passed the halfway mark right so it's just that it's known every day it's
breaking everything down into small chunks so if you can cover 60 miles in a day you're doing well as a solo so
that's you know you break that target 60 miles down to 30 miles fact we half-day yeah and just keep on going through it
like that so yeah hopefully by day 10 nothing so they you know a good chunk
into the race a couple hundred miles down and just sort of not really looking
at the miles to go because I'd be a little bit disheartened and the three thousand and odd miles and yeah and then
just enjoying the experience is the main thing for me thank too many people come back from the race and they've treated
the thing is a you know a pressurized race whether they're not really appreciating
where they are what they're doing there's a book I've read recently by a guy called John Fairfax who wrote solo
in 1969 right so he did it basically like compared to me on the bones of his ass like he doesn't have any kid none of
the electrodes for the stereo right yeah yeah definitely he had no food he caught most of his
food that he ate on the road no so all that sort of stuff I've got like fishing rods and a spear gun and as
much as possible I'll sort of try and enjoy the experience yeah rather than just treatment it so sort of never got a volley wallaby yeah
let's come up a few times yeah there Wilson yeah that would be quite cool so
one thing that I didn't understand was how you secure yourself when you can't touch the floor of the ocean for
sleeping so you don't drive okay yeah so you've got a thing called a pair anchor which is like a 12-foot parachute and
it's out on like a 100 meter lane right so you've got a big thick rope
you attached to the boat and then you put the power on cow so that the current obviously that's going underneath the
boat the power anchor harnesses that current then it keeps the nose of the boat basically into there as well yeah
so that your position is held yes you won't gain much distance while you're
under on a parent and ideally you're not going to lose much either and then also in bad weather you can
deploy the power echo and it'll keep there from the boat pointing into the bad weather yeah so that you're going
sort of up and down rather than side-to-side for sure and it it's meant to eliminate the possibility of capsize
but it doesn't but your friends proved in yeah twice a 24 oh yeah so the general rule of thumb is if you've got a
boat that same 3 metres wide if you get hit side on by a wave more than 3 meters you're gonna you going over yeah and
it's the Atlantic Ocean so most of the waves are sort of a or 9 metres okay see
if you hit one sideline you goin over Wow so I think it's important as well for if anyone thing's gonna do and it is to understand
it's how many times you're going to capsize rather than a few of any capsize I've been comfortable with the fact if
it's gonna happen Wow so yeah so in terms of the route that you're taking and you've spoken
about the the streams and the wind that you gonna catch am i right in saying what you said to me that there's gonna
be some times where you may be on the crest of a wave going in the right direction so to speak and you can kind
of almost surf that a little yeah definitely Apple at the right pace too right yeah so in what normal people
would consider bad weather in certain situations for ocean row in it it's really good for you because you'll get
picked up by a wave as you're rowing yeah and then the common thread is the ditch the oars just let go of them and
they'll sit in the gates and they're not going to go anywhere and then you grab your hand steering ropes yeah basically
steer yourself down the wave and you'll pick up maybe like between sort of six and ten knots right which isn't very
fast walking from A to B but surfing down away from this sort of free money source yeah yeah so you're flying along
and then anyone understands surf and obviously waves come in sets so if you're doing that every sort of 10 to 12
seconds you're making up some really really good distance by so a lot of this I guess a lot of the ease of the journey
is going to be dependent on mother nature yeah and also it depends on my for one
of a better term eyeballs is my friend leavin and it's doing whether we're going for the like five
teams are on the talus chorus right now yeah I know is it leaving this house the other night and as we were speaking here to keep
them dashing away they're like funny people on the race and give them their weather office right and one of the
teams who spoke to you or on Parker because the weather was bad yeah in inverted commas so they were just gonna
sit there and write it out and then expect to a four-man team a group of boys from up here actually and they were
they wanted more women they wanted more speed so they were like surfing down the waves as we've just described there so
it's it's it's understanding what bad weather is because there's a fine line between free speed and putting yourself
in the dangerous position for sure um but it's you know so it's nothing what I do you think
ranked on the scale would you say that yeah I'm pretty happy because I mean at the risk of sounding too confident I've
worked on the Indian Ocean for sort of 2 or 3 years and you know witnessed some
pretty bad weather yeah and that was when we were on sort of cargo and cargo carriers and tankers and
oil rigs yeah and we were a little bit worried so that was pretty bad over there so if I experienced anything like
that then definitely not be like a case of buttoning down the hatches and you know surviving yeah but I think most
scenarios it's gonna be sort of harnessing what you've got I'm just going that elusive it yeah so I saw
something online that you posted about a sheepskin seat cover yeah and then someone asked why you had a sheepskin
seat covers yeah and what are you wearing to Rowan so generally I think
eight percent the time people are ballroom naked and leaving they completely naked yeah
so the idea is that a few you could probably test at home if you've got that much time minimums but if you say
difficulty if your fuchsia gets covered in salt water yeah and then it dries out in the Sun the water evaporates but the
salt crystals stay in the material and they're abrasive so obviously if the t-shirts rubbing on your skin especially
with rowing you're gonna end up like sores on your armpits really bad really fast yeah and because you're at sea the salt
gets into the wound and it makes it harder to heal and then obviously because you've debilitated malnourished
all that sort of stuff you body's slower at fixing itself anyway too bad yeah Aravind yeah and that's gonna happen
anyway you've got clothes on or anywhere where there's friction where is the sheepskin because it's soft and fluffy
units like more of a natural fiber it it's better at not retaining the salt crystals and sort of man-made fibers are
so the idea is that you clean it out as often as you can with fresh water and
then it's sitting on that naked is basically gonna provide less friction and roaming in a pair of shorts so if
someone goes past you on a boat yeah they're gonna see and thank you for 900
dead yellow but yeah my my rowing yeah for the first part you you'd wear shorts for that reason the
middle of the ocean there's not many people saw someone on holiday a holiday in a yacht just coming on the Kazak yeah
and but I'll be in a position where I'm not tired okay that's what I was like before so in terms of avoiding sunburn
and stuff like that like even just like the volume of stone cream you're gonna have to take yeah so I use like these
zinc stick things yeah so just stick but I generally through like jobs I've done
in the past I've spent a lot of time in the Sun exposed to it and sort of big chunks yeah so I get used to it pretty
quick and like I said before when I was in Tanzania for a few years it was you
know something to put up with all the time there so you get used to that pretty quick but definitely from the first part I'll be covered up and you
know after a hundred days you'll miss the sunshine you're gonna come back with a wicked time so yeah I'll be quite leathery so fresh water as well like
what is a very very heavy yeah object to take with you how's that working have you got something you can distill on
board yeah so on board I've got a desalinator or a water maker and basically it's
plumbed into the boat so there's a valve underneath the hull like the bottom of the boat and it sucks up seawater and
then through loads and loads of different filters mega high pressure turns it from salt water into drinkable
water doesn't taste particularly great but you know it keeps you keeps you
going when you need it yeah and then also because the type of boat I have it needs ballast just so they set it down
in the water and again reduce the chance of capsizing yeah so in the ballast that's gonna come in the form of about
120 kilos of fresh water just in plastic bowls that you get from the shop sort of
thing and then if the water maker breaks my handheld will make a brakes as well
yeah I've got emergency what was the last mute sort of you know sufficient however long it could any idea where
that would be if you drink any of the fresh water in the balls you can do for a place it with sea water mark the box
so you don't drink it yeah and that way you don't use any ballast your to the print P emergency so that's
hydration what about food food comes in the form of freeze-dried meals the
sponsor that I've got fire-pot company called outdoor food that make that brand
they basically cook their meals and then do you hydrate them right okay so
they're way healthier than some of the other ones out there in the market so I want obviously mention their names but
they're super sugary so you're actually having fully cooked meals that just about the water table yeah and then you
just pour boiling water back in but vacuum pack for bikes yeah leave it for like 15 minutes and
that's rehydrated and it's all like chili con carne ultimate proper soup
yeah exactly yeah and they they're like a thousand calories each meal stuff like that so how much you're gonna be eating
every day so I put four of those every day as well as a snack pack in the snack packs got about 3,000 calories in it
that's a nine pack with three thousand yes it's like lots of I've got loads of nut butter some biltong because
apparently people say that you miss chewing because all their freeze-dried foods like quite sloppy inside there so
the biltong is just basically flesh ripped off yeah and it's obviously like mega snack for protein and then I've got
sort of energy gels there's fat based other than sugary ones and then battling
Spurs and flapjacks and stuff like that it's all work so you eat sort of the moderately well less yeah I think I'm
gonna be hitting about 7,000 calories a day and then the argument is you burn about ten so there's three thousand
calorie deficit every day so that's about pound a day of way yeah exactly going to be losing so what if we say
it's around about 100 days in a hundred days from January 18th yes your weight gonna be I think what do you've got the
vast majority of people that do it say they lose about a quarter of their body weight so that's why I took the jump
from 85 to 112 I aimed at 115 I think yeah but I think I'm about 112 of
minutes and there are there abouts yeah and then hopefully I'll lose over by the time
again if you came back in here at 120 have you realized yet super nice go got
a [ __ ] cut now and that we only got my walk fight you cannot show my comment about the time though yeah well you have
time so tell us about the rupture recovery thangkas everything given here
is based around the charity right yeah so to get a bit candid maybe a little bit sort of controversial i generally
you know a lot of other people wanna bring to the fore how much PTSD is
ignored I think people that come back from Afghanistan
injuries physical injuries are pretty well looked after now they don't get the
the best care that they could possibly wish for but it's it's pretty good so if you lose a leg for example you're going
to get process ik and it's going to be a very good sort of standard but
unfortunately the same can't be said for mental health if you come back with a brain injury or with post-traumatic
stress or anything like that you're just not well looked after at all it isn't clear what haven't you you
should be going down to seek help it isn't clear what kind of signs and
symptoms to look out for in people do you like do you think that this is across us UK yes like you like the
suicide rate for sort of veterans is sky-high and a lot of it is because of
you know post trauma sort of incidents that they've experienced or if they've
you know been in high-pressure situations for huge chunks of the lives which Afghan in the right provided you
basically leave the service and you don't have any transitionary sort of support you would just you know one day
you were flying around jumping out helicopters and shooting people and stuff and the next day you're in Waitrose getting annoyed knowing the law
yeah getting in your way when you're trying to apply tomorrow or whatever so it's a really hard thing to come to
terms with especially with the fact that there's no help out there and rocks or recovery is a charity that's sort of
changing with so they're providing help for veterans and the families who have to deal with
PTSD sort of bringing over injuries and stuff like that and it's like a fast action charity as well so if anyone for
example if you had a friend or a relative or whoever that was in the forces that you were worried about you
could call up to recovery and they literally fly up to see that friend or relative and give them like immediate
one-to-one support like there and then Good Samaritan let's put yeah really arias son obviously it cost a fortune so
raising money for a charity like that and trying to raise the awareness of them as well is like really important we
know I think I've got a friend BT or Ella who started that sports in America
which is a wounded and PTSD yeah supporting sport elite so they play like
baseball and a whole bunch of other stuff hmm he gave probably one of the most moving talks I've ever heard about a year and a half ago yeah and he went
through all of the different bits that all of the problems that his friends have had with PTSD he said that he was
one of the guys who'd come out physically injured quite badly but given
the choice between being physically injured and mentally injured he was glad that he was able to he'd lost a leg that
was with his analogy that he - yeah and I think it just sounds so alien the
concept of PTSD and obviously being in that high-pressure situation the level of adrenaline that they'll have
experienced the soldiers have experienced in one day of combat will be more than most people experience in the
air time and like not only that you can get away from the trauma side of things just looking at something as simple as
transitioning from one career to another for most people it's quite stressful but for people like in the backgrounds that
I've sort of encountered you go from this sort of high level like you know
whether the level of octane the adrenaline and all that other stuff that you're experiencing on a day-to-day
basis it goes from like a hundred to zero yeah and you're expected just to
deal with that and what you're used to the people that like people around you
their behavior that you used to that changes all of a sudden as well so you can't rely on people to you know treat Li the same way or
anything like that so you've got a you've got to transition your heads and like the way you act and everything you've ever known completely change that
without any certainty yeah at least and like if you're joining the military and
you're you know you're doing that role reversed so you're going from a very sedentary lifestyle and all that sort of
stuff and they're joining the military they take always the years to train you up to understand it that they can then
send you to war and then when you come back from war and you want to go back into like civvy Street you're just sent
there you don't get silly transverse things that they died down but they don't have any like you backups exact week so like that has a massive effect
on how people act on their reactions to things like how they process stuff in the heads and there needs to be help for
that there's like at the moment there's no prosthetics for the moment but if people whose legs or lose arms or
something they can get those limbs replace the R obviously nowhere near as good as haven't you the original paper
whatever but this like I said there's no prosthetic for the moment so the more help that people can provide by using
these carriers like Rupp to recovery you know ones like it it's it's super important to get to a point where people
aren't running out of options and they're arriving at the door suicide and people are losing their families and
enfant sort of things so so that's the goal is to raise as much money as possible where you ought to yeah so
we've I've raised about five grand for them so far the bulk of the money that's going to come from the row itself will be while
I'm away I've experienced in the build-up to the event itself that you're
taking far more seriously when you sort of you know you tell people you're gonna do it and then that sort of dies off a
bit then you buy a boat and that like think makes people think Jesus is actually gonna go through with it so yeah and all the trains and all that
sort of stuff yeah so I think as soon as I set off that would be a big thing yeah
and then also one of the founders of the the charity foxy and is on TV quite a
bit with there ses program on channel 4 I know he's got another program coming out about drug
cartels and stuff like that in Venezuela only he's not gonna make it
one of them a you when you're over now yeah well he gave me a load of heads-up about what's Menace was like at the
movies is basically a failed state pretty lawless yeah yeah so getting there is gonna be interesting yeah you might just go fight in the ball
turret right give me some give me some more food not going back yeah he's he's basically gonna help sort of spread the
message and all that sort of stuff and yeah I think like I said well I'm actually out on the road that's when they're sort of the money he'll come
chuckling in them and the BBC you're gonna do an interview on the 5th of January and then one of the main
sponsors is making a documentary so I think in terms of raising money there's
about sort of the next six months is going to be the big they did a big big push yet yeah so in terms of you've got
rock to recovery on there I know that you've got my protein as well who else have you got on that this song yeah so
the two main sponsors are true potential yeah they're an investment firm based in
nubbins they're northeast based company and then the other one is airfare and they're basically a flight claim flight
delay compensation company both owned by friends of mine and that brings a
northeast basis or companies as well so you taking a good sort of local bit yeah so that's like that's an important thing
for me I wanted to get some of people in the local area involved in it there was a story in The Chronicle and all that
sort of stuff and like I said before BBC Look North are going to come do it a future on it so have you found it difficult because you've said that you a
little bit of verse to kind of put yourself on a pedestal when searching
the accolade that's a little bit more extrinsic and stuff yeah have you found it uncomfortable to have to be the
Instagram story guy the constant update guy because as we've said when you when
you publicize these milestones and the build-up to it and presumably throughout as well when
you do those you kind of battling against two things there one of them is it'll raise more money for the charity
and generally a variety about the race is good but on the flip side of
you're maybe doing something that naturally you wouldn't have a preclusion to do yeah and it's really I did a blog
post about it recently because it's sort of you know it's one of those things I don't berate anybody that does it and
that builds their profile and that's what stuff because generally they're doing it for good reasons and I do
understand that the more people I tell about the road the more exposure the charity gets in the more money that we
raise and all that sort of stuff but also at the same time I've chose to do the road solo for a reason like I like
my own company I like my own space and I like being able to do things without any
sort of fuss and stuff like that yeah and I also strongly feel that in terms
of like raising money before the road and telling people what's gonna happen before the road to me it's sort of it's
not important until I've completed the task it's one thing to say you're gonna do it but actions are remembered long
after words are forgotten so actually completing the challenge we're coming back and having the story
for me is way better than going what I'm telling everyone you're gonna do it yeah there's obviously seven years worth of
me preparing for an Atlantic Rome has seen me see like send me his worth of
other people preparing yeah and the amount of people that put it off for a year or don't actually follow through
with it or set all these big promises and failed yeah it's crazy so I don't want to put myself in that
position where I'm telling everyone I'm going to smash it and I'm gonna do this and I'm gonna be this guy and I'm gonna raise this much money and all that sort
of stuff before it's actually done I think I'm in a better position to talk about it and raise the profile once I'll
actually achieve the milestone yeah then to talk about it before it happens yeah
it's just it's one of those things it's a world we live in it requires that sort of excitement and
beat up and big hoopla that social media is now yeah and hope left and alright
job of it so far but I could always obviously use like more shares and follows and all that sort of stuff so
what wow that you're on the roll if people want to keep up-to-date with what
you're doing yeah is there going to be you got access to Twitter if you go so how can people keep up there's a
thing called a yellow brick tracker that people will be able to download the app for that and follow me on like a google
map sort of french like a Google Earth image and they'll be a little like arrow which will be me making like a really
slow progress across the data and then also I can facebook and tweet using that
device as well uh-huh I can send photos and stuff and perhaps the odd video I
was gonna say cos the guy yeah who tumbled over he had would like it look like a GoPro sort of thing yeah it to
the front yeah so there is it capability these days for that that sort of stuff but it's just it's very sketchy with
satellite comms if anyone's ever had experience with that stuff it's hard to get the videos up and out well when you can't get 3G in the middle of exactly
the area trying to get video in the middle of your house but it should be good I think it's one of those things that you sort of you start sending on
Tuesday morning and it actually goes up on Friday afternoons yeah I'd be like that um but yeah I mean it'll be a blog
every day and all that sort of stuff and then Lauren's gonna control the social media stuff alright yeah thanks for
stuff like that ceramic so we're gonna have to be careful especially feeling naked of just what foot does end up going up yeah yeah well so so I've
joined everything to a close where can where can we find more
information about the role over the next the next few weeks and then once once everything's up and running working um
came up to down the story if everybody goes and checks out rock through recovery UK on Facebook and Instagram
it's just a prop to recovery UK and it's a number two not ta so go look on that
or if you go to any of the platforms and put in Atlantic soda juice into it Facebook or Instagram and that be links
there towards the fundraising pages to hand road to recovery and then basically
like I said I'll release like a page that people can follow while I'm on the road yeah like a week before I leave so
that I'll have the track of information and everything on there and yeah it's
not really the best way to follow it the fantastic well thank you very much for coming on I'll make sure that all of the links to
everything you've put in here tore up to recovery to the links to follow yourself will be in the description because look
man yeah all I can say exactly my appreciate from me yeah thank you very much Cheers
