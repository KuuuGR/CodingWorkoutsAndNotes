Intro
this week we're going to do something different on this podcast this podcast is about this podcast so many of you
have asked me questions about this podcast how it works how big the team is how we pick and find guests how we make
a successful podcast how you can build a successful social media channel or personal brand and also
how much money you can make from a podcast at the end of the day i just sit
here and talk i get to have interesting conversations with people i genuinely find interesting so i think people
typically assume that having a podcast is just a labor of love now that is true
i don't do this for the money i'm fortunate enough to have made a lot of money from the first company that i
founded i do this because i love it of all the things of all the revenue streams i have in my life podcasting is
my lowest financial return on the amount of time it takes me however this podcast will make millions
this year so this week i'm going to tell you the truth about everything after all
this podcast was founded on truth and honesty and i've not seen any other podcasters tell you the things that i'm
about to tell you about this business about this medium and about this industry i'm going to show you exactly
how much money i make from this podcast how i do it how i did it and how anyone else can do it too with
six or seven simple pieces of advice i'm also going to tell you all the non-financial reasons you should
start podcasting even if it never makes you a penny and some of these things are things that i came to learn over time
some of the things i never ever expected and some of the things some of the upsides and benefits non-financial of
starting a podcast have quite honestly changed my life so without further ado i'm stephen bartlett and this is the
diary of a ceo i hope nobody's listening but if you are then please keep this to yourself
[Music]
1. Consistency
so here's the thing i started doing this podcast three or four years ago with a 90 pound microphone that i bought in
apple that i plugged into my laptop i put a duvet over my head 3am in the morning i went downstairs into the
quietest part of my house there was no script no plan no team i
edited it myself i um engineered the audio myself recorded it myself on my own and i sat there and just spoke into
a microphone about my life and in that first episode episode one it was a total
one-off experiment in my mind i never actually thought it would become multiple episodes or a season and that
renowned line that people in the comment section often ask about that i just said i hope nobody's listening but if you are
keep this to yourself was totally random i didn't plan to say that i said it because i was about to share my diary
for the first time and i was unsure how being so vulnerable open and honest would be received so i jokingly asked
anyone listening to keep it to themselves and obviously you guys didn't do that and here we are
three years and 10 months later and the podcast is done very well it's now the most listened to business podcast in
europe it's sat at number one in the charts almost consecutively for 40 weeks straight and as i said it's become a
multi-million dollar business since since i founded it but and here is my first piece of advice if
you're thinking about getting into the podcast game and this piece of advice i guess applies not just to starting a podcast but also
to all facets of your professional and probably personal life i published my first podcast episode three years and 10
months ago but for the first three years i was never ever consistent with my podcast when i started one month i might
release an episode and then there might be a gap of like two months or three months or a couple of weeks then i'd pop up with another episode and then there'd
be a huge gap again and so on and so on and so on and whenever i was consistent
and managed to publish predictably every monday for several weeks in a row the podcast audience would grow and grow and
grow and you could see on the graph that the podcast growth was compounding if i then took a month off
it was almost like i was back to square one again you could see on the data when i had come back from my little hiatus
less people were there to listen so i realized very quickly that if this podcast was going to really work and
reach its full potential then i had to figure out how to be consistent so 10
months ago i made the decision that no matter what we would publish an episode
on monday every single monday and from that point onwards the growth absolutely
exploded if you're watching this on youtube here's the actual graph of listeners from the minute i started
being consistent with publishing the podcast every single monday um the growth exploded by 10x 10 times higher
and as i said this is not a lesson on podcasting it's a lesson on all facets of life whether it's building a business
getting millions of followers on instagram or even getting into the best shape of your life figuring out a way to reach that
point of sustainable consistency was the key to explosive growth and progress that is a fundamental lesson of my
entire life one that it genuinely took me 27 years to appreciate the value of being consistent at almost
anything consistency unlocks everything it teaches you faster than everybody else it compounds growth and as it
relates to content and building audiences it helps to establish a cadence which keeps them coming back for
more if your podcast is once in a while or even broken down into seasons that
have these sort of large gaps between them i seriously believe you're going to have
a really difficult time growing your audience especially organically because
people move on and they forget about you and you fall out of their routine we publish every monday morning at 7am
because i know 50 roughly 50 of podcast listeners listen in transit which means
on their way to work on a flight on a train on a walk or even like on a running machine at the gym so i want my
audience to know that on monday morning before you start your week or as you're getting ready for the week ahead or
during your monday morning commute you can count on me to be there every week
right here and that predictability for your audience allows them to fit you
into their habits and we are all creatures of habit my second piece of advice is also
2. Getting your podcast discovered
a tip about how to grow a podcast and how i grew this podcast when this podcast started it was me alone in my
bedroom always in the early hours of the morning stumbling around with a wire my laptop in this cheap little microphone
and i loved that i'm so happy that's where this podcast started it was great
but me talking about myself to my existing audience was never going to grow this podcast significantly in an
organic way in order to grow this podcast i had to find a way to reach new audiences and to pull them in so i
opened up this podcast to other entrepreneurs to successful people to the guests you've seen to come here and
share their diary in the way that i did when i started this podcast and those guests bring their audience with them
and the podcast started to grow faster and faster and faster faster than ever before it turns out i actually also
enjoyed that a lot more because i got to meet amazing people learn from them and be inspired by their stories but it also
saved me tons of time when i did it on my own i would honestly spend seven or eight hours planning and writing each
episode i had to do bullet points and figure out how i'd move from one bullet point to the next and then if i wasn't
happy i'd re-record the bullet point to try and nail it it took a lot of time having a guest means i could just walk
in sit down ask them the things i'm interested in and have a great conversation which now takes me just two
hours to record and as i said i find it significantly more enjoyable because i get to learn from this incredibly
diverse range of incredible inspiring people from all walks of life and i think generally you guys enjoy that too i know
some of you guys still love the solo episodes but i think generally it's really enjoyable to get a really diverse
range of inspiration from unexpected guests that a lot of the time you've never heard of before
and i in that format i still get to weave in my own thoughts and ideas into every episode although it is centered on
the guest if you want to grow your own podcast and you don't already have millions of followers you need to figure
out where this growth is going to come from where that organic growth is coming from because spotify and apple podcast
stores and apps don't have any viral discovery you can't just hit retweet or share in spotify um and send it to all
your friends like you can on other social platforms like instagram facebook and twitter the vast majority i'd say
over 95 of the discovery of podcasts new podcasts happens outside of the spotify
apple podcast store it happens on social networks it happens in whatsapp group chats it happens in
real life by sort of face-to-face word of mouth recommendations so to grow your podcast you need to figure out how your
podcast is going to reach a new audience and do it often and for me this is achieved in two ways as i said by
bringing guests in but also by having the youtube channel there's a lot of content discovery happening on youtube
every time you watch one video it recommends another and sometimes that video is going to be the diary of a ceo
so we get a lot of new listeners coming in through the youtube channel and in future they might decide to listen on
apple or spotify or to stay on youtube okay my third piece of advice is actually a bit controversial
3. Maintaining a high quality of work
it's really important in all aspects of your professional life to find the right balance of having consistency and
quality at the same time and if you know me you'll know that i'm someone that is an absolute stickler for quality if
you're one of the many thousands of people that has worked in one of my companies or alongside me or with me over the last 10 years you will know
this to be true my job as a ceo or a founder or marketeer or a creative is to
set a high standard for the quality of work we produce as a team and to protect that standard like a hungry guard dog
and honestly if you think the standard is too high for you or you don't like me because i'm
uncompromising about that standard then that doesn't matter to me because i'm not here to be liked first and foremost
i'm here to produce high quality work with a high degree of integrity and work
that we can be proud of everything else is a secondary bonus everything that is
why we are here that is our central mission and i never confused that with that said
on multiple occasions i've invited a guest to this podcast recorded a full episode with them and then i've deleted
the episode and never published the episode because i didn't think it was a valuable enough conversation to share
with you guys as my audience i genuinely feel a deep sense of responsibility to all of the people that listen to this
podcast because i know that you show up every single monday and often give me two hours of your time listening to
someone you've probably never heard of before and you're trusting me to find interesting people and have a valuable
conversation and to give you that value on your monday morning so on several occasions even on one occasion
when the guest was a mega star with tens of millions of subscribers of their own
which obviously would have done wonders for this podcast going back to the point i just made about leveraging people's audiences
i realized that the conversation was not valuable enough to share it with all of you and that was because for a number of reasons
because it lacked insights because it lacked inspiration it wasn't an intelligent conversation it was boring
and it didn't meet my standard so i deleted the episode told the guest why and we moved on in fact that even
happened this week i tend to think my listeners are somewhat like me um
you must be because i ask questions i'm interested in to guess and you're clearly interested in those things too so if i found the conversation with a
particular guest to lack value or to be boring then i know you will too and keeping that trust with you to me is so
unbelievably important it's not nice for a guest to have their episode of a podcast deleted and i'm
sure some of them have been a little bit pissed off historically um because i might have wasted their time i imagine if i was in their position and i went on
a podcast i traveled to it and then i found out that it had been deleted i would be annoyed too
but as i said all of this stuff to me is secondary to producing a piece of work that me and my team can be really really
proud of and if we're not proud of it then you won't ever see it um and that's the standard that will always maintain
it's not happened a lot i've got to be honest maybe three or four times um in almost 100 episodes but it's an
important point and i think having a standard drives all of the other work you do up so even though we've only
deleted four it's definitely meant that we've set a higher bar for ourselves as a team because we know that it's
possible that episodes can get deleted if they're bad and and so we do a lot more work
beforehand to make sure the guest is right and the themes and conversation are going to be right too my fourth point is probably the point
4. Money
you guys want to know about the most which is money okay so
as i said i only started doing this podcast once a week 10 months ago that's when we made the decision to take it
seriously and to be consistent before then before 10 months ago the podcast was basically just a hobby 10 months ago
when i realized i was going to do this podcast once a week and launch this youtube channel which meant videoing the
podcast for the first time and really really really go for it i realized i would need camera equipment a location
to film it and a team to help me put this whole thing together i've never ever cared about making a profit from
this podcast this fits into the things i do because i love it bucket in my life and my goal as i said to the team at the
time was just to break even jack sylvester who i produced this podcast with made a shopping list of all the
equipment we would need to make a high quality production and the total for all that equipment came to roughly 4 000
pounds i saw that list and i said to jack jack i want you to really go for it i want to produce one of the best
podcasts in the world come back to me with another list that is even more ambitious a few days later jack came
back to me with an equipment list that cost forty thousand pounds which is about fifty five thousand dollars he
wanted seven cameras some some of them are robots that move by themselves up and down the room some of them are
sliders we've got gopros state-of-the-art audio software we've got the best
microphones the best lighting black uplines you name it it's here and we and we really obsessed about the small
details of this room the set and how it would make you feel and how the feel of the set would impact the content itself
additionally if we're going to publish four podcasts a month across video and audio and then promote these podcasts
across social media with video clips but also find really high level guests we're
going to need a team so here's who i hired jack who produces the podcast i also have a full-time podcast booker
called harry who contacts potential guests i have a full-time pr manager emma berta who produces the video assets
and clips from this podcast and other projects callum who produces more video clips for the podcast grace who handles
the social media across all of my channels don my manager who works with sponsors and on brand deals and of
course sophie my long-standing assistant who helps me organize my diary and logistics across all areas of my life
so in total i have a team of eight people that are involved in the production of this podcast in various ways it's not cheap especially if you
want to do it properly and you don't have to do it on this scale podcasting can be
remarkably cheap especially if you don't want to video it you can start with what the 100 microphone like i did as long as
you have a laptop and edit it yourself and record it yourself you can do it over zoom but because i wanted to do it
big i knew i needed to find a way to make money from this podcast people had historically told me that there is no
money in podcasting they'd shown me the depressing numbers that you'll see if you google the term how much money can
you make from a podcast and those numbers work out the revenue potential based on how many downloads or listeners
you're getting and then they offer you some kind of dollar per download and i read on google when i was starting out
with my podcast that you could make 25 to 50 per 1000 downloads which meant if you
got 100 000 downloads per episode i'd make 2 500 to 5 000 somewhere in that
range obviously this wasn't going to cut it most podcasters make their money from
reading out adverts in the middle of a podcast episode and most podcasters get these advert deals from some kind of
podcast advertising company that acts as a middleman between the podcaster and the brand
and the brand is basically paying them on a dollar per download basis the issue
with this right is that the middleman is taking a big big cut and the brand is
paying a fixed fee per download regardless of how good your show is who you are or how valuable your audience is
the brands are basically handing the middleman a bag of money and saying get me podcast downloads as cheap as
possible and then they're coming to you and offering you some reduced rate so point number five is the approach that i
took i knew the typical way of monetizing a podcast was never gonna be enough to cover my costs so i cut out
the middleman here's what i did i made a list of five companies that i genuinely use every single day and have done for
years companies that have helped me in various aspects of my life and all companies that i really loved in terms
of their mission and values i made a nice little presentation deck which was just two and a half slides long showing
my audience the growth and i got hold of the email address of the ceos of those
five companies i sent them all an email explaining exactly why they should sponsor this podcast my ambitious plans
for the future i told them that i was a customer of their brand proved i was a customer and i told those companies that
i would make this podcast the number one business podcast in europe if they backed me and i would do it within 12
months all five of those companies replied one of them was the ceo of a company called huel a guy called julian
hearn and he called me the next day offering to support me this podcast he knew i'd been a customer for three years
because i talked about hewlett all the time anyway he knew every single word i was going to say about huel would be the
truth and he's never ever ever told me what to say how to say it what to
promote or anything like that at all he simply believed in me he backed me he liked the show and i guess because i'm a
genuine pure customer he knew i would be a benefit to his brand and no i
am a huge customer i realize creators and influencers say that a lot because they have to that's what they're getting paid to say but no i'm a super customer
i have two fuel fridges in this building alone that i'm recording this podcast in now six tubs of it over there on my
fridge um if you opened up the cupboards you'd find heel products it is the reason that i'm in the best shape of my
life it saves me huge amounts of time which is the most scarce and important thing in my life and it keeps me 10 out
of 10 healthy a few months after healed back to the podcast i actually asked julian the ceo if i could invest in the
company too and i ended up being a pretty significant investor in the business and i also now sit on the board too so a really really amazing
relationship and one that is based in authenticity and that's all because i cut out the
middleman and i went directly to the brand that i loved with a really compelling pitch and a very ambitious
plan for the future it's not often or typical that a creator or an influencer goes and pitches
themself to a brand but i swear if you have the gut skill effort and hard work to do that you can get amazing deals and
deals that are authentic to you and for me that was the most important thing another company that replied to me was
fiverr the same thing they believed in me i'd actually worked on a project with them before i used their products i've
used fiverr across a whole host of um portfolio companies that i'm involved in i use it for everything from graphic
design to video to audio editing to translations you name it i contacted the global marketing director who i'd never
spoken to before found him on linkedin i told him about this podcast i hopped on a zoom call with him sent him some stats
around the podcast told him about my plans and they said they'd sponsor the podcast too again they've never told me
what to say how to say it they leave me alone and that makes everything much more authentic and and much more honest
and i think i think you guys can tell lastly my third sponsor is my energy my newest sponsor an absolute phenomenal
british success story co-founded by a remarkable entrepreneur called jordan brampton some of you will know i've been
a big advocate for sustainability ever since i sold my range rover sport and replaced it with an electric bicycle and
my energy are at the very forefront of british renewable ecosmart technology in
my mind they are the british version of tesla and so i reached out to jordan because their values and missions are
completely aligned with mine i asked if they would support the podcast and they too after a zoom call and a few chats
said they would love to and my relationship with my energy has got closer and closer and closer and i'm now
involved in a lot of other things within that business too i asked all of my sponsors for a 12-month contract which
allows me to plan further ahead and to forecast into higher and i genuinely
have such a amazing relaxed trust-based relationship with all of them which means i have that freedom to speak about
my relationship with their brand in my own way in my own words and that as i said is incredibly incredibly important
to me it also means that this podcast has never felt like a job no one hands me a script and tells me what to say i
do it in my way and that's integral the psychology proves that's integral to enjoying something the minute it starts
to feel like a job and you lose that autonomy typically that's when motivation declines and this as i said at the start
of this podcast episode fits into the bucket of my life that is called things i do for fun i don't want to compromise
that if if i ever feel that is compromised then maybe the podcast would stop outside of those key sponsors that i've
mentioned i have the odd brand collaboration or opportunity maybe once every other month which i might mention
on the show from time to time and my three key sponsors and my other sponsors pay varying fees depending on what i do
for them but all in all this year this podcast will generate over 1.2 million
dollars which is just over 100 000 a month so it turns out the naysayers i
encountered when i started were wrong and there is money in podcasting and you can turn it into a really lucrative
business my last point is a bit of a bonus point and that's about why i wanted to do the podcast in the first place and since
5. Why I started and new reasons to keep going
launching it the new reasons why i carry on doing it um i started the podcast because i believed in the medium of
podcasting to communicate ideas and to tell stories and to connect with an audience in a world now where everybody
is so obsessed with reach like 1 million views 1 million impressions podcasts sat
alone as a different channel because it offered depth when i started the podcast i was also making videos on facebook
watch and i remember making four videos that ranged between 3 million and 33
million views on average those four videos did 10 million views each the views were staggering huge view
numbers however the videos were like two to three minute kind of viral
semi-forgettable highly relatable videos that after watching most people never
really remembered ever again and one of the sort of like real world measurements that i have about how much the content i
make online is connecting with people is when i meet people in the streets or on a train or an event what they mention
and people never ever mentioned my facebook videos and so for me that meant that those facebook videos weren't
connecting with them at any real depth when i started the podcast although at
the very very beginning i was getting thousands of listeners i would get stopped all the time
even though it was doing a hundred times less the views as my facebook videos were when i was getting stopped in the
streets it was getting a hundred times more mentions and the essays i was i
would get in my dms the the the long sort of anecdotal explanations about how it impacted people meant way more to me
than getting a really big reach number and so i made the decision that i found the depth much more enjoyable um it was
having a greater impact and when i'm producing content that i hope will help people i think of it in terms of the
time it takes me versus the impact it has and in that department podcasting sits absolutely alone the audience is
smaller than the viral videos i used to make but the impact is a hundred times more profound none of you can remember
the last thing you saw on instagram you can't remember the last photo you tapped the last reel you watched but all of you
can remember the last movie you watched on netflix and i think that's the perfect example of how reach can be quite meaningless but depth can be
incredibly impactful it stays with you and for me podcasting an hour long and two hours long sometimes at real depth
on very emotional topics has a tremendous amount of impact which makes it all for me incredibly worthwhile and
the other really unintended consequence of doing a podcast was it forced me to
to keep a diary to then sit down at the end of the week and look at that diary and to reflect and to take lessons from
my experiences we all go through life experiencing things those that stop look
at what's happened pick it apart analyze it and form conclusions on it will learn
more in the same amount of time because they're taking more from their experiences my diary keeping a diary
analyzing it and taking lessons from it genuinely made me smart it genuinely
helped me understand myself it grew my self-awareness and even if i didn't have a podcast or an audience i would
recommend that everybody does that journal have something where at the end of the week or at the end of the day
whenever you want to do it you reflect on the experiences you've had and you extract the maximum amount of learnings
from them i never expected that but being forced to produce content whether it's on instagram or a podcast or on
youtube um really accelerates how much you learn learn about the world learn about the topics you're discussing but
most importantly learn about yourself and the other really unintended consequence of starting a podcast
especially one that's now videoed is it's helped me sharpen my sword in terms of my skills in terms of how i speak
communicate my ideas present on camera and those are skills that are so
incredibly important in the day and age we live in especially in the social media era so i would deeply encourage
everybody to find some type of way especially if you're young and you're growing up in the social media era or if
you're someone that wants to improve your confidence or get better at sales i would find a way to create a pact with
yourself like a promise my promise is i have to show up on monday and make this for you create a pact where you have to
consistently produce content as i said it improves your ideas it improves your
ability to speak and it also helps you on camera which is an important skill in an era where everything seems to be
recorded and the other really unexpected upside of having a podcast and inviting guests
on was you genuinely make amazing potentially lifelong friends
there's this ted talk i watched probably about four or five years ago and it's um i think it's called like the 35
questions to fall in love with somebody and it's basically this list of 35 questions that if you ask somebody and
then spend four minutes staring in their eyes apparently you're supposed to fall in love with them now of course that's
but there's real psychological evidence to support why
that would help you connect with somebody and the truth is as humans when we open up to somebody else and they
open up to us it's been proven that it's easier to connect with them so after
sitting here for two hours with a guest that i've never met before talking about their childhood and things they've been
through and their mental health problems and their struggles and their dreams and their ambitions after the podcast finishes filming
honestly in like 90 percent of the time i feel like they're my mate and they
genuinely 90 percent of the time will say to me let's go for dinner let's go for a you know and they genuinely mean
it and i genuinely do like you know i had reggie yates on the podcast never met him before a couple days later i'm at his house and i'm having dinner at
his house liam payne never met him before came on the podcast was at his house two days ago and we're genuinely really good friends now and it's the
same with all of my guests i go to their birthday parties i go to their their weddings sometimes we become really
really really good friends and it's because we connected from a place of vulnerability i never expected that and
for me that is reason enough to launch a podcast it expanded my professional network but it also expanded my
friendships and that's really what i wanted this podcast today to be about i wanted you to know that you can start your own podcast and even if you don't
go for the full production studio like i have you can make enough money to live off think about it i get paid to sit and
chat with other people that i think are amazing that is a unbelievable privilege so what are my
plans for the future of this podcast if you know me you probably already know the answer to that question i want to take it to another level as you may have
seen we launched the diary of a ceo live which is our live event and we we sold out manchester's albert hall we had
thousands of people there and it was i think i'm safe to say totally
unexpected a big production it was theatrical in its nature there was sort of like special effects and stuff video
music it was all there and it was a really really honestly one of the most powerful evenings of my life over the
last five years maybe the most powerful thing i've ever done maybe and we're now going to tour that across the rest of the uk coming to five
uk cities first and foremost which i'm going to announce shortly
and in other elements of this podcast we're going to continue to take it to another level guests are going to get even better production's going to get
even better and hopefully i'm going to get even better too and most importantly we're going to continue to be consistent
at something that we all very much love doing this was a very different episode this week i hope you enjoyed it i wanted to
finally answer some of these key questions around this podcast and just be completely honest with you and i'll see you again next week we've
got another great guest coming in and i can't wait [Music]
you

Transcription:

Intro
ali abdul he is a creator he is a entrepreneur who came first at cambridge
and he is a productivity expert the way that i define productivity is just kind of using my time well and working on
things that are meaningful to me and optimizing for happiness i feel unproductive when i know there is something i want to do and i am not
doing the thing because i'm scrolling instagram procrastination is a problem with getting started and so the key to
overcoming procrastination is that little nudge at the start towards actually getting started there are a few a few hacks the one that i use all the
time is the the two minute rule two minutes is all you need to change your life the way i try and remind myself of this
point of i i am enough is thinking and and really trying to internalize that the journey is more important than the
destination we do need a destination but really like am i enjoying myself day to day and am i kind of
living the dream as it were day to day and not and not so much worrying about the goal at the end of it
[Music] productivity procrastination
two things that all people aspiring to success or really aspiring to get anything done
often struggle with today we're going to try and solve that problem today i'm joined by ali abdul he
is a creator on youtube he's got millions and millions of subscribers he is a entrepreneur he's a cambridge
graduate who came first at cambridge and he is a productivity expert and honestly
he's read more books than anyone i think i've ever met on the subject but generally about how to become the best
version of yourself this conversation isn't just about productivity and procrastination it ends
up twisting and turning through a bunch of different topics like relationships and friendships and the meaning of life
and happiness but what else would you expect from this podcast you're going to enjoy this conversation ali is an incredibly
intelligent intellectual compassionate self-aware individual and he's able to
talk in a way that simplifies complex ideas for people like me and you
so without further ado my name is stephen bartlett and this is the dire river ceo
i hope nobody's listening but if you are then please keep this to yourself
[Music]
Your early years
i really start here with all my guests because i think it's so foundation foundational to everything that they then say they're after is getting a bit
of context as to who you are where you came from and the environment in which ali was created
oh interesting question okay so um i was born in karachi in pakistan in
1994 so i'm 27 now and when i was two years old my mom and dad divorced and my mom moved us to
lesotho in southern africa uh it's a country most people haven't heard of it's surrounded by south africa like
landlocked by south africa and we were there for about five six years growing up uh at that point
you know my mom really valued education she was working as a doctor and she knew the educational opportunities in southern africa in the suture were not
great and so we made a plan to move to the uk until we came to the uk in 2003 she started working here as a doctor and
we moved around a little bit in different areas in the uk and it was really in in secondary school uh that i
did in south indonesia essex where i discovered kind of entrepreneurship
under the internet and computers and stuff and basically all throughout school
i'd be the kid getting like decent grades and everything like that but the thing i like i would i would look forward to going home so
that i could do some more coding or tinker on some websites or try and show my services as a freelance graphic
designer or something for five dollars here and there and i was making kind of you know a little bit of money i i lied
about my age on paypal i pretended i was 18 when i was actually like 13 and i was getting like 5 10 from these small
businesses uh here and there and thinking oh my god i'm making money on the internet this is incredible and then as i went through school uh me and my
friends we were all quite interested in the entrepreneurship stuff we were all we were doing like well in school and i was like oh it would be cool to go to
oxford or cambridge would be cool to do medicine but really my passion at the time was
going home and and tinkering with websites and so that was kind of the environment that i grew up in then when i went to
university you know thankfully i got a place for medicine at cambridge which was great awesome experience just on that point there so you you were
tinkering on websites and loving it that's the thing you were like running home from school to do yeah um but then
you go for medicine what was the driving force behind you deciding not to do the tinkering on websites for a living and
going and doing medicine i mean i you said that your mother was a doctor yeah so i think when you grow up in the sort
of environment that i did whereby parents and doctors all of my mom's friends were doctors
everyone we knew had like doctor parents there are so few viable careers where you think you know what am i what are my
job options in life well it's either doctor or lawyer or engineer like it's literally just those three you don't even realize that other jobs even exist
not in like a a way where the parents are telling you this consciously but more like just the
narrative that you absorb from the people you're around is that i could be a doctor or engineer or a lawyer
and so that was always in the back of my mind that oh it would be cool to be a doctor one day and when i was around 16 i can i ask why
yeah i think because doctor seemed like a prestigious thing
and i think i i remember even when i was like six and seven when people used to ask me what i would want to be when i was older i used to say either a
neurosurgeon or a gastroenterologist not even knowing what that meant but it was just like a big word that would make me feel cool that oh yeah and then the
adults that i would speak to would be like oh hello fancy so that in and of itself yeah where does
prestige exist one would assume that it exists in the mind of others like do you know what i mean like so
that's what i if you had said to me i really want to save people's lives i really had a real high desire to like
save lives and then i'd be like okay that's the voice inside but when when it's like status then it was very much
status and prestige and that's the thing that i think about to this day a lot about like now that i've taken a
break from medicine you know often if i'm if i'm having conversations with my mum
the she'll try and talk me back into doing medicine again really and one of her kind of bargaining chips on that
front is oh but think about the prestige you know medicine has a certain prestige around it that being a youtuber doesn't
and that's always like oh you know it's that that side of me that's like well i want to carve my own path i don't i don't care about status and status and
prestige and then there's the other half where it's still like a kind of a narrative going through my life that i
need to optimize for like this sort of old world prestige instead of happiness instead of happiness yeah which is
bizarre isn't it it's completely bizarre yeah this is a strange like it's a cultural thing as
well largely i think with i think with you know my mom dropped out of school when she was seven years old
so doctor lawyer anything with prestige was the correct answer yeah um
maybe that's because this is me just guessing out loud when you come from when you're an immigrant family
one of the actual biggest predictors of happiness was financial security and
being a doctor i was like maybe yeah i think i think that's a big part of it where with my with uh with our parents
generation especially especially as immigrants seeing other people who are happy correlated
with other people who had like a big house and like nice cars and we're going on holidays equals financial success equals oh those
people did well in their traditional career of banking or medicine or engineer or law and the narrative of like someone like
you entrepreneur social media big company that it just didn't it just wasn't really a thing in our
parents generation and you said they're like going on holidays but i think if in go back to my like the
village in nigeria where my mom's from having a good job was actually like survival it was like being able to eat
it was like much more just much lower things on maslow's hierarchy of needs it was just like being able to
survive and that not having a job in an education was like pain from food
no health care no education whereas as you say like in the western world when you grow up here yeah it
means lamborghini and holiday and stuff but so you take that you take that decision
anyway driven by your by an external narrative to go and become a doctor uh external i think
there was also partly an internal narrative and i'm not sure how much of this is me just bullshitting myself but when i was 16 i decided i made a
conscious decision do i want to do computer science and do the tinkering with websites thing or do i want to do medicine
i think what i reasoned at the time was was two things number one medicine is six years
at university computer science is only three everyone says university is great ergo six years is better than three years therefore medicine makes sense
but the other thing that i thought was that it would be more interesting for my life to be a doctor who knows how to code than to be
a coder who knows how to code and it was like really that decision where i realized okay why don't i do
medicine keep the coding website east kind of stuff on the side so that i can eventually do some kind of tech startup
thing related to medicine and then medicine becomes a side hustle in a way before i had the terminology of the frey
side hustle and so it ended up not quite working out that way but but certainly from my first year of med school onwards i knew that i
was not going to be a doctor full time i was going to do medicine for fun and i was going to make money on the side through a tech startup or something like
that and did you try tech startup uh a little bit so in my first year of uni uh
second year of uni i started a company that helped other kids get into med school and then so that was like
in-person courses but then eventually because me and my brother knew how to code we turned this into a software online question bank for the different
med school admissions programs and so that would that was it sort of like you know subscription billing software as a service kind of product
uh which was the closest i got to a tech startup i i dabbled with a few like medical tech things i used to do
freelance app design and web design for med tech startups while i was when i was at uni but when the youtube channel
started and that really started taking off i sort of realized that the thing i actually want to do is is
teaching rather than coding um and then something something that you talk about
in the book is kind of reflecting on your life and figuring out what are your values what is the thing that you have that intrinsic motivation for
and for me i always had that intrinsic motivation for business type stuff and also for teaching uh i used to do
tutoring when i was like from the age of 13 up until now and those were the times where i felt most alive in a way where i was teaching
someone else um and the nice thing about being a youtuber is that it's just teaching at scale and so i think i found that thing
that drives me intrinsically um that so now tech startup is sort of a oh backup option
if youtube channel fails if i get struck off the medical register i can probably start a text startup or
or words to that effect i always find it a little bit weird that someone would just like go on youtube and make a video
How did you become a Youtuber?
you know what i mean like that when you hear about the first time where these big youtubers started whether it's like true geordi who i've spoken to here or
alfie days who i think became like the biggest one of the biggest youtubers in the country like that first decision
to record yourself usually in your bedroom on a [ __ ] camera talking to nobody yep is a little bit weird do you
know what i mean how did it start for you it started for me so
i i harbor dreams of being a youtuber since about 2009. why um because i used to follow uh people like coach schneider
and sam tsui who were kind of youtube cover artists they would produce covers
of popular songs and those covers were amazing like they filmed them beautifully arranged them beautifully and i had a few friends who
are really good at singing and i fancy myself you know i was quite into maths i like the idea of playing multiple musical instruments so i thought i want
to be the sort of youtuber where i can play along to songs and my friends who are actually good at singing can sing along to those songs and that's the sort
of youtuber i want to be and so i sort of had a few like sort of stop starting moments over the
over those like next 10 years kind of trying and failing at this but ultimately the reason i became a
youtuber was because it was content marketing for my medical school admissions business where i was helping people get into med
school teaching them how to do well in these exams and no one was really creating decent content for free on the
internet about those exams there was these kind of corporations creating boring corporate looking stuff
um and i saw that gap in the market i was like great if i can create these sort of tutorials on youtube content
marketing people will watch my tutorials free and if they like me enough they'll sign up to the course
and that's why i started speaking to a camera in my bedroom it was like all right guys here are some tips for
section one of the b-man you know section one is all about critical thinking the 60 minutes and 35 questions and bloody blind here's how you do it
and i was so familiar with that stuff having taught it for five years um that that started to do reasonably okay early
on in the days where i had like 51 subscribers 52 you know refreshing the youtube app every day to be like oh my god i've got another view
um and it sort of morphed from there was there a tipping point where you thought [ __ ] this is gonna be
bigger than the the thing that i intended this to support
yeah that tipping point was my first video that went viral uh and it was a video about how to study
for exams um this was one of those weird
weird things that i look back on where when i started youtube it was in june of 2017.
i knew that i wanted to make this video this sort of how to study for exams evidence-based tips at some point further down the line it was a topic
that i'd researched extensively i like people would come to me asking for help on how to study for their exams there's
actually a whole body of like psychological research on this that we just don't get taught in school around what are the actually most effective
ways to learn and so i knew i wanted to make a video about this but i knew that i wanted that to be like my 100th video rather than my
first video because i knew that i knew nothing about cameras or editing or anything and i reasoned it would take me
a hundred videos of being bad at it before i could make a video that was actually good and i thought to myself to myself okay i
really want to put all my everything into this 100th video so that this video can potentially go big and that's kind
of what ended up happening i think it was my 81st video or something rather than my 100th but that video went viral
i i had like 4 000 subscribers before just sort of slowly building up and then over the next few weeks it just exploded
up to like 20 000 25 000 um and i was getting all these comments from people who knew me in real life being like oh i've seen your video i
didn't realize you're a youtuber and that was the tipping point um which really sort of started that
exponential growth trajectory that kind of you talk about in the compounding chapter yeah yeah yeah about that again
so there's two things there the first this i'll just do them in the order in which i i thought of them um
The importance of consistency
okay because you mentioned compounding there what have you learned from your experience on youtube about the
importance of of consistency um and also from what you kind of what
typically happens with viral videos is just there's it's so impossibly hard to predict the outcome right so a lot of people say a
lot of people on youtube will make videos called how to make a viral video and in marketing it's all like here are the secret sauce here are the secret
principles but in reality you can only you can ha you can guess
a couple of principles but the outcome is hard to predict so what have you learnt about consistency but then also being able to predict the
outcome yeah uh when i was listening to your your compounding chapter i just found myself like nodding along like an absolute
maniac to everything you were saying i think it applies so much to youtube uh these days i i teach people how to be
part-time youtubers and the thing i say is that if you make one video every week for two
years then i 100 guarantee it will change your life i can't put any numbers on it i can't tell you you'll have 100
000 subscribers or how much money you'll be making but i can 100 guarantee it will change your life at the very least
in terms of the skills and the experience and the contacts and the friends you're going to make through that process but you have to put out one
video a week and you have to do it for at least two years um i just asked on that then on that point
there what is it that will would make someone do that
because i mean that's like [ __ ] clean the floor every day for
two years and i promise you'll work out for you like people don't seem to be able to do those
kinds of things without some kind of intrinsic driver so i'm like i'm curious because you could say that to a million
people you could broadcast that through a tunnel and 95 plus will still fail
so what is it that makes people from your your experience but also yeah from your own life makes them do the work
without guarantee of outcome yeah i think again i i feel like there's a bit of a
cop-out because this is stuff that you talk about uh like in enjoying the process and this is kind of the theme of the book that i'm writing around how
you know it's actually quite hard to show up week after week not see any results and not see the views and the
subscribers going up and stuff particularly quickly but the thing that makes it bearable the thing that makes it fun is actually
enjoying the process and shifting away from outcome oriented goals like a certain number of views a certain number
of subscribers and more towards goals that are 100 within our control like i just want to make two videos a
week and if i'm happy with the video then it goes out and in fact even if i'm not happy with the video it goes out anyway and everyone i know who has
succeeded on youtube has had that kind of attitude at some point i just have to get that video out every tuesday without
fail it's not an option it's going to get done and you know like you say in when we talk when we talk about compounding
that that video on day 1 isn't going to do anything the video on day 2 or day 3 or day 24 is not going to do anything
but you find when you're on day 300 and day 600 oh actually all of this stuff has been compounding very very slowly and then
the results happen really really really slowly and then all at once as soon as you just get that one video that that
goes viral that is i think that's the chapter where i talk about the eighth wonder of the world yeah that's it with
warren buffett and my dog pablo being the opposing investor and i genuinely i think i learned that lesson
when i wrote the book when i look back on my life and i thought about all the things that compounded in my favor whether it was like my honestly it's
going to be keeping facts with you my teeth had some problems with my teeth and i thought do you know why and i
probably referenced this in the book like i i hadn't been brushing one of my teeth properly and it never mattered
today or tomorrow the day after but there i was in that dentist's chair but having my teeth [ __ ] pulled out and then my instagram was the same
um health and fitness at the moment the same my business was the same and it just goes to show that it's not those
key critical big decisions we make to drop out it's that like yeah it's that the compounding small almost uh
irrelevant decisions yeah but people don't they because i heard you started working out i did yeah and then you
stopped uh oh so i've had a personal trainer now for the last kind of eight months there you go amazing and uh you
know i've been i've been going on and off with the workout thing since the age of 18 and never done it properly until i got a personal trainer where now i'm
having to show up i'm paying someone 30 quid an hour to basically just be with me while i'm doing stuff
and that has been the thing that's given me the most results uh so
i think whatever like i i find in my life for things for things that i actually care about where i'm like okay i
actually care about becoming a happy sexy millionaire or whatever let me try and figure out ways that will
remove my own need for discipline and willpower from that equation and instead get an accountability buddy
or get a coach or pay a friend 100 quid if i don't do the thing this was what my brother and i did
when we were trying to motivate ourselves i was doing songwriting he was doing stand-up comedy like right if we don't do this every thursday for half an
hour we're going to pay each other 50 quid things like that to remove the choice the motivation the willpower the
discipline that all the more of that can be outsourced to someone else or removed completely the more i find i actually get stuff done
and then i don't have to worry about it cause i'm like okay this is taken care of i just show up i guess you're removing you're moving the mood as
opposed to like removing it you're moving it to another pact like near il refers to it as what you've described as
a financial pact where now your motivation is to not lose 50 quid it's like because that is that's a greater
motivating force than you have within yourself to work out that's interesting is that sustainable
no it's not it's not okay um this is all the stuff that i'm researching for the for for the book at
the moment um and you talk about this as well like in intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and the way that i think of it when i
think back on my life is that everything that i've done sustainably has been because of intrinsic motivation i've genuinely enjoyed the thing
but you can genuinely enjoy a thing and still find it really hard to get started i think that's where the biggest
procrastination comes in for all of us where it's actually just showing up to the gym that's the hard part like once you're there it's kind of easy it's
writing those first 10 words because once you've started writing the first 10 it's kind of easier to enjoy the process of writing the rest of them
and so and so the way i think about it is to get over that like hump of procrastination that activation energy
to get started at that point i will use every tool that in my arsenal to just
just get me to do the thing for two minutes because i think once once you do the thing for two minutes it becomes so much easier to actually enjoy the
process and and and sustain it and and you're so right when it comes to procrastination like that getting started point um i've again just learned
this from podcast guests that i've had near aiella and i refer to him he he said to me one day on this podcast he was like people procrastinate usually
because there's um a great deal of psychological discomfort surrounding starting the task
and a lot of the time especially with a gym or even an essay that psychological discomfort is like you don't have the
answers so i don't know how to use the machines at the gym or i don't actually have i don't feel competent enough to
even write this essay so i'm just going to do the [ __ ] dishes yeah it's like i'm going to hoover the whole house and
anyone else's house that needs hoovering today exactly um you you made a video about procrastination didn't you yeah
Procrastination
yeah break that down for me what's it what's in the video um so the video is called how to stop procrastinating right yeah um
so the the way thing about procrastination basically procrastination is a problem with
getting started um kind of this this law of inertia uh newton's first law that if
something is at rest it will continue to stay at rest but if something's moving it will continue to move without needing an external force and so the key to
overcoming procrastination is that little that little nudge at the start towards actually getting started
and all of the techniques around that like in the whole like psychology research or research around this is just
around making make make it as easy as possible um so reduce all of the friction to doing it if you want to
learn the guitar then have the guitar by your sofa rather than in the wardrobe where you're never going to see it and if it's out of sight it's out of mind
you're never going to do it there's like the external environmental friction towards doing the thing but
then there's also the internal friction it's like those narratives that we tell ourselves the uh the psychological discomfort of going
to the gym that i don't want to see how other people are going to see me though even even having having the wrong sort
of goal like if my goal in writing the book is i already want to hit the new york times bestseller list
then it's really really hard to bring myself to write anything because now every single word i have to write has to be in new york times best-selling word
whereas if the goal is to be honest i just want to write a book i'm proud of that's fun to fun to write that's actually within my control and it
becomes so much easier to get started at doing the thing um so to overcome procrastination we
need to eliminate external friction i.e the environmental stuff we need to try our best to get rid of the internal friction like the emotional side of it
the mindset the perfectionism the the fear the discomfort and then if we still need help there are
a few a few hacks the one that i use all the time is the the two-minute rule which is where i will genuinely convince
myself i'm only gonna do it for two minutes uh and if i want i'm allowed to stop after the two minutes because two minutes is better than nothing but like
95 percent of the time i decide to continue because two minutes is all you need to change your life yeah i should tweet that
that's good so yeah that's really good and i that two-minute thing is fascinating to me because i one of the things that um i see as another
psychological barrier to starting is people view it as like they view the challenge as mount everest whereas
like they've got them i'll say it another way they view the challenge as moving mount everest and really if they viewed it as just like
moving one pebble at a time it becomes such a simple task yeah and i get this a lot when entrepreneurs ask me they say
steve i want to start a business where do i start and you can hear in the question that they see it as moving
mount everest and i'm like well today all you have to do is think of a name
just think of like 50 names make a short list of names and then we'll revisit it tomorrow and then tomorrow maybe think
of you know go and check if the website's available and then we'll revisit the day after yeah and when it becomes that and when it becomes sort of
really small itemized one small step at a time and you're not having to get from
stairs zero to a thousand immediately it becomes so you know the
psychological discomfort fades away it feels achievable and that your two minute rule is doing a similar thing where it's saying well today i've only
got to do just just if i can open the word document and write a title and then we're done you know and so that's fascinating what about
you we're going to see something else there yeah i mean i just just to your point there um have you have you come across the blog wait but why no oh it's
incredible you should definitely interview tim urban when you're in america oh i don't know i literally yesterday went on his instagram and sent
media oh great yeah he's awesome any podcast he's ever been on i've been like this is so sick uh he has a great blog
post series about overcoming procrastination and the way he refers to that that point you just made is that um
there are lots of tasks that are very like vague and icky and you have to be able to uniquify a
task uh and something like start a business is icky something like learn to code is icky because like what the hell
does that even mean like where do you even start whereas brainstorm 10 ideas for a name and pick one of them is a
very clearly defined next action step and so i get this with students all the time where people are like oh i don't
have the motivation to study for my chemistry exam it's like what's on your to-do list study for my chemistry exam that's never gonna happen read chapter
one and answer questions four to five are a reasonable thing a reasonably defined next action step
and so what i do is anytime i find myself procrastinating from something i think okay am i procrastinating because
i actually the task is too icky i i don't know what i have to do because once i know what i have to do i can then do it for two
minutes and it gets done speaking about productivity um as you guys know i'm i'm the biggest fuel
consumer in the world and i have been for many many many years and i always get asked what my favorite heel products
are and i have them here in front of me the first product that i fell in love with with huel because it's nutritionally complete it tastes amazing
i have no time in my life but i also want don't want my diet to be compromised when my life gets really
really busy as it always has um ended up being um is this berry flavor ready to
drink cure that was where that was where my journey with heel began the next product that i fell in love with at huel
was the banana flavor ready to drink for me it just tastes better than the berry and i already think the berry tastes amazing funnily from speaking to huel a
lot of people's favorite flavor is the chocolate flavor i've never taken a huge liking to the
chocolate flavor but to be honest i don't really eat much chocolate in any facet of my life or drink it at all and now the product
which i have every single day without fail and probably because i'm in that phase where i'm working out every day
without exception and i want to make sure that my gains from working out whether it's becoming
more lean or becoming more strong are captured is the protein um here which
has just come out and as you can see if anyone thinks i'm bullshitting about how much i like heal this tub is basically
empty so huel if you're listening please can i have a top-up i will buy it don't worry um but honestly and i say this
with full honesty 100 honesty um i genuinely didn't like protein powders
before maybe i'm lazy not the type of guy that likes to mix things and this is my favorite flavor protein ever the
salted caramel heel which i talk about all the time they also have a ton of other flavors they're all actually on top of my fridge there but i'm starting
with this one i've basically finished it and then i'll work my way through the others and give you a little bit of a review on those i it's such as i always
say in this podcast it's such an honor to be able to talk about a product that you use many times a day i had the heel ready to drink this morning i'll have
this after my workout which is after this podcast and in terms of productivity optim um and operating at
your best then that is what huell is all about you know people talk about how they'll
Maintaining productivity - Gratitude shift
put on their to-do list clean house and it'll sit on a to-do list and clean up that's a certain big thing
and it'll and that'll sit on your to-do list for like i don't know two weeks or whatever but if you do if you time block and write in your this is what i do on
the weekends because so monday to friday my schedule is ran by the meetings and things i have to do so i'm a slave to
the calendar saturday and sunday come around i wake up i'm like
okay i'm like what the [ __ ] how does this thing work yeah i'm like it's empty i've got loads
of things i know i could be doing right now but nothing no one telling me what to do in a in a life of mine where i'm
told what to do every five minutes um so i time block on the weekends which means clean house would become at 11
till 12 i clean the kitchen because then it's like time sensitive
and like task specific and that's that's been an absolute game changer for me
and i also think in the era of working from home yeah where you know people are sat at home they
have uh tasks they have to connect people always ask the question it's almost like we prefer this because like
this is literally like the the three part structure of my book which i've been like i just having in my head for the last last few weeks
where like step one is how do we beat the procrastination how do we get started with doing the thing and part
two of the book is how do we sustain how do we actually keep on going doing the thing and
uh there's just uh so in in in terms of mindset the thing that i found that actually moves the needle is
focusing on trying to make it fun and i really i really like that word fun like i think there's something about the word
fun that is so like childish but also fully speaks to like fun basically means
in intrinsic motivation like something is sufficiently enjoyable that you do it for its own sake rather than for the
fact that you've got a sponsored helping you or you've got a deadline or things like that um there's one
there's one story in particular that i i i often come back to and that's like
sometime last year i was i was working at the hospital it was pandemic season et cetera et cetera and i'd gotten to
the end of like a 13-hour long shift and i was just about to go home uh and the nurse said to me oh ali can you put a
candle in this patient her like iv line is tissued and she needs fluids overnight and my heart kind of sank i
was like oh no like if if the nurse wasn't able to put the cannula in that means there's a patient with difficult veins it means
it's going to be hard to put this in and i sort of had this mindset of like all right then fine
and sort of grudgingly took out the cannula and got all the equipment in a tray
and i like as as i was doing this i there was a patient in the bay next door where they were just like talking to a
family member or something and saying oh you know this hospital has been amazing everyone is so nice and what a pleasure
it is you know freaking love the nhs kind of vibes and i realized that in that moment i was
not being like a good model internally for what i want the nhs to be and what i want a good doctor to
be and there's something that seth godin who uh who i've been following for a while says which is that
it's the difference between have to and get to and so i was considering as like oh i have to put in this cannula and i
remembered that blog post i read from seth godin where he said instead of thinking of have to think of it as get to i realized oh i get to put in this
cannula i get to make a difference in this patient's lives and life and give her fluids overnight so that she's not
gonna dehydrate because of her morning sickness and just that mindset shift immediately
made me feel so much better about it and i was like oh i get to do this who cares if i've been working for 13 hours this is fun this is privileged this is cool
and i put it in and we had a nice chat and i felt really great about it afterwards and now like and so that's
one of the mindset things that i just always come back to if i'm finding myself not enjoying something and
therefore my focus goes i get distracted i procrastinate instead of thinking i have to do this i
think i get to do this it's like a gratitude shift yeah yeah it's like your chapter three or what was talking about gratitude
and we so quickly fall out of gratitude when we become so easy to do yeah when
we become like used to the privilege of our life used to the privilege of our jobs of our relationships of our kids of
our dog we we think well you know we and because and the stoic people talk about this i think i'll probably talk about
this in the book as well because these are just like clearly the only idea that i have put them all in there um how they used to do
that like hedonistic adaptation um exercises to literally take the things out of their life that they've
really valued just to remind themselves of what they had and it kind of seems like um
gratitude is a very important thing have you got like a defined gratitude practice that you do like gratitude
journaling or that kind of stuff so i the gratitude journaling thing um takes place in the notes of my phone
where sometimes i feel the need to remind myself of what i'm really really grateful for i think i do have a
a bias towards feeling grateful all the time i really just get overwhelmed sometimes with like i'll have like a little flash you'll
probably get this when you think what the [ __ ] is this yeah like you know like what the f especially now that i'm
on dragon's den and that was a real vision of mine when i was like 12 years old i'm like oh my this is and i said this in my show
the other day i said um i said on stage in the drive of a seo live i said that um i said to the audience i
said like i think everybody in this room is living a life that you once dreamed of living
but you don't you're not even happy about it because present you
well if present you has told you that future you will be even happier when you get to somewhere else but like this is
it this was the [ __ ] dream and look at you living it look at you as your you know doctors and lawyers and you've got
the job at that brand you always wanted to work for this is it um and i i have to do that to myself sometimes because
yeah um because if not you'll never get there if your happiness is always as i said in
the book if it always lives somewhere in the future behind some goal or at the attainment of some task or whatever it always will be there and that was
certainly the case for me and i from what i read about you where um
you were talking about like outcomes and not being to attach the outcomes sounds like it might have been
similar yeah yeah very much so um i i have to remind myself on a daily basis
as well um to kind of be be grateful for for all of the things um
sometimes like if i if if i'm in the habit of doing like a morning journal i'll like write down a list of three things and it's often simple things like
you know this cup of coffee in my hand or angus or like my housemate and just like you know this nice chat that we had
and i think like like for me if i don't remind myself i i always just think in kind of hustle
mode of like all right cool on to the next thing on to the next thing on to the next thing um but like it was it was pretty cool
yesterday like we we we went on a tour of gymshark hq up north and i was just thinking that i can't
believe this is this is my job like i get to do this for work this is absolutely sick and even now being here
like this is sitting here talking to you is what i get to do for work and if like
i don't know 18 year old me were to imagine being in this position now i'd just been like oh my god this is this is
the dream have you come across a guy called brandon sanderson nope uh he's an author he writes he's my favorite author he does
he's incredible like fantasy novels stormlight archive huge huge uh series
in it there's like a q a phrase that i always come back to around this point there's this like um order of knights
they're called the knights radiant and they have like their like charter their ideals and their first ideal is life
before death strength before weakness journey before destination and it's that final bit of journey before destination
that i remind myself of on a basically daily basis where it's it's kind of like miley cyrus thing
of it's the climb it's not about how fast i get there ain't about what's waiting on the other side it's the climb
and the way i try and i try and remind myself of this point of i i am enough is
thinking and and really trying to internalize that the journey is more important than the destination and i think
we do need a destination like you know the fact that i want to i don't know
write this book or whatever like that's that's a destination but now that i've got that destination of like cool this is the direction i want to go at that
point in a dream world i would just forget about that and now that i'm on the journey i would enjoy the journey on
its own merit because you know as you know once you if you set a goal you hit the god it's like well happiness started the the joy from
that lasts about five seconds and then it feels like nothing even like sometimes it doesn't feel like
anything at all even even for those five seconds um and so what i've been realizing a lot recently is that
yes we're i don't know expanding the team and moving to an office in london and like hiring people and bloody blah blah blah but really like am i enjoying
myself day to day and am i kind of living the dream as it were day to day and not
and not so much worrying about the goal at the end of it one thing that you they talk about as well um is
i think it was either 19 chapter chapter 19 and 20. it was around this thing of you can yeah ambition versus insecurity
Figuring out your values
is this thing that you think you want to do is it coming from within or is it coming from outside of you
and you talk about values like living in alignment with your values do you have any like how how do you
figure out what your values are it's a really interesting it's a really interesting um thing um i think
i think one of the the best indicators of what your values are are from how you feel that's maybe the most
um fundamental human stimuli we have which is how something makes us feel um
slight tangent and i was talking to someone about this yesterday
in the world we live in and as the social media connected from birth generation we don't understand what our
actual true intrinsic values are very easily because even if and this is kind
of a controversial topic but who cares even charity we all think we're charitable human beings
we're not and if you've only got to look back at human history to understand that our
morals are highly influenced by what society's doing at the time because if you go back 150
years i would have been a slave potentially right my family certainly would have in africa like they would
have had a high chance of being slaves and at the time my slave master was not a bad person he
was a good person you know morally sound per you know and and and now obviously that's viewed as being an
awful thing and it's the same within like the lgbtq tqq community that you know
at one time um that was just everyone knew that
believed that being in a same-sex relationship was a terrible thing an evil thing in some
religious um writings now we all accept it to be how can our morals of society has
changed the force that's telling us what's right and wrong what's good and bad what's valued and what you know has
changed that's the only change that's happened so i do believe deeply that a lot of our values um unavoidably come
from our willingness to survive by taking up the values of the communities we live in however when it comes to your personal
values however they've been shaped usually from your parents or early experiences i i
just go on based on how things make me feel and that seems to be the only indication i
have of what's what's true for me and what's not if i'm alone and i watch a video of a
baby um suffering or crying and it makes me sad
when no one's around yep and i'm not having to tweet about my feelings to the world then i would
assume that that is you know you said about learning and sorry teaching you've got enjoyment from that you've always
got i would assume that's one of your sort of professional values or something you value professionally yeah
i've been on a whole like uh quest across the internet over the last few months to try and answer this question of how do you figure out what your
values are um there's this like program with a life coach that i even did which is like just just finishing up where
um one of the exercises was to like go back to your childhood and
think about kind of on a scale of kind of minus 10 to plus 10 uh minus being really bad and
plus being pretty good like what were the most salient experiences of your childhood and i was like okay this sounds like bs
but all right let me engage with this process and then i i made this list of all these
things that these salient memories from childhood like you know that time when my brother new game to my pokemon blue and i lost my 146 pokemon and that how
how that felt and that time when whatever um and the facilitator was like okay let's try and tease out like what
this might tell you about some of your values i was kind of surprised that a lot of the stuff that came out of that
if i think about is this a core value that i live by i want to live by the answer was yes
and i was surprised by how much of those experiences where when i was under 10 years old shaped maybe
the values that i've got right now and so when i think about my values it's things like i think primarily for me
right now it's like freedom and autonomy which is why i think i've got this whole drive to be financially independent to
work medicine part-time rather than full-time to have be in control of my own schedule things like
togetherness and kind of working with other people has always been a really fun thing for me whether i was in school or university
studying with friends it's just always more fun than studying on my own and that wasn't true for everyone but it was certainly true for me um teaching on
that list kind of help helping other people in a way but like i've got i've got friends for
example who who run charities and they genuinely feel in their hearts
if there is suffering in the world and i don't genuinely feel in my heart when they're suffering in the world um
but i know intellectually that i should care about this thing and so i will act in a way that makes me care about the thing and like donate 10 of my money to
charity every year and all this all this stuff but i don't actually feel it um but when i think about how i feel it's
like teaching other people rather than saving saving lives is the impact that i care about having and when
i realized this i was like oh okay this explains why i actually don't really care that much about medicine like i'm i
prefer teaching medical students than actually practicing as a doctor and realizing that teaching is more of a value for me
than saving lives for example i was like okay cool this makes sense i can now get on board with that and not feel bad
about it the other point is that i've never cared about really i've really never
cared about finding out what my values are because and this is probably goes back to how i answered that question because
the stimuli that i have to decide all of these things is like um how does it make me feel and i think if you have a good quitting framework
then you will quickly move in the direction of your values um much faster than others will quitting framework yeah
like if you have a good a good uh like quitting framework oh yeah you're very good at quitting then you'll actually
you'll so if you're good at conducting experiments and then quitting like just a it's like rapid a b testing
right and you can i think i think the answer really to finding out who you are and what your values are and getting
your place to a life that you really love is try something i always say to young people increase the amount of
experiments you're doing and quit faster so you go and get a job you're like okay um i hate this this boss is a dick
because we didn't have any freedom here or autonomy i hate that part i love the fashion part but i just hate this environment because of this and this
quit go and find a job where you have the bit you liked and some new sort of
factors and then you go okay well i love that bit i actually love being a manager here i'm going to keep the fashion piece i love the autonomy of being able to
work from home or whatever quit move on next job you know and i think that's what i've done in my life is i never knew what my values were but
i went in the direction of um i started out in call centers
knew i loved building things bigger entrepreneurs sales moved in that direction quit the call center jobs did about 15 of them start
my own business parts of business i really don't like don't want to do those parts don't do them i still don't do them
and i'm like this is the part within this bit within business that i love doing within this industry and i never
was intentional about that there was no plan it was this rapid increase experiments you're doing and quit as
fast as you possibly can um and then you end up i think in a life that you're but quitting is easier said
than done i have to say it would be remiss if i didn't say all of this is underpinned by huge confidence in self
and the fact when i do quit i don't need a plan and that off i'll be fine a lot of people don't have that part so they
hold themselves in a miserable situation because it's a certain one yeah you know i like uh like when i when i
read that bit of the book the the quitting framework i was sort of retrospectively applying decisions i've
made to quit to that that thing of like suck and hard i was like oh okay this actually makes a lot of sense um
there was one decision that my mum still haunts me about which was about about a year ago i decided that
you know what i want to take my medical career seriously and i want to move to america to do medicine i had a few friends over there it seemed like an
adventure and it seemed cool but to move to america from the uk to do medicine you have to take this like ridiculously
hard exam called the usmle and it's basically like relearning all of medical school uh but at like you know a
ridiculous level of detail more so than we have in the uk and so i started off preparing for this and i realized that
this is actually really hard and the thing that
i reasoned in my mind was i could do this it's but the reward is
really not worth it like you get to the end of it i've spoken to some doctors living working in america and i'm like yeah you make 400k a year and you're
working a lot and you're going through this four years of grueling residency program and in my mind it was like okay it's
it's hard and the outcome is not worth it yes therefore i'm just going to quit that's the worst place to be in life
doing harsh struggling for nothing yeah um but then when i have conversations
with my mom it's like oh well you quit because you're a quitter like the fact that you found it hard me like
you only quit because it was hard it's like no i didn't only quit because it was hard i also i also crucially quit
because it was like the the reward was not gonna be worth it but i i didn't quite have the terminology to express that until i read it in your book yeah
well i didn't either and it was again that's why i have to specify that that's not the framework i've made my decisions
through for my whole life in hindsight what i'm a very logical sort of first principle thinker and that's why i'm
able to arrive at peace when i make these massive life decisions because it's like oh logically there was no alternative there was no alternative i'm
not going to do something that's hard and not worth it but what kind of insanity is that i am someone that will
do something that's hard and worth it i'm not and i'm i'm not someone that's going to quit every time something sucks
i am someone that's going to try and change it if it's worth it and if i think it's possible to change i mean my
white you know my girlfriend have an argument and i go this sucks and [ __ ] walk out the door that's not who i am i will try and fight for something if it's
worth it and if i believe it's changeable and so logically i think that framework is
robust i think it's solid you talk a lot about time management managing one's time you made a lot of
videos about the topic what would have been some of the other sort of um tips or tricks that you've
adopted that helped you manage your time better we talked about time blocking and um breaking your
vague to-do list tasks down into specific ones is there anything else that comes to mind yeah there's one um
i've i've read a bunch of books around productivity and stuff there's one called make time by these chaps called jake and john
and there's a tip in there which i genuinely use every day uh it's just it's called the daily highlight where
it's just similar to gary keller's thing of the one thing like what is the one thing you want to do today and then it's
like i define that in the morning okay what's the one thing i want to do today record this podcast with you what's the one thing i want to do tomorrow finish
sample chapter for the book proposal and then i'll stick a slot in the calendar for it and then the thing will get done
and on days where i actually do the daily highlight thing i have about a 50 success rate with actually thinking about it in the morning i always just
get more done and i feel at the end of the day oh i've made progress because i've done that one thing that was most important and on the days where i don't
i find that like oh i've got these 18 things doing my to-do list oh comedy book got this am i message coming from this person who wants to enter an intro
to that person whereas when i know what that one thing is i'm like okay cool all i have to do
is just get that one thing done today and i sometimes think that if i did this more often if for 365 days i actually
just did the one thing that's the most important each day i've been making so much progress i'll be having so much fun and then i think to myself why don't i
actually just do this every day um but that's that's one of my main ones that's life as well it's just
and you when you talked about the tipping point in your career where you blew up you were talking about you made that video about how to study
and i guess the premise of that video was teaching people how to learn better you've read a lot of books
as it relates to learning outside of studying just more generally what tools have you adopted because
you're some you even you know you've read my book and you remember all everything it seems what trips and tips and tricks have you learned about how to
What tips and tricks do you have for people to learn better
learn better yeah um so essentially the main one is that we
learn by testing ourselves rather than by consuming more stuff
uh like we like in in which is a big country intuitive like when it comes to if we if we think about like studying
and then we can kind of broaden it out like if it comes to studying we think that to to learn more stuff i need to get more
information into my brain but what all the evidence says is that no to learn more stuff you actually just need to read it once and then you have to try
your best to get it out of your brain and that feels hard and it feels tough and it feels like oh i'm an idiot i don't know enough but that that like
desirable difficulty is what allegedly creates the neuronal connections in our brain to make us actually learn something
um and so it's similar to working out like progressive overload when it's heavy and when it feels hard is when
your muscles are actually growing because you've got the stimulus for growth equally when it comes to learning anything when it feels hard is when
there is a stimulus for the neurons to grow or words to that effect and so when it comes to studying
if anyone is sort of listening to this has exams coming up and they are worried about their grades
the the the answer is that they're just not testing themselves enough the more you test yourself the better grades you'll get and this therefore applies
also to every other thing that we're trying to learn so you know if i'm learning i was learning how to play
you've got a friend in me on the guitar the other day and if i'm just playing through the first two verses of it that i know already i'm not learning anything
but as soon as i try doing the thing that feels hard at that point it's like it the the harder it feels the more i'm
learning and then and then we sleep and then the connections get solidified um so it's that that's kind of the main
concept basically test yourself more whatever that thing is and the second big one in the research is spaced repetition that
anything we learn whether it's a fact for an exam or a song on the guitar our memory for it will exponentially
decay over time and the way to make it go into a long-term memory whatever the skill is
is to interrupt the forgetting curve uh at spaced intervals so maybe you would lo you would practice the song on day
one you'd practice it again on day two then on day five then on day 25 and then day 105 and as the intervals lengthen
that is the sort of thing that gets this how to play the song or this fact about medicine or whatever into a long-term
memory and most things around learning can basically be summed up by those two things active recall i.e test yourself
and space repetition i.e space it out over time interesting people are really fascinated
by productivity aren't they they are yeah i think i heard you say about like when you put the word productivity in
The definition of productivity
your content it seems to perform better yeah i i often think about this like
so so to me productivity i think i think to a lot of people productivity just means efficiency and
creating economic output the way that i define productivity is just kind of using my time well and working on things
that are meaningful to me and optimizing for happiness and so to me this conversation is productive hanging out
with friends is productive i was playing playstation last night for a couple of hours that to me was productive because i was like
intentionally doing it because i wanted to take a break from writing um it's when i feel it's i i feel
unproductive when i know there is something i want to do and i am not doing the thing
because i'm scrolling instagram that to me is unproductive you're not being intentional with your time exactly yeah but i think on the internet these days
people use productive as economic output and the whole like oh i want to be more productive it's a
i think partly it's a virtue signaling thing to some degree as well yeah
yeah partly it's a it's it's a version of a virtual signaling thing i think i think partly it's also like a self-flagellating thing in a way whereby
i often see comments on my videos where it's like a productive day in my life which i'm kind of doing tongue-in-cheek
just because it's funny where people are like oh my god i watch these videos just to make myself feel bad
and i'm like oh wow okay hey this is a this is mostly a joke like i hope you realize this but but but also
it's like that that's kind of sad that that comment has got so many upvotes where oh i feel so i feel like such a
waste man when i watch one of those videos and i think there is that like perverse sense of
people getting pleasure out of the story they're telling themselves that they are non-productive or that they are a
chronic procrastinator and to see someone who doesn't who is on the surface seemingly so
productive makes you kind of feel bad about yourself um i wonder if it's similar to like if i
look at my instagram explore page about a year ago it used to be bikini models these days the dudes with six-pack abs
and i look at that and there is a part of me that gets pleasure out of like flagellating myself and they're like why
don't i look like that yet and i wonder to what extent that's like a thing in the world of productivity
that is fascinating because i mean that would be driven by
the antithesis of that that's going to be driven by a culture where productivity and i'm getting so much done so i'm going to be
successful and rich in a millionaire and this is i'm in stealth mode building this massive business and i've been up
all night look at me it's 4 a.m and i'm still working that's driving one end of the spectrum which is making
productivity and being productive and aspiration for this generation and on the other end that's i mean
that's why again the desire to be productive is so high and your videos do so well on that topic
and then you have the counter movement as you always do where it's like i'm such a procrastinator and then all the
memes which bang just as hard because there's been this desire created in
culture to be you know super productive or even as it relates to like weight and fitness like
everyone wants to look so good and then the memes of people sat there with a pot noodle on their belly like resting like
with their like running shoes on will also bang just as hard yeah but yeah
it's just a very relevant thing in our culture which is quite quite strange that this incessant desire to be productive i think there's
actually there is a rising counterculture which is about being okay with not being produced yeah no exactly
i am i'm i'm having to pepper in a pepper that into my videos a lot more these days um
because i kind of thought it was it was so obvious that it doesn't need to be stated that obviously you know
don't be don't be don't seek economic output and productivity at the expense of other things that are more important
like health and relationships uh but clearly that's not a thing that is obvious and so i'm now
having to caveat a lot of my productivity advice with like a look guys let's just define productivity as
you know meaning and fulfillment and stuff rather than pure economic output and it's okay to be intentional and say i
don't do anything today if that was your intention i want to just do [ __ ] all like and i
think that's um that's the nuance that's required in all of that speaking of productivity one more
company i wanted to tell you about fiverr.com i mean if there was a company that's predicated on increasing your
productivity it is fiverr.com where you can outsource some of the tasks in your life that you do not want to do
professionally whether it's designing a website making a thumbnail editing a video anything you can get it
done on fiverr.com cost effectively and sometimes if we're talking about increasing productivity using someone
who's on another time zone which means work is still happening when you are asleep which extends the bandwidth of
the amount of hours you have towards your goals and this month we are using fiverr to redesign the thumbnails on our
second youtube channel a graphic designer we found there and i always use it whenever i have professional tasks
that i need handling that is fiverr with two rs.com slash ceo
Relationships - Being true to yourself
you talked about relationships at the start of this podcast you said you said you you think you alluded to
the fact that you hadn't had much luck there when we were talking about knowing you're enough yeah
what's going on yeah this is a real problem um so there's a few like narratives that i've
bought into um subconsciously one of those narratives is that i am like a weedy nerd kid this like the
kid that i was when i was 12 years old and getting slightly bullied in school and getting grades and stuff but like not really having anything anything
uh not being valuable as a human being beyond the fact that i was generating a stars in exams
that's like one side of it there's another side but i i'd love to hear your take on what's the other side
the other side is um if we're if we're keeping it real it's like i think it's around
masculinity and what it means to be a man and if one if one were to hypothetically
read wikihow articles on how to get girls or even the vast literature on the topic um
there is a big thing of women are attracted to
men like you know people who are so someone who is a man someone who leads someone who's like alpha those sorts of
those those sorts of things and i think
my kind of default way of being is very not that and like my idea of fun is
singing disney songs and playing board games until two o'clock in the morning with the pizza takeaway rather than something that a more like macho alpha
type person person would be and so on the one hand there's that thing of just be yourself uh of be
authentic self etc etc and a girl will like that for who you are and on the other side it's the the thing
of you will objectively get more success with women in inverted commas if you
sort of are more of that alpha type personality here's the problem yeah please
on the on that particular point before we move on because i'd love to hear what you're going to say but um you were you
it sounded like you were saying do i be myself and dance around listening to disney um even though it might return a
lower quantity of smoking hot potential partners correct
um or the alternative to that is do i be masculine um guy and like act outside of self to
generate more smoking hot partners the issue you have is you just got to zoom out and you've
got to think about the outcome of both approaches and how sustainable both approaches are all you can be is yourself for a long
period of time and if you want long long term results that's the only option you have of
course you can act as something you're not and pretend you don't like disney and not listen playboard games and stuff
and you might meet the wrong person for a short amount of time because and it will be a short amount of
time because that relationship will capitulate the minute they find out who you actually are and this is there's you
know um yeah this is this is always for me the answer is you have to be yourself
you have no choice in that you do have a choice in being able to kill some of those confidence issues which might be self-sabotaging at key
points in the relationship where it turns into insecurity and results in jealousy and you know if you're coming
into relation to thinking why the [ __ ] is this person with me yeah the chance of you exhibiting jealous behavior and
controlling behavior and manipulative behavior and insecure behavior and where are you why are you here why haven't you texted me back fast enough and is is
high and for me that will put undue pressure on something that might have worked otherwise so go ahead and work on
the the confidence issues but never ever dare change who you are like the
things you intrinsic do not change those do not try and act outside of those because that is that will lead to really
short-term results and you don't actually want to be with anyone for 50 years that doesn't want to dance and
listen to disney movies with you you don't actually want to society's telling you want smoking art but you don't actually want that you'll
you won't return joy on that you'll you'll return status from walking in with a smoking hot
model that has no brain but you won't return joy in the long term and that is the goal that's the
north star does that make sense it does yeah um
on the note of being yourself the thing that uh the the thing that i
feel i feel i feel a contradiction is that on the one side there's there's kind of
be yourself and on the other side there's like choose yourself and
what i what i worry about is what if this person who i am i.e the kind of nice guy who like like enjoys disney and
board games and stuff that's a result of accidental experiences that i haven't really chosen for myself
and should i instead be thinking okay who's the sort of person i want to be
well then having having said that i don't want to be anyone who doesn't sing along disney songs because they're just great um
yeah and you sing along to disney songs not because you're now being forced because you enjoy it yeah it's genuinely fun it makes you feel free to love it
yeah it's so good there you go so that's that's part of the answer to a lot of the things we've discussed before which is going in the direction of the things
that make you feel good don't suppress things that make you feel good because then you'll feel [ __ ] so if that makes you feel good that is
in as far as i'm concerned you've explored and exploited as you say and you've and you've and you've found
something you enjoy and don't sacrifice that for what for a pretty woman to be stood next to
you yeah that's not in that that trust me will not be enjoyment that'll be status that'll be extrinsic approval right
which is very different from internal fulfillment so i would never disregard those things however
you can as i've done over the last year and a half say you know what it when i look at my values and who i i
actually want to be internally my health this is what i've done is so
foundational to everything and i really managed to almost like hypnotize myself somehow
um into knowing that me being in good shape and me being someone that goes to the gym every day and prioritizes that
my health is my first foundation is in line with my happiness the change in my life the thing that's
put me in the best shape of my life ever was before as i said in this podcast me
working out was all about women the minute it became not about women it stuck
because because um yeah for so many reasons i mean i enjoyed the process and i removed
wanting six-pack and i basically don't have any gym goals now whatsoever my goal is to go every day it stuck it
became intrinsic it was for me um and now i go every single day and the minute we finish this conversation my
pt's waiting for me and i went yesterday the day before i'll go the day tomorrow every day okay i don't care
i'm not doing it for anyone else so it sticks interesting that's why your relationship will fail
if you're with someone that you you're with for external reasons it won't stick okay yeah this makes a lot of sense content
How to make create content
content yeah you make a lot of content and you've must have come to learn a lot about humans and psychology from
all these videos you make you tinker around with the titles and the thumbnails and um
and you've become such a big youtuber you've got millions of subscribers from a very iterative process of i guess really
understanding what humans will respond to and what they want what their desires are what would you give me as advice for
how to make if i'm a listener a really great content that people will care about
it's a broad question but there you go
i think it's about hooking them in with the promise of
something simple and quick and then and and if you stop at that point that
is i think where as kind of as sort of course scammers and
marketing gurus and stuff were maybe 20 years ago it's hooking them in with a simple and quick promise
but then delivering on the nuance of it that i think people are caring about
more than ever now and so like one thing that we've iterated with over
time is you know often the success of a video will depend on how clickbait the title is and
there's no getting around that we've never found that a title that's less clickbait uh does better i i did a video
called how writing online changed my life it absolutely bombed just changed
the title how writing online made me millionaire suddenly absolutely exploded people love that like oh this is a quick
solution uh this is a quick path to this um this this goal that i want hence your title of happy sexy millionaire
um but we've also found that on videos where i think oh let's let's dumb the message down let's just kind of do a
quick five-point listicle without any examples because people just want the dopamine hit of advice that sounds
reasonable but they can't action those videos haven't done as well like people click on them but then they don't stay watching
and the videos we found that do the best is you make a promise at the start and then you deliver on the nuance throughout the whole thing and actually
people at least in my audience and i suspect in yours and anyone listening actually do want depth and nuance not just a sort of
surface level two minute long thing that you would have seen on youtube circa 2005.
um i think you did a pretty great job of that as yeah yeah i'm learning i'm
con you know continue to learn youtube's a bit of a new medium for me so it was good it's good to get that um
that perspective you you also um you're very in in sort of self-aware and honest i i
you wrote something about um why you're failing which is uh i think you wrote a piece which was
Why I feel like I'm failing in life
detailing why you think you're failing in life i think i have this issue where
i often feel like what i'm currently doing is not quite good enough
because you know we're leaving money on the table or because our team is inexperienced or
because i suck at being a manager or i suck at being a leader and although i'm learning to improve in in
all those things i sometimes feel that oh but it's it's it's not fast enough i think that's
where the comparison stuff comes in because when my peer group was
kind of just my friends in medical school and i was doing the youtube stuff and
then i was kind of the only one in the in the in the pack doing the thing and so it was like oh anything goes like i'm
not comparing myself to anyone now that i am sort of a bigger name on youtube
the sorts of people i compare myself to now are kind of other youtubers with millions of subscribers the population for comparison changes and i find that
the more i compare the less good i feel about the stuff that i've done and so to get around that i try to just
a not compare at all and b also think journey before destination all the all of the mindset stuff but it's easier
said than done and i still feel internally like right now we're not using money in the company
like efficiently enough we're not hiring fast enough we're not doing this fast enough noting that fast enough um do you think you'll ever get to a point where
that stops hmm because i tell you what yeah what's it
been like for you well i mean no i was just to say let's just i mean one way to look at it is ali
five years ago when you first started if you had shown him a picture of younow
yeah what would he have said that's pretty cool yeah i mean like if you'd gone if when you made those first
couple of videos you've gone you're going to have two million subscribers on youtube you can have all hundreds of
thousands of followers on instagram that would have had a stroke you would have had a [ __ ] stroke
there's no way there's no [ __ ] way that's me yeah and here you are this is what i was
alluding to earlier it's like the past version of yourself told you'd be happy when you got here but you're not because like you're not
fully satisfied because there's a future version of yourself that's saying you'll be happy when you get here
and it just never stops never stops with it like it seems it seems like at least on the outside that you've done a good
job of kind of i mean obviously you're like particularly successful but like being okay with that level of success and not
trying to get to the the next level for whatever that looks like i think so i think so more
than a lot of people i speak to i think there's i mean there's still elements in me that are like i can do more and i can i can i can take on
bigger challenges in my life but i'm definitely definitely now detached from thinking it will have any impact on
the things that matter won't make me happier would make me more fulfilled won't be anything at all yeah
i'll be doing it probably for either the wrong reasons yep like just
more money therefore i can get private jets instead of a business class or
because um this is not the wrong reason but just for the challenge of it yep
um all but or thirdly because i want to solve a problem in the world as opposed to believing that it will
make it will make me it'll kill my imposter syndrome or it'll make me feel more you know
enough i definitely know that i'm enough okay i definitely know that much and i
know that nothing's going to change that positive or negative yeah that's good it's a good place yeah well i better
because i said in the book do not so um how how do you think about money it's a question that you often ask you
Money
guys that i really want to ask you because yeah obviously you are rich and
but there are there are more levels of rich beyond what you currently are so like they always will be and as you meet
people as as i've met people who are kind of levels of rich above me
where then then i start thinking oh maybe it would be nice to be able to afford to fly first class everywhere that'd be
pretty cool yeah and i think i wonder if that would increase my quality of life and i know there's that there's you know diminishing returns for money and stuff
sure you know first class versus i wonder oh no yeah how do you think about that i mean so i want to have enough money in
my life that i don't have to do anything that costs time
that i don't need to spend okay on things that i don't get joy from doing so like i basically want to have
so like an airport is a great example this is why i think i want a private jet because when i go to the airport you could spend three hours just checking in
and getting onto the onto the plane and that's three hours that i'd much rather doing something i enjoy doing with my
life um and as i talk about in chapter 19 of happy sexy millionaire time is what we have i refer to these 500 000
chips we have and we get to you know that's because that's how many free hours the average human being gets in their life i would like to have more of
those chips deployable against things that i really enjoy doing and creating memories with people i love not standing
in an airport queue for three hours so if money is going to solve that problem for me then money does matter it's not
going to make me exponentially happier like the queue isn't making me miserable it's not going to move the needle but yeah but i'd like to make more memories
in my life with with my niece and my dog you know yeah and with my partner so
that is my view on money at this stage okay um convenience uh less time wasted yeah
that's literally it that's literally it it offers me nothing else okay yeah
well what do you think of money i think
i think convenience is a big thing for me like i also have that thing of money is useful in so far as it helps me
buy back my time which i can then use to deploy against things that i care about but then
as i kind of get exposed to more like rich people and
see like the life that they're living and like you know this idea of thinking about moving to london
where like i've been living in my flat that me and my brother have a mortgage for in cambridge for the last three years with a lodger and therefore it's returning 16
a year because i'm not paying rent bloody but i'm moving to london where it's like i actually can't afford to buy a place in london like i could afford to
rent a place in london but it's like i could rent for a thousand a month or two thousand or three or four you know those places that are eight
thousand a month are pretty good i wonder what it would be you know can i afford to spend eight thousand a month on a place that's slightly nicer
that's a little bit more central what am i optimizing for if i forget a place in king's cross it's easier for friends to come visit therefore i can make more
memories there for increase happiness that way um and the money thing just sort of
i feel like those those numbers keep on going up because you know then you could be like well having a yacht would be pretty cool
because then i can invite friends on board and then we can do like jet skiing and stuff having a private jet would be really cool because then i can like fly wherever i want and save my three hours
of time and take my friends out on a trip having enough money that i'd be able to fly friends over to visit me would be sick for my personal happy and
i don't know i feel like the more i think about this the more i start to invent justifications for trying to make
more money yeah for the sake of happiness and fulfillment and stuff beyond the 75 000 a year that the
studies will tell us leads to diminishing returns i think the key thing there and what i've what i said in
my answer is that i don't think it will make me happier because i'm already i think at i don't think missing the
airport queue will actually make me happier yep i don't think it will because unfortunately unfortunately fortunately
i'm at a point where i don't think i could be happier okay yeah like i could definitely have less think less
annoyances in my life yeah but fundimentally i don't think i could be happier than this okay um or more
fulfilled or like comfortable than this so me killing the cue by getting a jet is um
is removing an annoyance and increasing the the yeah
how intentional i am with my extra two chips that you'll have it's not going to move the needle yeah okay it's not going to be the needle
and if this place was where we are now which is my home i live upstairs if it was two times bigger
would i be happier no no i wouldn't be no
okay but you know i'll probably get a place two times bigger yeah because i don't know
then i can have bigger parties and maybe that one's more people will be a more and more enjoyable memory at some point
but i don't i this is the key thing as i had to at some point in my life realize like not buy into the [ __ ]
justification or i'd live my life running running in that direction constantly and i say all the things it's not gonna
make me happier yep and if i still want it then i think um
then i'm then it's like it's okay for me to buy it's like yeah i kind of i kind of have have similar things so often
i will like buy something you know i bought one of those six thousand pound pro display
xdrs with the thousand pound stand that apple sell the other day just because no one knows what that is
it's like a ridiculously expensive monitor that apple sell for like professionals and i really didn't need it but i was like it would be kind of
cool to have on my desk and i knew there was zero way it was gonna make me any happier i was like oh
it's just it's just kind of cool and my housemate was like oh your your monitors arrived how do you feel i was like
like just even even contemplating how i feel as a result of the fact this monitor arrived just kind of a bit
baffling to me because obviously it doesn't make any difference to my day to happiness it was just something kind of cool that i could buy the business
expense and i thought why not i think when i was younger i used to look forward to purchases more
like you know ordered a playstation game when we're tracking the delivery waiting for it to arrive and i was just like
it's just it's just kind of things um and and the way i often describe it to people is that
maybe sounds a bit argument but it's like i feel like my happiness is a 10 out of 10 right now and i really can't imagine that changing but
it's still kind of cool to spend money on the things that i want to spend money on yeah if it's like tech or camera gear
yeah something i care about yeah i completely agree now and i i actually don't think i'm a very um flashy person
right now i don't own a car at this exact moment um i don't have like designer watches or anything and
typically if i make a purchase it's based in utility but it's really nice yeah and that's kind of what you're describing with your monitor yeah so
like i travel a lot so a suitcase or get a really nice one yeah but i don't need a rolex because let's be [ __ ] honest
no one uses it to tell the time anymore so that would be purely about signaling and status
um i don't really buy designer clothes at all i don't really think i have any designer clothes clothes
i don't really i mean i have a nice pair of boots or something yeah but typically it's like i mean this
is like a top man t-shirt i'm wearing from asos these are top man jeans fits pretty well yeah these like utility and fit and matter seem to matter more than
um in security driven purchases this this one mental model that i think of which is that if if you were the only person
in the world would you still buy the thing um i think when it comes to like new apple products yes i would because
like i can do i can do my work better on a nicer macbook or on a nicer screen uh
but yeah certainly i probably wouldn't get an apple watch if i was the only person on earth because i think the utility of that is more signally and
more about like this is the sort of identity i want to portray to other people and then it is about the fact that having an apple watch for me given
that i'm not into running is is actually useful you've read a lot of books mental models about mental models and various other
The key mental models that have had the biggest impact on your life
things what are some of the key principles or key sort of mental models that have had the biggest impact on your
life oh um
there's so many i can imagine that it's quite hard to yeah i think one of the main ones is is this thing about the the
money diminishing returns curve about like beyond about 50 to 70k depending on what study you look at money doesn't buy
more happiness i often have to like remind myself of that when i get into this cycle of
the pursuit of more stuff um one of the things i won't really call it mental model but one of the things i
often come back to is oh i think you talk about in the book as well uh five regrets of the dying oh yeah um and i
had have those written on the top of my to-do list on my daily to-do list template um that's that that's a good one
the other one is what is that for anybody that doesn't know oh yeah so there there was this like palliative care nurse or someone who
sorry brony ware that's why she messaged me on instagram oh no way when i don't one time i like didn't tag her instagram
so she's just like oh yeah thank you so much for the pose could you talk about yeah bro she's amazing brony yeah so she wrote a book called um the regrets of
the dying or the top regrets of the dying where she interviewed like hundreds of people who were on the deathbed asking them
what are your regrets um and some of the really common ones were i wish i'd lived a life true to
myself rather than what others expected of me uh i wish i'd worked less hard i wish i'd spend more time more time with
friends and family um can you remember what the other ones are like you know what i only focus on the first one yeah
because she was like she said this was the most common regret of the dying was i wish i had lived a lifetime to myself and not what others expected of me yeah
following your intrinsic motivation rather than status prestige external exactly yeah it sounds like the other
ones are all actually just yeah like offshoots of that yeah yeah and people as they're about to die must have this
amazing retrospective clarity over there what they did and didn't do right what didn't didn't matter it didn't matter
that that girl in playground said my hair was [ __ ] or this comment on instagram and that
retrospective clara because i i say this in the book as well this is about the i talk about how i don't think anybody
believes they're going to die yep and those people know they're going to die so they have that like it's all all the
[ __ ] just fades away and they go i just want one more day with my son yeah
but also it's it's it's not quite the same as the whole live every day as if it were you as if it were your last like there's that that balance there how do
you think about that balance yeah i mean so that's actually like fundamentally bad advice because if i were to live
today like it was my last i would probably be doing self-destructive things
like they're going to be self-destructive actually yeah yeah like financially i'd be blowing all my money like yeah so um
or something like that but the merit in that that i see is um
is living like life itself will come to an end um at some point um
which for me means being very conscious about the use of
uh your time i guess and what you're deciding to do if today were your last you'd be able to
cut through the [ __ ] that doesn't matter and so let's say if this life were your last live every life like it
was your last would be a better thing then in life yeah you'd really focus on what matters you know you've talked
about such a diverse range of topics on your youtube channel and really about like help you know
helping people as you know as the teacher you are become better at what they're trying to achieve you've talked about productivity
mindset um finance and all of these things what what are the what are the things that
What do young people need to know about mindset to live a fulfilled life
you see in young people today that you think um they most need to solve and understand
about let's say about mindset in order to get to that point where they are
living a fulfilled life what are some of the you know and i say this to you because i know how
many how many how many books you've read thinking specifically here about like young people and you'll see you're
seeing them in the comments section you're seeing the problems that they're trying to solve in their life i think the main one that i see is a mindset
that work has to be suffering and that
like working hard is like a bad thing and that
what it looks like if you're if you're striving for something is that it it looks like pain um
this is very much the mindset i had going into medical school where it's like oh i'm now a first-year medical student at cambridge university this is
this is supposed to be hard you know let's get all my big textbooks out let's like spend ages in the library you know
pulling all-nighters thinking it's a badge of honor because this is what work looks like and it looks hard and
in my from my second year onwards where i realized hang on like you know the thing tim ferriss often says like what would this look like if it were easy
i think if more young people accepted that work doesn't have to be suffering it can actually be easy and fun and you can
have it all provided you find ways to make it fun and optimize for the things that are enjoyable that will solve a lot of kind of
problems when it comes to the things people often ask me about which is motivation procrastination burnout and
and all that jazz i think another kind of underrated tip which the toxic
productivity people would would crucify me for is that i think everyone kind of
like if you want to if you want to live a life on your own terms then you do have to solve the money
problem because we all need to make money we all need to have that like in in board games
we call it you you call it as an economic engine like if you if you want to win in a board game you always have to figure out
are you going to sell sheep are you going to get wood are you going to get owed are you going to get hey like what is your economic engine going to be
and i think the sooner a the sooner that can be ticked as a box or the more aligned the economic engine
can be with the thing you actually find fun uh the more you can do that thing of living life on your terms
because what i never want to be in the position of is where you know that thing of well i just got to work the nine to
five so i so i can enjoy the five to nine because that's like 80 000 hours of our lives 80 000 chips out of the 500
that we're squandering away just to survive and obviously there's
it's it's that's so much easier said than done and a large amount of being able to take that money box being able
to build that economic engine is based on kind of privilege and where you've grown up and circumstances and all that stuff but i guess kind of from from
where you're sitting you never had that sort of privilege growing up and you kind of succeeded despite it and
yeah it's just that that thing of accepting i think a lot of a lot of young people especially like the gen c the the gen z
folks these days are in that mindset of i care about impact i don't care about
money i think it's very hard to live a fulfilled life if you're not like if if you think in that way because then
it's like oh i'm not gonna talk about money it's weird people talk about money on the internet et cetera et cetera so those would be kind of two things that i
would love to implant into young people's brains yeah that's a really interesting one there's been this were absolutely groundswell
over the last couple of years of i think millennials are guilty of it too just all of them want to change the world
and they don't really have a plan or have a specific route to
changing the world um or having an impact but they just want
to lead with that which sounds to me a lot like virtue signaling because i think the people that end up changing the world are very specific about what
they're going to do and it's very passion-driven it's very like specific passion-driven so they'll say
you know someone that does actually want to change the world won't actually start with the end in mind they'll start with i want to study medicine so i can
understand cancer and they'll change the world not the gen z that says i want to i want to change
the world or i want to have a big impact and you go what's your impact yeah they go
the world how do you ask too many questions i want to have that so for me whenever i
see that in my dms or when a kid comes up to me uh when i've been speaking on stage or something is i want to be a public
speaker i go what would you want to talk about it's like go and have go and live a life worth
talking about like go and have an experience go like go through some [ __ ] and then you'll the consequences you're
a public speaker i had no intention of ever being a public speaker there's a consequence of of having some creating a life where i
had some [ __ ] to talk about you know and i think younger generations have that the wrong way around they're so obsessed
about oh wouldn't it be great to create an impact but have you come across um effective
altruism no i'd like to see here yeah so it's like this um this movement this community that talks about how
um doing good in the world and like having an impact is actually like scientifically measurable and can be
done in evidence-based kind of ways and so they you know there's a few like
charities and um programs tied to that one of them is give well and they uh do
an evidence-based analysis of the charities in the world to figure out what is the most bang for your buck what's the what's the highest roi on
money donated in terms of lives saved or are some other outcome measures and you find that it's some pretty rogue
charities that that come out on top here for example the against malaria foundation um on average it costs somewhere between
two thousand and three thousand pounds to buy enough malaria nets to statistically be able to literally save
a life um and that's like a lot cheaper than most people would think and if someone
would say to you now you know steve you can donate three grand and you literally save a life you'll be like oh great have three guys um
and and so the idea behind effective altruism is that given that like like you can actually measure the impact of
charities um and where i was going with this is that you can therefore measure the impact of
a career and relate it kind of to money if you need to so they've done an analysis of what
being a doctor is like and in the western developed world uh a doctor will save around seven lives
throughout the course of their entire career and this is not taking into account the fact that if i wasn't a doctor the next
the next person would have gone into medical school and been a doctor in my place because in the uk we have more people applying to medicine than there
are places if you are the only doctor in i don't know sub-saharan africa or
in a country or something and then you stop being a doctor that obviously has a big impact but most of the people listening to this are not in that
position and so the way that i think of impact is in terms of like counterfactual impact
i.e what is my impact compared to if i didn't if i didn't exist if i wasn't doing my thing
and i often will see comments on videos from people being like oh you're a you're a sellout for leaving
medicine in the middle of a pandemic to like i don't know make youtube videos something something bs like that
and i'm like yeah i can see why that's the narrative that you're telling yourself but actually i'm not special as a doctor like i have no unique value to
add as a doctor two years fresh out of med school anyone basically who has gone through medical training in the uk because it's pretty good medical
training could do as good a job if not better uh than i can of being a doctor but where i have counterfactual impact
where i am kind of unique and the impact i'm providing is in the fact that i have a youtube channel that teaches people
and inspires people stuff and if for kind of the dms and stuff or anything to go by you know people be like oh my god i got into medical school
because of your videos i was from this background where no one ever applied to medicine no one thought about going to oxbridge and i got there you know in
part thanks to your videos thank you so much and i feel like the impact i can have on the world by creating content on
the internet and speaking to a camera in my bedroom is arguably greater than the impact i would have kind of just being a doctor
not that there's anything wrong with just being a doctor of course did you hear that mum are you listening
at least that's what i try and tell myself yeah you should say that to her we'll just we'll we'll snip it that yeah
yeah have you seen this i just uh stumbled across this no but i completely get that and i think um
i think yeah i think and it's funny because me being selfish in my life has been the thing
that's allowed me to help way more people developing my own thinking my own skills my own ability to do this stuff
has been the able to create a platform in which i can help more and i spoke to a monk or i think he was a monk about
this when i got to ask this world famous monk he was doing this massive talk in new york my one question was am i
selfish for having spent the last five years of my life growing wealth and developing myself and my skills um
should i have run off to africa and started trying to you know save one life at a time and his response
to me was that you can't pour out that for others that which you don't have yourself so he likened it to a bottle
and said you have to fill the bottle and to be able to pour out into other people's glasses so by filling your bottle as long as you are being um
you're doing good with your full bottle then that's a incredibly noble thing to be doing and
yeah that's something that um naval rovicon says as well which is that if you want to have an impact then you want
to get rich and you want to get famous as well because people who are rich and favors just have more impact than people who are not because you can just deploy
more capital and social capital towards the things that you care about to make more of an impact so optimizing for
wealth and fame when you're young and while building skills while having fun um
i think you know there are worse things chmath talks about that as well chamath papadea yeah said his name papadilla he
on stage says that wealth allows you to impose your opinion and viewpoint on the world so he says
who would you rather having all the money some like rich russian oligarch who has 75 yachts or me who has a desire
to um you know like elon like take us make us multi-planetary and and solve the carbon problem and so with
resources you can impose your world view of good or bad i guess on the world and that is impact maybe we're just trying
to make excuses for wanting to be really [ __ ] right to justify happy sexy millionaires good for
the world yeah exactly no no but to be fair even this podcast like this podcast was very expensive it's very expensive
to run the equipment's very expensive and this has been enabled the people we're reaching now that are listening to
this has been purely enabled by by the five years of selfishness and me building a business for myself i do this
as i said i don't even know if we make a profit i not really look to be honest from this podcast necessarily but um i
do it because of the huge enjoyment it gives me and the impact that we see in the comments section and the messages we get and that make that is such a selfish
thing for me it makes me feel really good have you come across a book called the elephant in the brain no oh this is like
a whole it's like really well written it's like all of the studies around what drives human behavior and the main
thesis of the book is that uh we're all ultimately selfish a lot of the stuff we do is for signaling but
there is like a pr secretary in our heads that convinces even us that our motives for doing something are not
selfish and they are in fact altruistic yeah um and there's a quote from apparently from jp morgan which is that
a man always has two reasons for doing something a good reason and the real reason
and so whenever people ask me why do you do youtube it's always that right do i want to say
it's because i enjoy helping people and like making content that inspires or the real reason which it because it
you know social status prestige money etc i like being recognized in the streets it's kind of cool
i mean i think it's a bit of both but and that's fine because that's the truth yeah
and it's the truth for everyone there'll be someone sat at home thinking no no when i give five pounds to him this person i'm purely doing it because
i want to give the money i'm sure you want to but the reason why is because it might make you feel good
right or because um it might make you look good and if you think i'm wrong
all you've got to do is go back in history whereas once upon a time your family members with with very
similar genetics to you might have been whipping black people yeah like and you
and you wouldn't have thought that was a morally bad thing to do society is heavily controlling what we
think is good right noble virtuous and as soon as we can admit that i think we can actually create a better world yeah
that is a vacant of this like virtue signaling what's the right hashtag to use what am i meant to say who am i
meant to be for others i think it's a form of liberation to admit that yourself yeah yeah i think
that's really good um there's a the there's a phrase that a blogger friend of mine uses called servant hedonism
which is that you like by serving others uh and and optimizing for serving others at when
you're making decisions in your life you're in fact kind of making yourself more hedonic more more more happy and
that is actually a reasonable and as long as you can admit that to yourself there's that's a pretty reasonable way
of living life listen thank you for your time ali thank you it's been a very long time yeah very lots of fun and you're such a diverse
character that's really why i wanted to speak to you because you have such a wealth of knowledge across multiple sex sectors and industries and topics and
themes and i find that um and that comes from your curiosity i can tell you're deeply curious i can tell you know
um and therefore you this is again also why i think you've done so well in as a content creator who is an educator and a
teacher because you are your curiosity has sent you in search of answering complex
questions that a lot of people don't actually have the um the time or the the skill to know how to answer and then
your ability to break those conclusions down in ways that people understand that aren't alienating that aren't too big
words for me timothy in my bedroom that doesn't didn't go to cambridge is a real skill
and it's also a testament to the fact that you actually understand the things you're talking about because being able to simplify as we know simplify complex ideas is the is
the best evidence that someone understands those ideas so thank you that's that's very kind of you to say um and we're incredibly gracious to have me
on your book had a big impact on me the the mental models in their decision making the the chip stuff with time
genuinely has changed decisions that i've made in my life um so thank you for that and if anyone's listening to this
who hasn't read the book would recommend the audiobook in particular which is narrated by you yes yeah
yeah and you've got a book coming soon haven't you uh two years from now so two years from now yeah i'll reach out to you to promote that closer to the time
we'll have you back on when you're ready yeah thank you so much i appreciate you thank you
[Music]
you

Transcription:

Intro
early twenties i was diagnosed with a brain tumor that was the first knock down holly tucker ex-ceo and founder of not
on the high street holly's story is mind-blowing we go and pitch the idea of not on the high street to
the land of vcs who would tell us that it was lovely that us women wanted to create a crafts website but
really there was nothing in it and i just said well we're actually going to change the face of retailing
funny enough it's not craft website we tried to build a marketplace with
no tech experience but we knew what we wanted and so we found someone who built the technology that ebay were
building in america and we just relaunched and we nailed it how could i smile or laugh
i found myself becoming a different version of me one of the lines at hollandco is bringing colour to grey and i think i
was turning grey
holly tucker ex-ceo and founder of not on the high street one of the uk's
most loved brands but a real pioneer in its space at its time holly's story
is mind-blowing how she rose from someone that had no experience didn't have huge amounts of capital at a
time when women in business especially women in tech had it harder than anybody else
she built an online tech company that went on to be worth hundreds and
hundreds of millions but her story isn't straightforward it's riddled with pain
divorce heartbreak turmoil and having to reinvent and refine
herself time and time again the fundamental life lessons
that she shares today and that she unpacks for us are life lessons based on problems that
we're all going to experience in our lives it's a real joy to bring you this conversation and i want to thank holly for her
openness her intellect and her incredibly inspiring personality without further ado i'm stephen barlow
and this is the diary of a ceo i hope nobody's listening but if you are then please keep this to yourself
[Music] i always start in the same place in this podcast because i think it provides the greatest amount of context on a person
Your early years
so i i'm i'm somewhat sort of bored of asking these questions but they're so incredibly foundational to
who you went on to become because everything from you know the start of your journey till now proves
that you are clearly an outlier in every way so tell me below the age of 18 what were the
factors that went into making that person that went on to become this person
well um i was nicknamed holly hurricane and that was because i couldn't
wait to get to the next stage so when i um you know turned i think it was
12 i persuaded my dad that i needed to get a job in a pub cleaning it so he would wait outside in
the car park at five o'clock in the morning i don't think i'd do this for my son by the way anymore but he would wait outside the um the pub and
would um pick me up after my shift i went on and then i just continually
worked when my friends weren't working i um decided that you know i needed the
first mobile phone you know one of those bricks i think it was one to one i think that it only worked in the m25 and
um and so i was just continually pushing it to be grown up or to be out of childhood
i think and so why um because i was in i think and still am
today incredibly excited by life i i really wanted to juice life and i was
ready to work and i think work has always been um an incredibly important thing i
remember at 15 um becoming an intern for publicist advertising agency um on
bake street so as my friends would spend the summer out in the you know getting up to mischief no doubt
i would be traveling up to bake street to spend my summer working and i did that when i was 15
16 and 17 and it actually and ended up being on the day of my a-level
results my mum waited around the corner and i went for a job interview on the same day i was getting these
a-level results in the morning and i got a job as the junior junior team maker at publicis advertising
agency ra and that i now call my sort of university of life um and then my mum got me in the
car and we went to pick up my a level results where i thought up until about a year ago i got a d
in business studies i actually got an e and that was just ironic because that was
the moment i started work i celebrated my 18th birthday in the office and i've been working ever since i'm 44
now and so i think that that says a lot about who i was i was just so eager to be in
the big wide world um i remember my parents going on holiday and i was living at home and i mean
again if my son ever did this to me i just um rented a place with some
friends in halston because i was working um in in bake street um and just moved out i just packed up
the car and drove the car and text my parents to say mom dad i've
moved out um i'm living in holston which they weren't necessarily thrilled about um at what age i must
have been 18 yeah 18. um so that is how that has been me i was
dyslexic didn't find out um for my exams i am
definitely someone who has to work hard to achieve um and always been creative
so that has been a constant in my life i studied art uh at a level
and i created this huge sculpture that they had never had someone do before called tom dick
and harry and they actually cast it in bronze and had a crane pull it out of the art studio and had to take the windows
out and that it's still there today at my school um because i i always go for it i suppose um
so yeah that was me you know but i'm so when we say before the age of 18 you know i was in an office at the age
of 18. um all my friends went to uni um and as i said i did this university
of life thing um that work ethic was it at all influenced by your parents when you say you're excited by life but
was there an example set by your parents about work ethic
um i think you know i was always fascinated by my father's
role he was a financial a cfo at general electric and he traveled the world and i was
always fascinated with what he did my grandparents all had you know their
own businesses and i was fascinated by that my mother had a small business
um when i was younger i think that always you know how we get our money was always
placed um we didn't have you know we weren't we were fine
but money and where we got our money was always spoken about so i i very quickly realized you work
to live so that's what happens and so if i wanted to go out i needed to work
for that money so that has just that was always part of me
so you know maybe that just led to me just continuing to work because that meant that you lived and um
so yeah so i i think that but my work ethic you know again we were talking off air you know i give
it my my all you know i lose myself in my work um it is me
and so that's an interesting thing as you get older so you you work at publicist until you're 20 years old
i i yes i worked there until i was about 21 years old and then i got head-hunted to move to conde nast uh
meantime i managed to marry my childhood sweetheart again uh hurricane holly was in a hurry
uh so i bought a place i got married um i need some more context here so your
childhood sweetheart you met him when he was we were 14 14 yeah yeah okay you're both
14. yeah yeah and we got married uh at 21 and um divorced by 24.
and so it was an incred my early 20s were a very very difficult period of time of my life because
i had built up since i was 18. you know i had built up this life in this world and of course you get married then right
and you know you're gonna have children and you've got a property in chiswick and you know you're all
there and then sort of life pays you back or gives you i don't say pay you back
that's the wrong way gives you an interesting lesson which is be careful to be in a hurry all the time just because you want it
and you can get it doesn't mean it's right and so we found ourselves as natural human
beings developing in our personalities and things and realizing that we weren't destined
to be together forever um meantime i was diagnosed with a brain tumor and that was fine it wasn't fatal um but
it had a lot of side effects so at quite a young age at sort of 23 24-ish i
was dealing with a lot full-time job um all these sorts of things and i again i look
at my son who's about to turn 17 i think all right wow holly you were young to do all of this so in my early 20s a
lot of things changed for me um and i had to slow down i had to
lose full-time work i had to become freelance i had to concentrate on my health i had to
get divorced um and so yeah and that was the first knockdown i would say i've had two of
those in my life um and that was the first one and it was pretty painful
you find out at 20 through 24 years old that you've got a brain tumour how did you find that out i was just
very poorly i put on a lot of weight and i was uh just not functioning correctly
and in the end um with all pushing it because also also a young girl going to
the doctor and pushing it with all the scans we found out but as i said it was it was livable with and um you know and
that's something that's fine um but it caused just a huge
amount of turmoil and um that's not to say i think my marriage would have ever lasted
anyway but it just created turmoil and i now think back to how tough your
early 20s are you know i don't think i would repeat them um i think it's quite a difficult
age you're meant to be grown up you're just still a kid i'm trying to work everything out at the same time yeah absolutely well especially you the
situation you'd put yourself yeah exactly exactly yeah but you just think the world's against you
and now i just realized it was a it was a great kick up the butt and so you go into freelance work you're
you're separated from this partner you've learned the lessons there hopefully yeah um you've understood the
situation with your health yeah you didn't have to have an operation no no you couldn't have one no yeah i was i asked that particular
question because i actually found out last week that one of my one of my best friends has a brain tumor and i and i was intrigued by the array
of emotions that you felt in that moment and i asked that question from a supportive friend standpoint as how you support
someone that's that's um found that out i think she's 24
24 and she found out that she found out two weeks ago that she's having she had a brain tumor and they put her into
an operation the next tuesday wow because of the severity of the situation so she's just come out of the
operation last night oh i really wish her well i mean mine wasn't you know it wasn't that serious so you
know that was something that um i was very very lucky about
but i think one of the things was is that i had to find you know twice in my life i've had
to find out who i am again because when you pull your identity into
something else that's not yourself or or it becomes your identity i think we all do that in relationships
sometimes you know that you are married or you know that's what i did as a young girl so then when it all fell apart who who
who am i and that was a really difficult moment for me and slightly the
thing that saved me was going back to my creative roots you know if i hadn't gone to the university of life i was going to go and do an art
degree so creativity sort of saved me and i i went on to
you know create vegetable wreaths which again i just always think you know the story needs to be sexier than the vegetable race but there it was
and i i built this wreath and i went down to my local high street to try and sell it and i was just freelancing at
that time in publishing but this was allowing me to be creative in the evening why vegetable wreaths
though um you know it it was just i needed to be creative i love
i love interiors and i've always you know at the age my 14th birthday present was a
subscription to the world of interiors um so you know that has just been something i have to have a creative
environment to exist in so my home right now as a shrine to not on the high street i had to move house to get bigger and bigger
homes just to hold what you know you can imagine um what i'm surrounded by and so um
that was just glorious for me you know why not um i just did it and then that was this
path that just opened up to me because i realized that i needed to sell these
things because i was going to obviously become a millionaire you know for reinventing the wreath because that's what need was needed in
the world and i realized that actually there wasn't any local fare that i could go
and sell it so again if you dream it up you can make it happen so i created the first chizz at christmas fair with 200 stalls so that i
could get the best store you say that like it's so simple because a lot of people
a wouldn't even they would have had the reef idea and never done anything about it and then when they realized that they
couldn't sell it anywhere they would have never done anything about that as well but there's clearly something that underpins that perspective that okay
well that doesn't exist so i can create that and yeah well that doesn't exist i'll create that to support that that's my dna
that's what i'm doing now holly and coats what i did at notton high street i don't just because it doesn't exist
doesn't even bother me it's actually just part of the fun of building i'm i'm
i love building i love it about the risk um well what risk because
um you know what was going to go wrong there people weren't going to come to the fair i knew that they would i knew that
they'd like my wreaths because they were good i didn't see risk you know i i
i just went into it and i created this event and it kicked off it was amazing sold all my
wreaths hated wreaths by the end of the thing was not going to have that career but now i was going to have a fair
career i was going to put on events so i quit my job um and told my dad who's my
be my cfo not in the high street and his cfo at holly and co and just said right that's what
i'm now going to do and so i delivered all the wreaths got rid of that out of my household and i then um created these events
and put on 20 events around london with small businesses and that was
almost you know again a pretty bad existence because i was on my own putting on these
events it was you know pouring with rain one day you can't control the weather you can't control the football being changed you
can't do anything but what it did do is it made me realize
um my total love for small businesses and what they
create because i curated all of those stalls and i could see that there was absolute hidden treasure
that no one else had discovered before and so the town hall roof i suppose was the prototype
to not on high street i want to i want to go back to something you said a second ago which was about that moment where
Losing orientation in your life
you kind of lose orientation your marriage has ended because i just think so many people listening to this
either have gone through that are going through that or are going to go through that moment where they have a significant life change
which completely makes them unanchored from what their like purpose is and who they are and um
i'm fascinated by how long that process lasted for you and what advice you'd give to someone
who because i experienced it a little bit when i like left my business or actually the first time i experienced it was when someone made me a really big
offer for my business and then i went home that day and like mentally spent the money and i thought well then what who am i
yeah who now like yeah because your whole identity was attached to this business so you might say like
what advice would you have for someone um that's going through that sort of like loss of direction because there's been a significant life
change and they they don't know you know who they are or which way to go anymore well it's actually something
that now i have a word for um whereas at the time it was a sort of
process when i consult with small businesses um and i i don't now do one-on-ones but
um in my book for instance it's called a brand heart and it's basically i believe that a
business has a heart and everything has to come off it you know that's the pumping organ that
everything should come back to now you as a founder need to understand what should go into that
heart and it actually should be made up of you so i think what i did was i went back to
so what makes holly exist what makes holly alive and through that process which was about
a year um and my second one which will come to probably
you know lasted two or three years was um creativity was one um discovering
um creative folk um my the my community who was i meant to
belong to um building entrepreneurism um
all these elements were coming through i was lucky um in my life at the end of the first
this year i actually met my partner who's been my partner for 18 years and i got married
and locked down so now he's my husband um so i was lucky to find somebody
um and he did a lot of cheerleading for me you know sort of because when you're in
that place you don't really um you don't have a perspective on
anything that you can give anymore and so i think that's another incredibly important thing is to surround yourself
with people who adore you and are willing to tell you what makes you um what makes the sun
shine out of you you know what that is and so i was lucky to have that but that brand heart like the who is
holly just cutting it up into five pieces and say okay if there were five things i've got to concentrate on
to bring to restore me what are they um but it's a pretty painful process
what role does patience play from in all of that process well none at the beginning i mean
zero patience hurricane harley i mean do you want to mean now i've got a little bit more you know
actually i'm enjoying that getting older and just having a slight um listening more um
not running so fast um and picking up the cues along the way which i think i probably missed the
first time around so i'm actually really happy to become more patient i mean we'll put
it in perspective you know i'm you know i i'm uh very ambitious so but i am actually learning to listen um
to listen to the world a bit more and even even though you've cut your heart into five pieces there to dissect
who you actually are um that doesn't necessarily mean you know the
the path as in in terms of like the business idea that's going to get you get you there or the career but you you
know the fundamental principles of what you're looking for yeah and then what you need to do like experiment do something yeah just
well actually that's not what i did for not on the high street but it is what we've done for holly and co because um
that was the you know that's the point isn't it you learn i you know from not on the high
street holly and co i have learned i don't want to do it all again as i did but not in high street so i
don't want a final destination when you take vc money on you have some final destinations that you
you know you've turned right and not left so always your course of direction will be to the right with holly and co what i
loved was not not having that and also being able to
um you know when people said so what is holly and co i could barely explain it i didn't have
an elevator pitch i didn't want to fall into that actually i think that is the beauty of what i
was looking to do but i did have a brand heart i knew that we had that i didn't have the final destination but i have
the coordinates of a few places i know to go and i know that i am you know i know the
direction i'm heading i always call it like an anchor you know i've got an anchor in the future i've got the rope that i'm holding and
that rope will change change it will pull me to the right and left but i am anchored
um yeah and um and i'm enjoying that that's what i'm really enjoying so i've got a we've got to go through
this um this uh not in the high street story because i when i was reading um about your journey up until this
The Not On The High Street story
point and the experience you'd had in you know working on you know creating a
a market or affair for for these small businesses and then to go from there to trying to create a e-commerce site
in the year that you did i thought was just madness and i think about entrepreneurs coming into the den and um
one of the questions i always ask them is like have you got tech experience yeah who's who's got the technical sort
of competence within the team show me what you know yeah and from looking at what your journey opened to that point you didn't
have any of that stuff yeah no none how beautiful is naivety well yes delusion it is awesome
you know i look at it you know before when i was in it in it you know i thought oh my gosh
there's so many things that we need to have done before now i look at it and i think could i just bottle up that naivety and
just take a swig of it every single day you know naivety is the thing if we had known
really that we were creating one of the first marketplaces in the world you know at that point in time
there was ebay and amazon amazon was still selling books ebay had you know your socks that you
got for christmas and the you know the title was one two three grandma's socks um
uh etsy hadn't launched yet um we were basically looking at uh you know
like many businesses start a human problem that we were experiencing and thought we could
create a solution and all we needed to do was take all those small businesses that were under my town hall roof
and just put them on this thing called the internet and then wouldn't it be great if you could
shop from you know lily bell and shop from the letter room and put it into one basket well of course okay well we got 20 grand
so let's build a website for 20 000 pounds and we found someone who could do that
big watch out there and funny enough three days before launch
uh we realized that they couldn't do that you know that there was no checkout but because again there was no
experience we had already told the whole world with a microsite that was counting down the days to launch
and all the press that we were very able to get um that we were launching on this
specific day the third of april so this 20 grand where did that come from well the
the startup um that sophie and i had so i i uh the story is that basically after
your local fare had a three-month-old boy called harry um with my now husband
frank and i realized that i couldn't ignore what i had witnessed when you put a
group of small businesses together that are like-minded and bring together discerning customers
there's something that happens there the high street was dying and i needed to do that but i knew i
didn't want to do it alone after your local fare which was my fair business i couldn't do it alone so i just wrote to
my old boss sophie from publicis so she was my boss saying you know
i basically don't think there's anyone else on the planet that has the into my yank you know is able to
rewrite the english dictionary um and can be that person
and so i wrote to her and i still got the email and it says you know i want to bring everything that's not on the high street
together but i had a terrible beater name and uh 24 hours later she said yes
because she was that customer too she wanted to find the curious the discover the small businesses and
things but i had a three-month-old baby that wasn't going to stop me and so we
went on this journey to build it and as i said you know we tried to build a marketplace with no
tech experience or retail experience but we knew what we wanted and so we
um pulled together a few savings we were both with young children our
husbands were working to pay for the mortgage um we got a loan from a bank very small
loan and we remortgaged our homes slightly both of us so i think we came to it with about 80
000 pounds thinking that we had contingency in there i mean everything and funny enough
uh we didn't have enough money but we launched on the third of april with no check out
to our shopping site um why was there no checkout well because funny enough ebay couldn't even
build a multi-partner checkout with one basket you know no one had yet actually done that
technology so and i remember naively calling you know calling ebay just picking up the phone
to ebay thinking i don't know who i'm going to get through to ebay hey hi is that the cto you know that stuff you're
building there's any chance uh i could have it too because we're dealing with a company in
cornwall who uh has led us down um so we didn't you know this hadn't
been built yet this this this functionality and so we launched we called it a press
preview and we just pivoted and we were uh on something called daily candy which
was huge at the time we were on the daily mail front cover all this sort of stuff it was great so we got all the traffic but no one could
check out um but you know as mother lions that we were
and i always liken businesses to being a parent
something that in my latter years was frowned upon by the vcs because actually i do believe
that when you have that spirit of a parent you can lift a car off a child when you're a founder and
literally you're launching a shopping site with no checkout what are you going to do and so we found someone who in two weeks
built the technology that ebay were building in america um and we just relaunched and and we
nailed it did you run out of money in those early yeah yeah totally we ran out money we launched in
the april and we're running out of money in the july um because funny enough technology costs
a lot of money especially when it's never been built before and um and so we had to go and raise money
and that was one heck of an experience because if you want to take yourself back to 2006
when we know one percent of vc money right now goes to women what do you think the statistic was then so we would pack up our
personalized bags we get on the tube no money for taxis we would knock on the doors
with meetings you know that people knew someone who knew someone and we go and pitch the idea of not on
the high street to the land of vcs who pretty much a hundred percent would tell us that
their wives did the shopping in their household and that it was lovely that us women
wanted to create a crafts website but really there was nothing in it and i just said
well we're actually going to change the face of retailing funny enough it's not a craft website
and that continued right up until the christmas and we were now paying our staff on our
egg credit card checkbooks we were my parents remortgaged their house twice
uh sophie's parents uh lent us money i mean it was dark dark days i mean not in the high
street was definitely on its last breath but the issue was it was working
you know it hadn't been working up until that point we used to have a bell that you would ring when there was a checkout of 30 pounds
and we were taking 10 and this bell would ring every second day and we were just thinking my god
this is just hell but just as we were really running out of money the bell just kept on ringing it was
happening because it was christmas and people wanted great gifts um so that was an
extraordinary journey but one that ended well because we found someone who understood what we were
building um and by the february 2007 we got our first
round of investment how long did that take to find that person so from when you realized you had to
start fundraising to the point when you the money hit your bank let's say well
it must have been uh eight months um but when we were
pitching it was just before christmas and i remember just telling them we hadn't got our first set of accounts yet
you know we were there and i remember my father being in the pitch meeting
and um you know we were putting what we were doing there obviously avoiding the conversation that
we were paying the staff with our credit card checkbooks you know like everything is fine oh my gosh that you
know it's like every time you raise any money the graphs only go you know through the sky and how you're
going to do it will work it out but it was an amazing moment and uh tom tightman who was the
investor had just written the first check for lastminute.com and he saw what we were trying to do and
he actually saw the power of female uh female purchasers
and that whole world and so um we did the pitch and he he you know he
played with rc he basically said that's great thank you so much and we packed up and we left and
my father said i'm so proud of you both knowing that not in the high street just died that we hadn't got the money
and it was finished because where our homes were on the line it was it was finished and just as we pressed
the bell for the elevator he said actually do you have a moment and he bought a bottle of champagne and
and that was it our destinies changed but that was how close we were um but you know we
definitely turned right that meant we got our first vc fantastic and then
um you know we started building not on high street and it was growing very very quickly
was it ever going to fail in your view i know you came close but was it ever going to be not at all never isn't that funny never never never
you know at the same time that we were running out of money i was buying every single euro for the whole world so we couldn't pay
for the heating so we had coats on between you know 9 am and 2 that was the coldest period in our
office and then the because the whole building was being knocked down but we just kept our office
so we had no boiler no heating but i was still buying the urls across the globe and and to this day
i think it's one of the most fantastic businesses um but never would it fail ever
because you know you as a parent you know if your child had any issue would you
not think that you could overcome those issues absolutely and that's the resolut
resolute that you need to be in business it's why i call not in high street my first business baby
holly and co my second i love them as if they are my children um and they will get my my full
attention what is your favorite flavor of heel jack berry my favorite flavor of fuel is
banana berry used to be my favorite flavor and i saw someone tweet the other day they said um because puel is now in tesco's but
the only flavor in tesco's is the chocolate flavor they were sort of demanding tesco's put the um
the berry flavor in because that's steve's favorite it's not my favorite flavor is clearly banana now those are the ones i look for the most
what does huel do for me i mean i've talked about this extensively but for me i get that a nutritionally
complete diet in 60 seconds and in the world i live in that is a that is a remarkable thing and
this is why even before they became a podcast sponsor i was buying heel to my office
um every single week you know and the funny thing is jack who's the director and producer of this podcast
he tried cure once he was like yeah yeah the guy is addicted to hill he's a fiend
for you now because once you see the impact it has you understand the convenience you understand it's nutritionally complete
for me it's life-changing and that's why hula is a bit of a it's a bit of a cult once you try it you can't go back
Optimism in business
you just said there that you know the company was completely out of money but but i i could tell that you also didn't believe it would fail which is a
bit of a contradiction to some degree but well because it was just money yeah and you could you could figure that
out i don't know how yeah but you know you know money is just this
you know okay so if we got the money and the hard bit really is doing the doing isn't it it's building
it so i always just knew somehow this will work out i mean of course you have your terrible dark days
but i knew it was going to work out how could it not were you on to something and i knew that
that level of optimism in upon reflection of your career of the last you know couple of decades how important
has that optimism been that just like unexplainable unjustifiable i don't know why but it'll just it will
all work out optimism because you've also because because you've employed a lot of people seeing the opposite that sense of like catastrophe you know
that catastrophizing oh no we're a [ __ ] you know that kind of oh yeah oh man i've i've kissed a lot of
those frogs um yeah wouldn't you say that that's a common denominator you find
in entrepreneurs 100 i mean even in team members someone so i've i it's so i say i can't
explain it enough i one example i always come back to was um i was flying to brazil and obama was
speaking at the same time as me um on the same stage as me just like i'm speaking just after me
and i thought well obama's here i'm a speaker he's a speaker can't i meet him and someone that was
working for me at the time went oh no i asked somebody and they said no sick as a [ __ ] if they said no ask
someone else and just keep asking and then they're like no no steve we've been asking and they just said no so i'll do it then and i
i sent some emails and within 30 uh within 30 emails someone comes and
grabs me goes come and meet obama yeah and i just think there's always a way there's always a way
and your life yeah and my life is testament to this upset this like there is a way or there's a way that's
you know what i mean there's a way where i have to work harder you know what i mean and i don't i don't allow for this other outcome
which is that oh no we can't i've never allowed for the other outcome ever
and it's actually my entire battery is powered by that and i am told i radiate it
so when you're around me you get hooked on to that and that's can be a really good thing
because it drives people in those dark days when actually the entire world is telling you no
and i'm saying yes and so it's an amazing thing and i think that optimism and actually
now as i said getting older it's actually i i would say there's optimism and now i
also have gratitude that's powering my battery you know i worked out my 40th birthday i have 29
000 days on this planet because i'm and as another golden thread that i'm sure you recognize as
efficiency i'm freaking addicted to it so i needed to know
so you know this life i just need to schedule this a bit so you know so i've got 29 000 days oh
[ __ ] it's not 29 000 days it's 14 000 days because i'm 40 right okay and
so that has also led to a countdown till i die
so that also has fueled this optimism and and [ __ ] it mentality because if today i am going to change
the world which i can it's even fueled even in in a better way
actually i didn't have that not in the high street because that was just you know fire fighting and
optimum was that that that that fuel but now i think i have gratitude
powering that even more and that's been in a beautiful beautiful stage of my life
that is amazing and you're right you so you're you're in survival mode and now you're now you've got choice now i've got
choice and a bit of you know the battle scars are there and i have an appreciation that you know i
can give everything and all but i need to make sure that my time
on the planet is also for me too because i do believe i'm here to serve
and i've again i can only say that now in hindsight but if i am here to serve i need to also
serve myself that sense of by the way i completely um resonate with
this um this focus on the amount of time we have left i wrote about it in my book at very
long length and you i think somewhere behind me there's a little sand timer somewhere on there there's usually a sound timer i don't know it seems to
walk around but because i wrote about it in my book at such length people started buying sound timers and and uploading them online and the
whole point of the sound timers it's one of the things that really allows me it reminds me of time it's like one of the ways we can see time happening
just by turning it you see your life moving away and it's that important reminder just like get on with it and focus on what
matters you mentioned um you now feel like you're here to serve
do you think that comes from understanding your own power yeah i think so i think so i
i would have found that really difficult to tell you 20 years ago but now um
i have been through it and done it and i also know that my optimism helps
people and i can see the effects and i can see you know what we brought up and not in the high street
was full of it you know i used to have people come in to the office um from other businesses that we
would hire they literally could feel it in the air they were uncomfortable with it
it was optimistic it was creative it was emotional and they were like this place is so
emotional and i'm like yeah and they're like uh we need to stop that and i'm like
we're never stopping that and i think that that's what i've realized is that that is what
i can muster up you know i i listen to one of my favorite songs is cloud busting by kate bush
and when i listen to that song i feel like i'm whipping up a storm
and that is my power but what i try and whip up is very positive and good for the soul
good for small businesses good for and what are small businesses they're founders with dreams you know
i love that and so um that is why i've writ potentially that
is now my job description um for the rest of my life is to build something that i can pour
that in and be efficient and so amplify it so not build an empire but be really smart and amplify that
feeling out to other people and help them there's an irony in that that you're talking about whipping up a storm and
your nickname's hurricane holly yeah actually i've never even said that
before and so yes i like that link that just happened there slightly different meaning now it's not
necessarily about urgency and more about i guess just power but yes exactly yeah yeah two different weather
types yeah yeah so take me back so that you start not on the high street it starts moving
Hiring for a business
you've got the vc money things you know team is small things are agile
typically the most fun times yeah yeah the team was small um myself sophie
i hired my sister um who was just going to help me out for a summer uh she still works for me at holly and
co so that's been a good 16 17 years that we've worked together now um
hired then her university friend her university friend came and coded the site
that but you know it's that beautiful moment that you're just literally do you have a pulse and do you breathe
okay would you like to come and work for us you know i was talking to somebody the other day um and he said it's that wonderful
naivety where you get in a car in the cab and the taxi driver is really really chatty and so you almost go and offer them a
job because it's just this moment where you need soldiers you know that's that time isn't it
you don't need the skill we need power and um we need energy and we need commitment
and we need you not to have a high salary that's the that's that moment in time
and so that was what it was and you know we were growing at 2 000
we were trying to keep up with it i call it like that speed train with all the nuts and bolts of flying off and you're
you're at the driving seat and there you're going and as you said with optimism that
energy is just infectious and so we just were growing
so rapidly so we were going from a hundred thousand pounds ttv to
a million the next year to two and a half million to six million now keeping up with that
and also remember in a marketplace you have two clients yeah i always laugh at people that
moan about having one client like try to you know you've got your customers and you've got all the
small businesses which by the way you are only as great as their ability to keep up with 2 000 growth
some of them are growing at 5 000 because they're the hot product and so it's that coaching of that group
of people to keep up with you meanwhile you know the swan to the customers and the swan to the uh
partners which we called them partners from day one you know they weren't sellers we were only as great as they
they were and that was that beautiful shift that we were creating in this world we were we were respecting small
businesses they would get a media pack that cost us way too much i think about five pounds per thing
but we wanted them to know how talented they were we curated from day one which now
you know uh is a word we use a lot back then it was not a word you know why aren't you accepting everybody
and we would be no we're turning away 90 percent of everyone that joins even though they're paying adjoining fee and
we're eating baked beans and worrying about the mortgage we're not getting paid a salary we will
turn away 90 because one day our brand will thank us for it and it did it very very much did
you talk there about hiring and that flipping hiring process at the start which i know very well and i i've joked
about on this podcast before like walking into pride and the guy selling the bags was like jonathan a director i was like yeah
and then like i had some guy on facebook he's called ash one of my good friends now and he even laughs about it he was on job seekers allowance he'd never done
a job in his life i made a marketing director and i was 18 and i was just like [ __ ] it you know like
yeah but you're like what's the worst i don't think i think this could work out right imagine if it does work out
that the taxi driver is going to be amazing funny enough it doesn't necessarily work out that way
almost never so but it's just i think the interview process when you're that naive is literally would you work for me
and they go yep fine you've got the job yeah or is there salary low enough that's actually double bonus
yeah yeah absolutely yeah it's it's a crazy thing the hiring process has been
again on reflection something i'm learning right now to do is that would probably be one of the
most beautiful points of building holly and co is my team and investing heavily in the development of each one
of the souls that i think are life is with me now not on the high street it was the soldiers you needed
the energy and then you get into the next stage don't you where actually those people by very nature
can't stay with the business because now you need skill and there's that awful moment where you're having to let people go for the
first time and bring in skill and to bringing skill you now need to interview don't you and
you now need to be able to know even what the skill is that you're even looking for as you're running at 200 miles an hour
and then it goes into that's next stage where you're now looking for the people to run the people
who you've just hired you know and that process for me was not something i could spend enough
time on i mean we interviewed absolutely everybody until the point that we had a c-suite
and um i always remember my father saying that 90 of my role as ceo
should have been the people 90 of my role was not the people because
how on earth could it be i mean you know you were the next race was happening or we were going
international or you know we've decided to double the company in a year
and now on reflection when i look at that oh it's the people so with holly and co
i've now got a good group of people that i believe are life as and i'm happy
to say that because what i believe is that they don't even know how great they are and i'm going to shine
their diamond until it completely shines and that's dealing with their personal side
that's dealing with their professional skills that's dealing with their whole self um and that is something i'm fascinated
by and i think i'm potentially going to build one of the most incredible teams
um that i've ever been lucky enough to manage and you've
learned those people i just everything you said then i'm not i just agree with it all i agree with every single word because i
went through the same exactly the same journey of hiring anybody bringing in skill
bringing in a bunch of people that had done this job for 20 years to tell me what to do and i got out the way
and i let them run the team and do all the hiring for me but then i also had the reflection three four years in that in fact this whole time what i actually
was was a recruitment company and that was my sole responsibility yeah and then you look at all the people
there and you go to the kitchen that i i would and i would you'd be getting a cup of tea and i
wouldn't know the person to my left how terrible is that and also that you realize when you get that c-suite in
because that's what we need to do because we've now got vcs and we need to get the the huge company cos and the cfos and
all the seas um i call it um in that they just then recruit the carbon
copies of themselves so suddenly you've got an entire organization of many
you know of those people and actually my gosh suddenly the pendulum swings so for not in the
high street remember we always used to say you know we've got our marketplace hat on one day so that is about trading the site and
understanding what customers need and then we've got our retail hat on which is the brand because we're not in
the high street we're not ebay we're not amazon we are not on the high street we are that beautiful mix
because we know our customer and so that was very interesting because actually what you need and require
to be able to curate unique products and unique companies is creativity eyeballs taste
all these things that are unable to excel you cannot put you know many times i've been asked can you just
please tell me the process between a and z of a great product and i'm like you see
you even asking me that my dear means that you don't even understand what makes a great knot in the high
street product so that was the difficulty is that suddenly you would get too much of the
processing too much of the operations everything was a meeting everything was a powerpoint everything
and that room for creativity and life and entrepreneurial spirit started being pushed to the side and
that was a very difficult period in time you know we were you know still growing so
incredibly quickly um so it was a difficult moment to try and balance
that state of growth and tech issues and operational issues and funny enough hr
issues when you have enough people um with that need
to be what i call truffle hunters now you know people that can really find the most unique amazing
small business that will create the next bestsellers did you find yourself at war with the business you
Losing myself within the business
created um
i i loved it so again if i look at being a parent
i loved it but i didn't enjoy them right now you know i found them difficult to live
with you know and that's what i would say it's you never lose your love you never lose the but actually what was
happening was the process had become so big
that the core of what i loved founder titus you know the duracell
battery you know that is why founders are unbelievable should never be moved from a business
whatever should maybe take a new role that's okay because actually they don't enjoy the role of the operations
but that sort of duracell battery when you take it out of a business you know it i'm sure you've interviewed
many people that you something goes the customer even knows it everyone knows it
and so that was that's just been a brilliant uh lesson for me but also a lesson that i
now pass on through holly and co you know holly and co is all about me being vulnerable with the truth
and hopefully inspiring other people that when they're growing their small business and they think they're going to
hire the next person that's going to be the silver bullet a there is zero silver bullets in business but b
it doesn't work without you you know for all your defects and all your faults and all your weaknesses it just doesn't work
without you and was there a moment where you realized that you'd have to take a different role
within the business yeah i suppose it got to that point where um 200 people five vcs i was chairwoman
and ceo um and things were changing you know i was
you know 15 meetings a day running to the loo with my pa who would then brief me as i
was in the loo on my next meeting to go into my office where it was already set up
to be countlessly doing board meetings you know one board mini team would finish and we'd be preparing
for the next board meeting um and basically being
at at a stage where in any given day did i do anything
that i loved you know my new book is do what you love love what you do you know i brought up this business that i loved
but every single day did i actually ever do what i loved and there was that moment
where i needed to make that decision um and it was a pretty
goddamn painful one where i sort of realized i'd lost myself you know i was um i didn't look like i
looked today you know i was in the tube dress with the high heels on double spanx on
i was a she man you know i needed to be that person i was brought up remember i
was 28 when i started i was i was brought up through not on the high street and experience that's all my reference point was and so
i knew i needed to dull motion and you know drive this and be this person and um and i think i was
probably in reflection tired of not being holly
could you feel it yeah yeah yeah yeah but i didn't know at the time like you were just saying i was just in the
motion i was a hamster in the wheel you don't know any different you know you just exist don't you and
your whole purpose is to fuel everybody else and sort of you you realize that when you're not there
things go off the rails and so you have this sense of responsibility and every night i went to sleep
um i would lay on my pillow i would have my son as my responsibility i would have my
home i was the main breadwinner of our home but i would have the thousands of small businesses that if i
go wrong ever you know a lot of them 50 of them relied on that this was their
only income their husbands had quit their job you know they were doing million pounds two million pounds a year like
this was my responsibility and the staff were my responsibilities i had this heaviness so how could i be light
holly how could i smile or laugh i you know i i found myself becoming a different version of
me um one of the lines at holland co is bringing colour to grey and i think i was turning grey did your
partner know that frank yeah yeah you know definitely knew that we were in a catch-22 though you know
when you bring up a business that's providing the only income there's no way out you know
how how does this go somewhere because my ambition you couldn't stop me i was on the
Leaving not on the high street and rediscovering myself
hamster wheel i could see everything you know i always have to be reminded what year i'm in because i can see what the future is
i know what it is so why i just need now need to make it happen that's the the part so you know we we nearly didn't
survive a few times during that um time you know being an entrepreneur and having a relationship
is a very very difficult thing because and having a young child you know harry was three months old when i
started not if the nanny didn't arrive he was put under my desk you know i remember at the age of two he
was under my desk he had a dvd player you remember where you actually put the dvd and you open the screen and you put
the headphones on what sits in ribena and i would just sort of shuffle them in there and there used to be a
program called mr british where she used to talk about putting the baby in the drawer when mr president that was what harry was he was under the thing
because being a woman and a mother no you know the kid doesn't come to work even though
i was the boss but it was their mindset no we are tech female entrepreneurs we have got to be a
certain way um and so that was very challenging and it puts a strain on relationships um
and so that has just been difficult you know you know the downs are very down dark
dark days when you're running out of money you've got to raise again but the business is going amazingly
you have no choice let's do it again um and you know your family takes a toll and
that decision to sort of change your role that's not a decision that's made overnight that's a slow sort of grinding down and other
conversations up until that point with the board and with other people and with frank or yeah
there was i mean it was a bit of a storm of lots of things i can't quite
remember what was going on at that point in time but it was you know another christmas was coming up it's
going to be double what that is coming in um a very full c-suite
managing that group of people um being at you know now vcs are really
waking up you know what we're doing where you know i think we were at 100 over 100 million ttv
you know this was starting to become something it was about internationalization so doing it all again but in other countries
and um there was just this point that that needed to probably not be my existence
in the future so um ripped off the plaster
and did it and decided to get a seasoned ceo to come and replace me
um sophie had left the business at this point a few years before so i was why uh her children were at a
different stage of life um were older than harry so again as a mother it's okay when they're little and she
gave me that great advice you know don't worry you've missed his first steps he won't remember but when they're doing their jesus
season a-levels they freaking need mom and um and so
she you know i realized that i was again i thought i could do it all and i
i just now in hindsight in my father had left a cfo two years before that so i was sort of
on my todd i was now this woman with this group with these feces and um
you know you're always plagued with the imposter syndrome and i think that i allowed that to ha you know
determine a few things in my life now i look back thank goodness for that because what i'm doing today i have
never felt more powerful i've never felt more holy i've never felt more
colorful i've never felt more of a founder than i do today and i'm in complete control
but when we go back to the story of the two times in my life that i lost my identity
might i not rip the plaster off if i'd known what i was going to go through because i'm sure you've had people
describe it it is not funny losing leaving your business if we
relate it to a child how does a mother walk away from his kid you know talk to me about that process
yeah it's a very very hard one i think actually so many more people need to talk about it because i think it's like a bit of a
dark secret like it's it's that thing we're all bound by certain things all this sort of um our ego is at play
here you know there's so many our shame are all those points and i i wish
more founders spoke about this moment it's your entire identity goes now now i
had built i was just you know hi what do you do i'm the ceo of not on the high street
really you know uh when you wake up in the day it's all those emails it's all it's all
that responsibility the pressure on your shoulders wake up the next day
what do you do um you just forget to even say you found
not you know you were the founder of norton high street you're but you're nothing so i had a couple of years that were
maybe two three years two years dark years where you know at stages i couldn't get out of bed
um but you know when i had to do it all again you know i had to look at my brand heart
i had to surround myself with people who could raise the phoenix out of the
ashes um but it was difficult you know i i couldn't go
to events with small businesses i would you know break down i would have to
leave i i couldn't see people that i knew i i couldn't meet socially with people
because i just didn't know who i was um and it was just a very difficult time
in my life how old were you at this this time well i must have been uh 39
no forty fourteen and what you're describing there in terms of symptoms sounds
like depression that phase is actually what i think it is sounds like is um what what i think now i think it is
is grief grief yeah i went through i went through the seven stages of grief
i um it really was a loss you know that was what i was and
especially as i'd always likened it to my child you know i had harry my real baby and i had not nice street now i wasn't
with my second baby so how can a mother do that to start with
what happens when i'm not there it's going to fall and i'm not going to be there to pick it up so it was a very very difficult process
but as i said you know i went through total grief i i i got
counselling i surrounded myself with great people
i instantly had to start building you know it was the only thing i knew in my head um so six months
later i my sister uh was employed by norton high street
she left someone else left who's now my other co-founder and we would sit around my kitchen table
um i decided to ditch the heels so i threw away every single pair of high heels i owned
um today i'm wearing glitter trainers and i have done for five years to really say that actually you can be a
very powerful knowledgeable business woman and wear glitter trainers and actually this is holly
and so slowly i started peeling the spanx off the heels i slowly started rediscovering
who holly was i had some cheerleaders around me who would remind me on the darkest days
and i knew that creativity like it had done with the vegetable reese was there as my savior what i
had to be is holly again and holly is only holly i think with a business within her you know uh
and when i say business and what i'm trying to rediscover with holly and co and trying to put it out there is
actually it's not just business i believe creating a business makes you
happy and actually um striving for happiness i think that when you can control your
own destiny you can work around your family when you can be your most creative self
when you can answer to nobody when you can dictate all of these things where you live what you do
that is a real source of going for happiness and so actually people do ask me why are you
freaking obsessed with business holly like redefining business what is it about business i'm like it's not about
business business is a tool and a key business is just the thing the vehicle
to get all these other things and that is why holly and co sort of had to exist
i did say to my husband never again you know because he couldn't do what i
mean it's huge the whole family goes through your storm you're whipping up but
my yeah yeah oh yeah but when you give them
enough glasses of wine and you can sell anything to anybody you can definitely tell them
so my sisters uh carrie my actual sister gabby who left not in the high street
and has become almost like an adopted sister but with the founders of holly and co they basically said you can't ignore
your bird's eye point of view that you had that is unique to not in the high street you saw thousands upon thousands of
businesses grow from nothing to where they are today because all i was obsessed with was the
common denominators the they all felt alone and yet they were going through the same thing
and i remember when we built not in the high street naively i thought we could have a
consumer site but i knew very quickly that they would need a b2b site because as they were growing
they would need the tools so i said to myself well we'll build two sites when we launched norton high street
obviously that didn't happen um now that b2b site was on the agenda not
in the high street every year for 11 years and uh actually now i think
that holly and co is my b2b scratch that i've itched
but when you talk about business normally it's done in a certain way in a 2d way in a greater way and my plight was to
help the dreamers we have a phrase dream dabble do at holly and co i want to help the
dreamers become doers and i want to help the dreamers go for it and i want to help the doers never give up
and so that means you need to give business a facelift and so that is what i'm trying to do is
create a bubble an existence for these small businesses to live in where i sort of with the my knowledge
have created a world where i answer the needs you know you don't need to have a business plan
you need to have a plan you know one day you might need to have a business plan to raise money but you need to have a plan and the
second you take that you pop that balloon people start coming alive
and so that is why holly and co was where my sisters say you can't
ignore that and that was the moment holly do you know how much knowledge you have in your head that you need to share
and there's the this of service part that came through and i think as i rose from those ashes
as my wings became colorful service was written on my back and that
has now allowed me to put myself out there as quite a private person but because
i'm of service it doesn't matter what i feel it's what i can do for others
and that has just been the again that's the fuel in my duracell battery that just gets me up every single day
quick one i've recently made a purchase i've bought myself a tesla cyber track it's not here yet
they're still not to be delivered and the reason i decided to do that i sold my range rover sport and i ordered a
tesla cyber truck was because i want the vehicle that i drive to be run purely on sustainable energy and
that's also why we were so keen to have my energy become a partner in this podcast so we can start talking about sustainable energy
and one of the great pioneering products that my energy have created is this thing called the zappy which is
so discreet fits on the outside of your home and allows you to charge a huge list of electric cars
including my cyber truck so when my cyber truck comes i'm going to put this on the outside of my house and this
will charge it which i think is just amazing this is britain's number one best-selling solar ev charger
and it's beautiful and i can't wait for my cyber truck to come just so i can have a play with this you refer to holly and coz being a good
Helping people create a âgood-lifeâ business
life business yeah well i i referred to it being a good life business but
i also want to abolish the word sme you know i think that there's a whole new language that even needs to come
into business um and i'm not talking about businesses who want to float on the stock exchange
i'm not talking about tech businesses i'm talking about 99.9 of all um businesses in the uk are small
and medium right i'm talking about that when the founders sat around a kitchen table in their slippers and has come up with a great idea now
they find themselves with 50 people i want to always remind them that they were the founder
with slippers with that crazy idea and that i hear them and i see them and i feel them
and i want to create something for them so the good life it sounds very personal
because um i really you know i'm of service i care
about people enormously you know if i feel emotional when i talk about it
um i want them to have the best life that they can have
and i i really would live in gratitude because i'm experiencing it and i want others to
and i think i could be the key so that is my power and so one of the
things i say to people is you know they're not comfortable calling themselves entrepreneurs they don't want to be an sme hi my
name's julia and i'm an sme they don't want to you know so i say you look you run a good life company
you balance your creativity and your need to drop off the kids and pick them up and have family life
and take august off right with your ambition profitability growth
and your own little empire building you know those are the two things that you balance and that's a good life you're not
looking to get nekkar island at the end you've already and what i always say to people is have you ever looked at where you want to be when you're 80.
you know it's a lot of people don't by the way no one so if you want to be in your business
you know right now my son's working at hollyon coast training as a barista you know he was three months old he's
nearly 17. he towers above me as this strong man that i thought i was going to [ __ ] up
definitely as a baby i'm so proud of him he has his own business
you know that is the good life i have brought up the next generation that needs to understand entrepreneurism
do i i want to exist in a world where he could be by my side in the future
where these group of this team that i've got can work with me for 20 years where my husband where i take fridays
off and i go on a date with my husband that's what my good life looks like and
so that is where you know i can see myself at 90 here
but i do ask people have you looked at the future because you by looking at the future understanding that last point
you can work backwards because it's normally not all the riches the lamborghini the the you know all that thing that we
we we see don't we sunday times rich list you know is that is that really where we're heading or is
it a world where our mental health is stable we're with our family for as much as we can get when our health is good
um where we're creatively fulfilled we're changing the world even if it's just your town
you're doing something and um and that is why now people call themselves a good life business
and that requires as you say like a real change in narrative because instagram and that external voice is
telling you build hire more people make more money and and what i love about what you've
said there as well is you you're you're centering so a lot of the when you ask a business um or their objective is a
lot of them will fall into the trap of and simon sinek talks about this saying we want to be the best or number one and just at the
very end of my time at my business i stood in front of all of my employees in the office and said and explained why
um why we we had to remove that terminology from all of our um from all of our internal and external
comms because um those it views life in our journey as a um
a finite game like we'd get to the number one on the scoreboard but then what then and if and because there's nothing then
once you're number one or you're big or you've made whatever there's nothing then we try and shift the company towards a direction where we viewed it as like an
infinite game where um there isn't a scoreboard and we're trying to create a sustainable life for ourselves
and our company that could theoretically last for many many many decades and when you start viewing your business
and your employees in that way that they might that they could be here for 30 years all of your decisions are
different and your goals are different but it's tough when you have vcs of course of course and so that's it's impossible
and that's what you you then you know you're a chameleon aren't you and so you you will behave a certain way
so with holly and co that's the liberation i have where i understand the value of raising
someone up to the highest point of their lives personally and professionally they are rock stars they've never and they
they know that holly and co was the reason for that they were set free of anything they asked and they're going to
be there for 20 years and they're going to grow so many businesses neglect history as a
really really valuable tool you know what you've done before and what has worked and hasn't worked is
incredibly important um i actually do value the the um the want for people
to become um sort of the the champions i suppose and so
that is now the destination why i don't have the elevator pitch i mean who am i pitching to you know
what why i don't have the destination i have an anchor that anchors my 90th birthday i have an
anchor which is my vision but i don't have to define it yet
because i want to be around for that long and how on earth we know as an entrepreneur you don't you can't tell me what's going
to happen next year you know we we ca we can have a course we have her best intentions and we can think that these
people are going to be the a game um and so that has been the beautiful point and that is the knowledge i'm
trying to share with this community trying to help them understand that
they're not a cookie-cutter business they don't need to be they shouldn't be um and that that's what i'm hopefully
leading by example for me a really pivotal point and what you're saying there was either we had this guy in my business who used to ask
this really annoying question when we were growing he should say um but yeah what's like the purpose of social chain
and he was just asking me that question like what's the what's the what's our purpose what's our purpose and i thought he was a bit
a bit of an irritant because we're trying i'm just trying to keep this thing alive purpose is paying you yeah it's making
sure i can make payday this month then next month and that was my purpose yeah but they got to a point where i did
start to reflect maybe five years in on like what what is this what am i doing this for
um and that's when i went away that i think it was a christmas time and i and i sat down and said what is
the what is the purpose of this company and i came up with this www.thing where i was like um
work welfare in the world these kind of three components so the work we do and the standard of work
we do for our clients and i broke that down into a set of goals and values uh welfare was really about the team and the family that were
working here and then the world was the wider impact that we have because of our existence on the outside world
and again that broke down into a set of goals and objectives about the environment and about philanthropy and that gave us all this kind of www
dot set of values and meaning in the world and that's the thing that pushed me towards realizing that i had to make a
company that was sustainable one not that one not one that was driven for the stock market i
had lost control of the company because there was i owned a small percent by this stage
there was board members that were triple my age i was still the ceo but a lot of it's
lip service when you don't really have control right they want they need to keep you happy because you have a lot of influence over a lot of things um but i
couldn't steer the company in the direction i wanted to and you have different objectives there's a
lot of people 95 of people in the board are trying to make money just more and more money by any means necessary and you're trying
to be this founder that's got these dreams and visions of beauty and talking about purpose and values
yeah and it it's just nonsense in that environment and i realized that's why i resigned last year i
realized that the way that i wanted to take the business in was not possible i no longer had that control because starting at 21 giving up that control
you can't get it back you can't and now you you have got the war scars you've got the battle scars
and then what's so fascinating and i'm excited for you is whatever's next you've had those hard
lessons and potentially what you'll build next is going to be your good life company
where you can start resetting some of those things rewiring for yourself and we're lucky to
be able to do it again you know that's the amazing thing but you know it's never do you care
still about the business um it's still my baby like
i remember i saw someone on a competitor on linkedin the other day just like they had like um they'd paid to
take us our name on um seo oh yes yeah yeah you're just like oh you were really looking for serious chamber
and i was looking at the new [ __ ] yeah yeah and then you're almost like who's not looking at that
yeah yeah you wanted to call someone yes why is yesterday there was a tweet on social
chains twitter and i was like and i i posted to the managing director of the us i'm like yeah someone needs to step in here and
clarify and i literally took a screenshot i'm like i would if i was there if
you know it's it's a interesting um world that we're living in at the moment
i think what's beautiful for holly and co is we are we are right in the zeitgeist
of what people are feeling so um you know when we're all looking at
you know the freelance economy when we're all looking at the changes remember not in the high street was built when the high street was declining
holly and co is here when we're all valuing mental health is something that we do talk about um changing the world purpose our
environment all these sorts of things and so that is what i'm excited about because we are
able to pivot able to move um and we're building something that is at the time that people need it
um we're going to have a lot of displaced people and they're going to need to be entrepreneurial and they're going to
need to probably have their own businesses and that's what i hope we can do is provide them with the the
guide i suppose and that's brings us to do what you love love what you do
Do what you love, love what you do
yeah yeah it's an amazing experience i'm a dyslexic so um writing
you know i remember not in high street so if you had to check all my emails that wasn't probably great because that
meant that i definitely thought i couldn't and remember she could rewrite the english dictionary so it was probably the wrong person but
right person at the time um i didn't write until four years ago when i started my
instagram account holly tucker and i now write a post every day but i
would have to get my founders to check the post because you know i couldn't do it
and you know again they raised me up they said actually you can write so fast
forward how on earth could i write a book so during lockdown one um i created something called sme sos
actually for my community so i went live every day on instagram to try and demystify the news to try and
be there for them literally just be there every 10 o'clock every morning i'm just going to be here for you and we
can just do this together but what they didn't know i was also writing a book in the morning first thing
and it was one of the most beautiful experiences ever because people liked
who i was and how i wrote and um yeah there were loads of spelling mistakes and d's were bees and all this sort of
stuff um but it was a wonderful experience and it allowed me in a book to
almost put down everything we've spoken about today bringing color to gray being passionate
your energy you don't have to be great at the p l you have to be great at being you and
we'll figure all the rest out at another stage um that you are the founder that you're
the heartbeat brand and purpose is one of the most important things that you can
put into your business and so they're micro chapters because all the small businesses that i
uh virtually mentor don't have much time so you can pick it up kids can be screaming you can read a
micro chapter we created a exclusive product range so every micro chapter has a
almost merch that goes with it but obviously all the 50 small businesses that work with me
actually do what they love and love what they do which i just love that circle it's a color book which was funny
because business books normally aren't color but of course it had to be color and
it's um yeah sunday times bestseller and i'm super proud of it and i hope that now writing
books will be part of my life until that age that we speak about where i'm
gonna wear lots of jewelry big glasses and drink lots of wine
it's such a beautiful book business books aren't usually like this they're usually quite exclusive in the way that they're
created and the way that they look and then never color so you look at it and think ah work yes you know what i mean well that was the
whole purpose for the creative bunch um that our small businesses you need to be able to love it and it
you know it needs to be it needed to speak to you um and so many it's been helping
so many people it's just insane and so um yeah it's just one of those moments in
my life that i can't believe i get to be this lucky and i i imagine because the same with my
my book did you did you realize it would be that rewarding because the effort to
create it is oh it's a lot but then when you published and you got it out there and you felt the wave of
inbound yeah i didn't at all i didn't even realize you know it's like everything isn't it
when you're doing something you're not actually you're so fast forward you're like oh i've written that
book i really hope i get another b you don't actually think about the moment actually the book is born
you know so you're all you know up to that point and then you slightly move on you know you know and then the books
launch you're like oh my god i've written a book look at that person oh that was me yes i remember that and because of
covert and timings and things like that but the you know the process is not an easy one right when the editor comes
back and goes could you just insert that um thought into that paragraph thing you think really really does it
really necessary um and yeah so it's just been wonderful and and as i said having people the amount
it was shared it was as if it was the community's book and that i never explicitly said that to the team
but that's exactly what we wanted it needs to be the book that represented the good life businesses
that someone was talking their language and so that has been uh really humbling what a
wonderful sort of demystifying both book but also conversation today it's been an absolute honor to meet you and to have
this conversation with you and you're right you're one of those people that i think culture really needs right now someone that's been there and done it
come out the other side and said hear all the things that are [ __ ] up about the system and don't make the mistakes
that i made or fall into the traps that i fell into and i think that's um that's going to liberate a lot of people but as you say
it's going to lead them to a much better life so i thank you for that because i think we need more people in society that um
are willing to fight that fight and it feels like such a selfless one even though it must be selfish to some degree because it's giving you such a huge
sense of purpose right yeah well i i can't believe this gets to be my life get to meet you
yeah i'm a big fan of this podcast can't believe i'm on it um i was just saying that i was so
nervous i've only been on a few i'm very good at talking to others i'm so interested in other people's but i i'm not very
you know i don't do this very often so um it's been an absolute honor to meet you and i wish
you um your good life business in the future well i'm going to let you know and you're going to have to help me maybe yeah some advice
thank you so much
[Music]

Transcription:

Intro
this is like a therapy session patricia bryant she's a creator author entrepreneur with an incredible
story growing up my mum should take us to offices to clean the offices and we'll go to school
and she would say like just don't tell anyone that you're working at five o'clock in the morning you just go to school in the morning and
act like everything was normal there is pressure for influencers to speak up on every topic
all the time bearing in mind that my forte is makeup and clothing and financed you
know to an extent but we are not credible sources who know everything we just don't and i think it's really
important for us to say speaking up on stuff that you know nothing about is very very dangerous i had a stalker for like three
years and it was someone who would like just message me on all my platforms constantly
send emails message family members so i did a meet and greet an event
and then they messaged me like haha i was at your meet and greet so i remember feeling so anxious
you didn't see me you look so terrible in person next time i'm gonna do something
patricia bryant she's a creator author entrepreneur and a mother and she has a remarkable
inspiring story growing up on a councillors day having her dad deported when she was just five years old
a nigerian mother that came to this country doing cleaning jobs at night which she took patricia along
to with her and that mother became a property mogul and patricia
she became a superstar in her own right so it's no surprise that when i looked
at the comments section on a previous podcast episode a comment requesting patricia bright to
sit here with me and to be on this podcast had over a hundred upvotes and now i
know why her attitude perspective ambition self-belief resilience is incredible
so without further ado i'm stephen bartlett and this is the diver of a ceo i hope nobody's listening but if you are
then please keep this to yourself
Your early years
yes we share one big similarity with our childhoods in the fact that we both had nigerian
mothers we do we do yeah i didn't know that really no i didn't actually well i still have
nigerian mother so yeah yeah we both have nigerian mothers and um i believe both of our nigerian
mothers moved from nigeria to the uk yeah um so they they were both born in
nigeria so they're you know authentic roots are there but you know tell me about the rest of your
childhood i only had one nigerian parent i heard okay you had two yeah i had both my mum
and dad um growing up um but my dad was actually deported so he got deported when i was probably
like six years old and i actually remember the experience of his deportation as being something very
traumatic in hindsight as an adult i recognized that but growing up you know with an african mom
african dad our culture was just a part of us on an everyday basis
but also i was from south london as well so i kind of grew up in battersea and i came from a very diverse school
but i always went back to like a very african home and um
yeah i think it really shaped me to who i am today in what ways i think it's that kind of
i'm going to say aggression there's something about nigerians out of all other people from say the diaspora
um that i think means that we're quite aggressive and very passionate let's not say aggressive let's say passionate
we're intense we know what we want and there's also a huge sense of like pride as well that we can do
anything and we're good and i feel very privileged that i had a lot of that
you're great you'll do well you'll be successful don't worry about what's going on don't
don't see reality as a definition of a limitation for yourself and i think that that's really made me
do a lot of things that supposedly i shouldn't be able to do but that kind of upbringing made me be like
no i can do it it's fine it was always fine i watched my mum do a lot of things
that would be considered impossible for her and she just did it with ease and chaos
in my opinion now but somehow she kind of achieved those things and i would feel very privileged to kind
of grow up with that sense of confidence instilled in me which i think is really
cultural as a nigerian and i bet she didn't complain either oh there was no complaining she did she
just got on with it like even when my dad was deported she just got on with it and there were times
that you know growing up my mom used to work on the trains so she was one of the train cleaners
and my sister's three and i'm five she'd go out at night and leave us because there was no one to like look
after her kids she'd go out she'll clean she'll clean offices she'll take us to
offices to clean the offices when we were younger and um she just did it and we'll go to school and she would say
like just don't tell anyone that you're working at five o'clock in the morning she obviously you're not going to go to
school and tell people oh i've just been at foxton's like cleaning and helping my mom out you just
go to school in the morning and that like everything was normal um but no there wasn't any complaining and she just kind of got on with it
and do you think you know you referred to that as being that gave you kind of confidence that you could do anything but for me it sounds a lot like
because that immigrant story is so connected with like survival and that's why i talked about like she
didn't complain because it's like a lot of complaint comes from privilege almost doesn't it when you
feel like you have a choice yeah but what's really also really interesting is that some people still feel lucky
the fact that she wasn't deported when my dad was deported she probably felt oh my god i'm so lucky
i got to kind of stay here and um why would you complain when you feel like you're in a better position
for yourself and your children in the long term so yeah she didn't have the privilege of
wanting to complain but i think she was really like happy to still be here though she had to work hard
i think she knew that she had a lot of opportunity while being here and she'd be trained
and she she became a nurse and then she bought properties and then she retired in her 40s like i love
england in that it's kind of like the land of opportunity for those who really want to like you know work out what to do and
use it so i think she could see that that was possible for her and you talked about that that day when you were six
years old when you're there's a knock on the door at nighttime at night time it might have been
at night it might have been in the middle of the day to be honest what i do remember is like literally
about four burley police officers officers kind of walking in
um shouting like screaming like and there's me as a five-year-old my sister is a
three-year-old my mom in tears and then literally dragging my dad out of the house and it was like
your dad's gone like at that one moment and we didn't see him again for seven years afterwards so it was like i at the time
i didn't i never processed it it's only in the last year or two i've processed how kind of maybe traumatic that kind of
experience would have been for me as a child and i think it's also made me really be
fearful of loss which is why i work so hard so that things like that don't happen hopefully
to me and my family in the future so in the last couple of years you've had time to reflect on that and you i
guess you're saying did you choose to reflect on that or go through the journey of reflecting that because you could see
things in your behavior that you thought maybe that's connected i didn't even recognize it i knew that
there was like i work really hard like i'm really intense and i'm always like let's just keep going i'm always like that
and until i literally you know started to have therapy as like where does that come from and it was
that then got uncovered in my therapy sessions that actually the maybe one of the triggers for me
like working hard was because because of that maybe fear of loss um and obviously there's other aspects
as well i just like hustling that's fun but there was also maybe this thing here
that was one of my drivers that i've actually used in a positive way but it's also important to kind of reflect
on like dealing with things like that and i think that i came from a place of no it happened
that just happened it's fine on to the next whereas like when you sit down and talk about it you're like
oh that's that's not great yeah that's 50 years old that's not a great situation yeah yeah it must have taught you something about
something even if that lesson was wrong that's where i think about it i'm like that must have taught you something about the nature of life because at five
years old you're learning what the world means and what this means and that power and your dad and your mum i must have taught you some lesson about something
even if that lesson was wrong right yeah exactly i mean i didn't even realize that it could have been teaching
me something like no idea but maybe that
stuff happened that's life you're not really in control of anything um but things like that can't stop you
yeah i mean yeah i think if my parents were snatched out of my house i definitely wouldn't feel safe
yeah i wouldn't feel safe you know because that's parents represent the foundation of like
safety in yeah this is my house and these are my parents and they just are yeah and then one of those things is snatched out
it makes you i guess insecure about ever feeling too safe to somebody yeah but i think for me
maybe mine was that i can't rely on the system or other people to
secure my safety maybe and so i kind of i'm always trying to make sure i secure myself
with the actions that i take because those are the only things i'm in control of so i'm very much like i'll do it myself
i swear out myself oh don't worry because you never know what's going to happen there and i i'm like that as a person does
that make you paranoid about i guess
everything professionally no it makes me really objective i'm like
i'm a pure realist like something that's probably going to go wrong at some point in time and
that's fine like how are you going to handle that like it's almost like i prepare for something to
go wrong in a way this is like a therapy session oh yeah i mean this is
this is pretty much what this podcast is okay great yeah well no i just find i i think when i started this podcast i i am
i was anticipating to find these like wild differences between everybody but in fact i found the opposite which
is that fundamentally um we're all very very similar right when it relates to things like
insecurity and safety and childhood and then um obviously because in many respects you've gone on to create a career for
yourself that is so different from so many it would sometimes you think well what was the initial catalyst that
caused that person to be different what was the like the environment it's almost like a cauldron what was the furnace they were
like scolded in to make them then more hardworking or obsessive or whatever and
um yeah i guess i mean having a nigerian mother i already know what that part is like you
could call it a cauldron yeah yeah yeah yeah that work ethic piece as well which um is quite absent in this culture um and
that you know what we talked about complaining you referred to this as the land of opportunity
yeah how does that make you feel when you see people who have lots of a much
more let's say financially privileged start to life um and they
don't fully understand the opportunity the land of opportunity so my first thought is like i roll
like oh there you go moaning or complaining but i also realized that there's so many
different types of privileges that people have that can actually provide them like a
long-term foundation i think that if you do some people have financial privilege but they have no
love they have no hope they have no no one to tell them that they're good whereas i mean
i've had the financial privileges but i had a mom who was so loving and so caring and
so encouraging that i was in a better position just because i had that so i don't want to ever tell someone
that you're privileged because of xyz maybe in other areas they
didn't have the support that they needed to actually um spur them on to be the
best version of themselves um so i try not to be that judgmental
anymore because there's so many different categorizations of privilege and at some point you know you said your
mum she retrained herself she became a nurse which is amazing yeah um
and off you went to university i did yeah i went off to university mmu we have a similarity oh my gosh i
love that yeah yeah i lost one lecture but i was there for all three years but i just
dropped out yeah okay great and we have that in common because i i was barely there but i was i had a great social
life so it was enjoying manchester is great it was great yeah yeah no i went to university after like leaving home and i
was so ready to like get out of my house and get out of london and try something new and then find myself
in like a new city i actually went in to do fashion marketing and to my parents
despair because again as an african you don't do fashion that's not that's not a real course you do
accounting you do law you do business you don't do fashion marketing
um but i think i've always had this kind of more creative or creative streak as well as rebellious
streak as well like i'm going to do what i want to do um but funny i kind of went there to do
fashion but changed my course to accounting and finance because i realized that there was no
financial hope in fashion i was like oh i'm not going to be broke when i leave university hell
no so i changed purely on that on that basis that you purely on that basis i didn't love my
course and then when they were doing internship opportunities they were paying interns
8k a year 10k a year and like graduate starting salaries were like 8k and i was like i i'm not
rich enough to do this no way and then i found out about accounting and finance and they they were like the banks that
had really good opportunities and i was really good at the accounting because we had a module
um in the fashion marketing and i would i smashed it and i was like i'll do accounting and finance
wow you said at this point that you were your parents you know typical nigerian parents my mom was the same when i actually when i dropped out is when i
got help but uh yeah because you know that's even worse rather you're doing something at
university just i feel like part of it's just just so she can tell her friends or something i was like do you know what i mean it's just like
it's like i'm going to university so that you get a degree as being a good mother
my child is at university is what they tell all the aunties like it's very important yeah and at
that point your dad was he was back in your life yes so by the time i was about 12 he came back
um so fundamentally they defined his deportation as an illegal deportation
but we i remember going to the court cases and my mom pleading with you know social services and
lawyers and just people help us help us get my our dad back like how do we do this and then
we went to the court case and she was like i don't know why this man was deported like gavel down bring him back i was
like that took seven years for you guys to do that but he got back and like he just started
again worked as a security guard did all of that kind of stuff and then ended up working in the home office
for immigration which is so random because he was you know deported are you pissed
off about that the fact that you lost your dad for seven years for what
what sounds like it was a bit of a mistake or just negligence or at least a lack of empathy to take a
dad from their kids for what yeah oh am i i'm not pissed off
maybe i haven't processed it enough to be pissed off it just felt like it is what it is and this is how it went
um i felt more upset for my mum in that i know how difficult it was for her to like
have us and have responsibilities and deal with like managing this court case
she managed it her entire self she represented herself because she didn't have money for like lawyers and stuff
so she was under a lot of stress but she did it and she did other stuff as well so that was really
the main thing that kind of upset me i'd say when did your dad come back did you have a relationship with
him it was weird it was so weird it's like this is my dad hi dad like how how do we have a
relationship with a man we haven't seen for seven years but um you know he was the kind of
what stoic african dad so i remember he always gave me an envelope with money at
the beginning of term like well done look after yourself okay how's the weather are you reading your books yes dad yes
dad okay good like it was that kind of relationship but i knew it was it was still caring it was the way he kind of
communicated his care for me which is that envelope of cash and that's probably like a nigerian
generational cycle of like male figures yeah just being a bit you know a bit standoffish
about caring and when they ask you certain questions whether it's about the weather or your
studies how are how is your studies going like that's just they don't really know what else to
ask you but them asking you that is is powerful and my dad calls me every day is
hi how are you fine dad how'd the kids find dad okay bye like it just it's that checking
in which is really i like it i think that's probably also just a male
a male issue i think men typically aren't as um emotionally open so they don't build
that you know because vulnerability it's well connection seems to be built on vulnerability and they seem to have a bit of a guard up i
my dad is definitely exactly the same like yeah the questions are so like you know just say hi yes are you okay
yes okay goodbye yeah yeah let me know if you're not okay
exactly yeah um so mmu you go there you feel a bit out of place
yeah quite out of place what do you mean by that because i'd never left like london and
Feeling out of place
i'd like i had to make new friends and i didn't know anyone and i wasn't really good at it and i i couldn't
really find my tribe very early on and i was on a campus really far away i was on the
didsbury campus oh yeah like that was the town yeah out of town right and then there was like the main campus for manchester
university that everyone was at that's where i was
yeah where i was like come on um and i actually ended up like
moving out of my halls of residence really and crashing with a number of girls um in that main
campus and i would move from room to room so once one friend got annoyed of me after two weeks
another friend would say i'd stay with them for two weeks and then i'd just go back and forth like a nomad
for a bit and you you change course to accounting yeah
in hindsight how important was it how like pivotal was it for you to have an understanding of finance for everything that would then
come in your in your career because i feel like i feel like finance is such a neglected topic for
for kids i wish someone had told me about [ __ ] credit scores before i smashed mine
okay so the moving role was pivotal for my life like it set me up on a completely different
trajectory that i i wouldn't have even been aware of because off the back of that role i worked at
you know all the top four four companies in the world in finance i worked at merrill lynch and deloitte consulting
banks all of that stuff i would have never done that if i'd stayed in fashion when it came to her from a
personal finance perspective didn't prepare me at all really not a clue i owed the tax man
money i i i got my taxes wrong i had to pay fines i had no clue what i was actually
doing i had the degree i had the t1 great you've passed how do you actually apply financial
knowledge to running your own business to your everyday personal taxes like
i didn't have a clue spent the money bought bags made extra money on the side spent it
all oh the tax man and i wasn't prepared [ __ ] hell well i mean that's
a great advert for manchester united university maybe it was just me maybe i was just like young and dumb but
like it helped me from a career perspective but a lot of the financial courses out there
don't help people be better themselves of money and that's psychology point because money isn't such an emotional thing
especially as like an immigrant yeah oh yeah exactly yeah when you come and you grew up on a councillor state right growing
up in a council state getting money yeah dangerous concoction for getting a lamborghini or [ __ ] up with some
chanel bag or some [ __ ] exactly but like i grew up on the council estate
and then my mom bought her council house rights for 17 grand sold that house for
250 grand used that money to buy it to build a property empire and that's how she ended up retiring so
when i was in manchester i was actually my mom bought like four houses in manchester so i was doing
property management while being a student so i was still like running businessy stuff like as a student
so even though i had that came from the council background i'd seen kind of like how hustle and
money could kind of be made and that i didn't have to be broke forever if i was kind of smart about it
your mom sounds like all right beast she's wild she bought four houses while you're in manchester
yeah no how many no three oh well yeah so different yeah yeah but they were
and i can't swear they're like right can i swear of course you can swim
she was just in it for the flip oh yeah exactly yeah so you start at some point blogging while at university and
why did you turn to blogging why why was that a compelling path blogging or vlogging
i kind of went into it because i kind of had like a friendship fallout and i became a bit of
a loner like i didn't have a big social group like people would go out without me and i would live with a group of girls
and they'd all go out together and i'd be like left at home by myself so i i found like online communities
so i was part of different forums before reddit was read it before youtube existed there were like
forums where girls would talk to each other about beauty and makeup and i'd spend hours like writing to
these girls across the world and sending them pictures and they're used to before instagram there was [ __ ]
key there's all these platforms where we were communicating and then um
some of the girls would send videos to each other of like their new hair and their new makeup like
so random and then youtube had just launched it's like this is a great way to send videos
to each other and so i kind of got sucked up in communi communicating with all the people that i
met online because my real life wasn't that great and i guess when you started in youtube
you never never thought it was anything more than a no it wasn't a thing
at the time of me like watching youtube and kind of creating on the platform there wasn't actually that many people on
there um and so like little artists could go viral and there'd be like there's a song chocolate rain i
don't know if you guys remember what i remember with the the black guy with the hat yeah like yeah yeah that was like
mind-blowingly amazing and then what there was michelle phan she was like the main beauty girl that
was really like killing it so it was such a small little ecosystem that
wasn't a business but it was genuinely about like connecting and talking to other people online why did you do so well in
hindsight on youtube honestly length of time like i was just doing it for a really
long time and i was very transparent like i was so transparent i
was putting a lot of information out there um i wasn't that strategic with it but i
loved talking to people online like they were literally my friends and i used it a bit like a online diary
in a way very earlier on um but it wasn't like a
full-time thing i was like interning and working um but i think eventually i got really
strategic about it and that's when i saw like more growth or huge growth um you were saying that you
know you first started um like the online forums and stuff at a time when you'd like falling out with your flatmates
and um i guess from what it sounds like youtube was giving you that sense of like community i guess and
that you weren't getting in the real world fact yes definitely i didn't have like a huge
social life after a while um after the fallout and i had so much solace with just this
online community i never felt lonely because i could log in and there'd be someone on there and i could read
all the forum updates and talk to the girls who are into the things that i was into
they were all over the world it was just really nice to like have friends you referred to the fallout as if it was
a really pivotal moment in your life it was it wasn't uh it wasn't that
pivotal but it's quite hard when you're at uni and like your friends are off doing stuff and like meeting people and then you're you
don't have anything to do or they they're not talking to you it feels like a big thing in in real life it's really not a big
thing like but at the time it was like i'm so lonely i'll go online okay yeah wow good thing
you did what a journey and you say consistency you point at consistency as being the real
Turning your hobby into a job
factor to your success but consistency must come from you know enjoying it because there'll be
a lot of people listening to this thinking i want to be a youtuber i mean everybody seems to want to be a youtuber yeah but the insanity to do it as long
as you did without the um guarantee of money must have come from somewhere
there was no guarantee of money it was a hobby like if you're a painter you like painting at the weekend you're
gonna paint anyway whether someone pays you for your art or not you just enjoy doing it so i just enjoyed making videos
that other girls watch and i could talk to the other girls so i didn't get paid for like four years
but i was always uploading every weekend it was my hobby like it wasn't this is
going to be my new job which is why i even struggle with it now and that i really want to enjoy it in the same way that i
always enjoyed it and do i need to look for a new hobby and is now youtube my job like
oh i find it really hard to kind of balance the fact that this thing that was my my escape is kind
of like my job now there's we i was talking to one of the guests on the podcast a couple of weeks ago about um this study where when someone gets paid
to do a task they used to love doing they lose motivation for it and it's just mental they they do the study where
they give people this game people enjoy doing the game they then say we're going to ask you to do the game again but this time you're going to
get paid the other group don't get paid and the group that got paid to do the thing they just enjoyed doing
lose motivation doesn't it make a lot of sense you two stopped paying me
i like those checks um that is insane it's you lose internal motivation when
it becomes when when some of the um reason for doing it becomes
extrinsic monetary so and this is a you know it's a wise oh my gosh it's
tough isn't it it's really tough because people are like oh my god like what privileged conversation
it's not because like say imagine someone's like a a dart player or something right but
eventually once they get into the competitive sports of darts maybe it becomes a bit more stressful maybe they don't enjoy it as
much maybe the the the challenge of doing it is now i've got to perform for my management
and the the crew or whatever there's a dark crew
i just made that up but that becomes like i don't know more pressure than the person who just
wanted to play darts on the saturday night would feel can you feel that no no but the reason being is that
i'm i try to frame what i do as i've accepted that i have a huge desire
to create stuff right that's it so as long as i focus on this process is creation this process is
creation i'll be fine and that might mean saying no to work and no to sponsorships for a season so i
can at least feel that creation because it i'm very much like how do i feel about this which is kind
of bad but also it's allowed me to do what i'm doing feels like a good long-term strategy
yeah right because if you're not asking that question in the short term how do i feel about this so many people in fact i think the guest
that just sat in that chair last um you end up gradually becoming someone
you never intended to be and ending up someone you never intended to go so that constant asking of that question
how do i feel about this today which as you alluded to means turning down money sometimes
but you know thinking longer term about what you're doing and why you're doing it i think is so critical so critically important you know the
thing that had the biggest positive impact on me sticking to the gym has been this change in mindset and i've talked about this
extensively on this podcast about how i used to view my goals in the gym as being super superficial and attached to a season
to summer looking good for summer and that the shift came in me when i started asking myself this
question and i started viewing life as one season so i'd say to myself if if life is to be one season then what can i do
sustainably over the next 50 years what are the healthy habits that i could maintain
and that moves you from a place of intensity to consistency and one of the things that has really
helped me get in great shape is the ready to drink cures in the bottles as you'll know i've had them for
three to four years i've had two today alone but also huel's brand new protein product i've completely finished the salted
caramel one and i'm now starting my journey with the banana milkshake and it just tastes amazing
and the crazy thing is it's 105 calories some people historically you know when we
think about protein shakes we look at the calorie number when we see 300 calories it's 105 calories you get all of your
vitamins and minerals and it's 20 grams of protein for me this might be the best product that you would
have ever created and in terms of the results well they speak for themselves you know we've got two guests that have
How did you find the confidence to shift careers
come to watch this podcast today and sophia i said sophia you know she's she's followed you for some time i said sophia if you could ask patricia any
question what would it be she said to me um how did she find the confidence to make the leap from that sort of
corporate career to going full time with this thing called youtube
so for me my confidence came from an excel spreadsheet so i am not a risk taker i'm
more of a steady and stable person but i did a bit of maths i did a bit of a projection i looked at
what my long-term potential earnings and lifestyle would look like if i
stayed in the banking industry and then i looked at what my numbers were looking like
you know if i stayed as a creator where could i take it and even at that time i had no clue i
could get to where i am today but the numbers looked healthy enough so i was like okay i'll take the leap even if i do it
for two years it could be okay um and i didn't just jump out i kind of um took a
toe dip in and i quit my job but then i took another job that was part time so i could make content and have a job
as well and you call your mum you say quit my job i didn't tell her i didn't tell my
mom i didn't tell anybody what you've quit your big banking job oh hell no i could never do that so
i knew my parents would be worried and scared should we tell them now no no no no so mom i left my job
they barely know what i do right now they're like i do this thing on the internet they're like oh wow
it's fine yeah yeah so my mom but yeah so you made that you took that leap into youtube um was there a moment where
you think [ __ ] how this is this is moving this is or was it just one step at a time slow
and steady yeah slow and steady i was making i'd been making content for seven years
and then i got to a million subscribers so i didn't have any of those really viral moments and i saw lots of
people kind of steamroll ahead of me like go viral they were part of these groups and these
crews and you know there was a time that there was a thing called the brick pack they were all there and i was just like in the corner by
myself like plodding along and then inevitably like my my time
came and it took again that seven years to one million and then one more year to another
million and a half and i then had my own viral moment off the back of myself
and um but i never kind of took the step back to be like oh you've made it
because i never feel like i've made it not even now not yet
a lot of people might be surprised by that um maybe but it depends on someone's
personal definition of making it right and what's yours domination
what is mine um it's not just being popular on social media that's not my
complete definition of success right i think for me it's like creating things that i want to create
when i want to create them and monetizing them and bringing value so
if i say my overall thing that's it what that looks like i don't know just yet and you don't think you're there yet you
don't think you're creating things that you really oh i'm doing it i'm doing it but i don't think i've had like one
big thing yeah does anyone have one big thing though i don't know i think that i you know i
think if you'd gone back and asked patricia when she was at mmu what her making it look like you would have said you know hundred thousand
followers on my
yeah so maybe the goal post is just moving off into the future maybe that's maybe that speaks to what
life is it's just that journey as opposed to that destination right so yeah yeah and influencers being an
Being an influencer
influencer talk to me about that when i say it you know what do you think about
the lifestyle the stigmas etc etc so when people say influence i think
there's a little cringe when they say it but i think this concept of being
influential is has always been around but it's always been around with the hands of
the upper echelon of people only certain people are are picked by certain industries to be
influential but what i love is like now there's this democratization
people can choose who they want to be influenced by and how i got in my position is because
people liked me they decided that actually i want to hear what patricia has to say i want to see what she's buying i want to see what
she likes so i think it's a really powerful tool we've all been influenced the question
is like we want to choose who those influences are it's a it's a it's a big i guess
responsibility to some because i know for a fact that every time something happens in the world
you get a dm patricia i thought you were with us why aren't you doing 55 instagram posts
about palestine or kenya or india or oxygen in
the fires in australia i thought you were one of it's a lot it's a lot that's a lot bearing in mind that my
forte is makeup and clothing and and maybe financed you know to an extent
i feel there is pressure for influencers to
speak up on every topic all the time but we are not credible
sources who know everything we just don't and i think it's really important for us to say we're ignorant on a matter and we're
learning but kind of speaking up on stuff that you know nothing about is very very stupid dangerous yeah yeah and stupid
yeah um and also what is really scary is that if you don't think the same way that
everybody else thinks you're in trouble what if you have an alternative perspective you're not allowed to have
an alternative perspective if you ask of peace whether or not it's you know in the middle east specifically
Being a woman on social media
or for on a certain matter oh no way because the world wants to keep
everything burning but like personally i'm like can can this just chill like not just that situation
specifically but a lot of situations i'm like i just wish it wasn't happening is that
your approach to it you think generally if i don't have a a proper well-rounded view
because it's all well people like because i get the same this is how i know you'd get the same people message me and say steve speak on
this issue or black lives matter or whatever um while i'm still processing it and what you're right what they're actually saying is
share my opinion to your followers on this issue and they're trying to try and like guilt
trip me into it like yeah you know especially when it's when it's a group of people that i can relate
to just viscerally so like my skin color yeah yeah i'm expected to be a you know the spokesman of all black
people yeah oh me too as well yeah yeah it's a lot of yeah a lot of um nastiness what what else do you think is
um unappreciated about being an influencer you've obviously got a big platform the other thing i was going to say right this is what i was just thinking as
we're talking um the other day i thought and i've been working out for a year and a half now i always like talking about this
love it um and grace who sat behind that curtain over there i sent her a photo i'm going to post
like a transformation picture okay like the before and after and me and grace had a conversation because
if i was a female and i'd posted that i would have got [ __ ] ripped to
pieces right i would have been told i was toxic irresponsible body image
yeah i posted it fine yeah 100 of people like send us your plan like whatever yeah yeah and it really made me reflect on
how tough it is to be a woman on social media with a big audience it's like
the standard of perfection in terms of your like morals what you're posting how you're posting
what you're saying is a high bar to reach yeah whereas i'm not held to that standard as a guy okay
yeah yeah i'm not surprised but there's gonna be different standards
you're held by so with the women like us there's a lot of pressure around our
appearance or if we're mothers how we mother or what we're wearing i mean it's so random
but i'm sure there's definitely things that men are going to expect from you
that that i can't believe you did this or something even relates to success it's like i can come on and i could come
on this podcast yeah and say that i the reason i'm successful is because of me
and i can talk about my big old ambitions and i'm gonna when a woman does it it's like you know
what i mean it just seems like there's just a double a total double standard the fact that i can post me being kind of slightly
overweight in that shape and then like nine 19 pack like do you know what i mean i saw many
videos you said seven abs or whatever like seven abs whatever and the comments are like whoo but i
know if if um if a woman did the same thing it would be like this is irresponsible what
are you saying fat shame why is that i mean because
like men and women are fundamentally different so presuming that your audience is like
probably say sixty percent to seventy percent male 1 eighty percent women eighty percent with uh
i think women judge men by different standards so what you'll see oh let's talk about this what you'll
actually see in the world of beauty and women's fashion and um industries that are
predominantly consumed by women men are always at the forefront so the biggest
influences in the beauty industry are five men men who wear makeup right and that's yeah so men who wear
makeup are more popular than or let's say three men who wear makeup
can be bigger and get to bigger stratospheres than any women could um the fashion
industry and fashion brands all of them the majority of them are owned by men and ran by men or
creative directors are men not women not women there aren't a lot of brands that are run and owned by
women and i just think this is something to do with biology sociology the way in which kind of women
interact with men is different to how we interact with each other i wish it was different
but i've i've just noticed this like a lot and and the other point which i kind of alluded to there as well as on on this
topic of gender disparities i guess is it like just discrediting success yeah do people
discredit your success do you know what not so much and i think
also because i'm a black woman people are so happy to see me do well
because they feel like it's rare and so i think i'm afforded a bit more luxury to be a bit more like
aggressive about you know i'm pushing i'm moving hard whether you like it or not that's the
nigerian in me coming out and culturally i think um i'm allowed to celebrate that a lot more because
brits i don't think like to celebrate people doing too well or being too much um so i can get away with
it a little bit more um but i know like there is a little it can be tension when
i talk about my numbers too much and i'll definitely get the messages of this is not what you should be talking about you
shouldn't talk about how much you earn it's a bit rude imagine a guy doing it though oh
go one what show us the lamborghini again do you know what i mean it's like that's all guys do yeah that's how they build their status
is like i mean just that's what that's how it works have you put your lamborghini on no no i
don't have a lamborghini but no but i can openly talk about how much money i've i've
generated in my companies and no one's ever going to say oh that's so just tasteful they clap and but when women do it they people do
go oh god she's not that's not good taste is it yeah and that again is a huge like ben francis he talks about he's built a one
point something billion dollar company everyone's like amazing yeah you know they can show men can show the nice things the cars the houses whatever and
it's all but the minute grace beverly does a house tour you can't do it yeah
i have a video called like how i made a million on youtube right and um
it's firstly it's got like over almost a million views on it and um but the comments were so kind of
crazy people are like i can't believe you're sharing this we're really excited but um also
like um you should be putting this out there and what i actually did is there's no way i could actually share my actual
numbers because i think people would judge me negatively and like fall over be like what the hell
how is it possible and like almost want to stop the bag if that makes any sense like they don't
people don't like to see women doing two big numbers you gotta still be humble as a woman
how do you respond to that though how do you how does that impact the choices you make and does it impact the choices you make isn't that sad
though that yeah it really does so i've moved away from like putting out
my numbers i'm not gonna use using my numbers as a strategy or showing my things too much as a strategy
i also bought a couple of properties and you know i really want to share with people about financial
empowerment and properties and making money but like i can see that almost like a
a sour taste sometimes in people's mouths so i show a bit less of it i i'm not going to show you the new house that
i bought or or something else i'm not going to show it as much and i've tried to make more relatable
content and a lot of us have to be relatable and remain humble to still be considered um
a good influencer just don't show what you have
are you happy with that though are you happy to go along with that and to to do what um because when we spoke earlier about
what your goal is it's to make stuff that like really matters to you and that sounds like it's driven by like my terms you know what i care about in
my way and not allowing the audience to dictate what you create that sounded like your north star
and this being a good influence but it doesn't sound like it's gonna make you very happy yeah i think it's all about being
strategic though right so like if um
eventually showing lots of glamorous stuff is gonna impact growth it would be silly
for me to keep doing it right and again that's not my personal strategy anyway i'll be honest with you
i don't want to be like look at my new lamborghini look at my new house that's not who i am as a
person is a bit cringe for me and it's not part of my strategy but um i do want to remain authentic but i
understand that showing too much of my success um doesn't always sit well for people
and i'm happy to like remove that aspect if that makes people more comfortable
and i think that's because i'm a woman like i want people to feel comfortable um and you know you're you start this
Finances - your new project
platform called the break yeah that was it when i say when i say that there's a big smile on your face
yeah that's like my like my passion project turned like great potential business
opportunity and i think for me that's like where i decided to start talking about these things and
we're just we're talking about this now that people don't talk about money women don't talk about money
on that platform i am unapologetic and that's what i shared about the making a million in a year or making a
million over a lifetime and showing how i budget my salary and showing you how i bought a house in 10
minutes i put that all on there because i feel like you know over there is where i'm going
to talk about this stuff so if you like it is there if you don't like it let's go put on makeup on my other channel
and um it's been just insane to see how it's grown and how much there's a huge demand for
this type of content within this demographic it was what was missing when you started
out from what you said earlier exactly and that's why i created it because you were buying all those bags
and being a bit reckless and no one told you so you exactly and the tax man came knocking at my door and i got
fined and i was like nobody needs to do this this is how you incorporate this is how you
get your pension sorted out this is how you can buy a property for your business and i was just literally doing all the
stuff that i kind of learned from my accountant and from the financial mistakes that i've made i really wanted to just say
here you go here's this information use this make it be valuable to you to help you on your
journey do you know in black culture we um growing up you know i was watching 50 cent and
all this stuff and he is a bad financial advisor because am i can you get some advice
from 50 cent though [ __ ] every black young black man and what he told me about bottles and
lamborghinis and stuff it really hurt me when i was 21 and i finally got money and i went to the club and i was getting five bottles of don
perry on please and i blew a lot of cash and i just wish those those role models like the rappers that i followed when i was younger
i wish they told me about credit scores you know what i mean i wish but that's not it's not sexy right it's
not glamorous it's not fun like i have a video on pensions like
40401ks and whether or not you should be making a contribution to your sip right
that is not oh this is glamorous no one wants to hear that but there are going to be a few who do
take it and use it i wish we could dress up like credit scores like give it lipstick give it a lamborghini
um but we haven't mastered that yet maybe i'll do that later but they don't want people to know the
truth i don't think anybody wants people to really know the truth about finances right it's not beneficial it's not
beneficial to government it's not beneficial to corporations it's not beneficial to banks and lenders
who actually want people to be inept in this area so they can make financial
mistakes and then give them more money so like that's the reality of it like rich people aren't actually struggling
financially it's actually everyone else on the maybe lower end of the spectrum
who don't have this information but this information will transform their lives i guess
that's why they call it financial freedom there we go yeah and you said this started as a passion project and now it's turned into a potential business
opportunity exactly talk to me about that and where is it going ah this is this is a lot so where's it going so we really want to
build out like a web platform which has content but also tools that people can use so one of the
things that i created was a simple budgeting like template and like literally in like
two weeks we had like 20 000 people download an excel spreadsheet on how to manage their day-to-day income
so clearly there's more that we can do here we then launch a planner as well that
just sold out in like a day or two and then we're launching more of these so for in the long run i'd like to provide
more financial tools and resources that people could use to help them with managing their everyday
finances the dream is like an app but that takes time to like happen but like we've got the
designs and we're doing some testing now to really see how we can like build that out further
of all the work you're doing across all of these different projects and i'm sure there's many many more that we won't even talk about today
is this the thing you're most excited about and it's like choosing your choosing your favorite child but
i would say it's something i'm really excited about because it's so valuable so i'm very excited
about it and i think it's a new challenge so as an influencer like i work for brands
i make amazing content for them i get nice things but now this is my chance to kind of be a brand
and create value more so so it's really like a new challenge for me that i'm excited to
kind of get into and you when you're saying we you know we've made an excel document who is we
so actually excel document i made but i do have like my husband who's been really supportive and
like helping me build that out and then i've like recruited a ceo to like help me
think about scaling this out but um i've had other team members here and there freelancers here and there but i know
inevitably that scaling is something i'm gonna have to be willing to do and that's hard
for myself to do yeah your husband my husband michael michael
Whats it like working with your husband?
can i call him mike you can call him mike i can i can see him over there in the corner of the room follow me around
what's it like working with mike so oh that's a really good question so
working with mike you know what michael's been like with me for every step of my journey as a
creator and he's always worked a full-time job and then he inevitably went even to more of a
freelance role so that i could use him when i needed him so he will work as a contractor and
i'm like mike i need your help quit your job come and help me and so throughout my entire journey he's been
there to do that however working with your significant other can be real difficult um and there are
times when we're like let's not do this go back to your job make something happen go back contracting
and then when we're like oh we're cool come back again so it's what's important for us is
actually to establish how we communicate with each other and boundaries like when we're working
together we actually don't work in the same environment so he'll work in an office and i'll work
somewhere else because if you work in the same room at the same time it's not pretty we're gonna send a
microphone over to mike in the audience it's not pretty yeah because i think
when you're in like boss mode like you can be quite direct like i'm very like this doesn't look
good i don't like this can we change this how how do we do this better this is wrong right
and i think there are when it's with your partner they're going to take that personally
over say someone else who is you know just working with you and i haven't developed my managerial skills
to be great when it comes to you know my interpersonal skills just yet
so and i think when you're working with a loved one as well you you feel like you want to be more
direct like they should know just you should know this come on like but he doesn't always know and he can't read
my mind and he's a man so there's there's differences there um so that's when it gets a bit difficult when
we're together and how do you how do you balance like leaving work at work and not bringing that home with you
because one thing i came to learn was that the steve bartlett that succeeds in a professional environment that is direct
that is it's very clear and uncompromising it's not the same steve bartlett that is required to
compromise and oh you want to go for a walk in the park for no reason
how do you be two different people in order to achieve two completely different objectives and how do you do that also when you're
you live and work in the house right the same house because that's something that we deal with i think it's
again about setting these boundaries like physically so michael won't really work in a house
even if he's working on my projects and i'll try and work from an office as well as much as possible
um and then it's the case of like switching off it's hard man it's really
hard i think as a creator as a social media creator like you're always on i haven't mastered that yet but we have
kids so the good thing about kids is that they force us to
like give them love and give them attention so we have to switch off and sort the kids out and give them a bath
and give them dinner so we'll always kind of i don't know switch brains because of that oh there's a really good
point i never actually thought about the fact that kids would actually force some kind of balance into your life they do which is
you know yes amazing and you guys have been together a long time a long time yeah we've been together for
14 14 years yeah and married for like nine years i think yeah nine years yeah
i always i always think because because um because of my own experiences of being pretty useless at relationships
um entrepreneurs and especially i mean creators that's a different bag because you say you're always on they're quite
difficult to date yes yeah yeah and i think as well
and i'm probably gonna get in [ __ ] there's a troll famous but i don't really care i'm gonna die anyway um i think from entrepreneurs from other
cultures who have come up from another background and another another mother can be even more tricky to date yes you spoke to your
mother you used the word yeah we'll say passionate yeah yeah yeah yeah
does that really really yeah so obviously michael's like a englishman from from manchester right
and like we are very culturally very different and i think but it's so
interesting i think if i wasn't with michael i'd be very single and very lonely like i've accepted that i don't know if
anybody else would like actually handle me if that makes any sense i think it takes
a certain kind of person to be with an entrepreneurial person let alone an entrepreneurial nigerian woman
like that's like so many different layers there and yeah yeah he's like a magician to be
able to handle that and we're like polar opposite people i'm very like emotional and like let's do this
now and he's very logical steady stable and i think that actually is the balance that i've needed
like and i think we're meant to be together to like i don't know ying and yang it's great
you said he followed you here today but i heard you actually had a cyber stalker oh yeah it's not yeah it's not mike it
Your stalker
wasn't like i found it it was actually his account disturbing me yeah no i did i had a stalker for like three years
um and it was someone who would like just message me on all my platforms
constantly send emails message family members really weird
and nowadays i can't even remember like what their what their issue was i don't think they
even had one they were just obsessive me and obsessive like my relationship
to an extent because i used to put vlogs out and i used to have like content with me and my husband and i
stopped like actually it sounds so bad but i think it was enough to tell me i'm not going
to put myself out there in that way why
i i think it takes an emotional toll having a stalker because you're
worried like when you log in am i going to see their messages what are they going to do today what are they going to say today
are they going to dox me so they found out my parents name and address and say your mom's this name and she
lives here so like those things and obviously it was like psychological warfare um but it was yeah it was more
psychological but like when i was thinking about it i kept thinking it's because i put myself
out there too much this is why they're targeting me and i think inevitably it made me want to
retreat in certain aspects do you still think that was the case no i think that was one of my triggers
but i think inevitably i was like putting yourself out there too much from a personal perspective um
wasn't something i wanted to do like i used to show like i showed our wedding i showed me
giving birth i've shown i put a lot out there okay link in the bio looking via my best story
um and like the platforms love it when you put yourself out there a lot but inevitably it does take a toll on
you as a person and i i just said we're going to stop this i don't want to be that person
i actually care more about my real life than putting a version of my real life online i tend
to think when you're reaching that many people just probabilistically just by numbers you're gonna reach
at least 10 artists yeah okay just like do you know what i mean regardless it just happens yeah
yeah and you're blocking this person i'm guessing every time they pop up and then they're making a new account they're making hundreds of accounts
they're messaging other people so what would happen is that when i would message someone online they would like be in in the thread or
they'll be watching everything i was doing so i'd have to tell people i'm really sorry i've got a stalker
like if you got that message it's from it's from a stalker that like message brand sometimes it was
just really weird behavior and at some point it stopped it vanished or yeah it reduced it reduced i'd say and then it
inevitably like disappeared i kind of forgot about it to be honest after a while but i learned how to like listen to
their speech pattern so even if they would create new profiles i always knew it was them
based on the things that they would say and how they would say it so they'll try to hide that it was them but it's like it's clearly you
like and there's even like online forums where people like moan about online creators and she
would like she or he would go into the forums and be like talking about me so i would
stalk my stalker right so i knew it was them and then other people in the forum would be like your patricia stalker that they would
know it was the stalker so yeah anyway wow what a ride
that made you feel unsafe at any point there was nothing where it was like we know your home address we're gonna i'm
gonna come there there was some of that oh really so there was some of so i did a meet and greet an event
and then they messaged me he's like haha i was at your meet and greet you didn't even know who i was you
didn't see me you look so terrible in person next time i'm gonna do something right
so i remember feeling so anxious and i would i vlogged it and i remember like looking through the
footage and i was like who could it be who could it be it's like racking my brain it's like which one is it which one is it
and i think it made me a bit paranoid like sure a season but i was never scared because i'm from
south london i'm not scared come to my house
we'll see
quick one i talk about fiverr.com a lot on this podcast but i think the perfect sort of illustration of the power of
fiverr was actually illustrated a few weeks ago when jack who is the director and producer of this podcast was away
and so we had to find someone to step in to um edit the episode with dr alex
and so we turned to fiverr and that whole episode which you would have seen on youtube was edited by a young guy who we found on fiverr
and for me that's the perfect illustration of the diversity the cost effectiveness but also the sort
of bandwidth that you can achieve on short notice by using fiverr.com and if you haven't used fiverr there's such
a diverse array of services on the website delivered by freelancers everything from graphic design to building websites to getting subtitles
done to podcasts anything check it out go to fiverr.com that's with two hours
slash ceo so what's what's next for you then in your in your life as you look forward you know i'm not talking about goals i'm
Whats next for you?
just saying the sort of macro the overall feeling you want from your life and where you want to be
i think it's being open to more challenges that are different to what i'm used to i have been making
content and creating by myself for myself four brands for so long for like 10 years
and i i although i think i'm a brave person i feel like i've got very comfortable
so i want to set myself out on challenges that are completely outside of my
comfort zone maybe do something that
you know is unexpected for me unexpected for me as a creator influencers don't do this or influences
of your size don't do this or this kind of thing and i really want to work on like creating more products and
really building out a brand and not necessarily being the face of everything why we're not the
face of everything so i actually realized though i'm in the public eye
to an extent like i don't really like being famous i don't really want to be a personality i don't want things to be about me
and i don't know why i put myself out there if i didn't want that but i think fundamentally i'm happy to
slink into the background yeah i think there are other people who
want it more like i don't enjoy being
famous as in not that i don't enjoy but i think there are people who like really want to be famous
right and there are people who just want to do what they do and do it well and like not just have
their own normal friends do that their own normal things and get on with life like i get on the train
every day and i i go on the underground and some people like you get on the underground i'm like yes it's quicker
but i don't want to ever be in a place where i can't get on the underground people are stopping you saying hi patricia i can have yeah pitch and
you're like no kovid no i always say no i was like i'm always friendly i
guess you can use that fame for things that you do care about there right like i like that you're right you know what i
mean it's like double double-edged sword it costs something but it gives creates an opportunity for something in a way oh yeah wow you just
you just yeah you just told me off there in a good way
yeah that's kind of what i can the battle i'm having at the moment because obviously just on dragon's den yeah exactly and
that's going to be all over the tv and stuff and people are going to start coming up to me and pitching me their business ideas in the street which i don't want to [ __ ] yeah well i have an idea for you no but you
know what i mean like you're going to get because i went out with peter jones for like dinner yeah yeah and he goes i'm just going to pop to the
toilet yeah and like he takes three steps and a guy stops him hi peter
i know i knew you were here pitches him the idea the percentage asks and i'm just looking at people thinking
that's going to be my [ __ ] life but what so what's the upside what's the
why am i doing this why have i created why have i put myself out there and i think okay all the other upsides are that it's going to allow me to
build things that are more in line with the things i care about it gives you a platform an audience well you know yeah no you're right you're right and i
and i'm battling with the fact that there's clearly a reason why i'm i'm here or why i've got this audience
and why i people connect with me right and actually maybe it's a good thing that i have no huge desires to be famous
um so i'm gonna have to work out how to deal with that attention in a way um better
and not just think about slinking into the background because that's how you feel slinking into the background i wanna i
wanna be low-key like i want to make my videos and it sounds crazy and no one really watched
them well i like i like the idea of when things are small because i've been very viral like so i
was really bad i was getting like 8 million views a video 13 million views a video and at the time
i was like oh this is quite this is a lot for me to like handle because people are like messaging me all the time like patricia
and i'd be like hey guys hey um so it's not that i want to slink into the background
i think i just need to be more comfortable with recognizing that you know i'm here i'm doing it
um but still keep that normality that's really important for me
The underlying principles that made you successful
and what have you learned over the in terms as it relates to if you because i'm thinking now about you've got an entrepreneur over there in the corner
sophia and she's she's starting a meal prep business she's also working in the city in finance okay so it's very coincidental that
she's she happens to be here today if you were speaking to someone like sophia and you were just giving her a bit of advice on
how to um become as successful in what you do as you have
been what are those underlying principles where you say that really is the thing there's no quick
route but that thing there is the thing so i think the first thing is leaning
into your like authentic tone like what is the thing that makes you
or your brand yours and not running away from that and not trying to be something else it's like learning to not
be scared of yourself this is what we are this is who i am this is it right and then consistently
putting that out all the time so that people connect with that they either connect or they
don't but you only want those who are going to connect with that true version of yourself or your brand
and then it's of course you know you're going to jump on trends or or things that are
vital so you can get traction that's what i did i would jump onto viral trends
but do it in my own tone of voice um and you know it's the consistency
continue i've never done this before but i want to ask mike a question if i can you can answer one quick question he's famous mike i saw you on her instagram
actually with the with the baby father today um i wanted to ask you from your perspective why do you think patricia
has been so successful in what she's done well i reckon for a number of reasons partly i think it's her personality
personally because she does that knowledge so patricia christian doesn't acknowledge a lot of good things about
herself she's definitely 100 her biggest critic she brings a lot of energy and passion and
enthusiasm and stuff so when you watch her you feel good or you feel happy or you feel interested or
inspired but something that she doesn't really acknowledge but i think that's a part of it i do think there's certain fundamental
like i suppose numerical things like consistency and sticking with it over time and you
know all those types of factses that you can look at from a numbers perspective that help so definitely doing that and staying
with it and doing you know your three uploads a week and your regular posts and all those sort of things that help
but there's a lot of people that do that and don't have the same level of success right so that's why you have to look at what's
the differentiating factors so i think there's that i think there's an element of um her kind of openness and honesty and
her also because of i think partly because she's done it a long time she's very natural and authentic
so you don't feel like you're watching someone who's performing you feel like you're watching someone who is
genuinely you know giving who they are to you and that's rare right so i asked mike
there what you know what his he thought the cause of factors behind your success where he pointed at personality
you being vulnerable and you being authentic and um yeah i mean that's
that's kind of rare online with the world we live in with perfection filters and don't share the bad [ __ ]
yeah and i think i'm lucky in that i came up in an age of making content where it was so
authentic there was no business behind it and it was about connection
so i had that training that was my training gown for being a creator just just do what you do don't don't
think about it just do what you like so i i feel lucky that i've got that as like my
basis as creating um and being an influencer well i i can certainly feel that and i
think it comes through in everything you do especially the stuff you're doing on the break i've never watched videos about finance that seemed to be
so entertaining and real and weren't trying to be like snotty financial like long word business
[ __ ] advice yeah so it made it super like inclusive and um real and obviously that's what's absent
in that space exactly is inclusion that's why we both probably bought bags we shouldn't have bought
don't play on that i definitely should have bought absolutely so thank you so much patricia for your time today you're such an inspiration to so many and
much you know much of the reason for that in my view is because you're such a real person thank you and um and you're willing to
share that realness with everybody um what you've done is remarkable and i'm sure this is just the beginning for you
you look about 23 as well i was like you literally look 23 but that's that's part of the upside of the ethnic
background um thank you so much for your time it's such an honor thank you for having me it was great to come on and have a chat thank you
[Music]
um [Music]
you

Transcription:

Intro
reggie yates he's a critically acclaimed filmmaker a writer a director and an entrepreneur the first time i saw a
machine gun was in my estate at like nine years old when the police were raiding a flat on my
floor because there was all kinds of craziness there when you're just playing on the balcony as a teenager presenting kids tv with
air force ones and the mecca tracks it says something i'm on the bbc and i'm dressed like the boys that you cross the
street from subsequently you know i've had kids come up to me bro i loved watching you because we dressed the same we talked
the same and you were doing that and when people say things like that to strangers it's so powerful
for me empowering others is a huge part of my drive right now working with young talented people and i
love that i have that relationship with people because i never had it growing up there was always a distance between me and the person that was helping guide me
shortening that distance for me in the lives of others is what success feels like
[Music] reggie yates he's a critically acclaimed
filmmaker a writer a director and an entrepreneur and over the last three decades
he's been on our screens and through that time the world has changed the platforms have
changed and he has certainly changed he's been involved in scandals
wild success and unfortunate failure reggie's work as a filmmaker is extraordinarily diverse
and he's traveled across the world meeting those that have oppressed and those that have been oppressed and this conversation is the same
incredibly diverse we'll touch on everything from love relationships struggles family mental health ambition council
culture and everything in between thank you reggie thank you for your honesty because i
know the people that are about to listen to this podcast are going to take a tremendous amount of important value
from it so without further ado i'm stephen bartlett and this is the dire of a ceo i hope nobody's listening but if you are
then please keep this to yourself
reggie um location environment family where do you come
Where do you come from?
from um i am the child of african immigrants both my parents were born in ghana and
came to london as children i was born on tottenham court road so i'm london london london
and i was raised in holloway i moved to south east london when i was 14 and 18 i moved out and i've been a londoner
ever since and i say that because i've lived all over you know london's quite a tribal city uh between football
and the club you support and the area that you're from and your connection to it i've lived all over and i call south london home
now even though i didn't start there and i didn't school there really um but i love it there and it's nice to
return to the place that i spent a chunk of my teens so two parents from an african uh from
ghana great ghana they came here when they were my mother 11 i think my dad was maybe 15 or 16.
so tell me all about that and that experience because i know that in terms of like education and perspective on the
world and all those things from my own mom's experience she she couldn't read or write right so we had a ton of wars growing up because i
dropped out of university after one lecture so we didn't speak for three years i know that african parents have a certain perspective and i know
especially from reading about how you've handled things like fame press drugs alcohol and the avoidance of
all of those things i know i feel like much of that must have come from those kind of values yeah um i'd say it's a combination of
things it's a combination of the mentors that i chose uh the environment that i was in at home
and that massively comes down to culture you know and that's why i was really interested in your connection to nigeria because
culturally for me um where my parents are from has informed massively
in a lot of ways my outlook and culturally obviously you know when you've got west african parents who
were born there you're raised in an environment where education is everything because
as far as they're aware that is the only way to unlock uh another life for yourself my
grandparents came to this country in search of a better life for not just themselves but their children and ultimately us their grandchildren
and it worked you know my mom got an education i got an education to a point and
weirdly my social education and my extracurricular activities have given me a career
so um more than anything i think it's the values of an african house that have given me
what i believe to be a healthy life and i mean in every sense of the word
people talk to me a lot about being grounded and understanding what being humble is and i think when you've come from
nothing but at the same time you enjoy everything it changes your
perspective on what success looks like and that was the house that i was raised in we celebrated
every day because we essentially were striving to be happy
and happiness didn't come from material goods it came from success and achievement uh on a level
that made everybody in the house proud as opposed to what was going on outside the family home because culture was everything and do
you feel that do you still feel that and did you ever fully believe that happiness would come from success and
achievement do you still do you still deeply believe that for me happiness uh comes from being fulfilled i think um
in my at my most happiest and my most calm i feel like i'm able to love and i feel
loved i feel as though i am professionally and personally fulfilled um i feel as though i'm creatively
fulfilled they're the moments when i feel my most happy and they're the things that i'm chasing if ever i was chasing anything
and what was that what was the kind of difference in between your mom and your dad my mom was nigerian yeah i didn't i don't really
have to say which my mom was nigerian right my dad was the antithesis of that my dad was a what is a um older
white male very passive very very calm usually doesn't speak wow and my mom was she can shout for
seven hours at a tone you've never heard in your life without like taking a breath
amazing so was there a huge difference between the the sort of values or the approach of your mum and your dad that had a sort of
a significant well my dad's a musician was is and continues to be um but he
wasn't in my life my parents divorced when i was quite young and then my mother remarried a another garnier man who was also from
a similar background um and in terms of who they are slash were as people it's very different
um i think i get a lot of what makes me me for my mum my mom was incredibly social she loved music i've spoken about this
before she used to always cook with this sony ghetto blaster above the cooker and you know
it's west africa dean so you're using a lot of palm oil so there was like the the ghetto blast it's so like clear
in my mind it's just covered with red oil and like there was there was no cover on the tape bit so
you used to have to push a tape in and there was like marks on it as to where her favorite radio stations were so
i was raised on a diet of pirate radio and pop um and that was my mum it's just a
vivacious big social animal like i remember her 30th birthday because you know she had us quite young and her
just with a [ __ ] out the window like having a little dance or whatever and like turning up her favorite records and
my stepfather is not that you know he's not particularly social and he's quite different and his dad was in the military so he was i
imagine not that dissimilar to your mother it sounds like so um there were two very different
types of parenting in my house and as i say my biological dad wasn't present and ironically we're
probably really similar given our you know our expression through creativity
have you ever reconnected with him yeah um yeah so i did who do you think you are yeah
the bbc one show yeah and it's really interesting because they they started carving up episodes of the
show and putting them on youtube and they chunked my episode into four parts and uh on my father's side of the family
my biological father they've been mixing for generations you know like three of my grandmothers are mariah
carey black you know like they're super super fair because there's been generations of people that are of mixed origin and with ghana um
previously being part of the british empire and being part of the commonwealth and ghana finding independence in 1957
there was a huge uh english contingent particularly uh in around places like cape coast um
when it came to trading when it came to gold etc um and that's part of my family legacy
massively so you know my mum was bitterly disappointed after they did the research and realized that
her family background which was just one village versus my dad's side which was lots of
different people from different places in europe coming to africa and mixing so on and so forth so
when we made that show i realized that they wanted to start the show with a conversation between he
and i talking about the family and i hadn't seen him or spoken to him in over a decade so we met up just
before we recorded and it was it was weird because i hadn't seen him in so long and then when we did record it's interesting like the film
starts with the sequence with he and i sort of chatting and he's playing thumb piano but the last time we saw each other with
each other was the day before but prior to that i was a lot younger so yeah i was a teenager the last time
i'd seen him so is it i don't know i i don't really have any bitterness towards the man because i understand him a lot better now as i've
grown and as your friends become fathers you sort of start to identify
just how many people are actually naturally equipped with fatherhood and not everyone is and unfortunately my
father just didn't seem to be one of those guys one of the things i i got to be honest i worry about with
my own experience with my parents is that there are slightly toxic traits that they have and
i think this is the case with all humans but you know my parents are humans too yeah um that i'm i'm concerned i will
pass on like with through generational cycles and i think the less aware i am of those things the
more they stand a chance of like showing up at some point and running the show when it matters the most yeah do you have those fears have you
ever had that you know they had those fears i don't have them anymore okay and the reason i don't have them anymore is because i recognize that you
know i define my my present and my future my past i have no control over but um who i am today and
who i will become is down to me um and that also uh is massively dependent on my
understanding of my childhood trauma of the things that um
if unchecked could define me so i've always been desperate to define
myself even when i didn't realize that i was doing it so you know uh growing up in a council estate up the
road from here in holloway and having friends who have exactly the same setup at home you know
before my mother met my stepfather we were a single-parent household on benefits my mom did whatever she could to you
know feed the family and move us forward that was the same for the other boys on the estate so if i was hanging out with corey or tyrone or whoever
their house felt like mine and i was determined to not be defined by the things that we were being taught to
normalize you know and as a result i just have decided that that's not the life
that i'm gonna have and my children won't god will and i have you are when you
look at your career you are a tremendous outlier in terms of the journey you've you've you've taken and what you're
doing now that's very kind thing and then you trace it back and go you came from a councillor state not too far from
here for you to have gone on that journey and achieved the things you have i always i always think there must have
been certain factors in those early years that made you take a different course to those friends
that might still be on the estate now yeah it might have been you know we talked a little bit about values there it might have been you know
i don't know something someone said to you an experience you had or just the conditioning whatever it is but my question is do you
What factors made you break out of your environment
and do you know what those factors were that made you an outlier i mean you sound as though
you've done a lot of work on yourself and in the little bit that i know about you i get to meet people and ask so i
learned so much from these kinds of answers right and i've made documentaries for over 10 years so it's the same thing you know
you learn so much from your environment if you're willing to drink in the information yeah and i just in thinking about between therapy
and also being um present in moments like this you know yes there are cameras but i'm
having a conversation with you and i'm learning from you and that certainly was the case in 10 years of making films you know for
the bbc um so when it sort of comes to me looking at
how i've become the person that i am and how my journey has played out the way that it has done it's an amalgamation of
different moments and instances but fundamentally it comes down to
a desire even as a kid to understand and be aware and it's progressed into
this idea of being present and understanding the moment that you're in and why you're there and and taking as much from the moment as
possible so as a child i would always ask questions and i was far too
aware of my environment for my own good so for instance i'll i'll never sort of forget going to my
friend kieran's oh no yeah it was kieran buckley's house i went to kieran buckley's house in barnsbury and um
my mom was very protected so she wouldn't let me play at friends homes i know you know how that goes and i went
to kieran's and i was in the garden and he had this massive massive beautiful islington
garden with several trees in it and i asked him how come you've got a
park at the back of your house um and his mother sort of overheard and laughed a bit and it stayed with me
and he's like that's not parks my god are you talking about come on freeing it in you're in goal mate and you play this game you don't think about it and then i
remember going back to my cancer state and looking at the the one tree that me and corey used to climb and think
i don't have what he has why is that and then you start to think about these things and then start to understand
class and where you are and even so far as the area you know i started to really recognize the power of
my walk to school even as a kid before i got to secondary school i was like this is really weird like i live in
a borough islington in north london that has everything from council states with immigrants and white
working class right the way through to multi-million pound houses and i lived on a row called liverpool road which is
such a it's such an important road that i haven't only i've only become
aware of how important that road is to my journey in recent years so i lived at the holloway end of liverpool road and
liverpool is a long road that runs through islington and at the other end is angel an angel gentrified years before
holloway did hallway is a very different place now and they had a waitrose they had a sainsburys and you had these gorgeous
massive townhouses and you know if you deviated off liverpool road you'd be in barnsbury and there were these beautiful little villagey
roads and holloway was where the people that i grew up around lived and you had these estates you had every
kind of madness you could imagine happening on my estate like i remember my first the first time i saw a machine gun was
in my estate at like nine years old when the police were raiding a flat on my floor because there was all kinds of craziness
there when you're just playing on the balcony on your estate on on the floor that you live on you got on police there
you know let alone the other times that you see other weapons or you see other things happen um and those walks that i would go on
where i would be like wow the bit that i live in versus the bit that i'm walking through versus the bit that i'm going to to go to school
i know what bit i want to live on so i better start thinking about how i'm going to get to that bit of the road it's so fascinating you'd
say that and it took me in my head back to back to my own experiences being a kid and this really vivid memory i have one
day of looking up at the sky and seeing a plane and then looking down at my street and
thinking i wonder if all of these fam this is what they wanted from their life and then the plane for me was the juxtaposition between a family going on
holiday i'd never been on like other than coming from africa we'd never been on holiday yeah so i was thinking oh my god people are
going on holiday and then i look down at my street and i look up again and i see this plane and a lot of people will have that but
it takes a different mind to then think i want to be on the plane i want to be at the other end of
liverpool street um but then also i have some idea about how to get there
or maybe you didn't have some an idea about how to get there but maybe just the i mean if you believe in that manifestation just that i want to be
there so i'm going to make decisions over the next 10 years in that direction right well my journey's super weird right
because from the age of eight i was a working actor so i was constantly reminded about my
difference just by being present and by being aware even as a child so it didn't take much for me to realize
you're not like your friends reg because you're currently working while they're at school and
you've been allowed time off school to work so straight away you're like okay i'm a bit different and this is a bit of a weird situation
to be in and then you look around and there's a hundred people on set and you're the only black person both in front of all behind the camera
and you go okay wow um i'm not like any of these people here and the conversations that you hear
about what people did on the weekend or where they're going that even or even conversations about wine like little
things that people take for granted culturally anybody drinking wine in my house you know what i mean
like shallow was a big deal you know um going to sainsbury's was a big deal like
we used to walk to dalston with backpacks to go and buy meat and tin tomatoes and carry them back because we never had a car what does that do to you
though when you're on set everyone else is a different skin color and they're talking about things that you're not familiar with in terms of like let's be
honest like class right absolutely what does that do to you and does it put a chip on your shoulder does it
make you i'm more ambitious does it make you think [ __ ] i'm i'm out of place i'm an imposter yeah well it could have put a chip on my
shoulder and i'm incredibly thankful that it didn't what it did do was make me so hungry
to create an environment where i could feel comfortable and what that progressed into was
understanding that it's going to take me a while to get to the point that i'd like to be at therefore it would be and become my responsibility
to create that for someone else to create that for another eight-year-old me or 15 year old me and i feel incredibly proud that i'm
able to do that now because i recognize the power of it and regardless of those moments of feeling out of place or
being sort of feeling as though you know your class is being is being waved in your face like i told
this story the other day to a friend of mine who's i'm a godfather to his child he's one of my good good good friends
uh sam wilkinson he's a director who i made a lot of my documentaries with and um he's got my gorgeous little
god son in his hands little teddy and we're chatting away and i was telling him a story about uh being at this primary school in
island where you've got kids from estates and kids from quite you know affluent homes all in the same school and at lunch time you had
these kids with thundercats lunch boxes and these incredible sandwiches and kitkat minis all the things that i never had in my house you know
you're sort of looking at tinfoil that hasn't been used 50 times and you're like oh my god they're throwing the tinfoil in the bin what the hell
what the hell is going on without being made to fold and put it back because you could use it for dinner tomorrow anyway so you're like taking all of that
in and every lunch time i'll never forget um pat god bless her
uh the head dinner lady this big lady big lady would walk out and she'd go free school
dinners and all the kids that were on free school dinners used to have to stand up and go and get your food and it sort of
broke you a little bit as a kid because your mates were just a bit like oh my god can you imagine and i told this story to
sam and he started crying and sam started crying i think not because
well i think he felt a little sad for little mini me but he also as a father imagined his son in that
position and i'm sure we'll get on to family and fatherhood and stuff but i you know i realize how much fatherhood
has softened a lot of my friends and also has made me very sort of cognizant of my journey
and also just how important my childhood was in shaping who i've become and when you were there when you were in
What were your dreams for the future?
school when you were eight years old and working and acting what were your dreams for the future and how big were they could could you
what was that internal monologue saying that the end of reggie's story would look like i don't
know what it looks like now yeah and then i never had any sort of desire to create it or paint it
i just knew that it was fun and i enjoyed it and i didn't quite understand why i was getting paid to do it really i
just didn't get it because it was like you mean i get off school and i get to play make believe with people that i've
seen on telly and you're going to pay me for that right i remember my mom opening a bank
account for me because i did a job and this money started coming in and you
know suddenly you've got tens of thousands of pounds in your account you're not even in secondary school yet and it's like well hang on this is this
is crazy because mum's desperately trying to save to put this on the table or to make that happen
and i'm getting to do something that's fun and it's paying me really well and i get to do it with stephen fry and hugh laurie like what
that there though for me speaks to a really critically important part of like
success which is at a very very young age you got to see behind a curtain and the curtain was in my view just from
hearing what you said i can do something that i actually like and people will pay me for it and imagine most kids from that estate
all they'll ever get to see is you work in the factory or whatever you have to hate your work and you get paid [ __ ] all for it yeah
that's what did they you know well it's interesting you said it because you've actually weirdly picked up on a really interesting point because
um something happened on set in a moment of realization even as a child that
only came back into my head popped back into made a few years ago and i recognized how important it was and i actually put it in my book
and that was um work to me based on my grandparents and
my mother was something that you hated um my grandmother worked the buses
she was a cleaner she did all sorts of stuff she was a a cook for london underground at one
point i was at london bus one of the two my grandfather had two jobs at night he was a security guard at some random
factory in king's cross and during the day he was a mathematics professor at a university
you know it's an incredibly educated man but because he wanted to build a home in ghana and he wanted to look after everyone
he literally worked all the hours that god would send so whenever anyone spoke about work they hated it and then
the first job that i ever got as an actor when i was eight years old was it was desmond which for anyone that um has seen it
will know like retrospectively how important that show was for those that don't know what it is
uh desmond's uh i believe is channel 4's longest running sitcom and it's not on tv anymore it hasn't
been on for years but desmond's was about a black family in peckham who
owned a barber shop and it was a comedy about black life and
just about life and because it was so human even though it was massively flavored by this
caribbean family people loved it and it was massive and it ran for i think seven seasons right
so the first audition i go for is desmonds and i remember going to humphrey
bartlett i think it was the name of the production company in kentish town and we went up to their production office and my mum was excited
you know she was prepping me on her little cards like to get my lines down and everything and i got the job
and then i had this random moment that when i think back it's crazy for me as a
kid to have made this realization i had this realization and that was i was um i was on set surrounded by
people that looked like me and my family you know you had shirley who was the matriarch of the family who actually looked like my gran
you had norman who played desmond who was like the super funny old guy my granddad was this funny old guy that
used to make inappropriate jokes all the time and all the makeup artists were black and they would give me little boiled sweets
and everybody was just so fun to be around i was just surrounded by this blackness but in a professional setting and
everyone was at work and they were having a great time and something went off in my head and i
was like wait hang on a second maybe what i've seen in my family and their relationship with work
doesn't apply to everyone because these people look like my family and they're having a great time
so what would it be like if i did that for me and that's exactly it and i a lot of
people don't realize that and that's why i referred to it as you got to look behind the curtain right and once you see it
you can't unsee it once you make that connection that you can love your work and it can be in line with your passions
i mean right now the stuff you're doing in your career is seems to be perfectly in line with your interests you know and i've heard about
you know one point you were doing work in music and you're interviewing pop stars and you're asking them questions you didn't want to ask them
and you've it feels like you've really got closer and closer and closer and closer to doing work that's intrinsically
fulfilling as the years have gone on a lot of people don't realize that reggie and they don't ever get to see behind that curtain
yeah so what would you say to those people who um have the have the dreams but they've
always believed that work is a nine-to-five thing it's a chore it's something you do to fund your passion yeah or your free time well
it's really difficult in this era because there are so many experts uh on social media or on youtube and who
are releasing books or whatever you know there's a ton of people who haven't had any life experience which is why people like you i think are so important
and i'm not blowing smoke here you know you're having incredibly important conversations off the back
of living a life and doing something and you're still so young you have earned the right to say this is
what i think and feel and i'm willing to share it and you continue to learn on camera
making documentary is a huge part of me learning on camera and learning with my audience and i'm sure that you can attest to this
there's something incredibly powerful about saying i don't know but i want to learn and when you do that and it's
documented and recorded people come along with you you know and in this moment there are so many
people that just see the end result that want to be gary vee or you know want to shout advice and be
be the tough love guy and there is merit in that and i think that you know for a lot of young men
particularly you can look at some i'll use garyvee as an example i think he's fantastic in some of the things that he does and the
way in which he delivers a message because some people need to hear it similarly on the other side um a book like the secret for instance
you know if you don't have people constantly reminding you of things like some of the messages that are in
the secret you might need to turn to a book that has them all in one place you know
and i think it's incredibly difficult for people to
to be honest with themselves about what they're capable of without willing
to do the work yeah and so many people want the end result but don't respect or understand the
value in the journey and we live in a microwave era where everything happens overnight and people come up and come down from
social media stars to reality tv stars or whatever and it just it it breaks my heart that
nobody's willing to just look back a little bit and see that everything that they're doing has happened before
and it all ends in one way um and without sort of rattling on about it or anything
i had a conversation recently where i realized how fortunate i've been to have been around for so long because i've had a career for over 30 years now
and i've seen the cycle play out over and over and over again so like being
12 years old and interviewing the spice girls and thinking oh my god this is the most amazing exciting thing ever and then seeing their peak because you
know i interview them for wannabe then you see their peak and then you see the movie and you see them on packets of walkers crips
and then you see the fallout and then you get to where you are today and you see how that has played out but that's sort
of like a a bigger arc but you could go even smaller you know in the boy band era you name them i interviewed them from
the backstreet boys to five over here to whoever i met them when they were new
and excited then i met them when they were arrogant and horrible and then you meet them when everything
isn't happening anymore and they've got that album no one wants to buy you see the cycle happen over and over again today it's reality tv starts
only the cycle isn't three albums if you're lucky it's three years if you're lucky it's three years yeah yeah
yeah sometimes it's three months they do love island twice a year now yeah you don't get to a million followers before there's a new sexy eu
on the show you know and what does that take to i guess to in some degrees to to
reinvent yourself through as the world changes as platforms change to stay relevant to you know what does that take
i have no desire to remain relevant i don't care i will just continue to follow my
passions and i i recognized uh the power of platform
when i was 18 when some random kid's mum stopped me on the street and said you're a role model for
my son and i hated there for it and then i realized i have no choice in the matter and
the minute i realized that regardless of how i feel people are going to look at me because i have a platform
i understood the power of that platform and that started a thinking process that made me
desperate to get out of entertainment and get into documentary because i felt as though with that amount of eyeballs i should
have something to say and that's why i think documentaries have naturally led on to me becoming a writer director and filmmaker
and using art to actually say something and everything that i do now speaks to my
purpose quick one so many of you who are joining the huel family and becoming a hooligan as we call it
and starting your fuel journey ask me what my favorite flavors are and i've been quite i guess contradictory in the
podcast historically because as he will introduce new products i get new favorite flavors and so here in front of
me if you're watching this online on youtube you'll see my favorite three products that i literally don't can't imagine
living without at the moment so you have the berry flavor ready to drink which was my original favorite i have that for
convenience that then was replaced by the banana flavor which is my favorite and now and so that's for
convenience day today my favorite flavor as it relates to my gym fitness regime is the salted caramel
powder super low in calories all of your vitamins and minerals and 20 grams of protein in 100 calories
which is outstanding um so these are my favorite three products if you're going to try
huel and you've got the same palette as me start here that's my advice that journey you've
The key moments of failure in your life
described over you know 30 odd years and the the cycles and the
staying you know being at a point now where you can still do what you want on a big platform
there must have been a ton of failure through that journey and people don't talk about that because that doesn't make for good instagram posts typically you know like the day you get
rejected from the audition or whatever yeah what are the some of the critical moments in your journey where you
encountered failure or rejection and you had that sort of mental conversation with yourself to figure out
what the hell this means and what we do next um i
uh have done a lot of therapy and i'm really thankful for it i started in my 20s and now in my uh my late 30s
um i understand the importance of getting to know your shadow and uh
my current therapist i've been with for a while now is an incredible human being who has given me new tools for the tool belt
i'm using the language i love this i'm using the language and um just some of the things that he's given me
have really helped me to understand me at my worst and one of the big triggers for me is
when my character is questioned and i've always struggled with the idea of people
getting me wrong or thinking that my intentions aren't pure and i had a situation um a few years ago
now where i said something publicly that offended a lot of people and my argument was no no but i didn't
mean that i didn't mean that and what i came to realize was your intentions mean nothing if you hurt
people and in sitting with the community that i offended deeply which breaks my heart
because my first ever mentor anna cher who gave me my career in in television it's from that same
community as well and i learned and have learned so much about that community and that faith
um and i felt as though i let so many people down and in having those conversations and understanding that bro it's not actually
about you it's about knowing the power of your platform
understanding that you have a responsibility when you open your mouth because you've worked so long that people listen
to you now bro and respecting the fact that regardless of what your intention is
if you hurt people you have to behave accordingly and that was a huge moment of failure for me
that i have learned so much from and that i am uh i'm proud of the lessons that came
from it and those lessons i think have set me up in such a way that i'm excited about my future because
regardless of everything i've done i feel as though i'm only really getting started now and everything that has happened feels
like practice in a way so i'm gonna ask these questions because
i i'm scared that at some point i'm on dragon's den now i i have a podcast where i speak my mind
and i'm gonna say some [ __ ] at some point i've said to my team before i'm like i know at some point i'm going to say some [ __ ] that
is going to get me in trouble something that i didn't mean or something off the cuff or whatever you want to say didn't mean again to your point it doesn't
necessarily matter but um if i meant it or not what my intentions were but can you talk to me and we're kind of
talking about like cancer culture here we're talking about you know um someone that has a platform
that's speaking their mind that's is using words in various ways um so you're talking you're you're
referencing there there were some comments made people there was an uproar within the jewish community what was
your mental journey from the second you you said
those comments to where you are now can you give me like a little bit of the journey of like
you see the uproar yeah is the initial feeling of like you don't get me that's not what i meant
absolutely yeah and then there's is there anger there is there this and then there's no anger it's just disappointment because you know better
it feels as though it's the biggest thing that's happening anywhere in the world to anyone and it really isn't but the bottom line
is that you have caused offense to people that you care about you have working
relationships with people and so on and so forth and there's a lot of vanity that kicks in
hence me saying what i said about you know you feeling that it's the biggest thing because suddenly your entire world is made up of people
who are either disappointed or uh let down or angry with you and
rightly so um and you just have to sit in it you just have
to sit in it and make those difficult phone calls and also be willing to learn and understand that you were wrong
and i think when you are at your core a good person which i believe i am when
someone tells you you're not oh it's really difficult to get your head around
but leaning into that and like i said getting to know your shadow um understanding why that's such a
trigger understanding what that is setting off for you in terms of things that may have happened in the past etc um
it's uh it's a process that you kind of have to go through that gets really really dark and difficult and then you
come out the other side saying okay i'm i'm proud of that den like i'll never forget actually and this isn't
this is a horrible clan name drop but um uh daniel kahlua said to me that um
actually off the bat like he and i had a conversation about this whole situation and he said bro um there's a reason that
golf balls have dents in them i was like what do you mean he said well you know golf balls with dents go further
and i was like yeah and kalu was so right you know um i learned so much in that situation
that it weirdly strengthened my relationships with a lot of people from that community and also my knowledge is better and my
knowledge of self is better in terms of how i manage myself in complicated moments
this idea of the shadow getting to know your shadow i find that so fascinating it's good stuff in it yeah it's really good i've had that expression before
um yeah well i wish i came up with it but i'm gonna pretend i did but it's just knowing it's knowing what
your triggers are knowing yourself at your worst and being comfortable with it you know i
i can proudly say that i can't there's very little that could happen to
me now that i don't have something in place to help me
navigate it you know i i so i've been having this conversation with one of my best friends
Getting to know your shadow
and he's i'm going to say the context because i think because you've had you've been through the therapy maybe you can offer some advice sure
he was saying to me the other day that he is so easily triggered in the moment by certain things he thinks it's because
he used to get bullied when he was younger on the playground but for example if someone was to say that he was wrong or present evidence
which proved he was wrong or his romantic partner who he's i'm currently with were to get in a little bit of a tif
with him it's kind of like this red mist and he can't control it and then ten minutes later i don't know why i don't
know why i do that yeah yeah how did how did you find out what those triggers were and you said you've got
something in place to deal with it what is what is that because he was like in the moment when i'm
sat with my girlfriend at dinner yeah and the trigger goes if i walk off that's storming off if i
go silent that's sulking so what the [ __ ] am i supposed to do yeah um well it's gonna sound ridiculous
but listening is really difficult when you
feel as though you're being challenged and nine times out of ten any conflict
that i've ever had hasn't actually been about me so to have the resolve to shut the [ __ ] up
and listen sometimes allows you to get through the things that are triggering or annoying or make you angry or
frustrating and get to the heart of what something what's actually being said and why and then when you get to that it just
becomes so much easier because most of the time it's not actually about you you know maybe something you've said or done is triggering to the person that
you really care about you sat across the table from you and if you're willing to get beyond the fact that they're saying something that
in the moment makes you angry you can actually move forward together in a way that just didn't exist before
the the thing that's jumping in and that's it's it's commanding your brain to try and win or to go for victory or self-defense
though yeah that you know that can come from the playground that can come from a comment your dad made you when you were four or
whatever so especially if you're someone who has come from nothing and has succeeded yeah you know it's you against
the world for a huge chunk of that you know earlier stage it's very easy to need to
win everything in life especially arguments but most of the time winning an argument actually ends up putting you backwards
because what you described there is i'm from what i understood is ego yes you have to build and i
genuinely believe this too especially because i was a very young entrepreneur in rooms with you know people that were not the same
skincare as me and three times my age when i was first pitching my my ideas and at some point you have to
develop a sense of like huge confidence and self-belief which
has to kind of flirt with having a big ego because i promise you like as you'll probably
know um i don't want to speak for you so i'm saying probably there people will try and [ __ ] with you
especially if you're they i mean of course because everyone's trying to win in their own little personal war especially if you're an outlier yeah if
you are the t-1000 yeah people really want to figure out how they can break you yeah and some people get off on that
yeah um and i'm sure you've experienced that i certainly have but i don't know uh in my experience
a lot of the time when i find those that that conflict where i find people trying to push buttons
it doesn't take much thought to recognize where it's coming from right and most of the time it's not about you i mean books like
uh ego is the enemy or you know uh start with why like they're really or leaders leaders eat last yeah the simon
says um that's a great one for ego um i i sort
of learned a lot from that about how to lead and also what true leadership can do
and that sort of unnatural thing of not being submissive but allowing
someone to find their answers with your guidance as opposed to you telling them is so powerful because it just makes the
bond so much stronger you said i read that you wrote that you had what part of your therapy sessions
was to really understand your issue with father figures and the
sort of tricky relationship you had with father figures yeah yeah uh there was a disappointment that i
felt even as a a young age in that i didn't have the perfect dad at
home or at least a dad that i felt that i deserved as a kid because i was a good kid i was i was working i was doing well at school
i was clinging to my sisters like i i thought i was a good kid and i felt that i deserved a different kind of
dad at home especially someone as someone who was so obsessed with tv you know i'm looking at uncle phil going why
can't i have what will and carlton have you know i want an uncle phil um
and in going to some of the houses of kids that i was going to school with and seeing how their dads fathered them it
made me um disappointed that i didn't have that at home but i've spoken about this before and this
is a book that i've been working on uh called bits of dad um and i was incredibly fortunate
um to have bits of dad um because of what my mother invested in me
so my mother taught me from quite a young age to recognize what a good man looked like which helped me pick the
right friends and ultimately pick the right mentors and people to follow so i say bits of dad because
i would look up to and ask questions of mark who worked at the play center at the after school club at my school
and he would help me with sort of dealing with some of the dynamics in my friendships at school
and then i had billy mcqueen who i call my tv dad a producer who i met when i was 12 years old at disney
who would answer any professional question that i needed help or guidance with and then there were these other men who
helped me with self-discipline or money or even football or even you know conversations
about women and relationships and amalgamated they made the perfect father but i had the bits
and the bits were enough for me so when you're going to therapy was it a
question you're opposing to your therapist about how you get a better relationship with father figures or was it a um was it about authority was it about
bro we've had so many conversations about dad i couldn't tell you what it was specifically but i think just knowing that
being a good man is such an important thing for me and my future and knowing that i didn't have quote
unquote good men at home uh has always been something that i've revisited and tried to unpack and
understand and um it's something that's in the front of my mind in a lot of ways as i said you know that so many of my friends
are now becoming fathers seeing how they parent and also seeing the decisions that they make and now becoming a godfather for
the first time you know i'm not dad i'm not a jace you're saying so i could yeah yeah yeah you know you you go
around you pick up you change nappy sometimes i haven't changed teddy's nephew just yet because he does massive um but um knowing that when that kid
gets a little bit bigger i can help sam this guy who's a mate of mine who i love dearly
and maybe the bits that he can't do with the bits that he doesn't want to do and i offer a different perspective as
well i i one of the really sort of fascinating point i've just become a godfather again congratulations time last week
so that's and i'm particularly close to the dad one of my best friends worked
for me for seven odd years so i feel and it's also the child is um so my friend is the dad
is is is black and the the mum is white so the the kid is probably going to look a little bit a little bit like me so i feel a greater
sense of responsibility it feels like my first my first real kid um there was something you said a quote where you talked about really
The force thats driving you
understanding how precious your time was and the the actual quote is no one like me has had this opportunity
so i'd be a fool not to make the most of it i really want to understand that like driving force within
within you that's that's um still driving you today and i i've sat here with so many
um successful people so many successful uh black men um i've analyzed myself and it tends to
be a bit of a cocktail sometimes your story from the council estate sheds some light on that yeah and you know liverpool wrote that really shed
some light on it as well um and the bit we talked about being underestimated and
you know feeling sometimes like the outlier in certain rooms yeah um but that thing about time and that
sense of responsibility you speak to is because you saw that word and you're right that was
almost your feeling of responsibility yeah it's really complicated and
i think the idea of responsibility comes from understanding that i was one of the first people to uh be given a platform either on prime
time or on children's tv and so on and so forth and because i've always been myself
[Music] regardless of who i was at that time and you know having been on tv for so many
years that version of me has continued to progress you know as a teenager presenting kids tv with cane row and you
know uh air force ones and the mecca tracks your academic sweatsuit knowing that i'm not just wearing this
to my dressing room i'm wearing this on camera says something it says something i'm on
the bbc and i'm dressed like the boys that you cross the street from that was like i understood even at 18 that that was a
thing that meant something and subsequently you know i've had kids come up to me
over the years saying i grew up with you on tv and bro i loved watching you because we
dressed the same we talked the same and you were doing that and it just made me feel like i existed
and when people say things like that to strangers it's so powerful and i assume that that might be the case
even as a teenager and i'm so glad that i was right because
that desire to be me whatever room i'm in has served me well and that's gone from
presenting kids tv right the way through to writing and directing now like i've just completed my first feature
film pirates uh which will be out this year and i'm a producer i'm a writer and i'm a director
in this movie about three men of color men 18 year olds right
and i employed the crew i am sat there in interview rooms
interviewing heads of department deciding who is going to ultimately set the mood
for this thing that really matters to me because as a writer director it starts with the script but as a director you're on set and
you've got 150 200 people working for you and if you don't lead in the right way
they'll decide what this environment is going to be and the big concern for me was i'm looking
at three versions of me i've got a moroccan kid a ghanaian kid and a west indian kid who were 18 who were leading their first
movie i remember being 18 desperately trying to get auditions for movies and not getting them it was a very different landscape then
so i understand the responsibility that i have today to put on for those guys for redder for
elliott for jordan it's my responsibility to put on for them and create an environment for them in a way that just wouldn't exist
if the man at the top of the tree didn't intrinsically understand them because nobody understood me coming up
that's where the responsibility comes you know so this is a tough question to answer because i would find it tough to answer but i'll answer it as
well if you want me to but what what what is the best and in your own self-assessment
The best and worst parts of your leadership style
what is the best and worst part of your leadership style um i think the it's easy to say the best
isn't it i'm great okay let's start with worst i
think the worst part of my leadership style is that i want everybody to have a good
time all the time oh okay interesting i do please explain desperately well
when you're responsible for the environment when you pick the people if it goes left or if you pick the wrong
person it's on you and it's your fault and that feels [ __ ] when you get it wrong
and it affects people that you care about that feels terrible so i desperately want everything to work
out in an environment where i'm responsible you know so i think that that's probably one of the biggest failures
that i hopefully will be better at in the next project you know to be really transparent sometimes you have to replace people midway through a
shoot and it's knowing when is the right time and also having the balls to say you don't quite get what we're trying to
do so thank you for what you've done but your your services are no longer required you know that's difficult
yeah especially if you empowered them to begin with yeah and to take it away is tough um i think the thing that i'm good at
is people management i'm good with people i'm good on a one-to-one basis as well as with
the group um and i think the thing that i'm best at is understanding my actors because i
once was one and knowing that you know they just want to do a good job
and are individuals some might require talking to before a take some might require being left alone
some might require some coaching or some confidence boosting some might require being told to rein it in
you know i with pirates i decided that i wanted to make sure
that my three central guys were a little family before we even got on set so i contacted one of my mentors um richard
curtis write director who uh wrote uh notting hill uh
love actually four wins in a funeral um he and his wife emma uh freud who are amazing amazing couple
uh i met through comic relief which is also something that they do i mean they're kind of amazing uh when i was 18
i met them through comic relief and they've been in my life ever since and when i started writing off the back of spending new year's at
one of his places i said look could i would it be possible to take one of your homes by the sea so i can go and write
there and they're like absolutely and they've given me they've opened their doors to me for me to go and write at their
one of their their homes and the desk that i i wrote a few drafts of pirates is the death that richard wrote notting hill on
so i'm rubbing my desk come on give me some of this good stuff come on um and prior to shooting
i the guys allowed me to i asked them and they were absolutely fine with the fact they actively encouraged me to bring the boys
to the house for the weekend we spent the weekend by the sea cooking together watching coming of age movies
talking about the movies uh very much about friendship and coming of age but it's also set in 1999
with a whole uk garage backdrop so the entire music in the movie is ukg and the boys are desperately
trying to drive from north london to south london and the peugeot 205 to get into twice as nice on new year's eve 1999. that's the movie
it takes place over one day right so you know we got like spoonie on the phone or we got like the heartless crew
on the phone and the boys were just sort of learning about garage and they were also forming these relationships and when we got on set
everyone was like oh so you guys have been friends for years right and i'm like no we just you know just hung out and in now we're at the
point where we started doing screenings people have watched it and they're like the chemistry between the boys is unreal and i say all of this to say that the thing i'm
most proud of is that i recognize what is necessary to get the best
out of my actors and as a result i'm incredibly proud of what they've done i'm just really excited for them because
i know that they're about to have very exciting careers one of my actors red-eyes a moroccan kid
and he's amazing he turned 21 while we were shooting well during our break we got broken up for kovit we got stopped
mid-shoot and we went back thankfully and finished the movie but red is this young incredible uh kid from
uh from morocco london moroccan descent and he said to me like in the audition i was like you're
so naturally funny why haven't i seen you do more comedy and he said mate i only ever get the
the the child of terrorist the young about to be turned terrorist role i only ever get
those parts he said i've never read for comedy ever because i'm always reading for the same thing
which is why when this came across my desk i've done everything i can to be good at it because i don't want to just
play a terrorist i'm more than that and for him to be in this film and to be so funny it's just the most amazing
feeling ever to give somebody that platform you've created so many critically acclaimed
The most key moment from all your films
amazing documentaries right and they're so diverse in their subject matter thank you yeah no just
i was going through yeah yeah it's really just like it's so diverse but i i wanted i wanted to
know of all and this might be like picking your favorite kid or something but of all the documentaries and all the moments and those those those stories
that you've told is there something where you think this is why i started
man that's so tough because there's something in every film yeah genuinely yeah it might even be the lesson that
you know you made a crap a crap documentary and you knew it going in but you did it anyway
there's been so many amazing lessons so i think the thing that comes to mind most whenever i'm asked this question
is um the south african preacher i made a documentary called the millionaire preacher um and there was this guy
called uh umboro who is still active as a preacher i mean he recently i think he got arrested
for selling pictures uh to his followers uh that he took when he went up to
heaven so he recently i think has been arrested for that i'm not entirely sure what's
going on with him now but anyway at the time when we went to make the documentary with him he had a congregation of about
10 000 people and he was a multi-millionaire several rolls-royces you name the car he had it mansions the lot and his entire
congregation was made of poor black people and he fell out with me
because he didn't think i respected him enough because i came to the film as somebody
who isn't particularly religious but has a religious background i grew up in a pentecostal christian church my stepfather was muslim i converted to
islam when i was a kid and in my teens i decided that faith really wasn't for me in that context so i'm looking at this man
thinking you are literally exchanging people's faith for their pay packet and i was disgusted by him
by everything that he represented before i'd even spoken to him before i'd even begun to unearth who he
was and what got him to that place and it was an incredible learning experience when he decided that he
didn't want to film with me anymore and you know his armed guards were sort of like you know had their fingers on the trigger as
i was trying to force the point that he should keep talking to me and he was just not interested i i came to realize that
it's not about me the reason i was there was not to have a personal experience
the reason i was there was to make a film that could potentially shed light on an issue or teach something to people across the uk that i
would never meet and ultimately the world as the film went on on netflix and i had a similar situation
when i made a film about being young black and gay i have a family member who i'm incredibly close
to who is a gay man and um his coming out was this incredible moment for me in terms of
realizing how difficult his life had been up until that point because of what he worried about because
of what he thought might happen um and i wanted to make a film about that
and cut a long story short ultimately the film for me didn't feel as though it nailed it
and i was really really disappointed and uh the production company that i worked with at the time would always do
screenings of the film as the films as they went out so we went to the exec's house and we're in his house
and we're in the kitchen watching it and the credits roll and as the credits are rolling everyone's sort of high-fiving each other going ah we killed it we're
trending on twitter this is brilliant everybody loves the film and i'm just like that isn't the film that i had in my head that doesn't speak
to the the specificity of the experience in the way that i wanted it to anyway point being i went into my dm
on all the social platforms i was on at the time and every single mailbox was filled with messages
from young men and women saying we saw that you were making this film
so we purposely watched it with our parents and i've just come out to my mum because of the film you made i was able
to have a conversation with my dad because of some of the things that were happening on screen thank you for giving
us that opportunity thank you for opening the door and i felt like an absolute idiot in
that moment because i was so busy worrying about being missed our program maker and making this film that
was perfect in my mind's eye whereas in reality the conversation that was being had had never been had before
let alone on the bbc and as a result it actively changed lives of people watching it literally changed
the lives of people that messaged me wasn't about me and i felt really embarrassed myself
it's really interesting that balance of it being not about you but it comes to me
yeah do you know what i mean it's that it's that yeah it was it came it was birthed out of your own personal experience and your desire to tell a
very important story which had clearly moved you emotionally enough to commit your life a portion of
your life to telling that story so it but but also i completely understand what you're saying which is like the
outcome is not about you i guess yeah um the experience is yours yeah but the experience that people take
from the content you will never own i will never know how much what i do
affects people or doesn't there's someone out there right now who's seen everything i've never done and i'll never meet them similarly there's someone who i'll bump
into tomorrow who's just seen one film and will have a really important conversation with me
you know on a lot of levels for both of us potentially i'm not responsible for what happens with what is created once
it's out in the world and being comfortable with that is quite difficult but also quite freeing in a lot of ways
quick one as you might know i've recently teamed up with a new partner for the podcast called my energy and they're best known
for their pioneering renewable energy products but they're also doing so much to try and help all of us navigate some of
these alienating um complicated terms as it relates to sustainable energy
whether that's the term les or ules or clean air zones cars you can and can't drive
in london it can be a lot to understand but these guys are making it simple they have tons of
helpful guides explanations q and a's and videos on their website that make all of this stuff make sense
to neanderthal idiots like me and they sell some of the most amazing renewable energy products whether you're buying an
electric car or you're trying to find sustainable ways to run your home check it out myenergy.com they're an
awesome company round by an awesome awesome founder one of the real uk british success stories
and uh i couldn't be more excited to be a partner with them and let's talk about money then so you mentioned money there what role
Your relationship with money
does does money play in all of this stuff and success in your view in in life well i've never chased it which
is probably why my account hates my guts you know i walked away from prime time tv that you know
is a very rare air in terms of the amount of people that get to host those shows that get millions and millions of
viewers and also the payment that comes with it you know i didn't enjoy
hosting those shows i didn't enjoy being in that space i didn't enjoy being told what to do and say i essentially was being asked to
not be me and that didn't work for me and in walking away from that and focusing on
documentaries i walked away from a lot of money and knowing that i was going to take a hit
financially ultimately being able to get to the place that i am now as a filmmaker
um was something i was very aware of so money has never been a driver for me but
it's been something that i've been conscious on because you've got to live right and also i look after a lot of people
and i help a lot of people and i support people so i've always wanted to do that so money has always been important in that
sense but it's never been important because i'm going to show you that jump you described there where you swing from
being like a tv host to saying you know i want to make my own documentaries feels like a risk it is yeah massively
talk to me talk to me about that the feeling you had when you thought you know what i want to go and pursue myself now yeah
and my sort of intrinsic i always get roasted for using my insurance i can extrinsical intrinsic fulfilling passion yeah um
despite that i'm gonna have to take a financial cut potentially yeah i might not you know and the risk there's no guarantee
here right this might not work out might not get commissioned well it's the same thing with radio you know i hosted radio for 10 years i was
at radio one for a decade and i walked away i left hosting the chart show
not because i was fired but because i decided it wasn't right for me anymore because i stopped learning and for me it's always been about what
are you learning how much you're enjoying this and does this align with where you are as a human being does this align with
your passions does it align with what you care about and you know i you touched on yourself earlier in the
conversation when i recognized that i didn't want to talk to harry styles for 30 seconds
about the new video i wanted to ask how the hell are you managing all of
this you're nine years old like mate how are you managing this
there are grown women that are hunting you down yeah sexually yeah and you're figuring out who the hell you
are as a person how are you managing bro i wasn't allowed to have that conversation on radio one
but i was in my documentaries you know and you know every form has its limitations
which is why documentaries have um grown into filmmaking because now i can actively write
the conversation as opposed to sitting down with someone hoping that they're going to give me the sound bite that makes that you know
makes that uh exciting for the audience now i can write it and through some of my experiences in
factual and life i'm able to create people and create characters that are flawed and interesting enough that
trigger conversations in the way that i would hope to do in the approach to making a documentary
whereas with the film drama specifically i'm able to literally lay it out and create it on my
Whats the importance of being your true self?
own terms and in terms of yeah and so in terms of like fulfillment happiness mental
well-being yeah how important is it to be your true self you know and you know again we talked about the lgbtq
community and how the struggles they face when the suicide rates are higher because they they are forced in many instances to live a
life that isn't true to who they actually are from your own experience i mean from mine i know that i mean when you're i mean you're doing it now
you're making extraordinary work because it's connected to who reggie is
um you i'm guessing you're you're more happy you're happy right you're fulfilled and um and it's
all seems to be a really positively reinforcing cycle when you get closer to that yes sense of who you are it's it you
know it is it's it's looking at your door and i'm sure you have a similar thing you know you look at your calendar for the day and you go what am i actually
doing today and we've all had those days where you see something in the calendar that you don't want to do
seldom do i have those days now it's very rare that i have something that i don't want to do
um but professionally particularly yeah um and i'm really excited by that and
i'm proud of that you know um everything that i i'm invested in
professionally uh comes from a place of passion so for instance i made uh you know talking about social media and all the
rest of it i made a drama for the bbc called uh make me famous which was a
standalone one-hour drama about the relationship between uh fame social media and suicide and you know i
created a character who was a reality tv star who after being on a hit show suddenly his
star begins to fade and there is a newer younger sexier version of him who's getting all the accolades and love and suddenly his
rates going through the floor and what that does to him on a on a mental health level
and the conversations and research that i was like embedded within in the build
up to write in the screenplay were incredibly eye-opening for me because i was talking to stars from reality tv past and present
and hearing the difference between people who have been on reality tv 15 years ago and today was heartbreaking you know and seeing
the way that these kids understand fame and and what they're searching for you know and also recognizing that i'm someone
who's hosted reality tv you know and i have a really strange and unique relationship with it so
my point is regardless of what it is i'm doing i care about it i care about it and
that's anything from content to product i have a dairy free ice cream you know i have it sounds ridiculous but
i have a dairy free ice cream i'm a creative director and business partner and blue skies but this is a dairy-free ice cream that
is made in ghana it employs 3000 plus people the people
that work there all look like me and my family and they are being given an opportunity
to not only have a career but be paid properly and it's on amazon fresh and it's in
waitrose and people here are enjoying it in the summer not thinking about it but what it's actually doing is incredible it's changed the community
and this is something that i'm connected to so whatever it is i do now if it doesn't align with my purpose i don't want to be
involved isn't it such a massive uh i reflect on this a lot and especially when i'm speaking to one that has
sort of immigrant parents that you know our parents central concern was survival yes and
what a privilege it is that people like me and you can sit here and talk about meaning and fulfillment and pursuing a
dairy-free ice cream from guys just it seems like you know i think immigrant children will and hopefully understand the weight
of that that response almost responsibility you know when you when so close in your
your your family tree there was people literally fighting for survival yeah um i just think that's it but the
difficult thing about that is and this is a conversation i'm having a lot you know talk about people becoming fathers a lot
of my friends are from a similar background you know black white and different you know whatever children of immigrants or
white working class now that they have worked hard and found a level of success
and are now becoming the parents the lives that their children have will be worlds apart from the struggle
that they experienced how do you navigate that relationship with your kid
who for intents and purposes is silverspoon because you've worked so
hard yeah you've now made it easier for your child and are you going to be mad at that kid yeah because things are easier how do
you raise that child with the same values you know i hope that's a rhetorical question well i definitely don't have
the answer because i'm single i'm not even a dad so i don't have to have that conversation just yet nice segue
to me okay so you're single talk to me about
Romantic Relationships
that how are you going to be waving a partner oh yeah this is like tinder cast
um amazing so so tell me is reggie yates hard to date uh absolutely why uh for the same reason
that you are your business it's the truth it's the truth i i i have a feeling everything
i'm about to say you will identify with and that is the um
disclaimer everything i'm about to say will probably make me sound like a massive pratt so please don't judge um
you're not like a lot of people uh you're not like most of your friends because of the life that you've chosen
for yourself and more importantly the person that you've had to be to become the person that you are which
as a result means that your dating pool is small because if we're talking about someone beyond uh
being attractive and needing to have the value system or the outlook or and this is the really difficult
thing the understanding that you require it suddenly becomes incredibly hard and
one of the stumbling blocks i've found is hoping that someone will become the
person that i really feel that i need in terms of their understanding of me um or expecting them to
and in doing the work and realizing the role that i play in that i've been at
different times very responsible in that those moments of conflict should we say
whereas today i'm just very clear about uh who i am and also what i need and i think if
you're very open and honest about that in the beginning it makes it easier but it doesn't make
it easy and the pool continues to shrink the more my world changes
because a a guy that was like a mentor for me always described me as a moving
target like reg we're moving targets bro like it's never going to be easy because you continue to learn
you continue to work on yourself and you continue to have that hunger to be better for yourself and for others and it's
incredibly difficult to find someone that is either on the same path or has the empathy and understanding for
you and the path that you're on and the knock-on effects that that will have romantically so you said two things there that i
really wanted to jump back to before we proceed um with this topic you said you've come to
learn who you are and what you need yeah who are you and what do you need um i'm a fiercely creative person
with a very young spirit who needs friendship and
understanding and empathy as a writer you know when you're building characters uh one of my
favorite things to do for my characters is write down what is the lie your character believes and i think for the longest time i
believed that i would find a female me and i couldn't imagine anything worse today
and also you know you have to understand the difference between your character's wants and needs which is why i find writing so cathartic
because i'm essentially doing therapy on me as i'm creating different versions of me at different points in my
life and it's never going to be easy to be in a relationship with someone like myself
or i imagine you because we are moving targets i'm a walk in the park um going back to what is it are you
single yeah how's that walk going for you that's good okay so going back to what i
need what does what does and i find this so fascinating because you've described it there like i've been on this journey
over the last 10 years where what i thought i needed if you'd asked me 10 years ago i would have gone this hair color these eyes this way size
this fashion sense and as i've got older and older it's just come down to these like fundamental i guess principles or values yeah and
now there's basically only three of them but i want to i really want to know where you are with what you think you
need now i think it's very simple uh it's to be with someone that i can love unconditionally and that
will love me back unconditionally that's the simplest version of it and that is flaws and all and i think
it's also the desire to be understood and also the ability to understand because i
feel like reg i feel like there's a lot of women out there that would love you unconditionally and i still feel like that might not be
enough um that's an interesting point i don't know i think because i've had exes that loved
me i genuinely know i'm thinking of one in particular loved me unconditionally but it wasn't enough okay so the point i
was about to make and i think that this is something that might i don't know i'm interested to see if this speaks to you is
the understanding part of it right i say understanding and it feels like quite a blanket term but what i mean by that is
culture is such a huge thing for me you know like i'm walking around at the moment with this tiny little chain on but the
pendants on it are jinyami which is a ghanaian
symbol which means trusting god i've got a little africa symbol and i've also got my
family crest right i don't even think about these things anymore but when i think about what i have on me
literally my family is incredibly important to me my relationship with my spirit is
incredibly important to me and where i'm from are incredibly important to me and there is a huge difference between empathy and
understanding and being in a relationship with someone that doesn't understand those three pendants
and doesn't well if they don't understand those three pendants they won't understand me so when i say understanding i speak to
that and it's very easy to say that you can love someone unconditionally but when you're someone like you or i
who meets a thousand people a week some on the street some in situations like this some through crew that you
will never meet again you long to come home look at your partner
and not need to say anything and for them to understand you and that's why
understanding such a huge part of it professionally as well right because you
because you coming your work's going to take you all over the world and you know an insecure partner might think
oh they might try and compete with your work they might be jealous of your work they might well does that mean he doesn't love me
he's spending x time away in a jail cell yeah what about me it's part of it
yeah because work is and isn't um it's a part of who i am you know i go
to the cinema twice a week i've just put a movie theater in my home and god forbid
anybody tell me that i shouldn't be in there as much as i intend to be movies have got me where i am and have
helped like i learned to shave watching danny glover teach his son how to shave and leave a weapon
films are a huge part of my life and you can understand that you know
uh you have to understand me professionally just as much as you do emotionally spiritually and culturally do you think in
relationships you're selfish i definitely was not so much now um
i i i learned the hard way i've been in failed relationships and i've also even in my most recent relationship my
desire to understand uh only went so far and i've you know done some more work on myself
and ultimately didn't work out but i think i understand why and i definitely understand the role that i played in
that last question on this particular one before you can just throw it back at me if you wanted because i've just been like refusing to give my perspective here
because i really i i've really gained a lot from this kind of conversation yeah sure um if you spoke to your
former partners what would be the one common theme as to why they think the
relationship didn't work um i think my my previous partners will say that i
always operate with the best intentions but didn't listen enough and listening so important
oh my god especially if you've got a lot to say and especially if you you've done work and you know stuff
you think you know stuff um you can and i certainly did in my 20s fall into this
belief that i knew enough and i didn't need to listen to you because you don't know as much as me i mean it's
incredibly unhealthy and potentially quite toxic um so yeah i think my biggest failure
romantically has been to not listen interesting where are you i think i think i i've been very uncompromising
and i'd say selfish i think i'm definitely probably in relationships other than my
ex who i've who's taught me a ton of really important lessons about myself and about patience and about yeah
just really realizing that really because i used to once upon a time when i was younger i used to think it was all about
findings i've said this in the last podcast but finding someone that was perfect so again i was i was in search of like the
female equivalent of me that was like super career orientated had the same beliefs as me i saw the world would give me but it was
such a contradiction because i wanted them at my beck and call but then also wanted them to be busy and when you analyze what i was
looking for it of course it didn't exist yeah so the question in my mind moved from being
are they perfect are they worth it and when it becomes are they worth it it's an immediate appreciation for their
and your lack of imperfection and also that there's going to be some really tough difficult times where
it doesn't make sense to you they're worrying about something irrational they're upset about something that would never have upset you but you have
to as you said earlier you have to listen and you don't have to agree
and in fact you don't have to tell them that you disagree yeah you just have to listen and hear them out and that's a skill that i've honed more
recently in my my last current relationship where even if i don't
agree on everything i listen and i will hear them out and yeah i'm
learning the lesson how much do you take who you are professionally into your romantics this is a chip it's a perfect question to
follow up with um no no surprise that you do what you do because that's literally what i what i've what i always ask
people which is in work context i've been taught or in order to succeed
i've had to be someone a set of values a way of speaking a lack of compromise
a clarity of vision and it's worked out and it works out so i come home at night and i'm like
same clarity of vision same like that no [ __ ] there are emotions
yeah and somebody else's feelings yeah i want if she wants to go to the park and do a walk i'm trying to
from my business perspective trying to understand what the roi on that is like i'm like but that's not what i'm wearing
yeah like what the hell are we doing having a picnic like i've got money you know so i've got money to make or something but i've i've
had to realize that i have to be two steves to succeed or different steves to be succeed in different parts of my life in
certain contexts in a boardroom if i'm doing a deal with a one of the ceos of the biggest brands in the world
who is smashing his pen on the desk telling me i'm an idiot and i'm at war with him we're friends but this is how these some of these people do business
i have to be a certain person right the person i have to be when my partner tells me something
like do you know about their personal spiritual beliefs that i might not understand in the full context
is completely different it's not about being right or winning in that context it's about listening
trying seeking to understand and trying if i can to try and find the sort of
mutual bridge in which we we both share values even if the words we're using are different
yeah and i've been on that journey for the last i'd say two years because of this person i met who
yeah who taught me those lessons it's empathy and understanding isn't it ultimately that's what it comes down to what about you on that on that question
you asked me there about the person you are in work yeah and then the person you are at well work has to be quite black and
white in a lot of ways doesn't it you have to be very clear and clinical uh about what needs to get done to
achieve the thing and that's just not the case when you're dealing with a human being
if the thing is uh having a nice dinner and having a conversation where
everybody feels heard you can't be black and white about that there is a gray area that
relationships romantic platonic professional whatever that they they can operate in that
require wriggle room and i think that at my worst i've not allowed for wriggle room when
it comes to somebody's outlook or perspective ultimately i am very happy that i am
where i am and i think i've ultimately made the right decisions in terms of my relationship choices and whoever i end up with hopefully will be
the best version of themselves and i will be the best version of myself and we'll figure it out but what seems to keep coming up for me
is what the foundations of any healthy relationship actually are and the foundation for me that i'm in
search of is friendship i think if i want to
not only spend time with you in the way that i would a friend but also i'm kind to you in the way that i am to
my friends in terms of allowances and allowing for uh being wrong and also figuring it out
and also having a healthy conversation about something when you're on different sides of the argument
bringing that into my romantic relationships has already started conversations in a way
that feel healthier than anything i've ever experienced before how how did your parents how do you
How has your parents relationship affected you?
think your parents relationship has impacted your ability to form relationships
massively yes massively um again you know we're talking about the journey of others so
i'll try and be as respectful as i can but as an adult
who is now a lot older than my parents were when they had me um i'm able to have a little clarity on
their decision-making and understanding that their age probably played a big part in some of the decisions that they made i'm sure
it's the same for you you know you look at friends who get married in their early 20s or um
essentially find their life partner before they've had a life and you can have an opinion on it but
you're not necessarily going to be right because there's no way of knowing you
can have an assumption as to where it's going to go and how it's going to play out because let's face it who you are at 21 is infinitely
different to who you are at 29 let alone 30 plus [Music]
i just try my hardest to be as kind as i can to the decisions that my parents made
and how that in turn affected me because i think culturally now we live in an era where we think
more about our how our behavior affects others than
ever before and you know the way in which my stepfather spoke to me at one point or
the way in which they interacted in front of us as kids shouting whatever it was you know um i don't
think it ever occurred to them the effect that that might have yeah that's not because they're bad people that's because culturally that wasn't
even in the conversation at that time so i hold no judgment towards uh parents from that generation um
i've got no excuse though because you know when i'm a parent i know better i've had 10 years plus of therapy and also i exist in the
self-help generation where we've read every book and we have conversations like this and i have conversations like this
with my friends and i know for a fact that my dad and my stepfather wouldn't sit around
with their group of predominantly black friends and have conversations about
you know healthy relationships and mental health etc so this is the last time i mentioned them
because i feel like i've said so much about them but again richard and emma when i went to their house um for the
first time in in notting hill and i walked in and saw this sign on the wall
it broke my heart and excited me in a way that i've never been excited before and those two conflicting emotions stick
with such a visceral moment that i had that no one in the room was aware of they've got a bunch of kids they have
this lovely house where all their kids at the time lived at home and there was this neon sign on the wall that said everything is going to be
okay with literally in lights on the wall in their house where their children were growing up
and it grounded me to the spot when i saw it because i thought subconsciously what is that doing to
these children that they are safe as a message in lights is something that they walk
past every day to me that's what love looks like it's
being able to tell someone you love them without having to say anything based on the environment you've created
based on who you are for them and them feeling safe
that to me was in one moment a real a real sort of
opener in terms of what i would be searching for and should be searching for that feeling of safety from someone that
doesn't need to be said is that is that in part because you didn't feel like you fully had that when
you were definitely i think it's partially because of what i grew up in and partially because of the
relationships that experience up until that point you know it's funny because you you know
a lot of things can we can sometimes play play defense play defense but it turns out well we
think we're playing defense but it turns out to be self-harm so we reject the chance of safety
because we're not comfortable with it it's kind of like what i was describing when i was 14 and jasmine
told me she loved me i was playing self-defense but it was in fact self-harm
you're trying to protect yourself yeah in doing what feels right in the moment but ultimately you're killing something that could have
been incredible i think we've all been there i certainly have definitely i'm just
really thankful that i don't do it anymore i remember sort of rejecting this idea of um of who my family was and how much
of an impact that had on me and then when i embraced it and i embraced the good and the bad i was able
to see so much of the good you know my father who i don't have a relationship with is an incredible
musician he's still part of a band to this day and you know i put on his album and i cry
because it's like this man brings so much beauty and joy to strangers he wasn't able to give it to me but i'm
objectively able to find that beauty and the art that he creates today you cry when you listen to your biological fathers particularly one song
jesus christ which song it's called jojo's song and so we have the same name i'm um he's called reggie
yes i'm reginald yates and um he's obviously guardians because you're based on the day that he's born i'm not
i'm tuesday and so everyone calls him jojo right so it's jojo's song and it's a song where he's singing and playing a fun piano and it's just oh my god
it's beautiful and to know that this man who for chunks of my teens i really resented
because i felt that he wasn't there for me has this beauty in him moves me to tears
whenever i listen to him sing and have you forgiven him i forgave him a long time ago because
i think it was like i said the point when some of my friends started to become fathers you realize that not everybody is going
to get it right and not everybody's cut out for it and i was just unfortunate to not have one of those world's greatest dead guys
i ended up getting a dad that just really wasn't ready to to do it or grow up um and i can't be mad at him for
his journey that brought him to being the man that he was when he became a father and on that point just to conclude that
point of the relationships love point do you think you're ready to be in that relationship that you said
you think you need yeah i think so i think because i'm on my journey professionally and the
worry of not getting there which could affect you romantically doesn't exist anymore for me
that's a huge thing that is taken out of the equation of who i am romantically i think because of the age that i am and the experiences that i've had
i'm very close to being who i will be for the foreseeable yes i am a moving target but the
target's moving out you know the things that are changing in me aren't as big as they were in my teens
into my 20s so meeting someone today and being with them in five years i don't envy just being totally different people it's
so interesting it's easier yeah sure i love that point and you talk about the moving target the
way that i've come to learn to to sort of mentally understand it in my mind is like
you imagine two lines and then from this point onwards the lines start moving
and if they are one percent if say the reggie yates line is just one
percent to the right you and the other line will move apart over time and i think i love what you
said there about like i think i'll be a similar person in five years time which means like the degree of
separation won't be it's less yeah so i think yeah that's a well the
greater journey has been made up into this point and i mean that personally in terms of
my development in knowing who i am the level of self-confidence i have and also what i'm fighting for
has suddenly been crystallized because as someone who has the ability to do lots of different
things i was running around trying to figure out who i was supposed to be and at the same time worrying about what
i was leaving behind for so many years whereas now i've tried loads of different things
i've had lots of different kinds of relationships i've traveled i've done all these different things that i know what i want for me and i
also i feel fairly confident i wouldn't say i know but i feel fairly confident about what love looks like for me
what success looks like for me and what fulfillment feels like for me which instantly makes picking a partner
all being chosen a lot easier in that stage where you're running around trying to figure out who
who you are yeah um for me that was a very insecure stage in my life i talked to you i said
i was before i wanted lamborghinis right and it's funny because in that stage when you're you're most insecure and
you're most searching for answers what i tend to see especially on instagram these days is that is the stage where people arrive
at the conclusion that they need a romantic partner to complete them right yeah
and it's in fact what you've described is no [ __ ] like that's the stage where you need to do the self-work yeah and then people form these like oh
well i had a huge gap so i filled it with a romantic solution yeah and you complete me as one of the most
dangerous statements ever right because you don't yeah
and eventually we're both going to realize that i don't completely when you don't complete me you've got to be complete
to meet someone who's complete to begin something new together and it's that um the idea of you know your life their
life and the shared life right and being willing to recognize that they have to have a life
separate from yours and as you do for you to build something together that's separate and different
and i'm excited about that because i feel as though my universe looks the way that i've always wanted it
to i love the friends that i have you know they're like family to me i love the home that i have i love the
relationships that i have with my my mother's like my mate now it's really lovely and all of that has been work
that i've had to do on my own so now i can come to the table as a healthy grown-up
and make healthy conversation and have healthy decision-making you know damn society wants you to rush it though
doesn't it it really does you know it really does but i mean our parents generation all got married a lot
younger than we didn't look at the divorce rates yeah i think being happy with who you are
first is imperative to being able to recognize someone who is happy within themselves
What does the future look like for you?
your work you're doing so much at the moment this is kind of where i wanted to to end this is you're doing so much
across you know your books you know your podcast i think you've taken a little bit of a break
at the moment yeah yeah i'm gonna get back to that but that's another conversation your documentaries your business
what are you most excited about what does the future look like what is the big professional i mean if there is one
what's the big professional i don't mean milestones i mean the big professional feeling you know what i mean the big
professional feeling is being creatively fulfilled in broad terms in more specific terms
it's my business we haven't actively launched yet but we are working
and operating and that is five seven so i have a company called five seven uh which is a people product and content
business which has a cause arm we have past the mic which is a platform that we created for young creatives
which is growing and doing really beautiful things in terms of empowering diverse voices right the way through to content we make
everything from feature films like pirates or you know make me famous um uh right the
way through to uh product like blue skies so everything that we do at five seven has the fingerprints
of my outlook on the world and this idea of understanding the power
of platform like there are so many people that get to a point of notoriety and start selling slim tea
and there is no judgment on anybody that does that but i i judge you reggie doesn't but i do i
judge you i always go back to that mom in the street who stopped me and said you're a role model for my kid and me
hating it and then finally coming around to realizing i have no choice in the mail if you have an opportunity to make
movies to sell products to make tv shows to create a cause-led
initiative why not make it good why not make it
speak to what you care about why not make it something that can actively inspire other people to be
better than you are and do more than you've ever done so for me empowering others is a huge part of
my drive right now and um working with young talented people
inspires me to be better and as a result i feel incredibly fulfilled you know i don't see myself as a mentor but i've
technically mentored three or four people and they're like my little brothers and sisters now that's how i see them they're my friends who come around for
dinner or football or whatever and you know guys and girls will call me and ask for advice on their relationship or
on a decision that they have to make professionally and i love that i have that relationship with people because i
never had it growing up i had these bits of dad but i never had the big brother you know there was always a distance
between me and the person that was helping guide me um shortening that distance
for me in the lives of others is what success feels like so the big
thing is being creatively fulfilled financially free and ultimately
understanding what it feels to love and be loved really and that's a journey that's what
In your view whats your potential?
we hope for in your own view what is what is your potential
um unlimited okay and i don't say that because i think i'm lebron james because i definitely can't dunk like
lebron yeah but i do think that i don't think i know
anything that i've wanted to do like really wanted to do and i've really worked for i've achieved
i don't know uh and because that has happened it can happen in any way shape or form
my mother believes that she's quite a spiritual woman as most west african women are i'm sure i'm sure you've got your
stories but she believes that everybody's born with a gift right my mother believed that my gift is to see and to communicate
and she always said that to me since i was a kid you know you can see and you can communicate um and the communication thing is sort
of panned out it's you know essentially how i pay my bills sharing ideas and the the c part of it
is quite ambiguous in a lot of ways because what i've come to understand that to me is that you know as a kid i used to
dream quite vivid things and they would all come to pass to you know learning about self and
doing some reading going some seminars watching some stuff you understand things about manifestation all the rest of it and
that dream thing has sort of changed into manifestation in a lot of ways and when things start to happen
that you had in your head it teaches you you can do anything yeah and that's how i feel right now i feel
like i can do anything i had an idea at a funeral of all places two years
later it's a movie that is coming out in cinemas and
i genuinely think that anything that i put my heart to and my mind to i can i can make happen i can make it real if that's your world view
and you you believe that and you've seen it and you've got evidence for it in your life that when you think about
something when you see it you can then create it is it frustrating
when you speak to friends close friends other people who express their dreams to you yeah that they don't have that
too no it's not reminds me right no but you can't you can't be like that
and i'm i'm very i'm very specific about words some sometimes i try to be anywhere i hate saying the word can't yeah i feel really
strongly about this you can't allow yourself to think that way because who they are is based on their journey
yeah and they may beat that and get beyond that but you can't be mad at someone for
where they are on their own trajectory yeah it's so it's like when i because i have the same world view where
i've built those case personal case studies in my life that i could go from being in most sides stealing chicago
town pizzas to believe to believing and chasing that dream failing along the way messing up failure
whatever but being able to create the the life that i that i was aiming for and so when i see friends who express
their dreams to me and i deeply believe that whatever like we're not talking about going to mars
right we're talking about i want to be a whatever or i want to try i know they can do it
every part of me knows it's possible because i've seen behind the curtain and and they have what it takes and to
be fair when i started i had like my math to ship my english [ __ ] my parents weren't speaking to me we don't come from a family that had any money
so i i know that the belief the self-belief alone the foundation of being born in such a
privileged country is is more than they need to go after that and i just have this [ __ ] thing
in me where i'm like you know i'm like you can and it it you know i get i i definitely i i get you and i
hear you because i've definitely felt that before especially when it comes to young people that want you to help them
or that want you to mentor them and you take a chance on someone and you give them all the information
you give them the blueprint you give them all the tools and they still don't listen or they
agree and they do the total opposite mate it's like practice for parenting isn't it
people that you love or invested in aren't necessarily always going to do
what you think they should do and you can't be mad at them for it because it's their journey and
that is something that i'm incredibly thankful for that the people that i've had around me have allowed me
to not listen and make mistakes or go in another direction like i had a huge huge desire to be a musician
for a long time and i was making music and i was offered a publishing deal and i was collaborating with everyone from i mean
i won't even say the names but you know i made an album and i had a deal on the table and i
i was adamant that this was what i was going to do i was going to be the first person that could host top of the pops and perform on it like that was
that was my thing right and when my god rested soul music lower at the time richard and she sat me down and said
okay you see that top of the pops that you're hosting you see that radio one show that you've got you're gonna have to leave all of that bro
to do this because you're gonna tour you're gonna be in studio we're gonna send you here there and there the label will want you to record and
blah blah and i was like i don't wanna give all that up and it was like all right so are we
going to sign this thing or not and i walked away from what would have been another career
because ultimately it wasn't what i was supposed to do and i wasn't willing to give up the thing that i loved but i
needed to spend three or four years of wasting the time of people that were producers and and
and singer-songwriters who come and collaborate with me and people gave studios were giving me free time record labels were offering me contracts they
were rewriting them all of this investment into me for me to say now i'm just gonna go back
and do what i was doing before i met all of you lot sorry you know
i've done it i can't be mad at someone else who's doing a similar thing because there is that point in your life where you have
to figure out through mistakes or through trial and error what you're ultimately supposed to do
amen i'm glad you agree no i do because i would love you to challenge no i love but i that's why i do it because i know listen
i know that i'm like so so many of my approaches in so many areas of my life are so imperfect but i love getting the perspective from
someone else because everything you've said i completely agree with and of course you're of course you're right
but i still contend with that feeling because there's this there's this like bias in me that i've had it's it's
weakened over time but really wants people to um feel what i
feel in my life and uh and that is an awful bias because it's projecting my own values and world
view and what i think happiness for everyone looks like onto them um so i i yeah you're not the only one
you know i a million percent have done that myself yeah and even in relationships right absolutely so absolutely if you do this you're
going to be like this which means you're going to be just like me and you're going to be great the most frustrating one is whenever you say to someone you say
what do you want and they go this and you go okay here's how you get it and they go oh [ __ ] you know and you're like well you said
you wanted that this isn't that isn't even my world view you said you want to be a costa rican belly dancer here is the cause and
they're like wow well the truth is uncomfortable right yeah and it's usually [Music]
it's usually harder than people want it to be and that unfortunately in this conversation is
both the case for someone like yourself who sat on one side of the table saying this is what you need to do and on the other side of the table the
person saying well i don't want to do all of that and what you both leave with is truth and that is that you can't control
someone else and that is that you've really got to do the things that you aren't willing to do to get what you want you know
amen listen reggie uh you know the work you've done with your documentaries i just think is tremendous and i think
i remember once upon a time listening to i think it was neil degrasse tyson say that the most important work we can do or the most
important people in our society aren't the people we elect into power it's the electorate that elect them
and so therefore the most important powerful work one can do is educating the electorate and what
that really means for me is like the way that people think about whether it's sexuality or regimes in other countries whatever it might be
is the way they think dictates who they then elect into power which then impacts our laws in the society we live
in and that's the work you're doing and i find that to be the most admirable important work of it all so thank you for doing that work thank you
for being a role model i mean i've watched you as a young kid growing up in plymouth you know for
for many a decade and you know you've been one of the faces that i even i could relate to on tv because you look
like me um and so i want to thank you for that as well but also thank you for your time today because i think the conversation
we've had has been very honest diverse you've you know you've shared things that you didn't have to share and um
i know that comes from a very selfless desire to impart value on people that um might need it in various areas of their
life so thank you that's incredibly kind thank you for having me thank you pleasure thank you
[Music]
[Music]
you

Intro
i just knew this city needed something better than the classic takeaways that's how i got
the idea for delivery i definitely know what it was like to walk in their shoes i did that job for a
long time i did you know five deliveries last night and that's why you know treating riders with respect and making sure
their voices are heard is so important to me we're running low on money because we
couldn't get money in for whatever 14 months hov it kicks off our users were disappearing because
there are no restaurants left on the platform so we see this plummeting growth i had to do the hardest thing i've ever had to do i had to
lay off you know a significant number of people at the company i'm so proud of what we built and i'm so
excited about the future but it is a hard hard job and anyone that tells you otherwise are not being honest
we're about to get all this money in the company and then suddenly it was just gone right
big number 600 million something like that and i was like holy [ __ ] you know what do we do
[Music]
delivery one of the fastest growing technology companies in europe you probably know the company you've
probably used it but you probably don't know where it came from you probably don't know the founder and
his story his unconventional very very humble journey delivery went from an idea that
one guy had in london while working in the city to becoming a multi-billion
dollar company in record time but the crazy thing about my conversation today with will is
he is not your typical founder he's not your typical ceo he doesn't feel like your typical
entrepreneur this was really his first business and the really
puzzling thing about my conversation with will is he doesn't fit the typical
stereotype of what you expect an entrepreneur to be and i think that is amazing because it
just goes to show that entrepreneurs don't all share the same fundamental characteristics
they're not all these big braggadocious characters with huge egos and you can achieve great success with
great humility will is an anomaly i think you'll feel that today he is incredibly
humble he isn't that introspective doesn't analyze himself that much and he feels like a very simple straightforward
character but what he's achieved wasn't simple it was excruciatingly difficult and as
he'll tell you today it still is without further ado i'm stephen butler
and this is the director ceo i hope nobody's listening but if you are then please keep this to
yourself
well i am sometimes when i have guests on this podcast i don't really know where to start but with you it's slightly different
um as i was reading about your story and i've you know as i said you before we started recording i've been i think actually in 2015 i was
delivered delivery's biggest customer so i'd like you to confirm that and reward me accordingly but i think i was
um and i've watched the journey over the years and been absolutely blown away by it because of the disruption you caused to such a
big incumbent industry however when i read into your story i kept seeing this phrase that you'd say
Your early years
and it really boggled my mind because it's so atypical of the guests i have on this podcast and it's that every time you're asked
about your childhood or whatever else you'd always respond with i'm just a normal guy and when i think about what you've
achieved you built what is now you know at least it was at one point europe's fastest growing company
you couldn't possibly be just a normal guy i i don't know i mean i think i am you
know when you're a kid i don't think you think anything is abnormal just sort of is what it is um so i grew up in
a place called new haven connecticut uh it's a small city um
about 130 000 people probably 10 square miles so it's pretty small um it's where uh yale
university is oh yeah yeah so we're known for that and we're known for pizza those are probably the two things
we're known for best pizza in the u.s that explains why you went and started delivery companies i mean yeah i was always obsessed with sally's and pepe's
and modern and all that um but yeah look my my parents are immigrants
um so you know i would say growing up like uh i guess we didn't
probably spend very much money it's probably the best way to put it but when you're a kid you don't you don't think about that it's
just kind of what you your daily existence you know your
parents what do they do professionally my mom my mom's scientist she works at yale
my dad uh was an actuary he retired so they they were you know well-educated
sort of professional people yeah and you and that brought you over here to london
no no so so my story is i i yeah i grew up in new haven um i went to university in in chicago i
went to a college called northwestern um and then my first job out of college i worked on wall street in new york
because this was 2001. and i took this job on i mean i did
really well in in school both in university and in high school um it was just one of these jobs you did
when you kind of didn't know what else you wanted to really do you knew you could make money and you knew that other
you know successful people ambitious people kind of went down that path so how did you end up in london i ended
up in london because i worked for three years in new york uh my third year they said i got another
job at a different place and they asked me hey do you want to you know check out a
different office and i never lived outside the u.s i wanted to do something different i just took a chance literally
on london so i remember really well it came out in april 04. never been europe never been to london
never been been here and so i showed up and i had such a great time i met
you know the people on the team and i'm like [ __ ] it i'm gonna come i'm gonna come for a year
and then it ended up just basically staying and how old were you when you when you came over here for the first time
was 24 24. yeah i think it's so crazy so many of my american friends they've not left the us
and i i was reading something yesterday about the i was i think it was in i think it's a page in the new york times
it was talking about how important it is to leave the us to understand the world but then also to
appreciate the country that you have i couldn't agree more i mean today is july 5th right yeah exactly yeah july 4th yesterday and you
appreciate the us so much more once once you leave right because everyone in the us is
always like waving flags and stuff they don't i mean they don't know anything else right um but when you leave and you you
understand different societies you can appreciate the good and the bad of the us i'd say
yeah i don't want to go into it but when i i i you know we grew up in the uk and i think europe and pretty much the world
idolizing so much about the us because of films and movies yeah the one thing that upon moving to the us
when i was 24 to run my business to new york i couldn't get my head around was the healthcare system
yeah the idea that i could get sick and be bankrupt yeah because there's nothing you can do about it yeah that's the only well
there's a couple other things with guns which we weren't going to either but that's the bits where i'm like oh my god this isn't the so you were in new york
kind of the same age i moved to london then yes and you moved to you you were the williams sorry then yeah straight to williamsburg our office was
in manhattan so but so you're you're working in canary wolf i'm guessing if you're in finance
yes i was a morgan stanley um and i remember my first day i showed up for work because in new
york you got 25 dinner allowance you can order whatever you want actually funny story my first kind of
day at work in 2001 i was pretty cheap right so i was like 25 i can get
i can do whatever so i actually ordered 25 whoppers because burger king had this dollar whopper special and everyone's
like what are you doing and by like day three the sort of novelty wore off i'm like i gotta work 100 hours a week it's not
you know this isn't that much fun but no the first day i got to london i asked people we're working late i'm
like what are we doing for dinner everyone's like oh just i don't know we go to the tesco and i'm like what's
tesco so we go in the supermarket and everyone's like we're getting these microwave meals and i'm like wait a minute i'm like this
is not you're working like 100 hours a week you try to aspire for something a little bit better so first day that's how i got the idea
for delivery first day i moved here one of those tesco meals just didn't cut it i mean it was all right i mean they're
but but i mean there's just london's like one of the culinary capitals of the world like why wouldn't you want
better food delivered what's that i mean so many people have ideas right so many people have ideas for big grandiose
What made you take on this industry?
businesses but it's almost like and i'd hate to say this because it sounds super pessimistic
but the odds are you're gonna fail so how dare you how do you try and
build that you know that massive logistical operation that is delivery you know honestly um
it's a really good point right because you you're aware that there's the possibility of failure i don't know when i went into this when
i started it i just said i'm not hedging myself in any which way i'm not doing side projects
i'm just gonna focus on this because i really really believe it not so much to start a business i believe in it as a consumer
right so i always thought about it as you know i'm building this business for myself as a consumer and hopefully other people
also you know kind of think similarly to me and i was convinced that enough people did and so i'm not one of these people that
was like oh i need to start a business i'm like i need to solve this problem which i think is pretty different
in my mind and i think people should start businesses because they want to solve a problem or they they're in an industry that they
know super well they've identified some inefficiency that's my view at least i i complete you know over the last three years i've
heard this narrative that like it's much easier to start a business solving a problem that you and your best friend
care about yeah right yeah otherwise like you're gonna get bored yeah you know you i i told this story
before it's totally true i had a friend from business school super smart guy and he he was he had
like a thousand ideas he'd write them all down but his ideas were all predicated on
some financial outcome right and he started this thing it was the etsy for pets
pet accessories or whatever and i was like okay this sounds okay sounds okay i read
his deck and i'm like wow this is like like a great idea so he's like i'm gonna go do this and then like nine months later i'm like
okay how's it going he's like you know what i just really don't like dogs and cats very much and so i just
couldn't do it right that's true you can't do something that you're not actually fully invested in so many
entrepreneurs will say that they'll say oh no not even entrepreneurs so many people that are aspiring to start a business will say that phrase they'll
say i really want to be an entrepreneur i just need an idea and then you'll see them kind of like go and write down a
list of things that they could maybe do and whenever i see that and i this i just 100 stand by this i always think
they're going to fail because of the reasons you described there because you know they're going to go through that absolute [ __ ] chaos
yeah and i think it was steve jobs that said the same person would quit it when you go through the absolute
chaos so you have to love it and really understand it it can't be because i think i'll make because you probably won't make money either right
no you won't right or you you can't go in with the assumption you will
quickly quickly as well right yeah and you know and i had this other guy i knew who he was
like you know what i i he worked at a big consulting firm and he was mckenzie or something like that and he's like
in my spare time i've started these three businesses and i'm like i'm like no man you can't do that like
you pick one thing you gotta like really go for it different people have different sort of attitudes towards that my view though is
you you just have to go all in right so speaking of going all in there must have been a day where you
hand in your notice of resignation well so so no not not for delivery because my story is um so
after morgan stanley i worked uh kind of 0406 in london for morgan
sailing and then i ended up working at a hedge fund for about uh four years in london and then i went back to business school
in in philadelphia for two years and it came back in 2012. oh let's start this business fine yeah
fine so you came back so this was the thing i i i wanted to do after business school okay so you finished business school and
you came straight to london to start yeah because what was cool about business school was i saw offline
online happening right because remember i so i tried to start the live room 08
right and when i was still working in london and when i looked into it it was like all right i'd
have to put a laptop in each restaurant i'd have to build some sort of handheld device for our
rider network and it was just too complicated but you know steve jobs then invented this thing
that completely changed everything right phones tablets all of that and so that was the
prerequisite step of course for any of these well any business today really to operate right
because in oh eight iphone one came out sdk i think the ios sdk came out in 08 so
this app ecosystem hadn't really developed yet and so had to wait for that i didn't
know obviously that the iphone would you know do what it did but in business school i was just super
excited about it it goes to show how critical timing can be in terms of these macro factors with
technology to enable ideas like that because you're right you could never have started this business in 2008. that would have just been impossible and
you think i think the same about things like spotify all of these macro factors of handheld devices and 5g streaming
and 4g streaming whatever all had to come together for you even to have that conversation with the record labels
totally the infrastructure you know i mean you think back to to just laying cables under the atlantic
i mean all of this stuff right to to to the to the iphone to all the software that was being built on i mean
just crazy what had to come before and and those changes are always happening because the of the rate of evolution of technology
so it goes to show that right now because of what's happened over the last x amount of months there are new
opportunities being that have been created for entrepreneurs whether it's blockchain or crypto or so
i think even as an entrepreneur you always think all the good ideas are taken and you know for us we're obsessed about
continual innovation of course because we know competitors come for us right we know that there's going to be someone
sitting around going man this delivery thing kind of sucks we gotta like we can do better than that right and so we're paranoid about that all the time
right that's how we think about it we always think we can get a lot better we have to so so when you first started
out in london so you've moved from business school you've you've got this idea um talk me through
how you know as a ground floor opportunity how that became a a conceptual like a business yeah so um
it was me and my co-founder greg so greg and i grew up in new haven together we've been friends since i think we're like 12. wow right
yeah and so we were into computers like when we were 12. i mean this is before
i'm trying to think here because my mom worked yale so we would go use the um the unix
workstations there and we we actually you know like we were on these use net groups
um you know we were using ftp this is all before there was really a true graphical representation of the internet
and so we got and we got pretty into computer games and stuff like that so we were we were pretty into that stuff
um and and so that's how i that's how i knew my co-founder greg um we then kind of got out of computers
a bit i don't know just discovered different things um but he ended up just you know staying
well he he studied history then worked as a car mechanic just kind of randomly because he liked
cars so he just decided to do that and then he started becoming a software developer again and so him and i we would discuss ideas
like all the time and so in oh wait i talked to him about this idea right deliveroo
and he was like we thought about it he was like this is really complicated for all the reasons we just talked about but we stayed in very close touch so
throughout business school i was always like hey man what do you think about you know this thing again i think it's like possible and so i convinced him to
quit his job and you know kind of start this thing with me
but i moved to london he stayed in the states so it was kind of like this weird thing right but i would say so i moved back
here on october 12th um we were building the prototype uh the restaurant tablet um the rider app um we didn't actually
launch with a consumer app we literally just had a website and so you had to kind of if you had a phone you
had to kind of zoom in to all the buttons it wasn't even mobile optimized we didn't meant them an app right so
and and so yeah because there's two of us right and so um i'd say the first few months before
launch it was like me trying to set up restaurants i signed up restaurants walking up and down the street
in chelsea it was him building all the initial technology me and him making product decisions so
it's just just basically two of us then he came out for the launch january
13 and we launched in feb 13 and um yeah it was just me and him for the
first i guess year yeah so you were
predominantly leading the rider side in the kind of like on the ground operation i mean there's two of us so there's literally
not like i mean greg was building all the technology yeah he did it himself which is like pretty
incredible i was working with them on the product decisions and then i was running the business but
the business was me signing up restaurants me you know getting getting the rider side of the marketplace going
um and obviously you know attracting consumers but the funny thing is you know
initially when we launched in february obviously no one knew who we were so i would actually just ask my friends to
order all the time and you know they just get annoyed at me like why are you like bothering me like
what and um a number of my friends would would order i know for the sole purpose
of watching me deliver the food to them right and i know that for sure and they they just thought it was like
funny they would do the same yeah so i would deliver the food and then they they'd want to chat i'm like sorry guys i gotta go do my next
delivery um but then i realized one thing after a while they kept ordering even if i didn't
deliver the food and so that's when i kind of realized we were onto something do you remember the
first order that wasn't your friend oh um no i i honestly don't but i can
tell you the first order though the first first order ever i mean i told her to order it was it was
my friend anetta and she was living on sydney street in chelsea and the restaurant was rosso pomodoro
and i and you know i was like excited because she ordered so i delivered it but i delivered the pizza upside down
yeah so it was it became a calzone um and then i then i just ate it and she's
like you ruined my meal and you ate the food this is like the worst experience of all time yeah only up from there though so it's
good i mean the writer ate the order yeah yeah not only you delivered it
terribly and then ate the food but but still charged her i'm guessing i might have given her a refund i think
i don't know for any kind of video but no that was that was what happened right it was like my friends were ordering and then it was just word of mouth right and and people
got you know the bunch of people started just showing up never i didn't know their names i had no idea what's going on and i
heard you you didn't do marketing for the first couple years a couple years yeah yeah well i did one thing i had to
i used to wear this kangaroo costume around um yeah yeah um i didn't really enjoy doing
that but um i i would wear a kangaroo costume and hand out these um you know whatever like this is the
living room yeah well why why london and not america i guess america's way more competitive and
the design of the country is slightly different but why london well i mean i'm a londoner right i lived
here for six years before going back to business school i just knew this city needed something
better than than the classic takeaways wow whatever you don't have to say i'll
say it just you it's [ __ ] awful what you know i don't know back in the you don't have to say i'll say it um
when i was a student getting the cold stodgy awful rest not even restaurants awful
corner shop takeaways and styrofoam boxes that was cold was just awful and there was no yeah and so
my first experience with delivery was when i think i said you off camera um a company that i was working with
turned the ceo turned around to me and said you can now order from top class restaurants and it
comes in a nice pack nice packaging and i thought there's no possible [ __ ] way and then i tried it and i never went
back well the reality is look i tried you know um just eat back in 0.7 right i
was really excited about it i was like this is going to be like new york and i tried it i'm like oh wait i can't track
my order i don't know when the food's going to show up and it was all sort of look i like kabobs right i like
fractures nothing wrong with that but if that's the only choice yeah i'm kind of like you know i like kebabs but my intestines don't so
like it's a very there's a battle there's some good places there's something no that's true there is there is there's a couple of
slightly healthier options for kebabs around this around this area um but then so you get to the point where there's i read about there was a
couple of riders so there was you and the three or four others yeah um there was mirza
there there's saeed there's hanif um sayed and hanif and mirza still work with us um doesn't uh there's about four of us
yeah and they're still writers three of them are one of them actually works in our office in dubai
now oh wow he does like rider support in dubai he wanted to move to dubai so amazing yeah
awesome and so you guys were this was when the business was starting to get a little bit of traction within chelsea
i'm guessing exactly yeah yeah so a little bit of traction in one neighborhood yeah we we launched only in one
neighborhood right the first you know a few restaurants were on the fulham road in the kings road and one of the restaurants was was my
landlord's restaurant i used to live above it so he i convinced him to sign up for just because he was like i saw him every
day right it's so funny because when you hear about the lean you know when you read books like the lean startup and you hear about
how entrepreneurs should be starting businesses you seem to have done a lot of things accidentally right
like even your your idea of launching in a small area whether you can establish network effects and not necessarily doing marketing
advertising to your friends stephen we didn't have money yeah this wasn't silicon valley i'm gonna raise a 30 million dollar seat i
was funding the business myself so it wasn't like i had a choice right and so i'm kind of like okay i don't
want to like burn all my cash you know and so that's kind of how i was running the business until we actually raise money
there's something important about that isn't there when teams don't have huge budgets they seem to make better decisions i think so i i think i actually do i
think having too much money can be problematic um and there's a lot of money now but yeah when you're when you're it's
just me and greg four riders like 10 restaurants you know you don't have any money yeah
you gotta like just work on the most important things and try to be as efficient as possible
i resonate with that because i when i started my first business we had six thousand pounds marketing budget and it was it wasn't until we'd blown it
all on all the conventional [ __ ] flyers posters some inflatable balloon which we rolled down a road
and we had no money that we sat there the three of us and and said um if we have no money how do we get a
million people yeah how do we do it and that led us to discover this thing called social media yep and then um we were like well this well this is
facebook page that has 8 000 students on it and the owner says we can buy off him for 50 quid i've got 50 quid let's go
meet him bought it posted about my website on this facebook page more traffic than we've ever had so we were like
let's just build facebook pages for free and so in 2013-12 we started building facebook pages we
got to 100 million followers we're doing seven billion video views a month and the business grew to be worth 300 million and it would never have happened
if we didn't run out of money because we were forced to think in real first principles exactly to ignore convention
and um so i i came up with i i think i i love this idea i i'm like that's
like my proudest idea so um we we were like okay look how do we reach people we could do the flyers
i was sick of walking around with this kangaroo costume right and so i was like hmm and i was staying in a
hotel and i was like oh they have these do not disturb signs that you can hang on the door
right you know when you're in a hotel like do not disturb and i'm like you know what we should just
say deliveroo and then list a number of the restaurants in the local neighborhood because no one knew you could actually get deliveries from there
and we just hung them on people's doors and that worked so no discounts nothing just letting
people know about it it cost you what 20p for one of these things right funny thing is the police got real mad
because they we didn't think about this at the time the police called us and they're like what is this delivery thing we're like
well we're a food delivery company they're like how do we know you're not a burglary ring
and a robbery ring and i'm like what are you talking about they're like well you could just leave those on people's doors and
see who doesn't take them off and if they're if they're still on the houses are vacant so you could burglarize them and
i'm like i didn't really think about it that way but pretty genius idea actually yeah and you're sitting there in your
kangaroo outfit trying to convince the police you're not a burglar basically do you want to come in and
Your riders being discriminated against
watch this podcast live from behind the scenes if you do all you have to do is hit the subscribe button and now that the world has opened
up you'll be behind the scenes as many of our subscribers have been i can't wait to meet you so i you know you've got four or five of
you um the riders riders yeah and you're i hear that you're hanging out in a starbucks
often and you're just sitting there chilling waiting for someone to yeah we're just talking i mean you know
you know there's like four of us there yeah do you the founder of the company and three others the three riders yeah just waiting for
the phone to ping yeah it was the three of us and it was the same guy would come to us and he'd be like all right you guys got to leave
we're like but we we bought something you know he's like kick us out every every time
you know and why was he kicking you out i don't know to be honest i don't think he liked
the look of us if i'm honest with you um yeah you know like like uh i i think um
you know and one day i went to him and i go what is your problem like you know and he's just like get out
right and it was the way that he looked at us the way he looked at me was almost like we were
not people right we're kind of like anonymous is probably the best word i
could use and then sort of sub human is probably you know the the worst word i could use
but it was like that like we're just taking up space in this thing or making his coffee shop look kind of crappy right
and i remember talking to the three other guys about it they like they're just like whatever
just let it go like like who cares but i realized that that must be how a lot of people look at them
all the time right because they're used to it right and for me i wasn't really used to it so i was like really really
mad about it but you know it i definitely know what it was like to walk in their shoes
you know for a day well for i guess a whole year because i did that job for a long time and that's why you know treating writers
with respect and making sure their voices are heard is so important to me
because of you know that one of those incidents and then those three those three guys were from pakistani
descent yeah so one would one could assume that
the the reason why the gonna definitely assume that yeah yeah i was assuming just to be completely clear
i was assuming and yeah and asserting yeah well they're just like the way you know they're looking at us like uh these these people
are gonna make my store look shitty you know you could tell right and so yeah that that was a kind of seminal moment i think
for me and and just talking to these guys but they were just so sort of like either jaded or
kind of numb to it they're like wow like whatever it seems to happen in them all the time yeah because they
experience that type of prejudice and discrimination all the time i i mean i've i've been there right so
very early and that's why that particular story resonates with me a lot is because i remember very early on when i was launching my
business i have a tendency to to wear snapback caps and hoodies even today
and obviously my net worth is significant now and so when i get into like the first class part of the train
i'll never forget the day whether the train attendant walks right down the aisle past everybody else and goes
this is first class mate you're like yeah didn't didn't mention that to anyone
else yeah just felt they need to come up to me and my snap back because i'm wearing this cap in this hoodie and tell me some assumptively that this
this is this is first classmate i'm just looking at him thinking yes i know yeah you know what i mean and
it's funny because i wrote it in my diary this is how i still remember this incident i wrote in my diary that one day you know i'll you know
i hopefully this wouldn't be the case that people were you kind of like numb to it or were you kind of angry
angry yeah angry but for me it's like this small little heat inside it's not like i'm gonna be
rude to you yeah but it's like you presume something about me and and to be honest
there's a bit of me that actually it's in some ways a compliment that he
couldn't possibly think someone like me could afford to sit there and for me that there's some kind of
compliment in there because of the underestimation that a black kid that's young can't sit in first class
you know not that it's a right thing but it's it is what it is well i guess for me though what it also highlighted to me like was
how lucky i was relative to some of these guys that they they cam they come from backgrounds of you know
extreme poverty growing up in in in in pakistan they came here to
build a better life they're super hard working like super dedicated and someone's just treating them like [ __ ] it's like
it's pretty bad yeah it's an experience you i think few would understand if they hadn't been through it themselves so at some
point in this podcast i usually do a break to talk about huel who are the sponsor of this podcast but me and will spent so long talking
about the product i thought i'd just show you this clip instead you know what i will try this you're going to try it do you like drink this
in lieu of a meal three times a day so you just stopped eating hey deliveroo man do you know what
actually it's crazy because that is that has been a pretty exciting yeah no well i i think i i had delivery
this no i did i had delivery this morning okay in fact the wrap the package is over there so i got at 7 30 this morning
and then when i'm busy throughout the day where i'll and i'm moving this but you enjoy
food you enjoy yes okay but i know we'll never give up hard food try it let me know all
right so let's see here we got the whole bottle is 400 calories 32 carbs
20 grams of protein man let's try it out low fat gluten-free sawyer it's it's not nest quick okay it's
cool this actually tastes pretty good it is listen and it will leave you feeling energized and full
and honestly we get addicted around here so jack um who directs the podcast when we put in a
huel fridge downstairs he hadn't had it before tries one and now he actually lives off it
The name of the company at the start
if i drink this am i gonna want to eat food as well no okay no chance so so it's a good way
to like yes lose weight and all that kind of stuff yes oh no chance i wonder if i can buy this on delivery maybe
um you talk about the very early days of delivery one of the things that founders struggle with a lot and i did as well is
is the name of the company and i heard i was reading about that oh no yeah but i love this story because
i think it highlights how crappy some decisions are at the start i heard
you were going to call delivery something else yeah there were there were a few different um permutations
one was a food pony because i didn't read about that because i was thinking of these
animals and food i think one was um i think it was i'm trying to think
here it was like uh yeah it was food mule was was another one because
you know a mule's uh transports um food not so good right what about booze
food did you forget that one yeah i didn't think you'd mention it um so
the original idea for deliveroo even this is before 08 right
so you know you this so in new york you go out on a big night first of all
everything's open like really late right so you can actually go out past 11. if you get home at like five in the
morning you can still order something to eat like you can do that and what my experience in in london
was you go out late and you just can't actually eat anything and i just like couldn't understand that and so
initially the idea for delivery was something called the zo7 it's called booze food which you
know really allowed you to order food at like 3am when you really wanted it so that is actually true yeah it's funny
because when people look at successful founders there's this like weird assumption that all of the decisions you made were
right and that you're super smart and that you got everything right and it's not until you go back into those early moments and dig through some
of the thinking the marketing ideas you think [ __ ] hell this is someone that's actually
developed their thinking oh it's just iterating right yeah you know um but the boost food idea so there's
there's another funny part of that because when when delivered so boost food was a separate thing but then
when my buddy tried to liver for the first time he was like oh yeah this is great like
you've got busaba you've got rosso pomodoro you've got all these great restaurants in chelsea
but he's like really what you need to do is have a cheat code so when you're really drunk you can put in some cheat code and then it's like
Your co-founder
literally like all the bad stuff for you so that maybe we'll implement that at some point i don't know you chose to ignore him
that's pretty funny idea interesting um talking about co-founders another sort of integral part of success in business
how um how did things go with greg i i know that he's no longer in the business but he at some point he
departed yeah yeah no i mean look without greg the business wouldn't exist
right no no question about it i think um you know he's one of the smartest uh
hardest working people i know we grew up together he's one of my best friends we've been friends since we were 12.
um i think um for greg he he wouldn't move to the uk um ever
he just wouldn't do it never yeah i guess he didn't you know he's too american i don't know but no he he his wife was in a um she
was getting a remd degree in the u.s and so it was like hard for him to like come over here and ultimately you know at some point so
he built a um engineering team in chicago where he was living but at some point i was like no this
this business real like we gotta we gotta have the team all together and so you know made a decision and he
he he left a business in late 15 early 16 or so um but i mean i have a great
relationship with him we were just chatting last night but yeah founders go through hell together yeah
yeah i mean my founder co-founder did yeah we went we went through a lot but you know it
was tough when he left right because i didn't have um there's not someone i can talk to on that same level right
yeah you've got your you know your your southern sort of other execs and you've got you know a board of directors
but it's different it's it's really different than having that did that hurt you when he left
did it hurt me yeah a bit right because i was kind of like kind of wanted to build this thing you
know with him but i also wasn't willing to just have half of the company be based in the
states i just didn't think that was the right thing to do for the business right um yeah and i think it was um
yeah you know it was uh yeah it was tough right it was tough do you think that situation
could have been handled differently in hindsight i think i think maybe i
could have convinced him a little bit more to to move out here i just think because he wasn't here
he didn't actually understand the momentum of the business but he didn't see all the stuff on the ground for him it was an abs
it was an abstract idea i mean you can see the metrics you can see all that but that's really different than seeing a bunch of you know delivery
riders the backpack on and sort of people talking about it in the uk right
but i mean look i i think i think would have been great if he if he stuck around but i also think that you know people make
certain decisions and he he decided to prioritize an another thing which is you know totally totally fine i find
that really interesting as well and the reason i asked that question about do you think it could have been resolved differently is because the world is very much changed now because of covid
and we have distributed teams all around the world in startups now yeah and this was pre way pre-coverage 2015
before zoom probably even you know had taken off so just i just wonder if now in the world we live
in now a relationship where the tech team is remote could have i i think i i do think and by the way
much of our tech team today is remote but the difference is we still have a very big core of people
that kind of have seen the journey up front and center and so when you layer on top of that remote people i
think that works really well i think to have a product team and a technology team that literally never uses the product because
they're in the states is a really problematic in my mind because ours is not a just a pure
digital product right we're we're a digital and a physical product a relationships business
that's what it is right and so it's it's different than you know something that's purely your experience in chicago and london is
What were some of your hardest challenges?
the same on certain types of businesses for us it's very different true very true talking about going
through hell with founders and co-founders and just generally the hell of starting startups um one of the real reasons i
founded this podcast was because and it's kind of clued in the name is because i didn't feel like the full journey of a founder is ever really told
specifically the hard parts um and i i know that in your journey to build
the business you did you've confronted all kinds of awful challenges yeah right talk to me
about some of those awful challenges especially at the start it doesn't get easier i'll tell you that
right so i mean the business is really you know significantly sized business now but i wouldn't say it gets
easier they're just different right so you're one i would say the big challenge is no money you know me and greg running
around right um i think my biggest challenge was at some point so i think i was lucky
in the sense the business momentum sort of did take it wasn't like super it wasn't like this but
there were new customers and we we knew this thing was working but i didn't know how big it was it
would be and at some point because i was delivering food every single night right and at some point i remember my my
flatmate he went to business school with me faris and he he kind of looks at me and he's a good friend of mine right he
says he's like what are you doing and i'm like what do you mean he's like you just deliver food for five hours every night
that's like what you do and i'm like yeah because i gotta who else is gonna do it and he was just like
he kind of looked at me and just like all right you know and then i kind of like because because i you know
i worked in these jobs that you can you know make a lot of money before i i had this summer internship at wharton
that was like the one everyone wanted and i just decided to do something else and um no
he was kind of like he thought i was like losing my mind right and then i thought of it because i'm not a very
like i don't even think i'm that introspective to be honest so i don't i'm kind of like i got stuff to do i'm
gonna like do it and so he was like hey man you should like think about what you're doing right and i did
and i was kind of like freaking out a bit just like sitting in my in my small room like what am i doing right am i where is this
gonna go and then i just was like you know [ __ ] it like i think this is going great so i'm gonna i'm gonna stick
to it so that was hard um i would say um did you come close to quitting at that stage no i never did
really never greg did though yeah greg did i never did i'm not like i just
i just wouldn't you know i wouldn't let that happen why i don't know man they just i just feel
like i have such responsibility to the people i i work with the restaurants and the
writers and i don't know you just start like i'll tell you what i'm not i'm not one of
these people you know you read about bezos like hey i'm going to start with books books are easy to transport i'm going to move on
and all these other things it's grand plan in their mind not like that at all but what i did see was i saw success
that fuels more ambition you get into the circular path and so i was i was on it like that and i just
also have this just immense sense of responsibility to people right similar to that story you told
about your friend there i read that you one day knocked on a door to deliver some food and it was one of your former colleagues from yeah from a hedge
fund yeah yeah i find this fascinating because people don't often talk about embarrassment
as being one of the real key barrier to entries to start businesses and to pursue your
your dreams yeah but it's such a tough barrier like humiliation and embarrassment and
that look i remember that look fondly of the people i was living with when i was 18 19 and you tell them what you're
doing and that kind of like smirky like oh okay yeah that happened i also i mean that
story yeah so it's john luca and um really nice guy but
so i'd worked with him probably five years before and he hadn't seen me in like five years and so he he ordered something i
didn't know it'd be him and i deliver this pizza to him and i got my my scooter helmet on
and he's like i'll do his accent it's pretty strong he goes will is that you are you okay he's italian
right he's from naples and i'm like i'm like who the [ __ ] is this i'm like oh it's john luke i'm like
hey uh i'm like hey john luca and he's like is that anything okay you know he's like he just thought i like
lost my mind um so because he didn't really understand that i started the business he oh i just i think he thought i was you
know just delivering pizzas right and i'm like well yes i am delivering pizzas but i also that is part of the
job but you know i also started this business and he just thought it was totally nuts yeah
a lot of my friends did in the beginning though that first year a lot of them did i mean they were supportive but you know i knew what they were kind of
saying behind my back a little bit too you know not not in a terrible way just like out
of concern why didn't you care too busy
too busy man i generally don't care i generally don't care what other people think if i'm honest with you my whole
life never really have i don't know why but a bit of a superpower isn't it
i don't know could be a good thing could be a bad thing don't know just don't really care that much it's definitely a good thing it's
definitely a good thing especially as it relates to your personal happiness but also pursuing your your um your goals and ambitions because
as we say embarrassment and and because public scrutiny seems to be one of the biggest barriers to starting and continuing
so when you get past that initial stage what are the next big challenges um so post year one business starts
getting some traction maybe business starts getting traction um that part's real exciting right you
know you raise your first amount of money that's like super exciting it's like wow someone someone gave
i think with us it was index ventures gave us 2.7 million pounds which now you're like that's like the
smallest seed thing that ever do but but i was like wow like we've got you know this these really smart guys that want to
invest in the business um and now it's about like how do we scale this thing and so it was hard but it was a lot of
fun right but i didn't know how to like hire anyone i'd worked in finance and i worked at hedge fund
sat in front of a bloomberg machine right so i'm just on gumtree that's how i hired and
actually the people people that that work at delivery now they don't they always tell me that's not true but it's 100
true i hired the initial people from gumtree and i was just like writing like random
like job descriptions and we ended up um getting an office
by office i mean probably the size of this room i would say no windows no heating it's definitely
illegal it was on cleveland street 121d cleveland street and um
we we found these like tables and chairs in the car park beneath it found a sofa on the street just set it
up it was a thousand pounds a month and we got going right but i loved that part that was so much fun
um so i'd say in the like the first two were super hard i would say years two and three
and four were hard but like exciting because you're expanding the business you don't really know what you're doing you're
kind of figuring it out as you go along right so i love that part your favorite
part yeah i'd say my favorite part is definitely when the company's like 20 to 100 people yeah look i'm the i'm
i'm the ceo of a large publicly traded company now right it's not gonna be as fun let's be honest
like and i'm happy to say that on the record yeah like everyone does everyone talks about the sub hundred
um because you know why because everyone's on the same page yeah you don't need to be deliberate about
communications you don't need to be deliberate about how all the pieces fit together
everyone just kind of knows and obviously to scale a company and do that in a high quality way you need to
figure out the systems to do that so that when you have 3 000 people it's similar to when you have a hundred but
when you have 100 i think it's the best you know everybody's name and oh everyone's name you guys are all
sort of kind of friends you you know you go to the pub together you know that's fun when did you
consider yourself to be an entrepreneur
ah i don't know i don't know if i ever thought about it like that was there
even after you raised that money did you did you think i'm a businessman
i always thought about i wanted to build an online food company that's how i always thought about it so
whether it's business or entrepreneur i don't know i don't know what the title means but you know it's funny because there's i'm not
obsessed with the idea of building a business i'm obsessed with the business i'm building so many people have it the other way
around i think so and it's almost become quite i know sexy
and instagramable to be like be your own boss i'm ceo [ __ ] like do you know all that stuff like and i think
that and again i just bet against those people that are building for the sake of status not for the sake of value right
solving a problem yeah solve a problem so so intriguing that seems to be a really similar pattern with the people that sit here
that have built great businesses they didn't they had no interest in being an entrepreneur they just got sucked into a problem they thought they could solve
yeah to me that's got to be the way now obviously there's going to be a lot of different people
different approaches but for me absolutely that's got to be the way so in that early stage when you just got that office and there's you know
Your mental health journey
a couple of you in that room things are tough right you're talking about you know you're burning cash
all startups especially tech ones tend to be burning cash yeah um what was your mental health journey
from that point till now look i'd say this um i don't know about other people i i don't think i'm a very
up and down person uh so i guess that's probably a good thing but i'm not
totally sure could mean i'm just suppressing a lot of stuff i don't really know right but um i don't have like these enormous
ups where i'm like going around jumping up and down and i'm not going bananas when things
are you know kind of going back that that being said some of my former colleagues in the early days might disagree with me
i would absolutely go nuts when i thought an order was handled and appropriately or customer service
interaction was um handled inappropriately i think some people probably they can have some memories of that but
i kind of got over that and don't don't really do that anymore but i would say a lot of the journey
is super super super hard i'm happy to talk about any of those stories with you but there's definitely been
long periods of time not just like for hours like long periods of time we're just like
man this is this has to get easier or like you know you're just i forget it was
elon musk or whoever talks about it the standing on the abyss thing you know you know chewing glass i felt
that like many many many times right that's hard
it's really hard if you'd known it would be that hard would you have started
thinking about your toughest moments if you'd known you would have had to go through that that chewing glass
staring into the abyss would you have started delivering um if on the day where you thought i'm
gonna start delivery today i'd come and i'd shown you a tape of those moments yeah but i guess it's a little hard to
say because if you told me hey business would be where it is today would i have started it probably yes
you told me it wouldn't work out and i'd be having chewing glass for like years then probably not right
it all it all depends but it it's like hard to it completely different degree because as
the founder you think about it every single hour you think about it you know when you're in bed
you know when you're when you're talking to a friend you're it's in you can't escape it right you touched your head there when
you said you can't escape it that's where it is right that's where it lives it lives in your head at all times at all times you can't escape talk me
through the specific details of those moments though one example of an issue so so one of
them was we were um so so back in 2017 holy [ __ ] i guess four years ago now
yeah we were um you know we'd raised a bunch of money from our kind of investors so that was index
accel green oaks dst you know businesses sort of flying um
and then um we were going to raise money from you know the world's biggest fund right
i'm not going to name who they are but you can probably guess who they are at some point right um
so anyway so we were we're about to do that um we just term sheets signed doing due
diligence summer of 17 and um you know big round and um
all of a sudden i get a call like oh we three days before we're supposed to close oh we can't do this
no blah blah blah reason i think it was related to wework it was
it was related to uber i think okay or something like that right i don't remember exactly the specifics but it doesn't really matter the point is
we're about to get all this money in the company and then suddenly it was just gone right a big number
big number and i was like holy [ __ ] you know what do we do so how big was
this number it's like 600 million something like that it's a lot of money right
700 maybe i don't even remember it's a bad day but then we um and i was like kind of pissed off
for like 10 minutes but i got the team together i'm like guys we got a lot of work to do over the
next you know month six weeks so we lined up like 25 investor meetings all around the
world and we just went we met with all these other funds
and we got it done but that was that was really really tough right again because if we didn't get we didn't
get the money because we're lost making entity right we were running out of money right so that part was not
fun that was a tough one but it was great we ended up you know working with um you know fidelity and t rowe price so we
One of my hardest moments in Delieveroo
got in terrific investors so at the end of the day you look back on it it was like oh that's a
actually a really good outcome but at the time it was really hard but that is so synonymous and typical
with building a business just that unix i mean this year's i mean covert 19 was an example of that just
unexpected unpredictable unanticipated crippling [ __ ]
at any time and this is why i find it almost impossible for founders not to live with some form of anxiety because
you know when you wake up on any day there's a high probability you're going to get a text message or an
email that something you didn't think about has just totally gone well i'll tell you i'll tell you a story
about covet actually it actually predates covet a bit so we raised the next round of capital
um so um from amazon which you you probably know yes the way this happened though was was
really crazy so we had um spent a bunch of time um with
amazon they decided to invest you know we negotiated the deal
all normal and they were great and we the due diligence process i was like wow these guys
really know what they're doing right so it's really it was really great so we announced the deal and again you
know we're loss making so we need the money right and again this is a big round and the um
the cma the antitrust authorities in in the uk they're just like we need
to review this but they wouldn't actually let us take the money in
right and we're like but how are we supposed to compete when we compete against the likes of uber and
justine you know that are well funded they're kind of like it's not really our problem you know we're like well
you know we're a british company trying to build you know big tech business here and so that whole process was
excruciating because it was 18 months long [ __ ] 16 16 months 18 months long where
amazon was a minority shareholder in our company i think a 13 stake 14 stake shareholder same as some
of the other like investors right they had one board seat everything was normal says and
you know these guys just literally kind of went after you know this um in an unprecedented way
but we couldn't get the capital in right so we're just going we're like what do we do and we're at the mercy
of some sort of you know institution right it's not like a free market type
of thing you can go and like find out you know we're at the mercy of this situation and so they took us through what they call
their phase one investigation which lasted like six months and then a phase two investigation lasts another
eight months so that was terrible right utterly terrible because you don't
actually have any idea what's going to happen because it's not it's not a logical process right it's sort of like you know
it's the whim of someone else right it's not it's not a logical process at the same time what started happening
was kovid kicked off in what jan feb of 2020 right so
we're running low on money because we couldn't get money in for whatever 14 months whatever it was
covet kicks off and covid what it did to us initially was our restaurant partners were shutting down for delivery
and dining not just dine in right and so the restaurants on the platform
started plummeting you know in europe and the uk now asia was different they handled it very differently
but we didn't our users were were disappearing because there were no restaurants left on the platform right i don't know what they
were doing i guess they're going to ocado or whatever and so we see this plummeting growth we
have to and we had to do the hardest thing i had to do the hardest thing i've ever had to do i had to lay off you know a significant number of
people at the company which just was the yeah it was the hardest thing i had to do you know like big layoffs because we we
just didn't know what the future was going to be like we were in the middle of an anti-trust process hoping to get a lot of money
in our business is plummeting that was really bad really bad i mean
the worst for people that lost their jobs obviously but really bad sleepless nights
i always sleep um but yeah the days are hard days you cite that moment as being the
toughest in your journey at delivery yeah i do i do just that whole
because it's it's not like a problem you or i could solve right if it's like hey you know we
didn't do this round i can go and raise more capital whatever we can go figure it out or
this feature doesn't work well the way we wanted to we can figure out a way to iterate around that there's an org structure issue well we
can figure that out but when you're at the whim of a government institution that's a very
different feeling that's a you're totally not in control and when it lasts for that long then the issue is
you're a tech company you can't not compete hard for 14 16 months right that's not
the world the way the world works it's not like a two grocery chains battling it out right it's just different
and so yeah i'd say that was hard it was compounded with the fact that we had to lay off all these people right
which is the hardest thing we could do now luckily for us these restaurants reestablish themselves and the business
has been on this amazing trajectory that was tough what goes into your thought process when
you realize you've got to lay off a significant amount of people you know that it has domino's effect
domino effects you know that it's going to be a press story all of these things you know that people are losing their jobs their livelihoods
at a time when they you know when they're going when when in a time when the the future is so uncertain
yeah what's going through my head like i mean just it's [ __ ] terrible right i don't
know what else to say you know but do we have to do it but it's terrible and getting up in front of the company
and explaining to people why this is the right thing to do really hard these are their friends
colleagues you know lost a lot of really great people you know it's definitely the hardest thing we've
ever had to do those are the days when it sucks busy right
look the job is like oh i'm so proud of what we built and i'm so excited about the future but like
it is a hard hard job and anyone that tells you otherwise is
either having an exceptional experience or or they're not being honest right i also think it's different when you're
the founder and the founder ceo right like i built the thing from an idea
right and it's a big thing and then i don't care about the press i care about like our employees right
i care about the restaurant partners the the riders the consumers did you have anxiety at
that point did you ever suffer with anxiety i mean i i certainly think so a must-have yeah
yeah for sure i i definitely had anxiety throughout that point running my business as well because we
face similar decisions and you're right the key word that you've used there which i resonated with
was uncertainty uncertainty because it's sort of like it's not in your control and you don't know how when you
i knew the cma i had to deal with them once in 2015. and it's not as you say no timelines we
when we didn't have a timeline when we were dealing with the cma yeah um we know that it's it's largely a
political yes um setting a presidency you know for us it was we were the biggest in our industry so
they were trying to establish a rule by using us as an example did you go through a phase one or what did you go through well i
was with the advertising standards association around disclosure of advertising and it was at a time when
influencer marketing it wasn't clear whether you had what you had to write on influencer marketing posts whether you
ad sponsored whatever i see right and so there was and the the rules and the guidelines
were as we were told by someone at the cma purposefully vague so that you could kind of you know interpret
and um they ended up using us as an example we had a case uh chundled on i think for nine months
for those nine months we're not sure whether they're going to shut us down find us slap on the wrist what's going
to happen it's tough but it's tough right because you don't know i don't know right so it takes a long time yeah that point
What do you do to relax?
around anxiety i think is um specifically interesting because um it's i think it's definitely increasing in
our generation because of social media and we all have more tabs open than ever before ceos are people that as you've alluded
to walk around with all the tabs open all the time what do you do to relax in moments like
that when you're in the middle of a the story i probably don't do a good job with that you know
i can put a pretty calm face on because i'm just not naturally like an up and down person
but you know i try breathing exercises you know i try to really kind of just
not think about anything sometimes i tried that calm app yeah i got through
day six of the 30 day challenge got got a little bored at day seven but
but um i used to read a lot i used to read a book a week i now at this point it's it's it's been
a while since i read a book which is makes me a little sad this is like my favorite thing to do
that does work or you just kind of go for a walk i go on long walks all the time
that really helps me out a lot i have some super exciting news to share with you all i have an amazing new sponsor for
the podcast which i'm very excited about called my energy like with all of the sponsors
on this podcast i've reached out to them because i truly believe in the transformative work that they're doing and that means that i can talk about
them from a place of real authenticity the company was co-founded by the brilliant jordan brompton
and lee sutton to give you guys a little bit of info my energy are one of the uk's fastest growing renewable energy
companies whose mission is to reduce our dependency on fossil fuels an issue that should be at the forefront
of all of our minds and it's been at the forefront of mine since i sold my range rover sport and traded it for an
electric bike my energy was founded in 2016 and since then their growth has been absolutely
bonkers from a team of just six in the uk to a workforce of over 200 across europe so throughout my
podcast going forward i'll be talking about some of their products and showing you how you can make that transition to a more green future
thank you so much for being a partner for this podcast my energy and it's our sponsors ultimately that allow us to scale things up and
bringing my energy on board is a signal that this podcast is going to get bigger the production's going to get better
Challenges of having a romantic relationship as a CEO
the guests are going to get bigger the stories are going to get more compelling and i couldn't be more excited to share all of that with you
could you could you talk to me about what it without going into specifics about people or whatever can you talk to me about the um
challenge of having and sustaining romantic relationships while you're also you've got this baby
and this obsession which is all concerning i think it's like yeah i think the brain is capable of
kind of filling itself up with certain things and then there's just not room for other things
yeah i mean that's how i think about it yeah i don't know if that's fair and you know some people would say that that
that i'm i'm certain that other people can can can can fill their brains up with more but
i'm like a very obsessive person right i don't know if you i'm the exact same that's why i asked the question because
i was hoping you might be able to tell me how to fix it i'm not the right guy to tell you all that so yeah i i've
struggled for that same reason just being very uncompromising with time and i hear compromise is an important
part to sustaining a healthy relationship i heard that too from all of my ex-girlfriends
but i don't know if like um yeah but i don't know if like it's also like
you know we do this because you know i don't know like we're hiding from something else or like you know
i don't know that's something i think about sometimes you think about that a little bit right like why am i so
obsessive but then i think back and i've always been obsessed about everything i don't really think it's changed but
when i started my career in business and i was obsessive looking myself in a room not really seeing my friends either i thought this is the
way to live life it's just about get rich get um successful and then everything
else happiness will arrive at that point like not it would not that i wasn't happy but just my happiness would it scale to
some point like euphoria so this is all it so you get successful you get some money and you realize that your happiness
probably for me i'm speaking for myself here doesn't necessarily scale it doesn't go down but doesn't
really move upwards that much and then i start reading about um the importance of meaningful
connections and relationships and all these things are watching this odd ted talk about how men in relationships over 100 years
study live longer are happier et cetera et cetera are more healthy and i think fact you know what i
actually think i've i've [ __ ] up i actually think maybe i should have attributed more time to relationships
but can you can you just be so intentional about everything i mean i don't know maybe we can i don't know
but you must you must understand the importance right according to like the science anyway of having
yeah yeah yeah but you know we make the decisions we do i
don't know you know it's all it's it there's a difference between an abstraction
and actually what happens right hmm but you because i i f worried that i might
regret it someday that i might have had my priorities wrong this whole [ __ ] time
you're a young man though does that ever cross your mind that you might have miss you might have put your priorities in the wrong place has it never crossed
your mind to be honest no really but i'm not a very retrospective person at all i literally
don't think about the past which may not be a good thing either good for certain things
not good for others what about friendships then through that through that you know chewing glass and staring into
the abyss how good were you at maintaining friendships and social
similar thing right it's like you have a limited amount of time and i'd say okay okay yeah you know
five out of ten probably five out of ten i wouldn't recommend probably it's a lonely job you know and
you're not gonna you don't want to like hang out with your friends and just talk about how tough your day is all
all the time either right so i don't know if you were the same way 100 awful friend my friends became the
people i worked with pretty much i had that i heard that but i think it's really important to separate that
yeah yeah but it's a solitary thing right you're a founder you know you just kind of especially
when greg kind of you know left the left and so you're just on your own and you got to figure stuff out
we make this sound kind of like terrible though i'm just like listen thing this is this is part of the reason why i wanted to do this podcast because
Delieveroo's IPO journey
i think there isn't uh there isn't this warning about the sacrifice it's all
oh my god look he's [ __ ] rich and he's got oh i'd love to and i think the balance is important
let me take you up until the the ipo so you do um company goes public um our company went
public via reverse merger things change it's tough um because you
now have the scrutiny of the public markets talk to me about that whole journey and how you found that
um yeah so i think the whole ipo process you know was it was a lot of work for
about kind of three four months before the ipo i think we were all kind
of looking forward to you know something you know really exciting um and it was
really exciting to take a company public you know um you know you know at a big market cap um
you know something coming from an idea obviously sort of the the day one you know trading was was
hard right because i'm not like i don't really like i said i don't really care that much about what
people think and i don't really read the media that much or anything like that but when it's that pervasive
you know it's like front page of every you know single newspaper you know telling you you know you guys
[ __ ] up or you did this yeah it was tough for a few weeks i'll be honest with you it was tough for a few weeks
you know because the market cap fell yeah and just like you know there's a lot of you know you you
people in the company oh look what's going on and you're on investor calls like what's going on
and ultimately the way i sort of think about it is you know so proud of the fact we got
here right i'm actually just focused on the business how do we grow the business how do we move the business in the right
strategic direction right and i'm super super super optimistic
about the future for all the stuff we've been doing for the past few years i'm going to come to fruition you know in the future and all
the future facing stuff we're working on now so if i'm very honest with you i don't think about the stock price i
I still do deliveries
actually think about the business but for a few weeks it was like
difficult right it's very hard and then there's all these stories we're
in which we talked about a little bit but all these stories written about drivers are they employees are they contractors
um the unique position you've got is you've actually been a rider and in fact you still are yeah i did i did you know five
deliveries last night you know notting hill and i talk to riders all the time i know
what they want we're building a business for our riders for our restaurant grocery partners for our consumers
that's their custom they're all customers at the end of the day that's how we think about it right so a model that actually works for
them has got to be the most important thing and we know our model can it improve
absolutely it can improve we can improve everything but do we think it's the best model for them yeah
100 your company's worth you know billions and billions and billions and billions and billions and billions and
you're out last night doing delivery riders yeah delivery deliveries around
nottingham why a few reasons one um i want i always test our rider app right so it's a good
way to do it secondly decent way to get some exercise and you're just on the road and you're
not thinking about anything else i actually find it very relaxing right and then thirdly i can actually
kind of see the restaurants in action too because the interaction is usually not with the consumer the consumer doesn't want to talk to you
but they just want their food i get it the restaurants you can learn a lot just by spending time there
when you shop at the restaurant to collect the pizza or whatever it is with chicken chow mein do they recognize you no no
one recognizes the writers recognize me sometimes but no one recognizes i'm not like a celebrity so have you ever had an experience where
like a restaurant was rude to you or like uh yeah last night really yeah i was pretty
pissed off about did you [ __ ] you're [ __ ] off the sidewalk no no no i don't say a word
but i i i make sure to log log into my notes really yeah how rude just like
well i was like hey i'm like hey i've been waiting for a while they're like they do this and i was like
shake behind you yeah i'm like come on and then then i got the food and it was like kind of cold i'm like hey like
you know just you know this food's kind of cold and they were like yeah just deliver it buddy and i'm like
at no point you told them you're this no i would never you're different from me no no
but i want the true experience right i want to understand what the writers go through it was
really funny as they were being rude to me there's other writers walked up to me he didn't know
where i was he was just like oh man you see these guys are at it again really yeah yeah and you take those learnings back
to 100 hq and you go we need to fix this yeah while we talk to those restaurants right are you going to speak to that
exact restaurant hundred percent i will and what would you say well
i waited around for a long time you clearly had made the food was just sitting around like we need better processes
we need to figure out a way to get this to work and please tell your staff to not you know be retweeted you know and i get it they're busy too
Your thinking around competition
like but you know it's uh just just smile say hey how you doing
it makes a big difference in people's days right what have you what's your thinking around competition you're in an incredibly competitive
field where you've got these absolute heavyweights yeah and you've had competition emerge and
disappear throughout your whole course of building this business and they've and all your competition seems to have had
10 times 100 times the capital that you've had oh i don't know we've had a lot of capital to be fair but i mean uber
yeah well they're there they always have a lot and rocket internet in the early days they launched in the uk yeah yeah what was that thing
they launched i forget the name but everyone else yeah food i don't know something yeah i think it was look i think competition exists because
this is such a big market right the it's 1.3 trillion
pounds in the 12 markets we operate in online penetration is you know call it three to five percent
it's early it's big market that's why there's a lot of competition i think look the way we think about the
competition is um you know of course we pay attention to
it i mean very closely but it's really about what is our consumer value proposition and is it
better than the competition is it growing on an absolute basis as well and we fanatically sort of measure that
um and we always think about you know what is the consumer the riot or the restaurant the grosser
of the future want before they even know right what is the answer to that question what is the future
well i think the future is i can't give away all my secrets the future is um look this this this
business is super underpenetrated on you look look at travel it's 50 right food is that low why is food
difficult well food's difficult because a it's perishable and b it's emotional
which means to express food online is hard you you go to a restaurant right
restaurant's a 75 gross margin business why low net margin but high growth what
because it's an experience right right it's an emotional experience but it's not just about the food it's
what was your relationship with the maitre d what was what did the core look like all these things right i know they're
amorphous how do you take that same feeling and put it online a really hard
thing to do so i think the future is going to be more and more food occasions online
they don't just have to be delivery though they could be dine in they could be a whole host of other things private chefs could could be that could
be you know cool recipe kits could you know a lot of different things right but how do you marry that
with the emotional aspect of this brilliant food industry right
and no one does it we don't do it well today you look on our app it's pretty transactional you look at ubers you look at you know any of these other
guys pretty transactional and i think the winner in this space
it's a winner i don't know that's that's maybe a poor word but but whoever does really really well in the space is going to
nail that emotional side right the restaurant generated content the fmcg generated content the grocery
generated content we collect millions and millions of reviews each week on our platform
we don't do anything with that great today in my view so how do you marry all that together
how do you migrate the experience from a transactional one to more of an emotional one right hmm
interesting this is emotional right here sorry okay oh you're gonna drink four of
these that's great for this one so we're gonna put that all over facebook ads
that's really interesting and so you're talking about creating greater depth from what i heard creating greater depth with that social and
emotional interaction with food within the food is social food is emotional right yeah at the core so delivery is becoming a
social network for food but i think having aspects of that yeah
right we want to be an app you go to not just when you're hungry but when you want to learn about food as well
right i hear you because like a chef tells his story in a physical space how do you let that chef tell his
or her story online and how does that help you make decisions as to what you want to
purchase right i think that's amazing and it's really different than buying like toilet paper on amazon right or
buying like which is transactional right it's more transactional now the reason you use amazon is the best most reliable service in the
world but i think with food i think it's a little bit different you need that reliability but you also need that emotional connection
Money
wow yeah so that's what we're we're spending a lot of time on trying to figure out so as you look so i guess no i've got
two questions so my next one is about money a lot is written when founders go public about how much money they've made
bonuses blah blah um i mean elon musk is a great example the amount they've written about him i
think it caused him to sell all of his properties and his house in pretty much all of his possessions and he now lives a lot of the time when
he's on a spacex in this little small shed but he said in the interviews he did that because the money is so secondary to him he just
wanted to disarm people from thinking about that and then obviously when he became the richest man in the world
again he is hitting with all the billionaires or evil stuff what relationship do you have with money
and what does it mean to you in your life oh man um
i don't know i never really thought about it uh [Music] i mean i don't really live very
differently than i did you know seven or eight years ago so kind of live in the same place
i mean i'd rather more money than less money probably agree to be honest um but uh did it make you
happier i don't know i don't haven't really thought about it i i
i'm sure there's some i'm sure having more at some point will make you a bit happier mm-hmm right i'm sure as you said
What are you aiming for?
there's probably a limit to that though right yeah but i'm not like i don't buy a lot
of stuff so i don't know like yeah i just don't buy a lot of stuff so
when you look forward into your future then what is it that you're aiming for and and why does that matter
[Music] look uh you know um
i think part of me would love to figure out myself um uh may sound kind of weird but
just when you start this thing you're on this journey and the journey sort of propels
it has a life of its own basically it's probably the best way to put it you start getting a lot of customers you
start getting a lot of riders start getting restaurants you get investors and and the things moving and you're moving
along with it in many cases in a very deliberate way in many cases
you're along for a journey and so this thing has a life of its own and
it it it it is pretty interesting to take a step back and think okay
is this journey completely everything that i had in mind and i wanted to do or were
there just a lot of parts of it that were it's like a wave kind of taking you along
and i'd love to figure that out a bit to be honest right i don't that makes
any sense yeah so what i heard was you're trying to understand if your own personal journey
is completely aligned with the journey of the company as as it grows because
the two entities you know especially i'm guessing at the very start they're so interlinked it's your life it's your everything but
at some point you have to kind of separate i think not necessarily i'm not saying resign anything but separate
your life and your ambitions from that because they're so intertwined and it becomes difficult i'm not even saying
separate necessarily but just like having a better understanding of what your role and what will wants
from his life and what he's interested in and yeah and i think i i wonder if other people feel that way i don't know
maybe you've asked that question i know how you feel everyone's that sits here that's a founder of a big business feels that way
because it's just all consuming yeah yeah tom sat there last week he said the same thing did he yeah he's
like he was he was he had a red phone in his bedroom he was he had from what he described he had very little life he mean he said his
relationships broke down french he said i think his friendships were okay um but he had this red phone
in his bed or bedroom that would ring when there was emergencies he was consumed by it he had a crushing weight every time he woke
up in the morning and so now that he's he's left he's now discovering
pottery and all of these other sort of personal things that he's doing just for
his own personal reasons which were probably impossibly hard to do when he was being dragged well i think yeah yeah i
think that's interesting yeah when you start something and it really becomes something it has a gravitational pull of its own
and the question is you know are you this thing or you in the orbit right yeah it's a little hard sometimes
to to to separate those two things so that's something i'd love to kind of understand how do you go about
understanding that i was going to ask you man you're the one that talks oh god a therapist probably and really
trying to i think you're just talking about it i think because even as far as i don't think we get much time to talk about these things no we're just being dragged by the
emails and the urgent that's what i mean so you have to create space right to i
think you have to i think and i think it will help with business as well right to take a step back to to remove
yourself and just like think about other stuff and when you step back in that's why i do think going on holiday
is really you know you know it's funny it's like i didn't take one for seven eight years
just didn't um which is like kind of stupid honestly but maybe in the first few years i could maybe that was fine
but just having the ability to step away for a week and do something totally different i
think is incredibly important you got any holidays planned for to to
do exactly that this whole travel thing is a bit problematic and if you were to go on holiday do you think you could you
could relax um it's hard it'll pre it takes me about three days
so i need to go on a holiday longer than four days yeah i think that's what i need to do yeah well listen um when you do figure
out those existential uh answers and you've you've had time to meditate
and go to the beach and uh figure out that's that point of separation that you describe
do come back on the podcast and we'll talk about that then because i'd love to know the answers um but i want to thank you for coming here today and having this conversation
with me thanks steven super fascinating thank you um and it's so it's so inspiring
and interesting how there's so many similarities with with founders that have gone on that journey doesn't seem like there's
many differences however the character that's gone on that journey always seems to be really really different and you are you
know remarkably unique so you hear the same things a oh yeah the like fundamentals of
the journey and what it does to you and how it feels is always the same but then the the differences and the
nuances are in the like the pilot yeah and how he addresses the and how he or she
feels about or addresses those that experience and that usually relates to
the younger years and where you developed your resilience or your perspective on the world um but yeah super fascinating super
inspiring thank you so much for coming today thank you now you're a very very busy guy thank you for the huel
it was delicious i'm not even gonna have to plug it you've done it all for me you've done my job thank you just trying to make it easier you're
right you've made it really easy thanks thank you appreciate it appreciate you thank you
[Music]
you

Transcription:

Intro
feel like i'm struggling to breathe it blew my [ __ ] mind i don't know who's dick i've gotta suck they get [ __ ] respect around here
true geordie went through incredible adversity to get to where he is today depression anxiety and he's one of the
few people that's willing to tell you about it the ego was just going [ __ ] crazy i'm the man all the worst
parts of me amplified it was it was better than a drug it was better than anything it was like wow i would have carried on
doing that probably if i hadn't have had a moment of like boom it just felt like everything i've been
building who had been like really like [ __ ] up i know i needed
humbled but it was brutal i literally wanted to kill myself like you know i really
really did when you love someone more than anything else in this world
that matters more than anything and where others would have capitalized on a sub story she was far too precious for me to
share she was mine she wasn't there for anyone else was just my mom and i miss
her every [ __ ] day bro but once you give it there's no taking it back the day i
don't need money anymore that's going to be a scary day for the rest of the internet i don't i don't
want to let the fans down and i don't want to stop doing what they love me for but
true geordi brian he's one of the real pioneers in the youtube space he runs one of the biggest football shows the
biggest podcast the biggest boxing shows and much much more but he is at heart
not the guy you see on screen he is a gentle giant one born in a council estate who went
through incredible adversity to get to where he is today billions of views his conversations seem to sway cultural
conversation but he's still not getting what he deserves in his opinion
and in mine when you see true geordie what you see is this big six foot five guy with tattoos and huge
muscles but when you peel the layers back you find the total opposite you find a small kid in
there one that's still living in the council estate in his mind and one that's missing his mother after
her tragic death a few years ago he's been to rock bottom depression
anxiety suicidal ideation and he's one of the few people that's willing to tell you about it
and tell you about it with full honesty and vulnerability i've known brian a long time and i've been so fascinated by him because he
appears to be this contradiction he appears to be someone that does not give a f but at the same time he's incredibly
incredibly sensitive to me he's the ultimate reminder that we are all a contradiction
and that you should never judge a book by its cover what you're going to hear today is some stories that brian has
never told stories that will move you some that might move you to tears but also stories that will inspire you
and teach you some important life lessons about what it really is to be a human being scars and all without further ado i'm
stephen bartlett and this is the direva ceo i hope nobody's listening but if you are then please keep this to
yourself
how would you define and describe the rise of true geordie and when i say that i'm talking about
Your early years
take me to the early days okay the stuff that made you who you are today um
i'm an opportunistic person i i when i see a tiny little like thing i just blow
it open straight away so like uh the first um thing that happened to me was
i made a random run about a footballer that went viral didn't really do youtube at all
just boom and then loads of people seeing it in the northeast it was like
this crazy son of a [ __ ] because no one really did stuff like that then i was one of
the first guys to do a football run i want to go back further what really yeah what further
in how well i want to know the the the insecure kid on the council estate all right okay
um kind of sensitive inside but had to act sort of tough because if you didn't
you would be [ __ ] up like you know on the estate like like my shed once got burned down like
set on fire just by some kids just cause it was a shed and it was there you know like you had
to carry yourself in a certain way because all of our dads were in prison all of our dads
like it was like weird you know what i mean so we were sort of raising each other and like i was like a milk kid at school
just because i could like drink extra milk and that it like dinner time and stuff
and i was smart obviously i'm a smart guy but like i was looked upon as like a nightmare
like my when i was 10 years old my teacher told my mother a parent's evening she went you can just tell when some of
them are destined for prison can't you but like she worded it like that you know what i mean and my mom's like i
know exactly what you're saying but like it was because i hated her she didn't understand me to get me she talked down
to me so being talked down to that really pisses me off even at a ten-year-old age
like i didn't like that you can win me over and i'll be i'll be brilliant for you but just respect this
ask me don't tell me you know like even and i know that's like a naive way to look at the world but i was 10 and i
just had a chip on my shoulder and um yeah didn't like authority
um and but i always was quite like a little bit competitive uh i
remember like there was a couple of kids like just little random memories i have of like i was fighting all the time but like i
remember i always thought of myself as one of the smarter lads and there was this thing about like some sort of school day
where they selected like the brightest boys and the brightest girls and i wasn't selected my mom were thinking
i'm smarter than them you know like but i couldn't prove it or whatever or i
don't know i was i was in detention a lot i got thrown out of school multiple times
once for pissing on the uh the school teacher's lounge window and telling the [ __ ] off when i was eight years
old one for fighting uh just just white like rebellious you know but
like but with a brain and i just needed to like find something uh what caused you to be that rebellious
eight-year-old kid i think it's genetic a little bit my dad was a rebellious man very much so my mom not at all my mom
loving caring kind mother teresa my dad uh like a punk
rocker who wanted it he like he did mad [ __ ] when he was at school like he took the whole school on
strike once just because he didn't like the teacher and like he was known for like he was thrown out of schools for like beating teachers up
and stuff like that because when he was like 14 violence was his life you know what i mean do you actually think it's genetic
i think that um yeah i think i think part of what makes
me aggressive is my genetic yeah because even the look i get on my face when i'm about to fight
is identical to the look my dad gets like it's that that switch you know what i mean so
i'm lucky that i've got it diluted with the kindness of my mother and i finally managed to channel the
aggression into later on in life into like focus and drive into the good stuff you
know what i mean by the time i didn't i was overwhelmed with whatever the [ __ ] was going on in my head i didn't really
know what the hell it was i had joe wick sat here you know the body coach guy and he um he told me about his mum and his dad and
his mum was very very caring and compassionate and his dad would punch dole um holes in the door yeah every day and
you know was violent and abusive and joe wicks has come out as
really really compassionate and kind i don't know if you know him personally but no even you know during
the during the lockdown people saw him doing pee with joe and dancing and doing his room and stuff was that the the guy
yeah popular for the pa stuff yeah but he was he was crying and he was he was ups
deeply upset that there was a lockdown because it would hurt other people one of the most compassionate people i've ever had met and his dad was
from his account very very um aggressive so i've always wondered about these generational cycles
whether it's you know i think it's different for different people i personally i believe that there's a
cocktail in me that's a real weird mixture of a self-obsessed
arrogant showman who was my dad bodybuilder hard man went to prison fighter
and then a woman who worked like looking after people very caring compassionate loving
charitable generous you know all the good things and i'm not saying my dad can't be good in any way but it was just to a very
polar opposite people and for me i i see that come out in me
and there's and there's there i believe in both genetic and uh like the sociology side of it as well
even any brothers or sisters i've got a half sister from my dad's side yeah do you think it makes a difference
being an only child of sorts uh yeah yeah definitely me and lawrence have had a few
conversations he's an only child too um and i think it does make you just live
in your own head a little bit you know and it makes you like i have times where if i spend too much time
around people i'm like i need a [ __ ] break from this like i want to be on my own and just listen to music for a bit
i heard you say this thing um i heard you say that people who live in their own heads and think the most i struggle the most
they're they're the ones who are more susceptible to depression i would say yeah do you want to come in and watch this
podcast live from behind the scenes if you do all you have to do is hit the subscribe button and now that the world
The rise of True Geordie
has opened up you'll be behind the scenes as many of our subscribers have been i can't wait to meet you
so take me through the rise so we i know every it's well documented how you became to be a youtuber yeah apologies i'm just used to rehearsal
yeah i know yeah and i i don't you're the same yeah you you tell the story a lot that he just rolls up and it loses its
emotion because i've said it that many times but yeah so you you rose as a youtuber i want to get to the point where we you know money starts
coming in because for me 23 24 years old when money started coming in
i was going to every night club in the weekend and getting five bottles of don perry on and i was trying to fill some kind of
gap in me and from what i saw in your videos you did a similar following i'd had a bit of money before youtube
because i was working offshore on the oil rigs doing a dfc diving so that was good money i was earning about ten thousand
pound a month doing that and that was a bit of a wild lifestyle because i was young i was working class
i was surrounded by men who were military men who wanted to go out beat men up and [ __ ] women and take
drugs and and get drunk you know so i was surrounded they were my male role models like you know so it was a crazy
lifestyle that so that was kind of partly me getting raised by these [ __ ] men around me
and then obviously um when i found youtube it was like a rebirth of like
oh um like i went in it's a long story but i went into a bit
of depression coming out of diving and not knowing what the [ __ ] i wanted to do with my life because i didn't know like
i knew i didn't want to be a diver anymore i knew i was done with that and when i found youtube it felt like a
little uh window of hope and then obviously that took off and once i
i started getting money yeah it was like okay i've i made it because i i basically gave up
on money i chose youtube as a path to happiness that was the idea was
give up the money forget that you're not happy doing that job i'd rather make minimum wage doing videos
than make six figures doing diving so i went on that path and then i it
dawned on me oh i'm gonna make more money doing this actually once once i was in the thousands a month it was a bit
of a oh [ __ ] like okay how do i handle this and i thought i had
a good handle on it like it was little stuff at first new car move move house
better place and all that and then once i came to london that was when it really went tits up to be honest with you i
just started spending money like crazy i bought three new cars in the space of
about 18 months um not all together one after the other sort of thing but like
um i was able to get things that i never dreamt possible and that was the moment
of like oh i can have this like my favorite car ever wow uh bought an audi r8 first that went
fast nice nice blue audio beautiful then i swapped that for a mclaren
uh which they had the convertible the roof come down i thought i was the dog's bollocks and that especially a guy like me like what the
[ __ ] am i doing in a mclaren you know it'll look ridiculous yeah yeah cause i'm so huge and then i swapped that for a bentley
um gt sixly um the continental um white leather interior oh gorgeous
all black wheels black everything else black and white there's this bit we
talked about when you leave diving and you kind of lose your orientation and that gives you minor depression which
seems to be so common in people when they they lose their purpose and i mean i had
tom bloomfield's out here as well it was very similar they lose their sense of purpose in life their direction they feel that
disorientation they feel the depression then you went after something that you thought would give you like intrinsic internal joy
and then it becomes a career and i read this study which i found fascinating that in um in in psychology if they give
someone a game that they enjoy and they play it they enjoy it and then if they then give them the same
game and pay them to do it they lose joy so when you start paying someone to do something that they
once did for the sheer fun of it they lose the fulfillment they're getting from it i've seen it in boxing
and stuff like that a lot like the passion goes once it becomes monetary and
obligatory you have to do it it's not i'm getting up and doing this passion now and but
i've never lost the passion for video making that's still there i love it um but um yeah i lost my way like
this whole thing of doing something for the right reasons
because i'd never experienced a kind of money before i i remember like driving that audi the
first one the audi r8 when i drove that off the parking lot that was a moment of like what the [ __ ]
like it just blew my mind you know what i mean the fact that i was able to drive a car with um
it was worth a hundred thousand pound and i paid for it in cash you didn't really boom yeah i was like
and uh and i remember just driving it and it was it honestly i don't regret it because
even though it was a complete waste of [ __ ] money and i wasted even more money swapping it for the other two cars
it was a real healthy lesson to learn and get out my system but it was like a drug you know it was
it was better than a drug it was better than anything it was like wow this is like for me i don't know
what it is about fast cars and they look nice and the way you feel when you're in just makes you feel like a [ __ ] movie
star or something you know um especially coming from a place where people
set fire at your shed because there was a shed you know like nobody had a nice car where i came
from you know it wasn't people didn't even have like a mercedes or bmw
let alone a supercar so that was mind-blowing you know what i mean and they just it was too much for us just was
and a lot a lot my ego was just going [ __ ] crazy you know what i mean like i'm the man
you know all the worst parts of me just amplified there's there must be a reason why you got you traded it in so many times
though right i was addicted to that feeling the new the new [ __ ] that that was the oh but but what if oh
and then i seen the mclaren i remember driving it into the [ __ ] this super car place
i looked at the mclaren i looked back at me already i was like i don't really and then i just kept looking at the camera it's new that's the new [ __ ] the new
hotness i know you know it's ridiculous just absolutely idiotic never ends yeah i would have carried on
i would have carried on doing that probably if i hadn't have had a moment of like
that boom you know what i mean what are you doing mate you know health
health life's good at that give you a good slap around the head when you need it and i really needed it
you know what i mean because everything that a man does when he's from nothing like all these rappers you know i was
doing the same thing like spunk money up the wall buy pointless jewelry clothes [ __ ] like that treating people the
wrong way treating myself the wrong way not looking after myself or piled away or i think i just skipped like the good
The fall of True Geordie
years to elvis at the end do you know what i mean like i just went full throttle um so yeah you said
boom oh yeah yeah so i had a bit of a moment where everything was just you
know came crashing down there was um a lot of people know there was the dms but also in the same week
there was the um the loss of a huge deal
um which for anybody that doesn't know the dms some somebody leaked some dm's yeah yeah somebody had sexual dms that
were out there um and uh me being the crazy wild bastard that i was at that moment
you know drinking a lot just doing all sorts just [ __ ] lost my way and then in the same week i
also had a deal that was on the table that was pretty much negotiated done
sign seal delivered which would have secured my financial future for the next two
years with a huge company big betting company multi-million pound deal
it wasn't it wasn't just one you know what i mean it was the deal um and they had hired a new guy who
thought he knew better than the last guy um and he i think he just like didn't like
me he also i think it was partly like you don't want to carry on the work of the guy who used to have
your job so he he was trying to find any reason he could to um
you know [ __ ] it up and you know he did what he did we got to a point where i was like
are you going to do the deal or not me like and there was um i can't go with the specifics because i agreed to like keep it
you know respectful like but there were some things asked of me which were just outrageous and um we we couldn't move on
basically and i'm i'm very glad i didn't because otherwise everything i now have
it might it might not have ended up that way do you know what i mean when you're put in a position where do
you want to do you want to keep your ownership of things or or not you know what i mean so
but yeah that was a devastating blow and then obviously having people laughing at you for sexual dms
and stuff when you know it was i was drunk as [ __ ] at the time and it was just a stupid moment
but regardless you know knowing that there's just such little compassion out there for you when you're having a
awful time it really it it took me i got from as high as i was it took us
as low as possible in that moment of like no one cares everything you've worked hard for you
now don't have i'd literally agree the tenancy agreement on my flat
for two years on the basis that this was all going to be saying so i'm like what the [ __ ] do i do now
you know what i mean so and then i was hit with a tax bill that
was way more than i could handle as well because in my head it's like got the cash come in and got the tax
bill paid off and don't worry about it so everything that could go wrong went
wrong and um you know i know i needed humbled but it was brutal that was and i know it
might sound to some people like out there like oh uh or poor pitiful you know
white boy problems and [ __ ] like that but it i literally wanted to kill myself like
you know i really really did because it it was just too much even for me like
and i'm a pretty tough person it was just it was awful like the level of abuse and
ridicule i got online and and the financial mess i was in it just felt like everything i'd been
building had been like really like [ __ ] up and uh
yeah it was even just talking about now it's hard to to say do you know what i mean because it was bad it was awful um so that left me
in a really really low place the people online would have had no idea
because i i remember watching that play out from afar and it was just online it was just kind
of jokes and well what you have to remember is they didn't know i'd lost a multi-million pound deal yes they didn't know i had a six-figure
tax bill to pay yes so that's happening behind the scenes and that happened before yeah before the
dm so then the dms happened as well the icing on the cake was the dms right if it was just one or the other
you could say maybe but when you're financially [ __ ] and you're also trending on twitter
being called i'm not even going to say the words but you know the things people say about gay
people that aren't to hurt them the things people you know you should go and do this you should you know and
people love to kick people on the way down but what they especially love and this is the difference is if you're a vulnerable person publicly
you're seen to be i don't know let let's say you're you're
seen to be in some sort of subculture that people view in a way that's like oh poor them i hope
they're all right i'm a big strong alpha male i look tough i
look like i can handle all the ridicule in the world um brush cockney you're like you know
so they people probably didn't think you know like and also when you're a man
you don't get sympathy the way women get sympathy when they go through revenge porn or anything like that it's not looked upon the same and i just
had to sort of think about it and take and go yeah this isn't fair but life isn't fair
so what the [ __ ] do you expect brian like you know um so i drank a lot of whiskey
and smoked a lot of weed that week if i'm on a sweetie you know what's so funny i remember i remember seeing it trending
i thought i'd go on his brian's account and see what he said about it yeah nothing silence yeah yeah and that for me was
really surprising oh yeah yeah i think a lot of people thought that actually but
i even in the chaos i act quite cerebrally
i can be quite reptilian when i need to be to get myself out of a you see in diving for example in the
moment of panic in that moment of like i could [ __ ] die here i've been in those situations
if i don't act smart i'm in a [ __ ] situation yeah
i gotta use i've gotta pull my knife i'll cut this rope do this dude i'm used to thinking like in that way
you know so i just thought i'm gonna i'm just gonna say nothing i'm gonna have it have a have a night to
think about this just just think about how i was i felt awful i was wrong but i knew i wasn't going to
give up but even though i wanted to kill myself i also thought that weirdly i think all the the [ __ ]
sort of it gave me something to resist do you know what i mean it give me because i'm a fighter in my heart so i was like nah
[ __ ] you um so um within a day i was like okay this is how
we're gonna do this i'm gonna get the two best piss take as i know and i'm gonna get them to rip the piss out of me
make everyone feel like it's over and done with now because the minute you acknowledge it laugh it off and show that you're not frightened
people will get bored move on to something else and they'll scratch the itch of saying because what they really
want me to do is self-destruct but if i show i'm brave they'll respect that and then move on
what they don't realize is i was pretty [ __ ] drunk during that whole episode really like i was it was we were
recording 11am i was on the whiskey like i had like [ __ ] two massive glasses full of whiskey straight
and then i was like right let's do this and like because i knew they were going to be brutal but i said you have to be you have to just say every worse thing
because then people leave me the [ __ ] alone and then i'll really get on with my depression then do you know what i mean so that's how i was like
kind of like sensible in planning out my own self-destruction
yeah it's very weird and i've spoken to other people about this when they've been in similar situations like when logan went through
his thing and he was like yeah see him i just uh drank a lot and smoked a lot that was
that was that was what we both did like you know so yeah so that after that happened i
then had to um okay where do we go from here then um
and i had a production company who were partnered with us at the time who agreed that they would carry the
cost to the kickoff while we were looking for another sponsor so that was very kind of them
shout out to pt knows who he is and um we don't get me wrong
those costs have to be paid back at some point so every show is x amount of money every single fee
you know and this is the thing that people forget i've probably got the biggest crew on youtube really so there's like 15 people every
show who need paid and every every single time we do a kickoff show that cost was building my my tax wasn't
going anywhere i needed a [ __ ] sponsor big time um so that was it was a bad time you know
what i mean a lot of pressure i think that was the thing pressure i felt it from every angle
you know how does how does that impact other areas of your life i've heard you talk about the impact it had on your
sleep which i think is something people don't think about enough because i think sleep is probably the foundation of your mood
how you make decisions and everything in between so uh probably um [Music]
i still haven't quite mastered that i think that's the thing that i think partly it's because when you
have your own business there's not enough hours in the day so you're always like late night being like what else can we
do what else can we do so i'm [ __ ] at sleeping and like as soon as i wake up by the time i've made the toilet for a piss i'm
thinking about what we need to do like so that's part of it um but yeah
i drank myself to sleep to a point where i was more collapsing rather than sleeping you know and uh it was awful
like i'm gonna play like just because these are the questions that come to mind you're drinking yourself to sleep but
you're a smart guy you know that that's not good oh yeah yeah but but at that point i cared more about
uh it was like almost like it was like a mathematical equation it's like what what is more important right now me
being like i didn't care about myself i just thought get through the days
because so my mom died right this is totally exciting um previously to that and i
remembered when i got through that i did a similar thing where i would just i drank myself
to sleep for about a month at least and i knew if i could just get a few weeks under my
belt no matter how i got through it it would be easier so i just had to get to that point
and i think i'm not recommending this by the way but few people will go
through the kind of week i went through so luckily it won't be necessary but sometimes
you've just got to put distance between you and the event and daylight will slowly become uh
seeable i'm not saying it was a good idea yeah yeah this is this is yeah it doesn't it
sounds like kind of look good on the movie yeah i can imagine yeah it for me because if those issues aren't ever
properly addressed then they kind of re-emerge or they say so i hear you but there's a time and a
place and right in the aftermath isn't always the best time to go and go
right let's let's figure out what went wrong here it was emotionally so distressing i just
thought i am gonna [ __ ] every every waking moment was they're all like the the whole thing the
finances the tweet that the all this [ __ ] i couldn't
i couldn't address it at that point i couldn't think about it at that point i couldn't work out what had gone wrong or all of that i just thought get a [ __ ]
sponsor keep doing the shows drink yourself to sleep if you have to just get a [ __ ] sponsor keep the money coming in because right
now without money you're you're [ __ ] so [ __ ] like i'm
homeless you know i mean like the amount of bills that were crewing up and the amount of money i had
i was going to end up like i was like i might end up [ __ ] wherever you know what i mean
like so it really wasn't about oh let's go and work through my problems it was like
let's put some [ __ ] money in the uh bank here was there one day through that period which you remember
as being the most agonizing one particular day every day every single day was just as
bad as it was like when my mom died that was what it reminded me of it was like i had died almost like
every day i'd wake up so when my mom died i remember when i'd wake up i'd go oh and it was that first moment when
your eyes went and you go oh it's real it actually happened and that's the moment where when when my
life had ended it was that moment of when i'd first wake up i'd go oh it's it's real it's
real and then i'd have to get up and face the day you know what i mean and just try and
block it out when i'd go outside i wore a cap i'd try everything i could to to hide who i was because i felt
ashamed that i was the dm guy or i used to think of myself as like
a great podcaster someone who had changed his life brought himself from and now i was like
being like shamed laughed at all of that [ __ ] so i just felt so like humiliated you know what i mean
i just didn't feel like me anymore when you said you woke up and you the first couple of seconds you thought it's
real yeah does that mean that your sleep was a place of peace a place of escapism uh
yeah yeah yeah i'm asking this question because tom bloomfield from monzo sat there and he talks about being anxious
and depressed for about two years and he said when i'd wake and he literally said he was here last week he said when i woke up
for two or three seconds i didn't know who i was or where i was those were the best and then he said it would just come crashing back down no
so the best time was when i was drunk before i went to sleep that was the point where i really
enjoyed it because i was like oh it's like i'm not even here you know what i mean so that was the
best time because then nothing felt i couldn't feel anything you know what i mean that was ideal that's why i kept going
back there every night but i wasn't an alcoholic or anything it was that feeling that i was chasing the
You Mother
i don't feel pain numbness yeah that was the good bit when your mother passed away you didn't
talk about it no no i mean youtube's a shitty place
isn't it it's a horror like as i found out the hard way you know so um and also she's just precious to me so
i uh i keep it to myself always um i keep hurting myself always i've only talked
about once online and that was the rebuild yeah and even in even in that video
which i watched twice um i still had no idea when it had when it happened yeah yeah because i was trying to
pinpoint if there was like a change in you or if it was during your youtube career at the height of your
youtube career before and and i thought it was you know for a guy that does really pour it out on the internet and i've seen you you
know when the logan paul incident happened i watched that video and you were pouring out your heart in a way that was
just remarkably vulnerable and that was just a secret yeah but it's like um
is that what i said earlier i can be quite cerebral when i have to be and i
can make decisions when i have to be pardon me for me own my own sake and
here's the thing when you love someone more than anything else in this world
that matters more than anything and where others would have capitalized on a sub story
she was far too precious for me to share with anyone you know it wasn't
about she was mine she wasn't there for anyone else was just my mom
you know what i mean and that's the way i planned to keep it you know i mean um i've i've explained
what she meant to us in that video and how much i love her i always will and i miss her every [ __ ] day bro but
um it's just one of those things where i think that myself certain things i
think you draw the line online you know you have to there has to be some stuff that's for you and even if
i say yeah my mom died and i loved her and she meant the world it was and i did try and give some ins and outs
of what my relationship was like with us so that people could feel how much feel the love you know what i mean
um i didn't want to give everything because
i don't know it's just too special for me to to give everything do you know what i mean like that and i think that's one thing that some creators
could do with learning as well is like what is how much value does something
has if you'll just share it with everyone and i do think you got to pick and choose
you know what i mean carefully because once you give it there's no taking it back and that's the problem isn't it you know
what i mean with youtube it's like once it's out there it's out there so in that video you say when you're you've i think you've just
been fighting with um is it vlad's dad oh with vidals
and you i mean you've looks like you've gone like 12 rounds with him or something and you fall over and you're back and you get emotional because and he says
you know that's what boxing does it brings all those emotions out yeah and you said a lie and you said i'm just a guy that misses his mum
have you ever processed that um yeah a lot a lot
uh i've truly faced i know everything like about me that's
good bad i really face up to my to everything in my life you know what i mean i know where i've gone wrong i know
i i really faced things head on and and with my mom i i faced it more than anything because
it was it was a constant in my it's like losing a parent if you're especially if
it's a it's an if you're an only child and there's only one parent it's um so severe because it's like i
try to describe it to someone it was like one day i went outside and the whole world was
full of water and people are swimming around in their scuba gear or whatever going but what everything's normal brian i'm like no no
you don't understand like like the constants in my life have been like the sun comes up in the morning i
breathe there you know the moon comes out at night my mom loves me those four things like oh this is reality
so to remove one of those components it blew my [ __ ] mind like that she couldn't be
here anymore i was like that doesn't make sense to me you know what i mean so i had to face it and i really have
processed it is and i think that's why i never felt the need to share it either because i was like you know i'm
at peace with with that as hard as it is it's just part of my life now and uh
and i and i feel like as uh people say things like this but i
feel like she's there i don't i don't need anything from anyone to make me feel better because
when a mother loves a son the way my mother loved me there's nothing anyone can tell me in this world
about her about about me about us so i don't need to share it you know what i mean you said you had one parent
then well my dad was you know around sort of but like in and out there you know he's like he's
Your Dad
a he was an old school guy my dad you know like like [ __ ] shagged around
went to prison just a wild man um but i'm i'm i'm okay with my dad now i'm
i've just reached a place of like understanding that my dad's got bipolar
disorder he's uh he's never gonna be quote normal like he's just that guy and
uh you know he recently had a suicide attempt which i had to phone the ambulance for on that and it's like
what the [ __ ] hell is this like you know what i mean you're panicking um hoping he's gonna be all right he
then got sectioned again um which this was this year you know and
you had to phone the ambulance yeah yeah um he texts me basically a sort of a
message that let me know what was going down you know so instantly got on the ambulance and then you're panicking
because the ambulance they're like oh kovid kovid i'm like you [ __ ] just get there
like are you [ __ ] me two hours it took them to get there you know two [ __ ] hours and like it was like a
full-blown suicide attempt like the pills were already gone you know what i mean so um
yeah just like the it it's stressful you know um when you when
you go through that and it was i did a podcast about it because you know you don't really know what to do like
last time my dad was sectioned i was a [ __ ] child like so i'm now his next of kin i'm his
his parent now in this situation so he's mentally unstable they're coming to me
asking me for the answers i'm trying to run a company and and do my youtube videos
hey everyone welcome back you know what i mean it's [ __ ] mental and that's one of
the weird things about uh being a youtuber is like i know that people rely on me for their escape
but it's sometimes that's why like you you messaged me to do a podcast around that time and i said mate
i ain't doing a [ __ ] podcast right now i'm not in it and i didn't because i just said i'll just be [ __ ] miserable
i mean great start anyway we're talking about yeah but yeah i i just knew i couldn't i
couldn't do it you know what i mean but um yeah it's been uh me my dada all right like
he sometimes he just um he says things from a different angle
because he's got bipolar so it's it's challenging you know what i mean get him to see where i'm coming from
sometimes it's so difficult when eventually i think a kid has to kind of forgive their parents
and start parenting their parents it's even kind of happened to me in a strange way because i think my mum i think my mom has bipolar dude
your mom's such a character i've heard a few stories and i'm like yeah i remember being young and being
told that well i mean the first one i wrote my book is when she came to the school in her lingerie when i was like
four or five years old yeah because she wanted to put on a show and then the other instance that sticks my mind there's one where she changed my dad to
the house with a knife and the third one i remember is being told that she had been locked up because
um they'd come to repossess her her restaurant and she was stood in the street with a knife and she was smashing
up her own shop and there was police in the street and everything and i was i didn't see that but yeah we'll have to set them up for a day
no but there is you get to a point where you realize that i'm not going to have the perfect family yeah that i see in the films and i'm
going to have to forgive these people who are meant to be my idols and guardians for their own flaws you know and
i just yeah it's i've made i've sort of
i've made peace with my dad's mistakes in life it's difficult though you know you you
know it's a really long process of why don't you love me why won't you be like this
why aren't you doing that why you know and as the years go by you realize
other people's parents are also [ __ ] up you know how many people can actually say they've
got two parents who love each other in a great marriage and have been great parents most people i know don't have that
situation even if their parents are together it's a [ __ ] [ __ ] show so yeah people are on perfect and
um i think just accepting that is a good start to life okay quick one one
of my best friends in the world francesca sent me a text message this week and i'm going to read it out to you
she said happy sunday so we're thinking of joining the huel hype i'm forgetting to eat all of the
time and i end up eating rubbish so i need to sort out any recommendations to start off with and my response to her was any of the
ready to drink fuels would be my suggestion whatever flavor you think is your preference honestly
francesca this is a very very good health decision and she then replied and said amazing excited to get started on it
um and i think that demonstrates um the genuine authentic relationship i have with huel i genuinely
depend on huel um because i am prone to missing meals and when i do have my meals
sometimes they're not nutritionally complete to say the least i'm definitely not getting my vitamins if i don't have fuel because a lot of
the food we have today is processed and it's it's filled with a lot of bad stuff so huel has been a lifesaver of mine for
three years and as i've said before it's such a joy to have a sponsor that you genuinely believe can help people change their
lives if they would only start using the product so let's get back to the podcast
Your experiences with anxiety
anxiety is a really interesting topic i've been involved in this mental health company for some time now a tie and i've just got really
fascinated about the concept of anxiety oh it's [ __ ] horrible just and i've experienced it as well i've
i've oh yeah been there tell me about your experience with anxiety um and when and was it later in your
life that you first uh i think the first time i'd had anxiety was after my mom died
in the in the immediate i didn't know what was going on i just remember being in the room and saying to my mates
my chest is getting really tight i feel like i'm struggling to breathe and i was like uh and then
you know the doctors hired us some volume and [ __ ] i think i had that with some alcohol at the same
time and that that was when the forcing myself to sleep sort of was was started but um as i got older
um i realized uh through the youtube thing
just like being known is is a really weird thing particularly
obviously around that time with the the fall of true geordi as i called it on the video
uh lot of anxiety and depression um and it's just such a horrible feeling
to go through because it feels very serious at the time yeah but it is in your head in it really
Your depression
you've been very open about your and i don't want to continue on this week because we've got a lot to talk about you've been very open
about your depression and suicidal ideation and one thing that i haven't quite
managed to get over in your head is what you said earlier where you said one of the things that actually made you
hang in there was that people didn't want you to hang in there and that's the floor yeah yeah i i like
sort of there there was a there was a tweet that was tweeted at me it's such a weird little
confession uh where a guy went um i've heard about your financial issues
or whatever he said in the street and it couldn't have happened to a better guy and
i've got like a dark sense of humor and i sort of smirked at it and i thought in my head i thought i
know i am not beaten like i just know it and i and i know i'm going to be rich and i know shit's going to go come back
around so i just screenshotted tweet and i'm thinking i'm going to use that as like an air freshener on a ferrari
i have this like i don't know you know what i mean like i want to prove people wrong yeah and and
and i think that drive at the start was a lot of that was like when i started youtube so many people like the [ __ ] is this idiot doing like
shouting on his camera and all that so then all of a sudden there was that that that negativity came in droves
[ __ ] thousands of tweets um and yeah it was sort of a weird like oh
it's like starting the game again but like on a different level so i'm like okay now i'm [ __ ]
but i've been [ __ ] worse before so it's kind of like all right let's let's use this a bit so
but to sort of uh yeah the depression it's it's like it's
awful and it's so negative and you think about like i was thinking about suicide on a daily
basis at one point i was you know i'm sorry if this is bringing people down when they're listening
um you know i was really seriously contemplating it in in a way of like here's what i would do
and and when the anxiety attacks were coming over me it was just an awful way of living and i honestly don't know how i got through
what i got through like looking back at it it was [ __ ] mental
um i've never been um to that point so when i hear people talking about it
it just it's like incomprehensible to me that you could get to the point where you
think the best route is to end your life so yeah i mean
looking looking at it at the time i thought i had what was like situational depression where i'm in this
horrible situation and that's why i'm depressed which was partly true obviously
but i was also chemically depressed as well like there was what i now realize is
through that my mom dying other trauma in my life
i definitely had chemical depression like i needed i needed medication you know um but um
i sort of um didn't believe in it didn't want to do it didn't think it would work
uh for me you know and also like when you're a guy who's um lives in his head and thinks
you know i'm a small guy yada yada you sort of you're worried it's going to change the
way you think and make you a bit what if it makes me dumber you know some something silly like that or
you hear about other people's bad experiences on it like [ __ ] your libido all of this sort
of weird [ __ ] put away on you there's this all sorts of little fears so
um it had to get so bad uh before i would try medication but like one day it got
bad enough where i was like i i realized i thought i'm definitely going to do it soon otherwise um i'm gonna have to i was like
frightened almost like as a kind of like as a friend of me
if that makes sense like i was frightened for me because i was like you're really gonna [ __ ] do this here soon like uh
the way i was thinking in the way my life was going and the way i was feeling about small things that really are like
you know when people sort of push your buttons a little bit yeah the way that was making me feel was awful like i was shouting at my friends
and my crew and um when someone was challenging me in any way
the the fear and anxiety was bubbling underneath it was just overwhelming and i had like really bad nightmares and i'd
wake up in the morning and i remember just waking up one morning just being like oh i really don't want to live anymore and that was
when i was like on the phone to the doctor and i was like give us whatever the [ __ ] you've got
because i'm willing to try anything now and uh thank [ __ ] you know um so they uh
they prescribed us some antidepressants and i'm really [ __ ] glad i tried the
mitt honestly you called the doctor yourself one night one morning uh it was in the morning night you woke
up and thought i need to call yeah i just knew i thought i'm like i'm i'm a liability to myself here and
it was like the fear of oh [ __ ] you're getting dangerously close like you like thoughts become things
right so like we we know that because when we challenge our channel our brains in an ambitious way
we can make magic happen but also if i'm thinking negatively i can go to
the worst possible place and i really knew i was like almost manifesting it because it
i was spending some i would there was so many times it would pass through my head if oh well i'll just kill myself oh well
i'll just kill myself oh like if this doesn't happen if this doesn't happen if this doesn't happen it was it was becoming an answer it was
becoming a solution to all of the problems that felt like they were mounting on my shoulders and
stuff like that um so yeah um and when i took the medication that was
when it really dawned on me like oh that wasn't just because of what i've been through or it was a
it was yeah post-traumatic stress disorder and all sorts of other [ __ ] but it was also like a chemical imbalance
probably in the brain where my serotonin levels were real low
um and you know i was desperate so i'm glad i took them i never see
You never relax
you meditate go on holiday relax chill out go to the jungle i was
in the jungle and you you messaged me and said i need a little bit of that yeah i mean you look like you're having a a whale of
a [ __ ] time um yeah but i am on like a treadmill you know what i mean
like i'm not quite at that point of um financial um what i want from life financially i
haven't quite clinched that moment of will you haven't set yeah i will i will
you think so yeah yeah because i don't think i have um
[Music] yeah but we're at different points you know what i mean sort of like um financially speaking um i'm nearly
there i think i'm getting there i've got a really good organized team now
money is is sorting itself out and it's like if i just carry on the way
i'm going we'll be okay and then i can have those moments where i go now i'm going to rest i'm going to enjoy
myself but yeah i don't i don't meditate i don't uh
you know how do you relax um glass of wine and um i say a glass a
bottle away but you know um will you ever talk how
to relax no not really i feel like i don't really
rely like the minute i put out something i'm really happy with i get this feeling of like content like
i'm like oh that's class that that's a really good piece of work that i'm really happy with that but then like
10 minutes will go by and that'll be when i'm like okay what we doing next then you know what i mean and
i think like you know we have that in common for sure and i no doubt that when when i hit that point where i'm
financially secure i'll still carry on being a bastard this is it but
i will chill out more i will i will chill out more and i'm already chilling out more since i started the antidepressants actually like in terms
of the way i behave like all of those i'm so much more in control of my
self now my anger my ups and downs that you know they're
everything's a lot more relaxed and and i communicate in a way that's not as um
like you know there's times where people have pissed me off and i would just not even look at them because i would be so frustrated that
when i tell them i wouldn't i wouldn't even look at them because i'd be like i want to punch you right now so i'm not gonna look
you know i mean like i just exude anger even when i was trying to hold it back
it was there obvious and i don't want people who work with me feel like they're working with a [ __ ]
lunatic you know what i mean so the the antidepressants have been a godsend and um
that's really helped me communicate and now now if i have an issue i just sit down and i'm just honest and
calm and i just go he has what's gone wrong he has what i think we should do better if you want to
hear tell me what i need to do better i'm all ears and it's like i'm a different i'm a better person now you know still
not the finished article by any means got lots of work to do but it just made me realize like my
and it goes by ironically to the trolls you know even even the trolls you gave me all that [ __ ] it's like when you're really unhappy
within yourself it comes out every way and and that was really what was happening to me i was like
and part of it actually made my youtube videos good because like the pain that like that fall of true
jordy video uh it was just i just said lawrence you need to [ __ ] sit down and i need to
sit down because i've got so much [ __ ] i want to say right now and if i don't get this out there i'm
going to [ __ ] explode so we're doing this it wasn't thought out or anything um
but it brings sometimes it's like that struggling artist thing isn't it people like that a little bit like to
feel like they're battling something so it makes the videos better so it worked in my favor a little bit
Attaching your happiness to a future goals
i just i've just come to i mean from my own experiences i'm sure you've heard this heard me say this before just when i
when i was insecure broke and striving to be rich and successful upon actually getting there i realized
that that was totally unfulfilling because it just moves off into the future and so when i what i think i've
come to learn maybe is happiness is in fact finding peace today irrespective of uncompleted goals
that's definitely in my head as well yes that word peace today yeah like
in even in the last month actually i remember thinking i only want to be around people who are
who make me feel peaceful if you bring drama if you bring aggro stress
you can [ __ ] off because i'm trying to turn over a new leaf now and not deal like and i think a lot of
people just did not realize like well they were keeping stuff on my plate because i'm the mountain of a man who
can handle anything apparently but i was at [ __ ] breaking point and i just wasn't saying it you know
whereas now i'm saying it i'm like no i'm not doing that like you know the other day one of the
lads in the team said it was um oh there was about research or something like you know for
graphic design and stuff and and me when it was um oh it would help if you if you had a look
and i said would you rogan's team tell them to do that or do your own research joe you know and
and now i'm just very much like here's the standards this is what we do and you know and are you still at do you
think this is what really what i'm getting at here is do you think you're still attaching some
happiness to the future attainment of some goal or
and this is like this is scary it's it's it's it's healthy and aware because it's like
i'm not under the illusion that the minute i hit the big number
that all of a sudden i'm gonna um that will make me happy but the freedom
that that number will then give me is what i'm looking for freedom from what freedom
freedom of choice freedom to do whatever i want with my life right now i'm a slave to the game the
game for me right now is i've got the all these shows all these brands i'm trying to build i'm doing the
fighting i've got the kick off the football brand i've got the podcast and other things i'm working on as well
like my poker and stuff and twitch i am on a treadmill
where every single week i have to do i'm contracted to do this show this show or the show i
i'm the most consistent youtuber in the uk it's just nobody really realizes it because it's kind of always been that way i've
always been that the guy like even though i slowed the podcast down in terms of like the amount of videos
i've been putting now it's been insane from for years now um
so i i have to do them because i'm not at a point of financial freedom and even when i am i might still carry
on but it would be nice to have the option to go yeah i'm going to do this and yeah i'm going to interview that guy here if i
want to interview a guy in america i can stop the kick off because i just don't want to do it this week or i'll
let my other boys do it and i'm going to go to early and interview joe rogan you know i'd love to have the
i can't do that i'm chained to my content and i love my content fortunately and i love
the people i'm around but if i if if i didn't it would be really hard
yeah i've i've been thinking a ton about this it's actually again the last chapter in in um in the book i was writing and i i
think my conclusion my book's actually quite similar it's called happy sexy geordie is it no where'd you get the name no it's just
that last i was i thought so much about ambition and my conclusive point was when you realize
that you are enough and you actually don't need more money or you don't need more external validation that foundation is
such a contradiction right that when you realize that you're actually you've got everything you need then you
then the result is true ambition not ambition to impress girls with a lamborghini not ambition to prove
everyone wrong but you go after the things that you actually genuinely give a [ __ ] about and when you get to the point where you
are you know that you're enough then you start to go for things just for the sake of like the intrinsic content that's what i'm
talking about yeah that that's where i am it's like i know i want to get there but i'm not there yet
and when when i get that big [ __ ] off deal that's insane then i can be like
i mean unfortunately that'll mean more work but there you go right but i'll have the money to then have
that in um bring the plane into land eventually and go okay now what do i want to do
um ultimately the funny thing is i'm doing what i want to do now i'm just doing a lot more of it than probably
physically i should be you know what i mean it would be nice to have a bit more
bigger a bigger team is really what i'd like to do is put invest more into the team and have like
more people to help me because me and the boys we do a lot it's funny
because it feels like the snowball then gets bigger as it's falling down yeah possibly add five more people then that means
more brand obligations to pay for that you know what it is though it would make me so [ __ ] happy to be
um i i i know this is like i get why this is [ __ ] but it's also like
it's enough for me even people from newcastle have like underestimated me even people who should
be championing me and supporting me are telling me i ain't [ __ ] so just to like go beyond what anyone could
even imagine it would be such a [ __ ] ride and ultimately that's all i want to do at the end just look back and go
Whats the big ambition?
[ __ ] me i showed those [ __ ] didn't know like and and have a good laugh and spend time with my friends
make great videos that's what i want to do what what are your ambitions now then i don't think you've you know you've
signed this deal with um obviously jim shark which is great and you've you've done a deal with beats which is great
you're over on twitch now poker stars as well shut up what is the big when you talk about that
big you know vision that you have in your mind of where you will be in five ten years from now what is that
um i feel like i've um i'm in a bit of a unique situation
in that i wanna kind of be the king of multiple different things and uh it's going to be interesting to see how
that that goes uh i think i'm the best podcaster currently
um about uh aside from joe rogan no offense to your goodness i think
you're very good um and uh you know i want to kill the podcast game
but that's been something that i've had to uh in the in in the past when that [ __ ]
happened i kind of had to put that back and go where's the money going to come from and sports is a lot easier to make money out
of so i went full steam ed with a kick off i think i've got something really special with the kickoff
that to me is the the future of football in terms of how people will
consume it in the uk that that show the the brand the kickoff the the
personalities i've got there i'm working on rebranding it right now you know gillette's up a saturday's
dying of death i've seen it coming in my life uh sucker am is so [ __ ] like they've
all piled like this what that happened in that space right now there's so many youtube channels they're
faking their views they you i know them all they've got all the big brands
budweiser you're getting robbed i'm just saying that right now you want to check the [ __ ] and why why have certain youtube channels
switch the likes off switch the views switch the comments off because they're [ __ ] buying views and stuff like that
what we've got is so authentic and real my studio i've spent hundreds of
thousands of pounds on the equipment in there we've we we've got something special there so it's about watering it and
letting it grow and if i build the team right i think we could like
no one can [ __ ] with us like everyone's copying us everyone's copying the kickoff no one can copy the kickoff they're all
wasting their time all they do is make us look better their [ __ ] attempts that they kick off
make us look ten times stronger so with that one i think we've got something really special there
and i'm surprised a huge brand has not seen that yet
like an amazon or or a google or whoever the [ __ ] you know because all right we swear on there but
we are killing it you know and and credit twitch they did see it and you know
i'm proud of that but the potential for that brand i just think is enormous i just
like i say i've been through so many financial struggles while keeping that going i haven't really been in a had a chance
to put it in third gear yet but i'm we're getting there um and then there's the fighting
i feel like thanks to logan paul and ksi they've put me in a really particular position where i really know
fighting but i also know the entertainment side of fighting and as as boxing moves towards that
direction and mma as well and my history of loving boxing and ufc
i can really nail down a special place in that where you know live stream wise
we're number one on fighting and football how weird is it that there's one guy in
the world who does a live stream on football and he's got the number one audience aren't fighting
you know that alone puts me in a really unique position without having to talk about the podcast
where it's ricky gervais one week it could be kamaru uzman ufc champion the next
tyson fury logan paul do you think you've got the credit you deserve i definitely don't no why um
Do you get the credit you deserve?
i don't know i don't know um i think you know i just did an interview
for example with kamaru uzman and the older i get and the wiser i get
him the better at questioning i get and the and the better i get as an interviewer and leading
the the guest and and taking them on that journey my emotional compassionate side is
really another gear that i have that other interviewers i just you know i've always aspired to be like
joe rogan but joe rogan has things i don't and i have things he doesn't he knows everything about everything this guy can
talk to anyone i just don't have that but my emotional compassionate side my
empathy i think gives me something else and on that on the interview i got so many comments
because it was one of the first interviews i've done which was the same guest joe rogan had i
saw the comments and loads of people going you didn't know you [ __ ] out did joe rogan with that one and i knew i did and i don't mean
that as a disrespect because he's like a god to me but on that one it really showed because
i just did a totally different interview and um and i i'm joe is always going to be the goat in me
but sometimes even the goat can be got and i can get him every every now and then and i and i'm
he's who i aspire to to be on every podcast you know so maybe i don't know i don't know what the
[ __ ] it's going to take um i don't know if it's because i feel like it's because i'm working class and i
don't necessarily like some people just get credit thrown at them like mr beast wow you spent loads of money on
a video uh what's the other [ __ ] who's always surprised as friends because i don't give a [ __ ]
like with all due respect you don't impress me none of you like you know your creativity is bang average you know like
i could turn up with [ __ ] money and buy a car for a friend you know what i mean so i'm trying to
tell stories like with the fall of true geordi with the rebuild with the podcasts though that content is like i poured my
heart and soul into it i edited it with my uh edit a geo shout out to him amazing
uh editor we sat together and did frame by frame i do the grade
i [ __ ] everything like every minute detail i care about why does my podcast look different
everyone else because i care and i will literally go and go right we're going to do the grade we're going to do the sound that doesn't sound right and i
every [ __ ] detail i care about so it frustrates me that i'm not where i
think i should be because the numbers are there the deals are there but the critical
acclaim for whatever reason isn't there and i guess it's because i swear and i'm not like mainstream worthy like i'm never i'm
never going to be the kid who jonathan ross invites on or you know i'm not and i don't want to i
don't give a [ __ ] about being well known on telly i don't want to go on it particularly um and it's not because there's anything
wrong with it it's just i'm happy where i am you know but um i don't know what it's going to
take bro do you feel like i've got to move a [ __ ] mountain no i know i i was just thinking about it then because i agree with everything you said
in terms of the influence you have and i and you i also agree that you are the best podcast in this country and
really you were the one of the real pioneers of a certain style of podcasting but also on the kickoff right you're a real pioneer
there but from what i've learned about company valuations and even how brands do deals
it's the way that it is packaged yeah and look i'm not greasing the wheels of
these companies and that's definitely a thing i need to do better because you talk about brand new channels yeah
certain youtube channels will take people out for dinner they'll schmooze they'll do all of that [ __ ]
and i'm clearly not doing that because but like credit of the companies who have invested in me because i've just
went look i'm the best and and you know i learned how to do decks myself
i was i've done decks i do all my own decks you shouldn't be i i sell uh well i've just hired a guy so
he's going to do them from now on but the point is is like i got i've done all right you know what you've done really well i don't i'm
gonna say it you're not getting the credit you deserve yeah i'm and and it's you know and you're not getting
the money you deserve either it's [ __ ] frustrating bro like oh you know i don't know what money you're getting but i know
it's not what you deserve trust me bro it ain't what i no i'm credit to the partners we've got
because they've looked after us um particularly um jim sharp and poker
stars and twitch um i'm grateful for for those people to be uh partnered with us but
yeah i i i definitely feel like where where i am is not reflected
um but yeah i need to do the the schmoozing [ __ ] a lot better and and the deck side of things we've
built that out and we're packaging up and branding wise i need to be a bit more
there's a lot of rich old white dudes who sign the [ __ ] checks who i need to be more friendly towards i i get that i
don't even think you do i think you need a bunch of rich old white dudes to be friendly with rich old white dudes yeah i think you should probably call your
company like true true entertainment yeah you put it all under there the minute so people when they look at something if
they if they value it as a youtube channel you're getting paid x if they value you as a media company
a buzzfeed or a vice which i am yeah you are which i am but you're not you're not packaged like that you're packaged as a
youtube channel vice is worth five like i don't know no it's what it was 1.5 billion
yeah like if you think about the influence in reach you're probably up there with advice but you you're branded differently
you're branded as a youtube channel so and i've done all this on a shoestring as well bro exactly i've been
like i've been in debt for the tax man i've got that rug pulled out from under me with the deal i've had to scramble to
get other deals i had to pay off the production company all the money i owed them yeah you know
you know that one who kept us going after the deal i had to pay them off and then i went solo and got my own production company set up
so we are beginning which is the obviously the concept where the promotion with distribution we
are a [ __ ] media company it's just [ __ ] frustrating because i don't know who's dick i've gotta suck
they get [ __ ] respect around here um but i'd i should be a multi-fucking millionaire right now balling out of
control i'm not balling out of control i should be going back down to the [ __ ] audi
garage no yeah i'm pissed off and i think that chip on my shoulder is a healthy thing in a way because it will just keep
driving me to get that respect i deserve and ultimately to get the money to look after the people i care about
and that's that's the goal it ain't about like ultimately yes i've got an eagle
yes i want to be respected yes but i could quit all that as long as i get the money to secure everyone who all my team
all of that you know what i mean and you 100 own your your formats absolutely yeah i pulled up on
heineken because they used the kickoff trademark and said i want my [ __ ] money really yeah shout out to heineken they paid me off
yeah they used the kick off and um i was like the kickoff the european
champions league night uh on with heineken and i'm like what the [ __ ]
uh tweeted them and uh and yeah i had everyone [ __ ] oh can we make this go away and but to
be fair the gaffer at heineken was cool as [ __ ] well he better have been yeah you should sponsor the [ __ ]
kickoff quick one as a serial entrepreneur that's currently building
multiple projects across multiple industries everything from the marketing industry to blockchain to consumer goods everything
one of the things that has been a lifesaver for me and again a company that i reached out to to evangelize about on this podcast because i'm a
loyal customer and they ultimately ended up sponsoring this podcast is fiverr.com

ceo and send me a screenshot if you end up using the service one of you is gonna win something very
amazing do you think you're happy now
i want to i want to answer this honestly i'm really really going there um
no i wouldn't say happy is the right word but i'm closer to in the middle than i
have been in a long time you know what i mean like that neutral point of like i'm not really happy but
i'm also not low i'm i'm heading up to like okay you know what i mean i have more okay
days than i have had in a long time since i started taking my antidepressants and stuff that's really helped me sort of level out a bit
so yeah i'm definitely a bit better but i
wouldn't say happy would be the right word and also i don't i'm not striving to be happy
either i think i'm striving for peace and content and um just uh
yeah you have your happy days you're also gonna have your bad days but it's like i wanna get to a place where i ride the storm
and enjoy the good bits and appreciate them and know that there will be hard times again but that are mentally equipped to deal
with them and then if i do have a bad moment that i don't want to kill myself or anything that's sort of my
what i'm looking for do you know what it's going to work what work it takes to get there do you have any idea what it's going to take
yeah yeah i i think so but also i'm kind of think i'm one of those people that
i'm i'm not anticipating an easy ride in life i'd be a fool after everything i've been through to think
but now it's going to go great you know so it's like um that's kind of why i search for money
because i think money does solve a lot of problems and it can make life a lot easier and
it's it's not like money isn't the answer but that can help a lot freedom it gives you yeah i'm still
super scared conscious about my relationship with money because i know that there's nothing you can do to take
that kid out of me oh yeah it will never leave me yeah they're still bitter me man i say a fast car and i'm like well [ __ ]
me yeah i can really go for one of them right now bitcoin was taken off i'm like oh should i
should i get on the train do you know what i mean once every three months i'll send my friends one of them's over there and my manager and my pa
a picture of a rolls-royce and i'll just like should i do it yeah yeah yeah yeah and i'll do it five
times a year i'll never buy it but it's that kid showing up again being like get [ __ ] show them yeah and this all i've
tried to do in my life is just be way more conscious of that kid in me but but this is the thing is like at
this point for you everyone thinks you're way more loaded than you probably are anyways so it's gone to a point where it's like
for you there's nothing left to prove you've proven it you know what i mean like you you're and i guess yeah bro
credit to you by the way you've done a [ __ ] good job yeah thank you you're right are you yeah thank you very appreciate it i hope you're proud of
yourself as well um i am and you're right i don't feel like i've got
a ton left to prove to people and that's why that's what i was kind of referring to and that for me has been a really good place to actually realize
what i care about in life because before it was all trying to get laid trying to get girls trying to get respect trying to get followers trying
to get whatever and when i was doing that i was getting i was making myself unhappy but i was self-destructing when you finally
get to the point where you realize that you are actually never going to be internally worth more
you're never actually going to be more valuable as a human being no matter how much money i have my value
doesn't change but insecurity is is is is it's a it's a gift and a curse isn't it it's like
rocket fuel it's like before when i was talking about my podcast and how i'm underrated you see the way i talk like the passion
whereas joe rogan ain't [ __ ] talking like that he's content he is the king like he has nothing there
and and also i kind of envy it because he's never been that way he's never been he's never come across as i need
validation um and i i know that's in me you know what i mean and it's not a healthy thing
and that do you think it's a good thing it's certainly [ __ ] driven us so i
can't i can't hate it all but it's like controlling it it's like the beast inside you and it's like
um mastering it you know knowing when to let it go
and like it's that same thing that will make me obsess over the quality of the content or you know
Do you think youâre happy?
the detail or the research or and it's the same thing that when people let me down in a work
situation i get [ __ ] frustrated because i'm like why the [ __ ] don't you want this as bad as i do
you know what i mean but if they did they'd be me you know what i mean i'm i'm i'm me they're them but it's
it just strives as [ __ ] insane sometimes you know i think it's about balancing that thing
and as you say trying to master it because you're definitely right it was like the [ __ ] rocket ship that took you here
yeah but at some point i think probably to fly you've got to let go and i genuinely think i've thought this
from just watching from afar and seeing the similarities in me and you i've thought to myself the day that
brian reaches his full potential will be the day that he no longer gives a [ __ ] about proving himself
to people because i think then i think then how you operate becomes a lot more healthy and
more more productive and more effective you're not being driven by these external forces you clearly you know
that don't want your best interest you can be in control because you're not in control if if there's that driving you right
you're not actually i'm the same as i said i'm on the treadmill bro and i'm and the the day i don't need money
anymore that's going to be a scary day for the rest of the internet because because the content's gone gonna [ __ ]
change like i don't know what the [ __ ] i'll do but it'll probably one i don't know i don't i don't want to let
the fans down and i don't want to stop doing what they they love me for but i i am a person who
evolves constantly and i'm always thinking and reevaluating and what you know what is this what am i doing why am i here
all of that and uh it'll be interesting to see what happens then
Reaching my goalsâ¦ or at least trying to
i'm i'm excited to see if that if that happens you know what i mean like what i would say what i will do
you're relentless like um eddie hearn [Music] yeah yeah he's one of the most relentless characters i've ever met and
he told me you know he's just working for that day to sell his to sell matroom and i asked him why he wants to sell
match him if it's making him happy and he goes well we were never supposed to be here and it sounds a lot like what you say to me and then he goes what i'm
going to do is i'm going to sell matching 5 billion then i'm going to go to the beach and smoke my cigar and i said edina you're not
no but yeah i'm not trying to do that i i get that i
love what i do and but like take take matroom for example right
this is me going on a run again i look at the zone i look at what matroom are doing i'm like you guys are [ __ ] geniuses this is
great why are you not coming for me why what what are you waiting for ufc
are joe rogan i've got a [ __ ] huge podcast audience every video i do about fighting gets loads of views my production quality
my shows um you know they've tried to copy my show there's no offense but i know they i mean i can say the way they
try to get a round table going they got joella in there and stuff like that i see what they're doing good good on them
like you know it looked all right but we just come for the real mccoy pays the money and i'll i'll [ __ ]
i'll make you guys i'll help you out you know what i mean there might be an issue of being
dependent then on you right for brands because if you're the main event one day if you decide to yeah cut the
brand but look at what joe organ did with the ufc it was a perfect marriage his podcast
had the fighters on he told the stories for the fighters he helped promote them they then go back
in the ufc they're now more relevant they get more pay-per-view buys and it's it's a symbiotic relationship there
where you give me the fight you give me anthony joshua the new anthony joshua you need to build him up and i tell the story better than he
could himself i helped make a documentary on him better than he could himself i'm king of content and i'll help you
out with that like i don't know i just feel like i've got all these [ __ ] skills and i'm sitting here making my own stuff but like with a
budget imagine what i made the rebuild me and two other guys made the rebuild
like it was good but imagine if i actually had a [ __ ] netflix budget you know what i mean like
why don't you take investment then uh i i would consider it but it would
have to be from the right person who understood what the goal was and actually backed me but unfortunately because i've had those
previous issues where companies have tried to um get me to sign over my ip for [ __ ]
peanuts um putting a gun to my head and [ __ ] like that and i've had multiple people try and do that
this made me very wary you know it would have to be a big amount of money and a good a good long-term partner
so you fancy it no i genuinely i've always looked at what you do and you know this anyway and i've
always thought that you you had been undervalued and i tend to believe that and because you do you've been the king
of what you do for a long time not blowing smoke up your ass you know this anyway no but you know it's true and um other
people who aren't as good because they they're packaged as these like big media companies they're getting the big seven eight
figures destroys his money yeah destroys us i'm just gonna [ __ ] say when i
[ __ ] got a massive [ __ ] deal with budweiser or anyone we'll bleep that people because they'll [ __ ] take me to court
um it destroys us because i'm just like you guys are putting out [ __ ] content you don't get any views randomly of your
video one video's got ten thousand views the next video's got five million no one asked anything
no one like budweiser double checking that like i didn't know and and i'm sure there's some back scratching going on behind closed doors
where someone went to eaton with his other [ __ ] mate and i'm not invited to these business dinners but if
you actually want to sell some [ __ ] and you actually want to make a [ __ ] buzz and you want to kick ass on the next
world cup or whatever we we do the content we are
me and my team work so hard it's not just me either you know i mean
we're all like grafting constantly my editor for example this kid works till like four in
the morning [ __ ] regularly you know to to give everything and um and that's someone's gotta pay
for that one day like i gotta get my end result from that you know we we do
because it won't i'm very loyal to them and i and we'll all deserve that do you know what i mean that moment of look at what we've
built you know when i see spotify signing um they've just signed the girl in the uh
america yeah uh call her daddy yeah right they give her a [ __ ] huge contract i'm like
look at her views look what the [ __ ] am i doing over here like i don't know what it is man i don't know what it is
but i think i'm right when i say it's because you've not packaged yourself as a media company that you well i think all her daddy had a lot of help
from bar stool um and obviously boston being a huge company in america they packaged her well and
and put her on the map and stuff and we've had to do ever like you when you met me i was in a [ __ ] bomb
shelter bro i i paid a toothless russian man 50 pounds a day for a sweaty bomb shelter because that's
all i could afford when when i met you in 2017 because the company had sucked
me a company had let me go because they quote unquote i'm not brandable and they couldn't make
money out of me because they couldn't sell me properly because of the way i was and i was on 50 quid a day paying
rent for the studio and that studio was [ __ ] horrible but now pokerstars beats by dre jim
shock and twitch apparently think i'm marketable so i proved that [ __ ] wrong didn't i sometimes it does feel good to prove
people wrong steve do you know what i mean but that's not the goal the goal's the bank balance
yeah proving him wrong when he said i wasn't sellable i've competed with a company before when
i was in the bomb shelter for for a sponsorship which was a six-figure sponsorship deal
and they were a 20 million pound company and i beat them you know what i mean so to say i've come
up from nothing's the understatement of the [ __ ] century and i just um i need to get that point where i'm
content like yourself i just hope and pray and i think this is why i keep you can hear me keep coming back
back to it is i just hope that you don't believe too much in you getting there and finally being
completely happy okay i'm aware what you're saying yeah and i've had plenty of money before and i've i've had
the the adrenaline dump of bloody driving a fast car and all that
you you you can live anywhere in the world you can drive any car in the world if
the people around you on who you want to be around if you yourself on content it doesn't matter
because i wanted to kill myself in in you know in a in a situation where many people would
have felt like it was the best thing and all of that and i i'm aware of what you're saying
i just want it all i want the content peaceful happiness nice people around me
and i want the money and it's it's life's a good ride in it so i might as well go for it
[Music] i think it's possible do you know you want to know something that's funny do you know what during that um that week
of hell i had i remember um i was just sat there i was like
i think i was having a whiskey at the time and uh this is what like a dark sense of humor america i remember
thinking hey this is so [ __ ] isn't it but what a ride
like it was just a bit of me that was like this is a [ __ ] story and that's jesus something like you know what i
mean yeah you just gotta laugh and go hey my life is not [ __ ] boring if
anything like it was like you know gotta laugh at it sometimes i'm new your
fitness stuff at the moment i've been getting very into health and fitness yeah i've seen that yeah you're looking shredded
thank you bro thank you yeah i'm on amanda's friends on his close friends yeah yeah i say that i say the stories
other people don't say as well how's that how's that um
impacted your life just having you know you've started boxing and you've started working out a lot and you're looking good
yeah how's that how do i impact on your mental health
it's be honest with me it's it's great in terms of like
How has fitness been for your mental health?
making you feel better and you have a great workout and you get the endorphins and stuff but also weirdly
there's the um if i have a bad week i feel worse about it like if i have like a week where i haven't trained or i've put weight on
and stuff like that it makes me go i'm letting myself down here you know what i mean i need to [ __ ] sought
myself supposed to be a gym shot athlete you know what i mean like so now there's more pressure on it if anything but
um are you gonna fight you've gotta fight
i think i might do something like a charity boxing match at some point something that isn't like what the youtubers do
i'd rather i i'm i'm sparring quite a lot now and
i'm getting some like heavyweight sparring in with like i'm going to get some pros to spa with me and stuff like
that and really push myself i feel like what a lot of these youtube boys do is they call someone out and then learn how to
fight whereas i'm actually just learning how to fight first because i enjoy it and and also because i'm dedicated to
what i do like if you look at my analysis on fighting three four years ago when i did
logan paul ksi one or joe well like yes i and then look at what i can do now when i break a fight down it is [ __ ]
so much better now and i think a lot of the to be fair a lot of the boxing mma fans although they they always disagree
with you i think a lot of them are recognizing like this guy is getting punched in the head just to learn fighting so he can do
better videos and that's real dedication so that's my actual goal to be better on camera
but i do love fighting for whatever reason it just brings out this all the things about me that i've
probably showed in this podcast or um that they come out in the in the ring when you're
being challenged and wanting to quit but keeping going anyway like i think every entrepreneur has that
in them really they're all fighters they're just doing it in a different way but when you're in a boxing ring it
really brings out you and um it gives you some sort of self-worth
and self-esteem because i i got that when i was at my lowest point really my depression
um like all of a sudden it was like yeah i am tough so i'm not just a big lad i'm hard as [ __ ] nails me you know and it
give me a lot of give me a good thing in the in the time i really needed it so if i was to do a fight it would probably
i'd rather do it like a social club where everyone's getting pissed drinking pints and a
live stream on my own channel or something and and donate everything to charity rather than
making it like a spectacle yeah and i'd rather fight a real amateur fighter who i respect he
respects no trash talk shake hands will have a pint together afterwards and you know just something like that
really you when you were going through that depressed depressive period you started boxing i noticed that you stopped podcasting as much and you
talked about how that was to do with money but i was yeah it was also mental health yeah i it's hard to do a two-hour podcast
even now i'm i'm in a much better place now but it's still it comes out we have to talk about it
because it was my state of mind and obviously this is a podcast about my life but um when you're really rock bottom
i could get on and we do these uh comedy videos for those who haven't seen them called true news where we basically look at the
the news and we just rip the piss out of it and um you know people like piers morgan
You stopped podcasting & turned off comments?
and the like they get they get a lot of stick off us and um i can do that because we can edit it
down it's it's me and laurence we're laughing and joking and then afterwards you know you you
switch off and you go back to being normal when you're podcasting there's really no way to hide and that's what i love about podcasts
is like you really do get a good idea of who someone is if they podcast regularly it's hard to hide it's hard to pretend
you know and that's why i didn't do it because i knew i couldn't lie to the i didn't want to lie to the
audience i didn't want to i'd rather come out and do like a month later and when i'm feeling up to it and
tell them what i've been going through so for example when like i say like when my mom died i never mentioned it or when
when my dad went through um his um suicide attempt
i only did a podcast on it once i'd knew he was all right and once
that moment had been and gone um it's difficult when you're a podcast and
you're living a life to to pretend like this isn't happening to you you also turned off all the comments on
your social media channels yeah i just i was just thinking then i was like yeah i realized i can't respond to your tweets
or i can't reply to instagram you know what uh that's an interesting one isn't it
because it's something no youtuber ever does because it's bad for engagement and
i did that on a couple of youtube videos as well and they still trended in the top 10 in the world and i realized well that's
bollocks then oh you need comments for engagement no you don't actually um and you know when you're watching
something on netflix you're not like i need to comment on this so why why is the comment such a big deal but mainly
uh i got to a point where mentally i realized this wasn't helping me and for all
i get lovely comments and and shout out to the fans you know you they make us who we are the negative
ones were so um nasty at times it made me just think
i don't need any of these and there's that old [ __ ] poem um is it rudyard kipling treat these two
imposters just the same you know tre tre people who who who praise you
and people who criticize you i i just thought you can all keep your comments because
i'm going to do what i'm going to do regardless to be honest with you you your numbers you're watching it cool but for my own
mental health i don't want to hear it right watch it enjoy it don't watch it don't enjoy it vote with your fate
i don't need to read this stuff right now because it ain't helping me so uh you know a lot of people
even people on my team were like oh you know you shouldn't do this shouldn't do that and i was like bro if you're going to sit and troll through
these troll through these comments and delete them all hours of the night cool but if you're not i'm turning them off
and it's it's really helped me though it's cause because because it's like i put a tweet out i put an instagram post out i put and
and i'm not going what are the comments saying well are they good are they bad i just go [ __ ] it do you know what i
mean like the video is the video and that's who i really am because i
truly i don't want to sound like it's a weird thing to say i don't give a [ __ ]
but like i do give a [ __ ] in a way if that makes sense like i want you to enjoy it but if you don't
enjoy it cool but if you're then going to try and insult me for it or say anything bad
about me i'm not interested you know what i mean because i know i'm a good person i know i look after the people around me
i know i've got a lot of qualities and i don't need you guys tearing me down right now so
that's sort of the way i look at it just it's so it's so one would say it was it's not surprising
to me because i think i've i've spent a long time talking to people on this topic but it would be surprising to someone viewing
in thinking you know true geordie big man you know says he doesn't give a [ __ ]
swears down the camera all the time and then for him to be affected by the comments
on instagram it feels like it feels it's not but it feels like a contradiction
doesn't it just to to the outside person who's viewing in
but then okay so to be absolutely brutally honest then to really narrow it down for someone who might think that
there is a contradiction it's like um
i don't mind whether you like me or hate me i'm actually fine with that but if you insult me that will hurt my
feelings so i'm choosing not to listen to either side because i truly don't care if you like
me or hate me you know what i mean i don't care i just don't want to hear it because then i will care
yeah and i don't want to have to do that and that's the truth you know what i mean and i'm comfortable with that reality of
some people will like me some people won't like me and i think to be as honest i have from day one and just be
like [ __ ] it put out there like that i'm not i'm not trying to make people dislike me if anything i want to make
people enjoy life forget about their problems have a laugh and it's probably as passionate as i've
come across here sometimes i'm really like a lighthearted person and and
i think one of the main things people say about me when they get to know me is i'm actually really chilled out off camera but when the camera comes on
i know it's time to [ __ ] do what i do and it's like the volume goes up and the opinions become
more powerful more passionate more in i am definitive you know what i mean and i don't know
that's just what i've learned to do that's why i've come to learn about you as well i think the first time i met you i remember thinking god this is such a
such a soft um nice kind gentlemen i am i am soft as [ __ ]
actually but then there's this there's this exterior which is can be quite
can be quite like aggressive at times and itself and it comes back to what we started the podcast on really
is it's that two sides to me like and i kind of called it my mom and my dad but
yeah very much so like there's my mom's side of me which makes me the care and compassionate
interviewer who can pull things out of people i think other people can't and make people feel like it's okay to share that
and then there's the arrogant show-off who
has a huge ego sometimes and uh that is my dad's qualities you know coming out
with me and um i'm i'm lucky to have both of those you know because
it is such a weird combo um but yeah i guess uh
is that it yeah that's it yeah no i genuinely i've been fascinated by you by you for so long and the more you've
shared and the more vulnerable you've been online the more it's it's all started to make sense to some degree
and i'm i'm looking forward to see where we go with it you know because i want to dig deeper i want to i want to i want to be
even more vulnerable i want to i want to go further in the future but i got a gr i like to grow as a person and then let
it come out like in stages because you know like you know how people like us we sort of we're mulling things over on a
daily basis like who am i what am i becoming is this the direction i want to go all these [ __ ] questions and when you
do that every single day and you're laying a brick in the house that eventually becomes like the person you are in your life
three months to someone like that is a lot they can do a lot so yeah i feel like we can
i'm i'm looking forward to finding out that direction and and hopefully making a shitload of
money as i said that's the if anyone any i know a lot of investors listen to this
if you if you uh info art
do you know crazy i think crazy things have happened from people that have listened to this podcast so i know that a certain big brand got a very big deal
off the back oh really yeah yeah big probably worth nine figures
no but you have you've really done me a favor because you know we just for anyone that's listening we had a guest um move
and you didn't have to you know i mean we're all very busy so i do honestly appreciate it i've always we've always got on all right mate and um and i've always um
i like obsessive people who are pushing themselves to the limit and uh i i appreciate what you're doing and
you've always been respectful of the the space that we're in because i feel like you're trying to bridge the gap a bit between mainstream
hence the tv show other stuff but also the space that i come from and uh you don't talk down to people who
are on this side and i think there's a lot of people who are in the mainstream who sort of
they just don't know what the [ __ ] we're doing over here and by the time they do it'll be too late and they'll be swallowed by this
industry so i'm coming for your job i agree man i i look at you as a businessman
and i genuinely and i'm sure a ton of people watching this will as well i just see and i've always you probably know this i've always seen a massive opportunity
because i do think what you do represents the future and i also think the way you present your content and not having
the filter also represents the future because the reason we have watershed and this and the bbc are so scared of
everything even though i'm now on the bbc is um uh is because
they is because of the medium in which we deliver the content tv yeah if you
look at sky social media they're trying to copy us every step of the way now they
they're trying to do what we do you know what i mean and and that's a compliment and they're pulling youtubers in from oh
all the time but when skye set up their own version of the kickoff that was the ultimate compliment and when it went down in flames within
two years it was an even bigger compliment we're going to end the podcast here but we'll talk
we'll talk or talk offline about do you know if there's anyway now i'm a free agent maybe there's some way that i can help you get the value that you've
oh man imagine you were the guy who finally sold true geordi to the mainstream and made it all happen
if you can do that then you'll really prove yourself but we'll leave that we'll we'll let steve bartlett go and do his
dragon's den thing for now okay but if you really want to see if he's good can he sell true geordie
that sounds like a challenge i love how he'll play with your regular yeah i know yeah just to see it you know me as well i'll
be going upstairs now well done on the drugstore thank you

Transcription:

Intro
your heart drops is this it is this the moment the company dies tom bloomfield entrepreneur investor and
founder of monzo i've never actually talked about this before after six months i just thought i can't work with this person i just really it's
really damaging to me and my mental health and so i resigned and the response to that resignation she called nor house meeting and fired
the entire company if i knew then what i knew now i would never have done it really if i knew what the amount of pain and heartache
that would be involved i would never have started but i didn't know that i cry quite a lot
you know i'm not ashamed of that for about three or four seconds i'd forgotten what my life was i was
calm and then three or four seconds later all the memories came back it was just like this crushing weight that really was the moment i sort of
knew this is this is no life there were no other emotions in my life really apart from just anxiety
i mean it was serious by the end we would detect criminals and shut their accounts down customs would turn up sometimes with weapons
and they threatened to turn up with you know a bottle of acid and throw it in someone's face that was tough
[Music]
tom bloomfield what a remarkable entrepreneur one of the uk's recent real success
stories and he and his team managed to disrupt the archaic incumbent banking system at a time when
nobody thought it could be disrupted but man his story is crazy absolutely crazy and the reason why i
started the diary of a ceo is demonstrated perfectly in this podcast it has it all
controversy drama business wars depression
anxiety resilience success and failure and today you're going to
hear a particular business story one that's never been heard before but tom felt that today
and here was the place to share it if you're an aspiring entrepreneur and you want to get to the point in your
life where you're running a hundred million or a billion pound company today might be your warning because as
tom is going to tell you all that glitters is in gold
and the true cost of entrepreneurship the cost that nobody seems to talk about
is sometimes greater than the reward on offer this is one of the most emotional raw
honest vulnerable brilliant gripping conversations i've ever had on this podcast
and i can't thank tom enough for opening up his diary and allowing us to look inside
without further ado i'm stephen bartlett and this is the dire ceo i hope nobody's listening but if you are
then please keep this to yourself
tom why why entrepreneurship i made a very bad employee
Why entrepreneurship?
i've never been promoted and i've been fired i would guess two or three times depending on how you count
why were you fired so often um my first ever job was a consulting firm
in london i actually wasn't fired from this one i was um but i wasn't promoted and they said i was uh highly disruptive
and not in a good way not in a sort of you know tech found disrupts industry more in sort of you know annoying junior analysts can't
follow instructions so i think i'm much i'm much better founder than i am an employee
what was it about you that was disruptive though i want some specifics um whenever i'm i see a problem i think
that this is in common with anyone who starts a business i look at the way something's done and immediately start thinking of better ways to do it
rather than just doing what i'm told i sort of scratch my head and think no it just doesn't make sense to me why are we doing it this way that we could do
this other way which is ten times faster i mean i one of my first ever jobs was to
uh with another analyst go and count all of the jewelry items on a like a massive jewelry website it must be a thousand to do a
tally chart of the price range and this guy i started doing by hand so i scratched my head and wrote a little excel script to script basically scrape
the website and just tally them up and go there's your results and but they didn't want that because they were billing by
the hour and that'd only taken an hour of my time rather than 20 hours and so they could only bill me out for an hour like no no go back
and do it by hand so it that kind of stuff just drove me crazy and i was always just looking for ways to automate ways to do things
better um i guess that's what led me into entrepreneurship have you heard about this idea of first principle thinking absolutely yeah
my co-founder jonas at monzo was just i think he would say first principal thinking at least once a day
because that's that sounds to me like first principle thinking you're looking at conventions way of doing things and thinking well no this is there's a much
easier yeah absolutely you sort of start from physics and build build up from there really how's that how's that voted for you in
your in your personal life though so because life is personal life is full of convention marriage school
follow this path do you know what i mean yeah and i you know i i'm not married but certainly when i was younger i followed that conventional
path i i went to a grammar school i did my exams i got a place at oxford um i even did a master's at oxford so i
sort of i was following that conventional path towards becoming a lawyer i guess but somewhere along the way i started
realizing it probably wasn't for me but definitely in the early years that was my path you
built this hyper fast growing business which was you know funny that you used
the word disrupter which was known as one of the uk's great disrupters and still is known as one of the uk great disruptors um
can you tell me why like because i when i when i speak to shaq do you know shaq shaquille khan about
daniel eck and when i think about your story you both made the decision to take on
just what what many entrepreneurs would consider to be an immovable object you took on the banking system
um danielek took on the in this massive music industry that was seemed to be
immune to change i was talking to shaq about this last week oh really he texted me last night about um about harry's new fund so he i think
that's why he's fresh of mine what gave you the conviction and the
What made you want to disrupt an industry?
confidence that you could take on such a mammoth industry with monzo
um i mean arrogance for naivety and arrogance i think in no small part
um i i'd already built a company called gocardless which is a payment processor so that sort of
taught me that you know three young guys could get access to the payment system and actually move money around
um and banking was a step up from there it was it was more regulated more complicated
but i had the background in payments and i was an early natwest user or rather when i was young and they were
very old i was a network user and i was deeply deeply disappointed and i think like any founder really a
huge sort of dose of naivety you know you look at a problem and think it's probably i think if i knew now what i knew if i
knew then what i knew now i would never have done it really if i knew what the amount of pain and heartache that would be involved i would never
have started but i didn't know that and so i had a huge amount of self-confidence huge amount of naivety
and just assumed that i could figure it out and i think we got a really really long way and i mean the company's still doing fabulously so
i'm incredibly proud of of what we built i find that point about naivety so interesting
because it almost feels like founders like yourself need to be deluded on one end in terms of their own
confidence yep right because if you look at the stats and all the odds they're clearly against you so founders
like yourself seem to be i deleted sounds like a negative word but it's like for me i'm saying in a positive way
almost like deluded to the or naive to the the stats and the probability of this success yeah totally but also self-aware
enough to listen to feedback and to not be blinded by their hypotheses listen to some feedback
i mean a lot of the feedback i got in the early days was this is impossible you can never do it you know go back to your day job um so i
think you do have to be incredibly optimistic as well but a little bit like investing i'm
doing a little bit of investing now i think you if you have a lot of experience the downside is you've seen
these ideas fail again and again and again and it's really hard to then leave that
baggage behind and look at a company um i looked at one yesterday it's like i i've seen that model
fail four times not my you know i wasn't running it others were running it but to um have a fresh enough mind to think
okay maybe the timing's different maybe the founding team's different maybe the technology's changed this can now work so i think actually
the benefit of being naive and even being quite young in your career is you don't have that baggage of knowing how it failed the five times before
um which i i find super interesting when you're looking at founders in your investments now
from your own experience of being a founder yeah what are the attributes you're looking for i mean the really simple one is being
technical being able to write code i think is just a huge huge leg up and all of the founders who aren't technical and there are many
great ones um i think the biggest problem the early stage is finding a technical co-founder so that's just a
an immediate benefit and if if i could talk to my um if i could talk to people in a sort
of if age 12 to 18 i would basically just go and say learn to code you're going to have a
really well paying career for the rest of your life and it'll it's a great step into entrepreneurship
are you technical yeah i learned to code when i was 12 or 13. bit websites um i mean i was never
i studied law not computer science but i can i can code i there's still code i wrote probably in the monza code base somewhere
i think it puts the emojis into the the push notifications but um
yeah so being technical i think is just the easy answer um more fundamentally i think just being
really really determined and resilient seeing as you said an immovable object and either finding a way
sort of round it or over or under it or just straight through it it is some that um being indifferential basically i
think is is the single biggest predictor of success you um you strike me as someone that has great
confidence and i imagine that's come from as you kind of alluded to with go cardless you've built evidence over time
that you could do things so i i i sometimes think of confidence as like a self-reinforcing
cycle either upwards or downwards um i think i was more confident when i was 28 than i am now for sure and i think that
comes with experience um i think you
you take enough knocks that you start to and you realize you don't know i think at 27 28 i thought i knew everything and
now i realize i you know i like to think i know a lot about a lot of things but i realize i don't um and so my i'm still
a confident person i'd guess but if you put me in front of my 27 year old self i think you would see two different people
maybe less naivety maybe that would be yeah exactly yeah i've seen the failures a few times now
because i i was saying that because there's a lot of um a lot of young people in my in my dms that are dreaming big dreams
like yours but they would just never have the confidence or conviction to pursue them so i was wondering is that i'm trying to
get to i guess the crux of what made you so starkly different from every all of the young people that have
at least verbalized equally big dreams i think i'm also just really impulsive
so i i think quite self-confident but i was um i've taken quite big life decisions
without very much reflection um and that's worked out really well i'm you know i'm hugely privileged i
um i've grown up in the uk which i think is enormous privilege compared to a lot you know people in my position but growing up in
in rural africa are not going to have the same opportunity i have great education i had parents who supported me and i knew i could take risk because if
that risk didn't pay off i've have i have that safety net and so um yes i was confident
i think yes i was impulsive but i that was enabled from a place of huge privilege because i could
take the risk and i actually think people in this country um with great supportive
families don't take enough risk in general i think people go into pretty safe
careers in law or consulting or whatever and i think they could
do more interesting things have more impact make more money if that's what drives you by taking more risk i just
don't think they do you know i think i put myself on the risk-loving end of the spectrum um and so i've quit
jobs and moved countries you know with like hours notice um i started go cardless
with matt hiroki because i quit my consulting job to go to a bigger consultancy and in that gardening leave
i just got bored i had three months off and they said let's start a website and i said yes and then my combination said come out and
interview and we did and we got the offer to do y combinator and their investment about three days before my mckinsey start date
so i just sort of said ah this sounds fun i'll i'll do the startup thing instead you launched gocardless you take that to
i think a nine figure valuation uh it's 970 million dollars at their last round
i believe that's what was reported so not quite a billion um okay 10 figures
i mean that is a that is an achievement that most people in their lifetimes would you know would never go near um in of
itself you you then depart go cardless i left early um i we were 35 people you know it was a
the valuation was in the region of 30 or 40 million at the time hiroki my co-founder at time um
i took on the ceo role and it's done just a phenomenal job i'm just ten and a half years old now it's and it's but it's been
that was not an overnight success story that was ten and a half years of really really hard work and huge credit to him and matt also who
who stuck around a lot longer than me i was there for the first three years i think i put something of myself into it but it was i was there for
the beginning not the uh not the middle and certainly not the end why did you leave i wasn't really pat i think it's a great
company but i wasn't really passionate about b2b direct debit software right it helps
you know um lots of different uh suppliers collect money from their customers
um in a sort of back-office way it didn't have a big consumer brand it wasn't direct to consumer really and i didn't
b2b sales i found uh really difficult and frustrating and not something i was good at
and the tech kind of was built um and that had been my role so i sort of i went from there to join a
dating site which is like the polar opposite you know uh all about brand direct to consumer
um really fun every day uh terrible business model that was one of the ones i got fired
from um i was head of growth that we stopped growing um it was bad you were head of growth
and you stopped and the company stopped growing very self-aware and honest for you to admit that um and in fact i saw the charts and it
looked like a rocket ship when i was sort of interviewing there for crazy 48 hour interview process i flew out to new york they showed me some
of their growth charts really sort of hockey stick metrics um and then it all just started to plateau and i
kind of ignored that yeah i said okay that's my job to come in it had flattened out and i joined to kind of
reignite and i didn't i wasn't able to reignite it we sort of plateaued along for about 10 months and then it fell off a
cliff revenue declined 70 um within about two to four weeks
without any kind of macroeconomic this wasn't covered or something this was back in 2014. the world was going
well the dating site just was no longer cool i think um so we rode this wave of
popularity and sort of zeitgeist um it was called grouper it was it was incredibly
sort of cool novel idea back in 2013-14 um and then people just got bored of it
i think so the idea was um it was six of you three three guys and three girls or three guys and three guys if that's your
your preference um or three girls and three girls um but six of you you and two friends
would go and meet three other people so you knew your friends and they knew each other and it would put the group together you need to kind of
go and have a wild night out um rather than traditional dating apps sort of one-on-one this was sort of a group social experience
uh really really fun but um not a great business model you got fired uh yeah most the company
got laid off actually yeah and then you took how long off before you swung back into the next thing
um so i uh about two months but only
about two months um because it was the u.s i was on a weird visa this is not
interesting but basically i couldn't take another job and i couldn't as soon as i crossed the us border my visa expired yes i've yeah
but whilst i was there i could stay there for actually two years or something um so i just spent a summer in new york
chilling out and then came back to the uk and i think about 48 hours after arriving in the uk i met up with
Monzo & Starling rivalry
ann bowdan at starling and agreed to be their cto within about again 24 hours um and there's a lot
written about how i mean how your relationship with and transpired and your relationship with
stalin more broadly transpired what's what are what are the key highlights from that from that journey
choose your co-founder really carefully yeah uh i mean there were 14 of us at
starling and 13 of us started monso it was that stuck
wait say that again 14 people at starling and 13 of you started monzo 13 of those 14 started 13 of those 14
started monday okay including the chairman of the board um the entire management team the office
manager everyone so one one would say well you know tom must have ripped them all away
[Laughter] no no i just didn't want to work with
anne like really i've never actually talked about this before and there was there has been a book i haven't read the book uh the brief version is after six months
i got fired twice in six months um i was never paid i invested my own money which is i lost
um there was never any paperwork which is my fault um and after six months i just thought i
can't work with this person i just really it's really damaging to me and my mental health and so i resigned
and the response to that resignation she called an all hands meeting and fired the entire company
because you resigned yep so i didn't i didn't pull anyone away she fired the entire company that's not true two people happened to
not be in the office so they weren't at the meeting where they got fired so they had to work two weeks notice
because they weren't technically fired but everyone else was fired so we all went to this gin bar to kind of
it was called ask for janus on smithfield market it's a great buy you should go there um we all went there to basically commiserate just think this is crazy
what's just happened and literally it's i think we were there for two days basically in this gin bar playing we we
all played speed chess it was this very nerdy kind of four players we're playing lots and lots of bhs uh just trying to figure out what
we're gonna do and eventually like we can um we think we can do this ourselves um
so it wasn't a case of like you know me leading a coo me pulling the company
away i quit i was just like good luck to you i'm just i'm going to sit on a beach for a while and in response she fired the entire
company which is just i think a reflection of the way she she operates
i can't quite wrap my head around the idea of one person resigning and then firing everybody as a
show of i don't even know no it's not something i would do
where did that leave starling though if they only if they'd lost pretty much everybody other than the two people that didn't manage to make it into work that
day and they also resigned the day after yeah to come and work with us um she hired another management team
another oh really okay and it turned out that we weren't the first team there'd been a previous team as well
oh wow that she'd fired wow and then off so that's that's crazy so
you started essentially monzo was founded in that gin bar yep yep asked
for janice and it's still there we go back for some of our reunions really yeah yeah yeah and how did you feel so
you're fired you know from starling you all convene in this gin bar you spend a couple of
days there you end up um deciding that you're gonna go again together yep and
i guess you feel pretty fired up and charged up to not only disrupt the industry but also to compete with starling though
um it was unavoidable that feeling of [ __ ] them kind of but
we didn't i didn't really know that that she you know and was going to rehire a bunch of people it was over right and there was a big
feeling of like we put quite a lot of work into this actually and like we've had to leave everything behind so we came to
you know rewrite the code base redo all our regulatory submissions really from scratch which was kind of like a
oh i wish we didn't have to do this but we did um [Music] but in a way it actually led us we'd
made the mistakes once the first time so actually that sort of rebuilding process was nice because it was on fresh ground
but yeah it felt like a i mean initially we tried to negotiate with that and say why did you know
why did you step down why do like how can we we don't want to throw away this side for some people they've been there 12
months why are we throwing away 12 months of work and that was a sort of very convoluted week or two um where we almost had a
deal a couple of times and it just similar thing happened you know huge blow up and we just walked away um but no we never i think at monza we
never really thought about the competition actually it wasn't a you know we weren't looking over our shoulder at revolut or styling
it was uh if anything we were looking at the big banks thinking how can we take market share off them
Starting Monzo
co-founders when you started monzo you started with was was paul ripping your only co-founder no uh there
were f uh and it was a it was sort of weird actually because of 13 of us like how do you pick which ones are you
all they were all literally there on day one um so in a sense that was the founding team and they all got stock like not
options actually full you know stock um but the for arbitrary reasons which i can't really remember there were five of us so myself
paul um became deputy ceo and was the chief risk officer he became deputy ceo because the bank of
england looked at me and i think i was 29 or 30 or something i said you have you ever worked in a bank no it's
like and you're applying to be ceo of our newest bank yes and they sort of scratch your head for a bit and said how about this
sort of very experienced guy next to you this co-founder of yours how about they didn't say that they said
we'd like you to find a deputy ceo who's actually run a bank before please and i you know i said paul has won
several banks so he became deputy a ceo gary was cfo um he'd been at
abn amro and mizuho bank i think uh there's a guy called jason who is
sort of more customer marketing and then jonas who is the only one left now was a cto really really talented
developer um so he stepped into the cta how important is that you talked earlier about the importance of business
partners and that being one of your big regrets but how critically important is because you know
definitely one of the biggest mistakes i made in my career was when i was very young just hired anybody because i thought you know like oh you
like i remember being in selfridges one day there was a guy selling prada bags so like you can be a director you know what
i mean because you don't know what you don't know i didn't do that i did i was thinking i
was like 18 so um but i in hindsight i i know it's the most well
for me that core team is the most important thing yeah it's probably the single biggest determining factor of successful
failure in my view yeah so how important what was it for you to assemble
um that skilled co-founding team i mean it was it was luck at monzo
because that was the group that was uh starting and it was sort of like how do we keep this team together and it really was
sort of it felt like everyone's going to disappear into the wind um there was a you know it really was a
debate are we going to really try and do this again or you know is this it we just go back to whatever
we were doing before and so to keep everyone together i think it wasn't a and so i think we were really fortunate we had
such a great um different set of skills um but it wasn't hugely uh sort of
planned no i have a another example of this i started a company when i was at university through young
enterprise and on day one they were like 14 co-found co-founders of this business which is just a ridiculous way to start
a company and within about two we had meetings meetings nothing ever got done so within three months or so
three of us basically said look you 11. you can have right on your seat that's what you want but you know you're not really
here to run a business the three of actually are gonna like work all summer um one of them uh quit his job to do
he just left to work at deutsche bank and then three hours are actually going to try and run a startup here and so figuring out that core team i
think is is really really important to get right and having a group of 14 is not the way to do it really when
you when you started monzo from that i say from the gym but it wasn't really from the gym bar but you see what i mean that was the kind of
i guess the inception moment um what was the driving force for you to go on that journey was it money was
it the chance of you know moving an industry what was it
oh gosh uh insecurity i think for me it was i was much of the reason i started my business
was probably based on deep childhood insecurities about wanting to be rich and yeah like all of that i think tied up
into a bunch of weird sort of deep-rooted psychological problems um
wanting to prove myself wanting to win or wanting to be seen to be successful i
think um that money played a part in it not the driving part but certainly there was a factor there
um a deep hatred for natwest bank um why they're just incredibly
frustrating to use just every everyone who came to work at monto had
one of these horror stories about their banks you know matt one of our early developers went 10p overdrawn with a
a different bank and paid the 10p in um and then closed it counts like i'm
done with this but he'd incurred the chart he didn't know they applied the charge at the end of month so it's like a
five pound overdraft fee that month which then the month after a month after a month after should have rolled and rolled and rolled and rolled and two up
you know two years later they came after him for several thousand pounds because he'd been 10p overdrawn for a day um just
everyone's got those kind of stories and so a big part of it was a frustration that banking worked like that
and a sort of feeling that it didn't have to be like that because we looked at apps like spotify or or uber and they felt magical you know
the i the people who've grown up with that technology it's sort of normal now but i
remember you know i downloaded nap stuff for the first time i remember showing my dad and my uncle you know think of any song you want in
the world yeah type it in and it starts playing and that's that is
magical um but now it's so commonplace and banking for years has just been
you want to change change your address down i've downloaded a form filled in the form assigned and had to post it off
this is for an online bank um so we really just felt quite deeply that it could be
the experience could be much much better do you want to come in and watch this podcast live from behind the scenes if
you do all you have to do is hit the subscribe button and now that the world has opened up you'll be behind the scenes as many of
our subscribers have been i can't wait to meet you and one of the other reasons you gave there as a driving force was wanting to
Wanting to be seen to be a success
be seen to win yeah or can you explain that one not to win i think that's probably the
wrong i i use that phrase but i to be seen to be a success i think like
validation yeah kind of yeah you know that's to my family and my friends and my school and teachers and um
you've already been a success though with gocardless did you yeah i had a bit but go kardas
circa 2014 2015 was still relatively unknown it was doing
well but not it wasn't a breakout success yet in the way it is today i think um just on that feeling of
wanting that validation from friends because we can all relate to that like i'm i'm playing devil's advocate but i know exactly what you mean you're on a tv
show exactly exactly and i'm doing a podcast 17 cameras right now um but uh but just drilling down into
that in hindsight was that a feeling that you think could have ever been attained um was it a mirage
i think i have attained it yeah oh i know i don't mean i'm the world's big success that's not what i mean i mean
that like i've tasted what that feels like that's mixing my metaphors there i felt what
that feel you know i've experienced that thing that's sort of like being in the newspapers and that sort of
um people using in monzo card and that stuff and it's
somewhat rewarding but it's not like i and i don't feel anymore i think what i'm trying to say is sort
of that need to prove myself has sort of disappeared actually um and so either i've realized
it was a stupid goal to start with or like i got far enough along that i sort of like take that off the list and sort of
thought you know that sort of it was fun but it's not my overriding purpose now um and i'm not i'm your next question
what is your purpose i'm not sure i have one it's sort of more like living day to day and enjoying life and i
i was never good at that i've really really driven from a very very young age so i worked incredibly hard for my exams and
my you know through oxford and starting companies um and very rarely paused to enjoy the journey
or the you know the cliche the small things in life the you know the choose your cliche right like how your
coffee tastes in the morning or the sort of the tweeting of the birds in the in the trees
and that stuff now i'm am spending more time kind of being more i guess mindful and kind of living in the moment do you have to like
reprogram yourself to get there though because i feel like society well for me anyway is um kind of conditions you to to
chase climb promote move up strive and and you're kind of deferring your
happiness to towards some future achievement accomplishment yeah so how did you get to the point where you just
enjoy it what it you know life for what it is in the moment was it reprogramming yeah i guess like
you know like you i i left my company i didn't um and that was really really hard and that was not a
that was um you know deep deep anxiety and bordering on depression and
uh like i i i wouldn't use the words rock bottom but like it was not a happy time and so
then recovering from that uh and i took a year off and you know travel around europe went kite surfing
and learned the language and all this kind of you know cliches um and that experience now
leads me uh whenever i i still get these like urges like sort of um they my local mp passed away
a few months ago and there was a by-election i was like why did i why did i stand for that seat and i could be an mp and then maybe i could you know
maybe it could be the prime minister and then i'm like but then what
crap yeah exactly and you know i think like i could start a company
and then you know what if it goes well and then i end up running a big company again so uh yeah just like a couple of sort of
those brain cycles and i'm like no what am i what am i thinking um i quite quickly come back to like i'm
really enjoying my life at the moment i'm lucky enough that i'm financially sort of independent now i have a great
group of friends like why um why do i want to go and make myself miserable again um where does that narrative that voice
come from so many people have that way because it's funny because you're saying right i'm i'm a i'm at a stage of peace now
i wasn't before but you still have that yearning or that voice that comes and goes come on tom do it
um it's that it's that sort of i guess disruptive kind of um i see something that's not working
and it's incredibly frustrating and i go i could i could make that work better i'm um
i'm uh reluctant i've talked about this before i'm working in the in the i'm
volunteering the vaccination program and it sounds like a sort of i'm proud of doing it and it's like a great feeling kind of being part of
a team that's uh hopefully helping kind of the country
get out of this lockdown rubbish but even there there are so many things that just drive me absolutely nuts
um and i think that's probably nhs sort of more broadly i think the smart use of
technology could really really improve the way we deliver care to everyone really medical care and so i
keep thinking i just want to like just give me you know experience um i just yeah why
can't i just come in and fix it for a you know it's incredibly you know i've struggled with a company of 2000 people the nhs employees i think
a million and a half people or something so um probably not for me but there's
always that like your question you know what what is that drive it's the
looking at something that's like clearly broken at least to my naive eyes um and that feeling that i feel like
along with a small group of smart people i could make it better okay quick one if you've listened to this podcast you
know i'm the biggest fan of fuel in the world and last week huel released hule's brand new
protein powders and i have to tell you the salted caramel huel protein powder which only
has a hundred calories in it roughly and 20 grams of protein has become my
go-to drink and you can if you're watching this on youtube you'll see i'm going to open that it's almost almost nearly done and i've
had it for a week um but i've been looking for a source of protein that is also low calories and
that tastes like heaven on earth and i finally found it so if i was to put my word
to you next to a product it would be hewls salted caramel new protein powders 20
grams of protein 26 of your vitamins and minerals in case you're not nutritionally complete or sort of
getting all of your vitamins and minerals and that 105 calories in a serving and it tastes like
heaven on earth what were the the good times at monzo the times you look back most fondly
What were the good times at Monzo?
small team so sub 100 [Music] being able to um
go from a kind of an idea or a customer insight or something like a conversation with a customer
about a problem to figuring out a kind of product feature to very quickly prototyping and building
that and launching it and then seeing people use it um and then tell their friends about it that very quick iterative
product development cycle i love um and a lot of the brand and marketing
stuff uh i when i was at gocardless i didn't believe in brand uh which is a ridiculous thing to say um
and i you know you has a marketing background that's almost offensive i guess but it's like no this is you know this
doesn't this doesn't exist really people um and then the day when i worked at the dating site that really opened my eyes
to the kind of power of human psychology and brand and and mission and values and we really took a lot of that into
monsoon and that it it was just astonishing so we started out even before we had a
product talking a lot about our mission and some of our values like transparency and kind of community orientation
and that worked so incredibly well um so yeah it was working with a small team
to build the brand build the product get into users hands really quickly and then see them enjoy it i've talked about
this a lot before that feeling of um standing in line at a coffee shop and seeing the person at the counter paying
with a the hot coral monzo card and then having the bartender or the the server say you know i've got one of
those as well and then listening to that conversation as sort of an anonymous bystander that's just incredibly rewarding feeling
that you've had a hand in in creating something that's that people are enjoying so much
let's dig into the point about brand then marketing because monzo really was a uk stand-up brand i think everybody
knew it um even if they didn't use it because of its disruptive values because of it it felt
unconventional in everything it did i mean even the card was completely unconventional intentionally yeah tell me
tell me what the secret was to monzo's branding success
um for authenticity i think um it was
we had a couple of early marketing hires who who didn't work out um and they were very senior people from
very very big companies who came in and they were a lot older and cayman is sort of like you know
how the kids going to think about this and we were like we are the kids um so we had a very early community
manager called tristan thomas who was there from almost in the first few months uh he just very recently left to start his own company
and he's now he was a vp of of um marketing running a massive team with a massive budget by the end
but he was a 23 year old when he started you know 23 24 year old um and i worked on it a lot hugo our
head of design worked on a lot and it was um it was just an authentic
representation of i think who we were and what we believed more than anything and we we did want to
be different from the big banks we intentionally positioned ourselves as a part so the hot roll card every other bank
was you know blue or purple or kind of a shade of black basically so like how far come from that can we get
and the big banks were very impersonal you know you you never felt like you were talking to a human and so we everything we did was human and
transparent um we we shared a lot of internal information that everyone you know we
published our product roadmap this is what we're going to be working on for the next two years which people thought were with bonkers but it
that was a way of building trust and humanity in opposition to these big sort of faceless banks
um these all sound like first principles yeah i mean none of tristan had never worked
in marketing before his previous job was at a refugee camp in in the middle east
i'd never really worked in marketing i'd spent nine months at a dating site but we yeah we um we came up we thought about
these principles and it felt like the kind of company we wanted to run and so
um we did and it worked really well um yeah with without any experience it goes
to show the risk of reading marketing books no genuinely i've always thought this because i've never studied marketing or
did any degree you know our business was did really well in in the marketing industry but i think it did well because we hadn't
read those books and we hadn't been sort of diluted or polluted by conventions idea of how yeah i think this today when i go when i
work and go into these family offices and i'm working on the marketing plan that the ceo often
will want to hire someone who's done marketing in that industry for 20 years and you immediately feel that that's the
fastest route to not standing out at all and not having any point of difference yeah yeah it depends what you want to
achieve if you are a family office or if you're managing the wealth of you know generational rich families then
perhaps you do want to look trustworthy in like everyone else if you're a challenger bank appealing to
21 to 25 year olds maybe you want a different approach i don't think there's a right answer but i think authenticity gets you
a really really long way whoever your target demographic is i am one of the things so we talked a little
What were the bad times at Mozo?
bit there about the your best times at monzo and i wasn't surprised to hear that it was when the company was small um because i've
heard that before but i also understand the feeling um and your worst times
um least enjoyable times least enjoyable uh i never liked fundraising we did that
a lot i mean i and i had to i think monzo's raised something like 600 million and i probably did 400 of that um that was
always tough uh and you only hear about the really quick round though you know the ad funding yeah we hit a billion the round where we
hit a billion valuation was very very fast um and very competitive so it was that easy but all the other rounds were real
slog so fundraising was never fun we had a weird time with the press where
they spent the first three or four years almost not idolizing us but certainly building us up you know the new kind of
uh the the sort of next great hope almost um and we could almost do nothing wrong which is not healthy and then we got big
enough and it flipped overnight and just everything we did was we'd get like
vitriol for in a way that i i mean i can understand it because it drives readership right and it's um there's a
point in time where the telegraph would put monzo in the headline at least every day even if it was a
story about one of our competitors it would be monzo competitor blah doing just like what
why and i i eventually sort of called out the journalists on this and took him for a beer and it's like look
come on tell me what's going on and he's like look every time i put your name in the headline or rather he's like look it's
my subs who do i i write the article they choose the headline um or my editor but every time they do that we just get
way more subscribers it's like you know sorry um but it it was really the entire from the bbc to
the telegraph to everyone it felt like a pile on in a way that didn't seem
fair uh really and it's i'm not to say that we never did anything wrong we absolutely did but even the good stuff
we did got um got negative headlines um and i think that's a peculiarity of the
british press in particular sort of building something up until it's like big enough to tear down
and that was just so confusing um yeah that was tough at one point we had
a bbc camera crew outside our office um and this was when we
we'd grown big enough we had um a small a small minority of people using monzo for financial
crime basically with money laundering for scams um and we'd have to freeze their account and we
weren't allowed to tell them why we'd froze in their account we'd sort of send the money back to where where wherever it had come from was a
very frustrating experience really and it's quite strict in the law that you have to shut the account you can't tell a person
so it's it's a really bad customer experience um but watchdog were running a program about this you know monzo
freezes accounts and they brought us a series of accounts that we'd frozen um over a series of several weeks saying
you know this is we've got you and we sort of brought the editor of the program and said look here is the
here's the criminal background of the person whose account we've frozen are you you're really going to run a program about about this
it's like oh no okay okay okay this happened 12 times and every every one of the times we showed we the evidence and like okay
you know and on the it was the 13th or 14th like that was a 50 50. you know we block the
account we stand by it but we don't have cast iron proofing like great we've got you so bbc camera crew
turns up and they'd commissioned a block of ice an enormous ice sculpture with a frozen
monzo card in the ice that they dumped outside our office and put a camera crew there for the day uh to see if they could find anyone
walking past it or you know to watch the thing melting which was like
what's going on you know i was like i started this company to try and sort of build a better bank and somehow
the bbc is camped outside my office trying to like i don't know i don't know what they're
trying to do um drive drive viewership um but that was deeply
annoying this whole press thing is i've heard this a million times and it terrifies the [ __ ] out of me because
you know joining dragonstone you join i was like oh my god amazing and then someone told me i think it might be one of the other dragons that's
been there for nearly two decades said here's what's here's what here's what's gonna happen is they're going to build
you up to a point where you're interesting enough to tear down again and hearing you say the same thing terrifies
the life out of me and it happens in everything tech startups um facebook
uh yeah i mean facebook's a great example of it but it happens to sports stars it happens to politicians it
happens to you know singers yeah yeah what advice would you give
someone that's don't read the good stuff or the you know just ignore it all basically i think
it's all yeah just ignore it all the hype and yeah because when they're
good when they're writing good stuff that's that's overblown as well that's not real life the bad stuff's also not true so
just i just ignore it all and did that have an impact on your mental health the worst parts of the press coverage
it didn't help and i stopped reading it you know i genuinely stopped reading it and i'd have friends sort of come and say it you know on a
saturday or sunday they'd read the weekend papers and it's like are you all right it's like i'm fine
what have i done that's the worst because then you've got to justify to people you care about yeah and make them not care like i'm
fine like okay just don't read the times this weekend it's like yeah never read the times um that was annoying but i don't know
so yeah the um the press was not fun um investment's not fun regulation got
really really tough by the end because we were a bank and ultimately if we fail the government has to step in and refund
everyone their money so the rules there were very very strict and because we got so big
so early and weren't profitable that that got quite tough um and i'm going to go through a list of
the bad things now the f i will stop on the final one which was um just organizational politics when you
get to we were almost 2 000 people and when you're 100 or 200 people you can know everyone and you can
you develop a really close culture really a sense of team spirit you know everyone you can know everyone's names um you get to 2000 people and you don't
and it um you get subcultures so teams develop their own sort of internal
narrative as to why they exist and what they're for and sometimes like we're saving the company from this other team over there and it's
you know becomes um really not collaborative actually and you get uh especially with some sort of quite
senior people start building their little fifedems
and you get this just weird politics and rivalries going on that i'd never worked in the company for it's like total it was totally uh
new to me um especially when you're this is unfair not everyone but sometimes when you hire people from
big banks they've grown up with that um uh culture toxic culture frankly
um and they bring it to a place like monzo and everyone's like what that what's weird what's going
on here but it definitely changed um and that was having to deal with that was was tricky
you talked about not being profitable i've heard you talk about you know that being one of the um
Was the business model of Monzo bad?
probably in hindsight one of the things you should have thought about more in the early days which was like the commercial model or the business model
of the bank yep is that fair yeah absolutely yeah um and we thought about it for sure
i think what we didn't do was make the hard decisions to uh to turn the corner earlier like we
thought about it and it was this was not it's not like we um blindly ran into
unprofitability we took a series of actions we knew they were loss making but we um did that in order
to to acquire users without paying so basically we swapped marketing spec we had no
marketing spend but instead we ran um uh like like operational losses
so we'd give away features to customers that would cost us money to get more customers because it meant our marketing budget
was zero and we grew to five or six million people with we probably spent less than 10
million on marketing total that's an average cost per customer of one pound 50. great
right so um but that that's that hides operational losses that's our
real marketing budget was giving away things like html withdrawals for free for example and we just didn't take the hard
decisions to turn some of those things off when we um we got to a certain size and it cost us way too much
free cards yeah expensive
with that it's like the long tail it's you know it's the um the very small number of people who are ordering 20 or 30 cards a year
most people they order zero to one that's fine but some people just lose their card every weekend and they get struggled no
problem just order another one it'll be here tomorrow morning uh and that's just annoying and costly
the other thing though um so we should have paid more attention to reducing costs and
taking a hard decision to drive revenues earlier uh we consciously didn't but part of it was avoiding those hard
decisions the other half of it though is weird um
i've thought about it a lot it's basically how you get almost self-reinforcement from your
investors so you run a business a certain way you get to a certain scale and you present it to a set of investors
and the ones who are more or less the ones who agree with what you've done and think it's the right approach we'll invest
and the ones who think you're bonkers will not invest and they'll go to someone else the problem is that becomes
self-reinforcing because they like what you did before so like yeah just do more of that
and it can become um a bit of an echo chamber where you just get the group of investors around the table who are all
big supporters who all really believe in the model and there's not really anyone being like uh you know you're running
um you should really think about this other stuff and a really a really smart thing i've
heard which i didn't do and i i hope i will will have the humility to do in future is to sort of
pick out the smartest investors you can or smarter's advisors or other other founders
and ask them why you think your business will fail and then really try to think deeply
about that rather than i think the natural tendency is just like ah you know whatever they don't know what they're talking about i'll just the people who think i'm brilliant i'll
listen to them um but that can become i don't think you grow as much from that so
really finding the doubters even the not so much the haters but the doubt is certainly and interrogating them about your
business and really trying to think through how you can solve those problems i think that would
have helped us a lot hindsight's a wonderful thing yeah now you have those some of those answers in hindsight and
what were what are those answers in hindsight that you wish you'd um
you'd known sooner so one of them's obviously you know getting to a profitable business model sooner making those transitions
profitable business model um cutting costs driving revenue by taking hard decisions to sort of limit some of the
free features and charges some of the things we gave for free i think she'd done that way way earlier um that's the biggest any cultural
decisions i knew there was a merging of the startup guys and the uh banking people which i guess that's necessary
right yeah i struggled to get the banking license without that and you've seen you can see that at revolut you look at all their recent senior
highs over the last year or two and it's big wigs from the big banks because they're trying to get a banking licence so
i think that's sort of inevitable um and you pay a cost for that you pay the price um customer service is always
one of big one of our uh investors who shall name remain nameless um was a bit of
contrarians basically said the quality of your customer service is too high
and it's costing you too much and it's going to be the you know it's going to be the weight around your neck for the next whatever 10 years until you can slash
and i'm not sure if he was right or not actually um that's when i still debate um i've
noticed revel revolute's uh customer service has declined month almost month over month for the
last two years i've been a customer there on monday but revolut they've made a real significant
it feels like effort to either cut back on customer service costs or just because they've got more users
they're struggling yeah but i've from when i joined revolu it was just amazing yep and two years almost three
years on it's just awful yeah and i think monzo's hopefully it's not awful but i think it
was amazing at the start and i think it's now variable i think sometimes it's really really
great but sometimes you end up waiting a little too long sometimes it's a little too hard to talk to a customer service agent arguably
i think i still think it's pretty good but in the early days it was spectacular it was the number one thing our
customers talked about was the service by far you'd look on social media whatever it was just
and if we'd have the revenue to support that i think we could have continued it's not it's not very expensive it cost us about
12 or 13 pounds per customer per year to provide that and i think the benchmark that everyone's aiming for is less than that
clearly and so the drive is always to automate more to put you know chatbots in to do whatever there comes a
point in your journey with monzo where you realize that you're no longer enjoying it for me in my business
it was kind of like a there wasn't a point it wasn't a day when i woke up it was kind of a compounding of several issues that
slowly wore me down yes uh uh yes it was that plus covered
and covered it was like knockout punch but yeah it was four or five four five six issues that
meant for the last year or two i wasn't having a good time really and i talked to my board about it i talked to investors about i think
hiring really good senior leaders was part of the potential solution and
we didn't do that fast enough um we've got some great great senior leaders in now
um and i sort of wonder what would have happened if we could have got those people in a year or two earlier um possibly they wouldn't we wouldn't
pay them enough they wouldn't have joined um i did talk about this a ts our new ceos like
if you'd have come five years ago i would have joined five years ago i was like go back in time um uh but yeah it was
four five six issues and then covered and that was just i mean for so many people in the world that was horrific for us our revenue
declined at least 50 percent within about a week or so uh the cost base was the same revenue goes down 50
we were already lost making so now it's sort of we had a funding we had 100 million funding round lined up
to close on the monday and on friday before london went to lockdown and all the terms she's got pulled
so again retrospects uh hindsight is 2020. um everything has bounced back
even like the in the investment market private investment and public investments are stronger than it was pre-covet and
so people just take these really short-term decisions in a kind of in a shock in a crisis destroy a
ton of value for themselves um and you know six nine 12 months later everything's bounced back even harder i
just don't understand it um but anyway covid was definitely the straw that broke the camel's back
and about six weeks into that six to eight weeks which is like i'm i'm working seven days a week i'm not
sleeping here this is just you know i need sort of throw the towel in almost you know i need to i need to
be subbed out had you been thinking about that conversation for some time before you got to the point where you
Leaving Monzo
you approached the board with the decisiveness that this has been done i'm not even thinking about i've been
talking to them about it for a year or two yeah not the whole board but yeah two members our chairman and uh
one of our lead investors absolutely we'd we'd had multiple conversations about me not enjoying the role as it was then
configured and the answer was like okay let's reconfigure a role let's bring people around you let's because
because we're growing so quickly and the way that senior hiring works by the time you realize you've got a gap
it's 12 to 18 months before you can actually fill that gap and you know muggins here ends up doing to be fair all of my senior team
were doing more than one job trying to fill the gaps but um that was the biggest problem for me that
we didn't have the right senior leadership in place so i was working several jobs uh and so the conversation was always
okay well we'll fill these roles we'll fill these roles but by the time you filled that role this other role over there the person who's doing really well at 200
you're now 2000 people and the person's burnt out or you know not doing well and you have to replace them and so
it was like whack-a-mole [Music] and i think that was the biggest contributing factor but those are
conversations i very regularly had with um board members and investors do you think those conversations were treated
with with urgency no from from either yourself or the board no
absolutely not it was always like oh yeah oh yeah we'll just hire you know we'll hire the person it'll
be fine or i'll just stick it out for another couple of years and it'll all be fine and eventually
it's like no i've got a couple of weeks
yeah i think a lot of them did a huge amount i mean eileen the one of
our investors from passion personally put in so much time to support the company and support me and
i'm really really grateful for that but ultimately um yeah we just didn't
hire see great senior people fast enough that if i can find one root cause it was that
do you think if you'd gone to the board with more urgency and decisiveness yourself though you would have been taken more
seriously if you said listen i'm going to go next week
if these issues aren't fixed because i i'm asking these questions from same reasons as uh i said before i
went through the same thing where i approached the board i said i've got some problems here these are the issues can we fix them and it was probably a little bit of lip
service yeah until the day that i resigned yeah i don't know i think a lot of people put
a lot of effort into fixing it ultimately was like on me to fix no one else is going to come in and hire a really top senior team for me it's
that's sort of my job um [Music] so i don't know i also i do wonder
whether you really could have got those great senior people in at a earlier stage the analogy's sort of like
a football team you're starting in the i don't know what the fourth division now is cool but you know you're there and you get promoted
and you want to hire someone for the third division but everyone's like oh go and hire ronald it's like ronaldo is not coming to play
for a third division team you know so it's a constant process of upgra like gradually upgrading until you get into
premiership um and even then you know you're you're charleston athletic or something
uh so i just think it's tough i don't i don't think there's a magic bullet actually a
quick one since leaving social chain a couple years ago as you probably know i've kept my options open i've worked in a series of companies as
a consultant as a creative director as an advisor as an investor but i've kept my options open and that is about to change because
i'm about to embark on my next chapter building my next company and i'm going to tell you guys about it first but i
wanted to talk about something related to that when i'm building this new company as i have been over the last three months
we need everything from websites to logos to editing work done to some sort of admin
stuff done and it's crazy that even me even though i have a lot of financial resources i still
turn to fiverr.comfiveerr.com to help me with freelance services for
me it is a godsend if you're scaling your business if you're looking to start a project or you're developing yours
try fiverr.com if you go to f i v e r r dot com slash ceo
pick a service try it and then send me a message and let me know how you found it i'm gonna be paying for five people to
have their services done on fiverr.com so go to that website now links in the bio and let me know what you think
Not sleeping because of the stress of the business
you said you weren't sleeping working seven days a week talk me through those moments when you when
things were have you experienced that i've oh definitely experienced
um anxiety and not sleeping well and an issue usually like payroll or
some kind of investor issue plaguing me for days and days and then getting sick yeah and
why have i got a cold i never get it cold and then yeah oh of course because there's no [ __ ] money in the bank or something
yeah um similar things uh we talked about a little earlier sort of that depletion of emotional energy so
that you have a you know there's a sort of a problem there you need to make a decision about maybe it's like one of your senior teams not working out you
know you have to fire them basically but like if i do that that's going to cause a bunch of other knock-on problems i don't want to
deal with yet because i'm i'm just trying to close this like 100 million pound funding round so just let me focus on that and and the
um the realization was sort of when the round closes when the money's in the bank and that weight lifts
you then look at all these other problems and they're very very easy actually like you re-energize quite quickly and able to
take those decisions but while there's just too many things sort of resting on your shoulders you it piles up and piles up and piles up
and so for me yeah it was um waking up at sort of four or five in
the morning often with um often with problems in the cold light of day are
relatively easy to solve but this the conscious part of your mind gets turned off when you're sleeping it's a sort of
subconscious like irrational part that blows the thing into a unsolvable problem and the next more you
can whatever you write it down you come back to the next day and go that that's ridiculous why am i even worrying about that
um so it's not a rational thing it's a much more of an emotional um at least for me emotional response
but because you're tired you make worse decisions and because you make worse decisions you end up creating more problems to yourself um
you know and the solution is easy to say and hard to do which is exercise more and you know stay off
alcohol and get to bed early and don't have your phone in your bedroom and like turn off your computer at the weekends
all this sort of stuff you know you should do um but when each one gives way the next
one's harder you know you haven't slept well so you don't want to go to the gym in the morning and because you look at the gym you blah blah blah blah blah so you can
either get into i think really good reinforcing cycles or very destructive kind of negatively reinforcing cycles
because you knew your mind was going to do that when you fell asleep did you upon getting in bed and laying down
presumably you knew that your mind was then going to run off with all of the thoughts and worries did that make that
process just before you fall asleep quite unpleasant yes and you sort of
going to sleep almost inevitably knowing you're going to wake up at 4 am is quite annoying to say the least
and the
it's a very depressing thing to say but sometimes when i did sleep a sort of
full night i'd wake up at 7 8 9 a.m whatever and for about three or four seconds
i'd forgotten what my life was like i'd forgotten what i was doing what my job was all the
pressures and i was like i was calm and i was sort of you know not stressed not anxious and then
three or four seconds later all the memories came back it was just like this crushing weight that that feeling was just terrible and
that really was the moment i just sort of knew this is this is no life you know i want the life three seconds ago where i can wake
up and not be worried and not be stressed and not feel like just anxious the whole time like there
would there were no other emotions in my life really apart from just anxiety that was a ten out of ten and every
other emotion felt like it's a the volume had been switched down to one out of ten because like anxiety was just 10 out of 10.
and that was no fun how long did that last a year and a half two years maybe [ __ ]
you know god i can imagine two years not fun and
i split up with my girlfriend as a result of it it's like mate you know my life's [ __ ] what can i do about it let's like one by one try and change
things um and rather than changing the job first i changed a girlfriend first um and that was really tough um
[Music] i left monzo and within about a week or
so i was sleeping perfectly through the night and it really just all went away yeah and now i you know i am
uh i hesitate to use the word happy but yeah i happy like content calm relaxed like i find things
to do with my day that i find you know that i enjoy and and suddenly like the small those
like emotions that were one out of ten when they're not being crushed by a ten out of ten anxiety like sort of start to
bloom back which is cool which um i like this is life yeah yeah
How was holding down a relationship while running the business?
the girlfriend topic i find compelling because i i've also struggled in that department forever yeah um
how was it trying to hold down a relationship whilst also this business just being this crushing
force in your life terrible uh and i really um
uh we we're um good friends still but she was a lovely kind considerate
person and i was just not a nice person to be around a lot of the time just like really um short-tempered
like inconsiderate and like intolerant basically intolerant there's something that was like tiny
tiny things that a normal person would just be like that's just a cute quirk i feel like that's so irritating you know
um and so we just ended up not enjoying spending time together sadly um and i i think she was doing a
lot to try and you know make our lives together wonderful and i was just a monster
because my primarily because my work was so [ __ ] um
which i regret a lot it's interesting so when um what i
noticed about myself is when i had a girlfriend at the height of my uh ceo [ __ ]
um i would make her feel incredibly lonely even if i sat next to her because i you know i was selfish and self-absorbed and
i did wasn't interested in anything but my own problems and i also didn't particularly want to talk to her about them because that was just
i felt like it would grow the problem if i then went home and just brain dumped on her yep um yeah
do you think it's possible for a ceo that's in a high intensity situation to
have a successful early-stage relationship i mean i never managed but i believe it
is possible i've seen other people do it and then i think um part of it is maturity
and um uh detachment but not in a bad way and i
mean detachment from your job being able to compartmentalize so paul one of my co-founders a little bit older
um and i think he had a really great ability to sort of come to work and be fully present in work and then to go home and just
totally switch it off as soon as his head hit the pillow he was asleep he had he and his wife run a lovely alpaca farm
in the north of england and he was just really good at having sort of of compartmentalizing his life i think
similarly with ts the new um the new ceo at monso he's an older guy um i think he's in his 50s and has run
big banks before and is you know finds it challenging and exciting and a little stressful but i
think he's able to go back to his family and sort of switch that part of his brain off and i could never do that i it was all-consuming uh sort of
emotionally that i would never even on holiday i could never switch off the nagging feeling about the
work um so towards the end there was a little bit more detachment and talking to jonas
my co-founder as well i think he took everything so personally in the early days and sort of six seven years in you you
there's a bit of detachment um and i think that's actually really healthy to realize that your
entire person is not intrinsically linked to this company and you can leave and the company will continue and
maybe the company fails and you'll still survive and that's sort of um by the way i think monzo's doing
incredibly well it's not going to fail um but just that emotional realization that you're not like the same being
as your company uh would have been helpful earlier on i heard you had a red phone in your bedroom or something is that true yes
The âred phoneâ in your bedroom
why was it red um it was more like a sort of um childish
pink color actually right the red pho is probably a dramatization i think i described as a red phone it was a pink it was an old nokia
um uh and why so the reason why um is first of all
because to help sleep i didn't keep my own mobile in my bedroom
so i turned it off and i had it charging out the hallway which i think is i encourage everyone to do i think it's great because you know
the first thing i used to do when i wake up and sometimes i do it still it's like you grab the phone and start and that's just not healthy so not
having the phone in your eye lasting at night not having the first in the morning just charge it in another room um that is a great step unfortunately
when there are really significant problems at three or four in the morning and it doesn't happen often but you know it
happened occasionally you need to be able to wake the senior management team up and the ceo up to make the hard calls um and so that
phone was like the back phone if something went wrong that would be the only one in my room
the only no one had the number it was linked to our automatic alerting system so if at monzo if something went wrong you
sort of click a button it would escalate and if it got escalated far enough the ceo gets woken up but only that system had the phone
number this and so if it rang it was because the bank was down um
and that happened a handful of times not you know not every week but every two or three months sometimes um
what an awful phone call yeah oh yeah yeah and it wasn't a person it was a you know it's a robot saying like wake up
there's an incident you are required to blah blah blah it's like ugh yeah that it's horrible because you can
see your hand gesture then how it felt yeah the heart your heart drops and you know it's going to be
the rest of your week if not your month is going to be ruined and it's you don't know if this is like the one that's going to kill the company we had
a few like that it's like you know it's is i think a lot of founders have like those moments like
oh [ __ ] is you know is this it is this the moment the company dies um and there's often not a lot you can
do actually as a you know your engineers running around trying to fix a problem and you getting stuck in is not going to
help help things so you're sort of almost like a helpless sideline observer um you know you have
to make the phone call to the board and to the investors and sometimes to the regulators at four in the morning um
but yeah you're in a pretty helpless situation yes there was a red phone it was more like a pink nokia okay but it sounds
better it sounds way better in the movie it'll definitely be a red phone yeah
um it'll be in like a box with like a maybe a code on it um i find that what you just said they're really interesting so there's
because i've been through that those key moments where you're not sure if your company is going to survive and it feels like the answer or the
determinant factor is actually outside of your control yep so it's someone else's decision whether your company
survives yep did you have many moments like that where it felt like it was someone else's decision if your company was going to survive
an investor or yeah and not loads but a handful so early investment rounds um
it was binary if we don't raise the money we we're folding the later rounds are more like the money's going to come in at some
evaluation um uh or some early outages we had a
really very bad we were still a prepaid card at the time and one of our suppliers which connected us to the mastercard
network went down it really went down hard for about 10 or 11 hours we didn't know it was going to be 10 or
11 hours it just was down and we phoned them up and they were panicking and didn't have a they didn't know when it's going to be back and so
you know we had about 300 000 cars at the time sort of like this could be two months like all the
cars could not work for two months now or rather it would take us two months to rebuild this thing um and that yeah we're just sitting
there thinking this is we it's our fault in the sense that we picked the supplier but beyond that like
they've just [ __ ] up right then you know i it it was it was totally ridiculous what
had happened in retrospect but um yeah that was uh real like
we can't do anything we literally yeah we're sitting there on customer support the entire company we pulled in on a sunday to respond to
all the customers and to proactively learn all this good stuff but that was a sort of we don't know if
this is even gonna come back online outside of the business and the chaos of the business what was your life
What was your life like outside of the business?
at that point um fairly normal
um we had a pretty good culture around sort of work-life balance at monzo um
you know mostly i was working five days a week unless we were fundraising i guess and i traveled probably a week every month
mostly for fundraising but i had a really close group of friends mostly from
you know growing up mostly from my secondary school actually i lived with my girlfriend we live you
know we lived in a big house with friends we cooked a lot um i took up pottery i i exercised a
fair amount it was very very normal not really nothing extraordinary but i wasn't working 100 hours a week for sure
i was doing 45 50 55 hours um really not a the time pressure was
not the problem it was the mental like the mental load the inability to switch off outside those hours and then boom
The road to leaving Monzo
pandemic yeah comes around term sheets get pulled yeah you're sat there you've already you
know it's by the sounds of it you're already on the verge of well you already weren't happy with how things were going and then that's the i
guess the straw that broke the camel's back for sure when you realized that you were going to depart
and you knew there was a date you knew people were gonna know you knew was going to come out in the press what were the range of emotions
and were sadness one of them yeah definitely um 80 was just like i can breathe again
so it was overwhelmingly positive for me i and i'm not afraid to say that um
and so i don't want to build it up and you know it's a sort of negative thing really but there were 20 things
like sadness that i was leaving a team
that i really really liked overwhelmingly um guilt that i'd recruited many of these
people and some of them had joined to come and work with me um and that i was leaving them to kind
of fix the mess um yeah guilt i think was more than sadness
were there tears shed um i cry quite a lot
i cried as well when i i went through a range of emotions my first one was i was angry a little bit because as i said i'd been given a lot i felt
what felt like lip service yeah so i was annoyed at first but then when i realized that i was actually gonna send the email
yeah it was like gratitude yeah and some kind of like sad or happy tears yep
um i uh so i did an all hands i announced it at a on a video call with like 1500 people or something
and i definitely welled up at one or two points there um in a in a genuine way but um
what i have learnt over the last few years is that um vulnerability is the best way to
inspire is confidence trust sort of become a leader to show if it's genuine you know you
can't sort of you know the fake tears but genuinely like showing your emotion and showing your
vulnerability and showing your screw-ups is such a powerful way
to inspire followership um and so what it doesn't i wasn't
i wasn't afraid of that or embarrassed by you know i was sort of welling up on a call with 1500 people but it wasn't the first time i'd like
practically cried in front of the company um you know i'm not ashamed of that so
and then the uh the weightlifting yeah great
no one can [ __ ] email you and you know um it was great actually it wasn't it was great but then we were in the
midst of a lockdown and i was my house was having building work done
so i had to get out of my house with four housemates we went to a farmhouse in devon
which was idyllic but everyone else was working i had no job it was in the middle of
nowhere it was pretty boring actually for quite a while i think if you know if london
had been booming and i could kind of go out and meet people have fun it would have been a great experience but actually that's um especially uh if remember sort
of thinking back to april may of last year when everything was really hard to lock down still
april may 2020 not a fun experience really i think i am an extrovert um i thought i thought about
this a lot i really i get energy from being around people and i was with four people just working all the time and um in the middle of
rural devon yeah not fun but i mean it's a lot to go from having such an intense overwhelming
purpose and sense of mission every day to having pretty much none yeah and waking up in
the morning and thinking what am i going to do today what happens today it's weird because my time was
especially monday to friday was scheduled from sort of nine nine am till about seven or eight pm was
scheduled down to the down to five minutes easily um and you'd look at my diary they would
you wouldn't find more than five minutes spare sort of in that block so yes having nothing to do was uh kind
of weird and so i you know i wrote a list of all the things i wanted to do i actually had this list for five or six years
so i started looking down the list for things i could do whilst in lockdown um many of the things i couldn't yet do
so i started drawing i spent two or three months drawing i saw that um
hockney had started using his ipad so i started drawing on my ipad which i i only kept up for about a month
or two um but learning a language was on the list i bought some kite surfing gear and did
a load of coat surfing which was amazing now um i'm training up to um
a big offshore sailing race so kind of a yacht race called fastnet uh so that's in august i'm learning to
fly so i have a list so now my time is not as planned but it's still and
i'm spending a couple of days a week vaccinating people which is um which is very rewarding um so i'm busy
again but each of it is like not inconsequential i think the vaccination service is a great thing to
do but if i wasn't there there would be someone else there you know doing the jabbing um so each one i could sort of walk away
from pretty easily so it's a it's busy but it's low low pressure i guess yeah
and it seems like you're focusing on things that give you like an intrinsic joy yeah and learning i really
like learning um any really anything so the process of going from a complete novice to someone you know
mediocre uh i love and i'm angel investing that's to keep a connection to the tech
community i'm i've made seven or eight investments in the first half of 2021 i'll probably make another seven or
eight towards the end of the year and i'm helping out a few of or at least i'm going in to bother the founders whether i'm helping or not i
don't know [Music]
it feels like a job where you have to pay to go to work you know um but i like that a lot uh
me and my co-founder went on felt two very different things when we departed we departed at the same time pretty much
and um he because he didn't have anything to do
um upon departing i think he struggled quite significantly you kind of lose the orientation in your life and yeah you're right when your
schedule you're so used to your schedule running your life when there's nothing there you get out of bed a bit later and then
you you know you can that's that sense of lacking purpose you see it within olympic athletes like
michael phelps when he wins all the gold medals and then comes home they call it gold medal depression and you don't have that
thing you're striving towards or for that meaningful goal life can seem to lose orientation a little bit your schedule now is as busy
now as it was when you were working no no i mean the dragon's done thing is as
and maybe maybe brought it close because it's like 7am and i get home at midnight yeah but um
dragons then aside no and i've also i mean there's nothing there isn't huge stakes so even the work
that i do do the things that are in my schedule i can just cancel if i don't want to do it whereas before it was huge stakes i had to get on the flight yeah
or i had to be up at 4am so you know so but but you know both you and me that
The urge to go back
there's still going to be that yearning to go back no
do you think you'll ever go back to starting a company being the ceo i don't know i have thought about this a
lot and people have asked me uh and i don't know um the thought process goes something
like um i love the early stage so you get a few of your mates together people you've always wanted to work with
perhaps and you start something and one of two things happens
you fail and that you know now you're kind of relatively high profile founder who's on to his third thing the third
thing's flopped and like ah we all knew he's an idiot so like okay that's humiliating or it's a success and you grow and
become a two thousand person company and you're like why have i done this to myself again i hate running two thousand person
companies um so the out i like the journey bit but the outcome either end
don't lose lose yeah like it doesn't seem there's much upside i mean it it's financially like very remunerative if you do well but
um it doesn't make my life happier so so in that sense no um with some caveats
one thing i've thought about doing which i've i've not started yet really is kind of run a studio so you get
four or five mates together with the aim of coming up with an idea putting in a ceo or a founder a
management team and kind of incubating it for properly incubating for 12 months you know actually like
building the first version and doing the marketing and but once it's at 12 or 18 months putting a full management team in sort of
letting it go you know so you retain a minority equity stake but really it's the the ceo and the management team that's
that's owning and running it so you you're able to that first year but then you're like hands off and then doing
that every year for five or six years so you end up with a portfolio of i don't know six to ten companies
so i thought about that a bit seems like a lot of hard work um so i haven't done it yet but i might do
that i think you'd probably end up getting sucked into the same problems yeah i agree because i think the power
law distribution of startup success means that one if you are successful one of the ten will be incredibly successful and then
they'll be like oh you know the ceo's not quite doing as well as i would have liked and you know either you think you should go in or someone else thinks you should go
in and you're ultimately you're running a 2000 company again and that's the thing i'm trying to avoid
um because i know a guy that does that how's that going um yes but he hasn't avoided the
[ __ ] so he's what he's he's a billionaire he's a multi-billionaire um and he
says oh i'm not g he when when press asks him he goes oh yeah i'm just not good at the operational bit i know what he means is
because i've spoken to him privately he doesn't want to do the operational bit doesn't want to care about people's birthdays that's what he says i don't want to have to
think about people's birthdays right so what he does is he comes he'll have a passion in his life say
psychedelics yep and he'll go and assemble a team a ceo co-founding team he'll go and hire the
people and then he'll handle the fundraising piece yep and he'll go off you go company but i still know that when [ __ ]
hits the fan and they've got funding issues yeah because he is the the big name in the piece he'll be front
and center of trying to solve those problems um i i i he lives a much better life than i think the ceo would
yeah and i think that's fine like i wouldn't i'm not looking for a zero stress life
um but i think yeah a lot of the people [ __ ] i don't like um the fun fundraising isn't fun but i
i think i have done it enough now that i could do it again in a relatively stress-free way but at 2000 people it's
not even remembering people's birthdays right right in the calendar like that's not you know i had a great assistant who would help me with a lot of that stuff
like it doesn't come naturally to me it's more like you know there's someone misbehaving
like 2 000 people someone's done something stupid at the christmas party and like it should be the chief people after dealing
with it but maybe she was misbehaving this never happened at monzo but um for some reason it ends up on
your on your desk like why am i dealing with these miscreants like they're [ __ ] around like this is
not like on top of everything i'm doing i'm having to sort out this hr issue
you have to because it i've been i was thinking i was just thinking of one incident at christmas party because you said christmas party
i'm not going to me and my co-founder stopped like we would go until 8pm yeah and then leave you'll be like this
is not because it'd be too much alcohol yeah and when you're 50 100 people you
know each other so well that like people i don't know maybe we're just lucky but people sort of respect
boundaries and behave themselves two thousand just law of averages like there's you know one in a thousand
people is gonna do something stupid so you have two of them now at two thousand people doing something stupid every every party it's
like they're gonna get fired for i know one incident well many incidents but i mean the crazy
twists and turns of being the ceo and finding these things out and we had someone who had been on doing i think
silk road on the dark where seven years ago got arrested they'd worked for me for three and a half years i thought they were a great guy yeah
they got sent to jail for seven years like the nicest guy in the company and he'd done it when he's a student all kinds of things christmas parties
someone's pushed someone into the toilet and kissed them and these are the things that in fact you do have to make the call on yep
even though it's such it seems like such a pathetic thing but that is sexual assault totally and and you can't
allow an incident like that to be mis-mishandled right because that is like that proposes an existential risk
against your company yeah if that were to break in the press so yeah and you know and it's
and it's the right thing to do but uh it should be the chief people off the handle yeah right like that's sort of my that was my problem
like there were periods of time when we didn't have a chief people officer so it just landed my desk and i'm fine dealing with a section of those
but when you're dealing with like four or five people's jobs worth of that [ __ ] then it gets overwhelming so
yeah i think it always comes back you have a incredibly sort of um
successful talented senior team and the stress becomes left because each you don't a ceo don't deal with that
your chief people officer says by the way this happened and i've dealt with it you go great oh thank god yeah i love those people in business
they deal with it and then tell they come to you with it sometimes but they tell you they've already dealt with it yep no action required tom it's already
been solved but just so you're aware i love these people and that's but that's how a senior team should work
really um and at its best it works like that it is magical death threats
Death Threats
nice little transition though i'd never got death threats as the ceo of social chain but i hear that you got a few
uh not loads but yes we and um and several of our staff as well um and we've got people turning up to
the office being we had security full-time security at are office and still do now
because customs would turn up sometimes with weapons um they threatened to turn up with you know a bottle of acid and their acid in
someone's face um yeah and yeah and come you know there were sort of groups on
social media who sort of try to find our addresses and sort of hand them around because i mean with six million
customers again sort of probabilities if one in a million is a bad egg you've got six bad
eggs um because we were a bank we dealt with
people's money and because we had obligations to detect and prevent financial crime we would
um we would detect criminals and shut their accounts down and the like the really pro criminals
would just treat it as a cost of doing business right like fine we've got thousands of these things it was like the amateur criminal
who like really thought we had a payday it's like he scammed some old lady out of her retirement you know he's got 20
grand are you like no shutting it down sorry sending it back and it got crazy like this was my big payoff
i'm going to come and [ __ ] you up um and clearly there were times when we blocked
accounting correctly if you're blocking tens of thousands of accounts you absolutely are going to get
it wrong occasionally and it sometimes it takes too long to get money back and we work really hard to get that time period really really as
quick as possible but still the law gets in the way you know you have to report it to the national
crime agency you have to wait for them to get back to you and it can take four weeks and they just don't get back to you so it's like okay we'll give them
the four weeks and then we'll refund you so there are rare cases where you're sitting on a legitimate customs money
for four weeks and they're going ballistic because they can't feed their kids or whatever but a lot of the time it's scammer who's
like they would phone up and they would have a record of a baby playing in the background so you know i can't can't feel my baby
yeah yeah um so yes it was never the professional criminals because they just choose a costume
business and by the way there were a ton of those and we and we caught way more than our fair share we were using a lot of
um basic machine learning to track sort of weird patterns and shutting their accounts down
we worked very very closely with the with law enforcement to to shut a bunch of these things down i'm
some of them were like wild there was a big ring a couple of years no probably three or four years
ago now where um if you've got a fuel pump you can
um you basically put your you sort of pay at the pump but what it would do is pre-authorize a penny on your card you'd pump your
fuel and then it would try and then it would calculate how much fuel you'd actually spend and then then take the payment
so people get a monzo card put one p on it swipe it and then go with a modified ford transit
so it's not like a 80 feet of petrol the whole thing was a fuel tanker so they'd put 10 grand of petrol into
their ford transit and then just drive off and the the payment on the card would bounce and they'd go and use that
to like they'd sell it to whoever wants petrol haul is uh farmers whatever um but they're
basically scamming um all of these petrol stations uh so we spotted that pretty quickly
um and shut that down which i'm really really proud of um there were several people trafficking
rings where they would um bring in women from um often east like east um eastern europe uh and then
traffic them for sex basically um and you'd spot patterns of behavior like
patterns of spend which suggests basically someone is being driven around in a in an uber or a taxi to um to be
pimped out um we'd spot that and work with law enforcement to actually like
um go and rescue people which is amazing like that's an amazing amazing feeling um but and those were mostly the pros
who were like meh you know you got us this time we've got these other rings so like whatever but it was mostly the amateur ones who get
really really angry you know they'd scanned three or four grand out of someone and it sounds like a lot to think about tom
yeah there's all of this hidden stuff you know you know you think of monzo and it's like the hot cold card and some great branding
i thought it was just a like nice colored card oh my god i mean it was serious by the end like
the running a bank is serious we were processing i don't know 100 billion pounds a year
or something of payments like it this is it's a lot of money it's people's salaries it's
and you six million customers you see their whole life you see the great stuff and you see the terrible stuff um
were you ever scared or threatened personally did you ever feel threatened personally in terms of your
personal security was there ever where you thought you know actually i do feel about unsafe here
um i had security and there was a we got a security firm to come and like look at
my online profile look at my house and uh figure out how much of it i was in danger and that was
a bit unsettling and there were times when especially when we had customers saying i'm you know we know where your office is and you
don't know who i am but i'm going to come with a bottle of acid i'm going to throw it in someone's face so that as you let as we left the office
there was a bit of you know a little apprehension there certainly um but
but no in general no it wasn't something i live with every single day but um but it was on them on your mind
certainly in a way that i think most people at most companies thankfully don't have to deal with that kind of [ __ ]
Enjoying the small things in life and relationships
but now you're enjoying the small things in life yeah yeah maybe i should go back to therapy now and like
you can make it even better yeah there's small things in life that you're enjoying what are they yeah walking in the park i
heard so uh my housemate's got a dog recently that's quite fun um uh a lot of my friends have just had
children so not me but you know my um i'm godfather to a couple of young kids my brother
has a young girl now um a disproportionate amount of kids you're you're getting same as me i am
the godfather to all of my friends kids now it's uh i'm not sure i have any friends left really who are not
either parents or trying to become parents we're you know i'm 35 so it's i'm trying to find new younger
friends now avoid that stage of my life for another few years um
yeah i i love pottery i'm learning to fly i'm sailing i love to cycle i kite surf a lot of
active outdoorsy stuff i'm growing plants on my roof my courgettes have just come out
which is uh yeah they're great what about your relationships are you single
taken dating i am dating uh i've always been um intrigued by
dating apps i worked at one um i've written about 20 of a book on one wow but over like the
last 12 years it's not going to get finished so i've been intrigued by that sort of whole scene for a while um
yeah and i'm dating and sort of having fun but i'm not um
not good at settling down i think or i don't know maybe i've just not met the right person to settle down i i
don't know i really enjoy meeting new people but after six months or a year or something i'm sort
of like um
i don't know what it is it's sort of like deciding to commit to each other and spend the rest of your life together i really admire people who are able to do that because i
have not yet been able to do that have you managed to analyze where you think that might come from
like inability to be content this is what i should go talk to a therapist about no because i'm asking for myself
i like novelty i really like new things new experiences and i get bored quite easily um
[Music] so i don't know yeah probably i think
combining um uh psychedelics and therapy to solve this problem
what's my next challenge have you ever done psychedelics i haven't neither of us i would love to i really wish i could say i had i'm
trying to but it's just finding the right place and time i think yeah so what's um so we look forward at the future of your
life i guess a lot a lot of question marks you're not really sure which direction you're going because i think i think you well i think you you kind of answered
yourself at the start about your your purpose in life now yeah what your purpose is i don't have one and i'm totally fine with that yeah um
Your purpose in life
i i think looking forward to sort of when i'm 60 65 um i think i would like a family
around but i'm not sure i'm willing to make sacrifices to
put in the hard work to actually make that happen you know what i mean what are those sacrifices like giving up the fun single life like
the bringing up a baby isn't i've seen it secondhand you know i'm not doing it day in day out but it's hard
really and i have huge respect for that i'm just not sure i'm willing to sacrifice my freedom and my my total
lack of like obligation um for that future lots of people find raising
babies rewarding i've heard oh my god um i do not
uh but that sort of future payoff of having you know that kind of close family it's i can't imagine being 65 and not having
that but then i'm not sure i'm gonna like make the sacrifices today to have that that's sort of
something i'm puzzling around in my head apart from that just sort of enjoying life and um helping out other
startups is a is a nice way to feel like i'm giving a little bit back without taking my life at the moment so for me
that's enough what do you think about i was looking to ask i'm glad i remembered what do you think about bitcoin
Crypto currencies
and cryptocurrencies generally terrifying um
i don't understand it i invested a little bit uh it went up a lot i thought i was the
smartest person in the world it came down again i sold before i lost any money really um it was too stressful
so there's a kind of two questions there which like is crypto what do you think of cryptocurrency long term and is it useful versus like what
is your experience of riding the roller coaster over the last year long term i don't know
i'm not i can see how it's interesting but i think it's at the moment massively
over hyped and i haven't really seen any cool applications in reality yet that solve a
real human problem that may change in future uh and then the you know the form a bit like the crazy speculation i
was you know checking the price of ethereum every 15 minutes or something it was that
that's just not healthy uh so i got out and i'm again sleeping much better now that i've liquidated my crypto positions um
yeah what about you are you a believer i i am so i did the whole 2017-2018 hype
cycle got burnt pretty bad there and then i'm a believer in blockchain as a technology
um i don't actually invest in bitcoin at all um i i invest in ethereum because i'm
slightly involved in building a company in silicon valley in around which is based on ethereum
but but i'm also not i'm fortunate that i'm not checking the price every day i'm a very significant ethereum holder
one of the top 5000 in the world but i don't check the price because i got burnt the first time
and i've just got this idea in my head that um i'm holding for 10 years anyway so irrespective of what happens i'd only
be checking the prices as if to inform a decision and i'm not going to make a decision if it goes down 75
there's no decision if it goes up which it did so yeah i think i have a healthy relationship but i didn't the first time yeah and also
the loss if i were to lose all the money it wouldn't have a material impact on my happiness or life i've heard smart
friends say similar things which is basically take a you're basically hedging into the risk
that this is like the future of the economy and so take between five and ten percent of your like net net assets put it in crypto and
really leave it for 10 years yes and so if it is like the future of money you have a significant enough proportion
of that that you're like well set up if it goes to zero you've still got the other 1995 percent to sustain you
and i'm well diversified across various different sort of asset classes so if i genuinely lost all of my ethereum
holdings i don't think i'd lose a night's sleep do you know what i mean and that makes
it easy not to but when i when i was at social chain when i was i hadn't had an exit or i hadn't taken anyone off the table at all
and the price went down it was like oh i was going up and down with you know with the price so again it
comes back to that video game mindset and i think the detachment point um you know when i started this podcast
tom i i did it for very much you know when i read your story i thought [ __ ] this is exactly why i
The good things about being a CEO
started this podcast because it's literally called the diary of a ceo and what i was trying to achieve there was to give up give people a more honest
view about what it takes to be a ceo um and because i didn't necessarily i
think that it's been kind of you know rock star like jet ski you know whatever millionaires
loads of money private jet um whereas there's a real as you've explained cost
which people don't appreciate um of being a ceo and so when i when i read your story i
think in the papers and you were so honest and open about the real nature of being a ceo the side of being a ceo that i can also
very much relate to that's why i just needed you to come here and to have this conversation with me
what is the upside of being a ceo i mean i think it is amazing i don't
want to sit here and kind of complain about my life um i think for
smart ambitious talented people it can be incredibly remunerative i mean
i i'm financially independent now as are you right and it's i think it um you can
create a lot of value but also like capture some of that value personally like and make money like that's true you can be
um you can choose the people you work with which i think is really really really important so you can select the
people around you and to um choose who you spend your time with and
you get to create something if you're successful that random people in the street use and that feeling of
um being a having created something out of nothing this thing would not exist if it weren't
for you and the team around you and that i think that feeling is um is amazing
and so i don't regret it at all um i'm lucky now that i'm 35 and i don't
have to work really unless i want to and all of my other friends are successful in their own careers but
they're going to be working until they're 60 or 65. um and so yeah it's hard and it's
stressful but you know it's i wouldn't change it for sure i would do some things differently i'd
try to i'm not sure it would change the outcome but i think today for smart ambitious
people i think becoming a founder is probably one of the best choices they could make if they're
if they are of that mindset it's not for everyone for sure but i think if you're ambitious and
confident and and want to create something it's it's unparalleled
and the the sort of the foundation of all of this the most important thing i guess is to make sure that you're happy yeah
and that i never thought about that i mean that wasn't part of my upbringing it was always secondary
yeah it was always like achieving or accomplishing a goal of winning and the
thing that i think i personally i don't know about anyone else any other founders but i never paid enough attention to whether i was
happy um [Music] uh which i think was a mistake
um and i'm now quite consciously doing that um yeah i think that's the probably the
downside so many smart ambitious people are just driven to kind of
jump over ever increasing hurdles um without thinking about why
did you think happiness was the outcome kind of yeah i thought that was the end yeah sort of
like yeah i didn't even really think about it
yeah it wasn't uh my family's always been quite um ambitious and driven and sort of
uh setting goals for you know i was as kids um and i i know other
families where that is not the case and i think talking more explicitly about like
happiness and contentment and love and relationships and those things and then having a balance
i've never done balance i think it's probably healthier if you do have that you know the different inputs and you can choose what's right
for you so you i don't i don't want to draw the point because i don't want to sound like your therapist and we're almost done here but it really made me curious that what
you're saying about your family and were your parents particularly goal orientated yes
they were very hard on you or um ambitious for us certainly particularly my dad um
and i i'm a huge admirer of what he started business youngish i think he was he was 35 or 40
when he set up his business and he'd retired by the time he's 45 um and so i always from a very young age
thought that sort of starting businesses was i never thought about starting business actually i thought about running
businesses so i had a privileged upbringing and my parents were around and sent me to good schools but
really pushed me you know it pushed me to be the top of the class and even when i was top of the class they sort of pushed me
further and i'd sort of say like come on well you know i i did well in my exams to a point
where it's like there is no more i can do in these things like i've got all the top marks um but they sort of didn't believe me
like no you must be hiding something where's the so there was always like um
i think my dad told me when i was 10 i should go to oxford and study law because it was the hardest course in the world so i went to oxford and studied law which
i'm not sure is super healthy actually so yeah they're driven very very driven
and sort of um because they you know i think their parents as well pushed
them and um my dad always likes to claim he came from like this really working class up bringing up in rockstar in manchester
it's just like it's i had a mercedes like come on and then you know with almost the same
breath he's like yeah we my mom had horses like what the [ __ ] are you talking about this sort of
working-class upcoming um yeah but they they always worked hard they moved to asia very young to make a better life
for themselves and they they did work hard and they provided us as kids with great opportunities um
and i think now later in life all of us have sort of realized that um thinking a little bit more about
balance and like happiness and relationships and family is more important as important certainly
and probably more important than um sort of achievement and um and money
have you got to the crux of you what makes you happy they're very not foundational for things um two or three things i know
definitely learning um new skills whatever i really
really really love that and um sort of like my ex was really into
not really that's unfair she um is it the languages of love like the way you sort of experience love
yeah yeah and so for me acts of service i hate the whole thing but i do but i see i see that in myself like i love to cook
for people i love to get friends together i love to you know cook a meal make cocktails whatever it is sort of
like get a house in the countryside and invite all my best friends that i i really like being together with
groups of people that are careful so learning new stuff being together with friends and kind of
creating like cooking whatever whatever it is so those those things uh and i in time
raising kids maybe we will see um that's more of an aspiration than a i
don't know well listen tom thank you so much for um coming and doing this today i think what the thing
that um you probably know but you might not fully realize um that i think is so incredibly
powerful is your willingness to be vulnerable and honest and i just wish there were more entrepreneurs
at all stages in their journey that were willing to be that vulnerable because of how um how
much of a how much of them reality is so much more comforting than the like
this kind of um phony um
untouchable narrative you get from a lot of entrepreneurs reality is such much more of a comforting um place to be
because i can relate to that and that gives peace to my own struggles and hardships and those are an
unavoidable part of the human experience and i think entrepreneurs like yourself that have been tremendously successful have
disrupted an industry and achieved so much who are also willing to be vulnerable
um are of a very special breed and we need more of those people so thank you so much and i appreciate your time today thank you it's been a
lot of fun thank you
[Music]
you

Intro
i like a really good life and i have a very good life
i knew i was a bit different as well though you know you felt different i did feel different i was doing
tv shows radio shows i had my own collection i had the business oh god how [ __ ] is
that life and i lost me in that there wasn't times where it wasn't fantastic there was but where was i i
didn't stop to breathe we've really [ __ ] this planet for you guys
we were blind we're blind consumers living in life while we slowly killed the planet and our
well-being so it has to be you guys that don't know my mother died when i was very suddenly
of um encephalitis when i was 16 and she was the center of you know the
world and i had to grow up very quickly and all that misbehavior
went into sort of responsibility this is this is really painful yet somehow i i wasn't
able to express it [Music]
mary portis you may know her from the high street you may know her from business or you may know her from her
books but the experience i had with her today is honestly incredible she is hilarious
she is smart she's witty and she is willing to be honest at all costs and that
really speaks to one of the central principles she'll talk about today which is this idea of the importance of
being true to yourself she's made the mistake that 99 of people that are listening to this are
going to make are currently making or are in the process of overcoming which is living a life that isn't true
to who you actually are and today she's also going to tell you about an idea that will be fairly radical to some people
especially people who are building and have built big businesses which is based on her new book rebuild
how to thrive in the new kindness economy she has achieved things that most people
in business would never even dream of she's been a media star she's been a political figure at times
and through it all through the hardest of times through grief through trauma through broken marriages
through public scrutiny in the press she has emerged as an incredibly outspoken
honest humble intellectually challenging and stimulating humorous inspiration leader entrepreneur
and public figure i laughed i realized and i was deeply inspired and you will be too so without
further ado i'm stephen bartlett and this is the diary of a ceo i hope nobody's listening
but if you are then please keep this to
yourself mary um you're a very stand-out person
with a very stand-up personality and you've managed to achieve some pretty remarkable things in your life and
from a place of curiosity that always makes me wonder what it is that made you different and i like to always start with people's
childhoods and their upbringings because i tend to believe that that's the most influential part of their life typically
so is there anything from your um younger years that you think has been defining in the person you went on to become
um i well of course i think that that probably is the case um i was one of five kids but i was the
Your early years
fourth out of five um and uh we were my parents were
irish had come over in their late 50s from ireland my father was a protestant
my mother was a catholic so you know from belfast from the north of it um of ireland so this wasn't
you know they they uh this was the time when that wasn't looked on too happily so they came over and chose
watford to live in [Music] it could have been dagenham but they chose watford those were the two options
and um i'm kind of proud george michael elton john so we're we're kind of and a good football team
but i think um i think looking back on my childhood my my older siblings we often talk about this we're very very
close it's sort of a two-year one-year gap between us all and i was the fourth and i remember
vividly thinking i'm not the eldest i'm not the youngest i'm not the first girl and i didn't feel particularly special
but so i was very um naughty as a child you know just spent a
lot of time up to pranks and trying to find my voice i think really
very loving household um my father was very high highly strong hard-working
and my mother was a poetical musical and was pushed us academically put us
all through the grammar school system i remember my sister coming home from school and saying i'm number two
in the class i looked at the register and my mother said and who was number one
so i think that gives you a sort of uh taste of what what life is like but um we're very close and um but my mother
died when i was very suddenly of um encephalitis when i was 16. and she was the center of you know the
world and um just by the the place where i was in the
family my eldest siblings my elder brother michael was at university and my
sister was just about to go and work um go training at uch
and my other brother was hairdressing and so i ended up looking after being the one at home
and looking after my younger brother and i had to grow up very quickly and
all that misbehavior went into sort of responsibility
that's what i think happened anyway i mean you know and i i just took on the role of the
the i wouldn't say parent because i was not very good at that at all
but the one who managed stuff at home and even when my elder siblings then came back
and to this day you know it's mary's house that we meet at or really yeah it's really interesting
because i'm i'm the youngest of four and i feel like i took on that role where i feel like i had
because my parents were absent by the time i was 10. why were they absent my mom just decided that i think she
decided that she'd raised all of the kids already you know like yeah it's almost like they've i've done my my work as a parent all my brothers and
sisters were older than me so she would then just sleep at her shop because she was getting burgled a lot at
her shop getting lots of like racial attacks on her shop so she would literally go and sleep in the back room after after work
wake up work go sleep in the back room but she had a 10 year old at home yeah and so i just learned this huge i
had this huge void of independence i became super naughty breaking into my school yeah all sorts of stuff i set far to mine
that was by accident i thought i could do a little bonfire on the wooden steps but yeah oh my god the
nuns i was looked the passing of your parents
[Music] at a young age how does that impact you
well mine sort of went from from uh you know this terrible traumatic my mother was the central figure um this sort of fiery
redhead who just was the backbone and i don't look back in hindsight i go oh amazing but
she was i was just about baked just about baked you know she'd i'd had enough
of love and time from her at 16 i think my younger brother laurence at 14 that was terribly difficult so you at 10 i'm
with you i can feel that that that's that's that's a very lonely place for a young boy
um but my father remarried within a year i used to come home from
school and he'd be crying you know and uh and i was actually then finding
lawrence and i were managing his grief with these young kids really you know
and he remarried very quickly and um and then he died of a heart attack nine months after
getting married but in doing so left the family home to the new wife of nine months so we
were all out on our own really after that and that i think i look back now
i look back now and i didn't look back for a long while didn't look back at all but i look back now and i see
that i was in grief for about four years i mean i used to walk to school crying
and then just get on the bus and smile it's grief but i don't you know somehow i suppressed that and um put it
into a life that i never dreamt i'd have that's for sure from that
did you ever get help with that grief never i remember the headmistress
saying you know if you ever want to come and talk and the headmistress was a nun called sister saint james who was you know this wonderful
actually i really really liked her she was pretty scared by most standards but i really liked her
um but that was it i wasn't good against hitting the headmistresses office and have a sob
especially with a nun and have to beat my chest and say about 10 hail marys
so i didn't know i don't think any of us did this was the late 70s i didn't remember it's funny
like last night i um i got a little eight-year-old and he's into elvis presley for whatever and i put on some youtube and we were
dancing to elvis presley he was trying to do the little movements and i said he said elvis died didn't he mummy in
1977 yes the year my mum died so my mum died in the july and elvis in the orgs and i
remember everybody grieving elvis and i was going no and i couldn't get on this i was like what
and everyone's like elvis has died the headline so i'm just thinking no my mom's died this is this is really painful yet
somehow i i wasn't able to express her
the grief for those four years how did how did that impact you um thereafter and also not processing
that grief well i think i had a lot of anger yeah i
mean my temper was very quick i don't have that now i've done a lot of work on it it's called meditation really
yeah and also being able to come to a place of acceptance and and having techniques on but i think
i had a lot of anger i mean my father would you know
was very quick tempered um but then with five kids running around screaming the house i think i would have been
so i think that was there um and i i don't know i just i think what i
did was i just kept going blindly i mean i didn't have any any goal or any vision it wasn't like oh i'm
going to show them i just kept going and i think what i did was ignored the deep sensitivity the deep
me i think i ignored that so i believed i was this naughty going fast quick-tempered
individual actually i'm not i'm really soft i wasn't that but i didn't know that for
a long long time was that a was that sort of exterior the
slightly tougher exterior some form of emotional reaction or defense from something do you think
because if that wasn't who you were wondering where that must have came from well i think it was a part of my
personality my behavior but i think i i believe that that was me
and i believed that that was going to be part of my success you know being quick-witted i mean fiery doing things fast
which is you know being a part of my work but i think i didn't ever discover the deeper sensitivities and there were
times when i felt vulnerable and there's times i felt lost and i wanted to be understood and it was like oh it's mary
and you'd go well no because everybody judged you on that it went weirdly even i think the persona
that i had on tv with the orange bob was that and people would edit me to that and i would often think but i
spent so much time behind the scenes sitting with those shopkeepers holding their hands or talking to them but
nobody wants nobody wanted to see that they wanted to go and actually yeah it deeply there was
another part of me that wasn't expressed you talk about this um step mother
i wouldn't even call her that really what would you call her the woman my father married i mean i i i
again i i think about that and i'm i'm talking with my children on this and um
and when i had to write my memoir you had to go back on this and and i just cannot understand anybody
not looking after children who are grieving for their parents i can't imagine you know being with anybody or me
marrying anybody i mean i was married a second time to a woman and she took on my children i can't
imagine anybody doing what she did i just it doesn't fathom in my head
here's a woman who had a child the same age as my younger brother who left us
homeless left you homeless well my father left her our family home we were 19 and 16.
we had no home we had nowhere to live and she didn't let you live there oh she
sold it she took it nine months of being married to my father after 25 years of marriage in a
family home that he built are you still resentful about that yeah
no were you at the time no that's another thing i don't feel resent i don't know all we wanted
was for dad to be buried with mum because you know we were brought up catholics and when mum died and she was a deep
catholic um they we booked the plot so that dad they have the plot so he can be buried
on the same ground and she didn't want that so we had to bring the family priest and go and see her
and we got that in the end and i no i didn't ever ever feel a dot of resentment
do you carry those feelings resentment regret yeah bridges i just genuinely don't
regret a thing my life's been extraordinary i had
extraordinary amounts of pain extraordinary heights and it's been colorful and one that i
would never have predicted when you think about the pain think of the moments of the greatest pain in your life what are those moments
Your most painful moments
um undoubtedly my mother dying that that um where you wake up and it's
it's like something's on your chest that was and i remember it was sunny
sunny hot i i didn't like the summer for years it was july hot
july the late 70s that summer when it was boiling hot and i just associated that and i used to
love when it became automotive cold you could go indoors and hide it felt like a security
to me and everybody was out playing tennis and walking and happy and somewhere and you just this heavy
black pain deep inside you um and both separations i've been
you know uh in two big relationships where i've been married and that that when you split up a family and i'm
a family person when you have to sit and go okay how do i do this how do i do this how do i sit with you
my children and say you know this little life you've got this is moving on that was those i
actually remember you know lying awake three nights on the road not sleeping
a dot and getting up there must be so much adrenaline in my body i mean i don't know
i lost about a stone in weight and i'm pretty slim i remember putting on my trousers dropped below my hips oh my god
that sort of stress and pain but you have to keep going because you are responsible
for these children that's what i wanted to ask you about is having been through so much stress and pain which is just this
unavoidable part of the human experience you can't avoid it right yeah if you try and avoid it you probably end up with
more um rumi talks about the bruises the poet sufi perk roaming the bruises and how we
learn from those bruises tell me about that well he's just one of my great i've discovered him um a 13th century
sufi mystic and he talks about the bruises that we hit and how they repair but that's how we
grow what have you what have you learned about how to cope with unexpected [ __ ] and pain that life
throws at you because you know you never see it coming i mean a lot of people have had it over the last 12 months right
last 18 months with the pandemic couldn't have seen that coming lots of people's businesses just smashed to pieces they've lost loved ones
how does one cope with that kind of like grief whether it's a
professional grief or a you know um the grief of a lost loved
one or the grief of a lost relationship is there anything you've learned over the course of your life where you think that's probably
the best or only approach well there is the wonderful line of this too shall pass and it does
[Music] for me i have found great great resolve from some of the great
teachings and the philosophers who i have read for a long time now probably about 15 20
years and and even if we look at the basis of most religion which is a patriarchy and
has been completely screwed and bastardised by most men but actually if you look at the truth at the heart of it it's much the same thing
that we all have to follow and you have to just connect
deeply with your inner whatever you call it whether it's your spirit whether it's your soul whether it's your
as oprah says my inner frequency you know when that gets shelved or you're not aligned
that's when you start to behave and you follow whatever's happening to you rather than actually connecting
truly back with your strength your resource and so that for me has been and i've
tried to guide my children on that and actually found that that has been i wish someone
had done that a little bit more it was it was shrouded in religion when i was a kid in the catholic faith which i just
could not connect with at all you know my mother literally you know going to confession you used to go into the
church and see these eight-year-old women beating their chest and saying dear god you know i've seen anything what's she done you know this is crazy
this isn't this isn't life what the some poor old but i'm kneeling down beating her chest
that's not what the world's about you know that that's what i've discovered is if you try and get back to your essence
and know and try and align and connect with some deeper strength whether it's
through meditation or whether it's just pause and breathe it will come through and it
does i mean that's not to say we should we have to go through grief we have to go through mourning we have
to let that go through our bodies leaving it in your bodies is the worst thing you can possibly do and i've done
that over the years and i've had my back put out i've been laid low because it's in there
so i've i've learned to do that i had you know first when covered hit it was
shocking for me i mean all my clients in my business which has been my backbone for 21 years
just closed down and and nobody said are you guys okay they just stopped work i had 55 people
well what the actual [ __ ] is happening here and i'm talking to my kids about being
connected to your source and i'm like jesus wept i've got to pay for all this and i don't know where i'm going to do
this and i'm just looking down the barrel at 60 and i suddenly went into that complete fear i was like you need to pull this
back i was actually pretty i felt i was a little bit ashamed that i wasn't better
if i'm honest i was such a shock such a shock and i've written about it
in the first chapter of my book because i want it was so shocking and it was like well they were falling down like dominance
that the the clients and we were like what we thought as a business was just going [Music]
um and it just slowly but surely i kept on connecting back to that
sense of me that deep truth that the world would look after you there was a great interview i heard and
i can't remember who it was and i can't remember i'd like to think but i remember he was a he was a
a philosopher and he and he said we're talking about money and he said think of a time when you've
never had enough can't think of a time when i've never had enough money i've had very little
money but i've lived and i remember just holding on to that
when it when is the world never ever truly looked after you
and if you can realign back into that sense of connecting and not go for the short term
whether it's you know following a route that you're you're trying to short term fix it through stress or through that
anxiety and you connect back to that true source it always works
you said during the pandemic you you felt it almost was as if you were saying you
felt shame that you weren't good enough i wanted to get more detail on what you mean by that no
what i meant was that i i the work that i'd done on myself on knowing
that you know this too shall pass connect back you will be all right the
world will look after you i i didn't well it took about a month and then i was like okay and i had
all the kids under one that was homeschooling happening i was on you know phone every single
morning with the ceo of my business we were on facetime it was you know we were on zoom
calls hideous it was like all the time it was this world that you'd been thrown into
where i thought all right you know approaching 60 ease up now port us you know you don't need to be doing as
much everything just fell apart bam like that like that
oh my god what has happened here so i was a bit disappointed that i
wasn't more you know arm baby really okay i was like sort of done a lot of work on
myself but i got it back i got it back she says talk to me about so i want the detail as to because i i read that
you'd said you you felt like you were spiraling out of control a little bit when the pandemic first struck and i think a lot
of people can relate to that that sense of um panic total uncertainty
and i mean we had all of our like high street clients completely just cancel all work not even
because they were they'd gone bankrupt but because they just didn't have certainty themselves so yeah they just stopped it was either like
totally stopped or paused or wait we don't know what's happening here right so if i and you you have in your agency
you have pretty much all high street players right so i can't imagine
and so i want to know when you say you were spiraling what does that mean uh well for example one of my clients
was a big piece of business that would do the other side of the world i won't mention it was a million and a half pounds bam clothes done
stop that stopped you like what what i meant by that was i
i've never in 21 years ever had anything where i thought financially i've made myself so
financially secure over those years i've never had anything that thought that might go
i've never i've never wanted huge amounts i like a really good life and i have a very good life but i've
never wanted you know the big amounts i've always thought you know this is this is really
good and i so i've never i've always shared the pie as it were you know i like a big slice of the cake but i also
i like sharing it out so i was never i've gone ahead i've got never that i like a lovely life and
and so suddenly this was like that might not be the case and you are the young lad that you've
got to put through school you might be working till you're 70 whatever to get this back up but i was like i
don't want to do that you know so it was going against my my flow and my energy as well you know
that i wanted to go off and do other things i was ready to go and do the the things that one should be doing at
60 plus when you've had a very big career and doing stuff that and i suddenly go oh god i've got to get
this back on and so i just didn't like the way that that frightened me it did frighten me you know there were
sleepless nights but then suddenly this place of acceptance came and you realize
there was magical times where i thought i am in lockdown with all three of my kids you know one of which had left home
one who's doing a masters and one who was eight this isn't going to happen again you know and there were times where they
were just out in the grass playing around with us together and that's that's the magic you know that's the magic for that little man
there with his big brother and sister there were times we just would sit up on um a place near us in swift's hill and just
look at flowers and draw flowers and i thought this isn't going to come again like this
and so i was able to sort of slowly but surely build back
and things got better and there's a huge debate now about what the new normal will look like
Remote working
especially as it relates to working and remote working and i wanted to get your stance on
this whole remote working debate i'll give you my opinion first because my opinion tends to be quite controversial i tend to think people have
overestimated the um remote working thing and i say this because i believe that the office is one
of the last sort of institutions of like community and human connection dating's gone socializing facebook
social media dating we now have all these dating apps and it's felt like in my life especially as like a 25
26 year old whatever that going to the office was actually one of the places i actually got to meet people
in my life and and connect and form communities and go to a football team as an adult
and if that all moves to zoom now like every other part of my life is dictated by a glass illuminated screen i worry
and we have had people sat in the chair from mental health psychologists and all sorts and the the consistent theme
for them has been if you can give someone community and connection in their life then they um then they do better they
are healthier and i felt like the office especially i know you've got an amazing office i've read about it i've
read about the atmosphere there and and how impressive that is and we also went to great lengths when i was reading about your office it felt a lot like
mine it's not hierarchical you wouldn't know who was in charge people are themselves it's very flexible and open we don't
have these rigid archaic systems in place and so it was a really enjoyable place to be and i would hate
for that places like that to be um to disappear i think the old office has
to change and die and be reinvented but i wanted to get your take on that well i think you said it i think you
know i think i think there's a lot of businesses jumping on the bandwagon thinking how can we you know save money on rent
yes and not looking at the mental health well-being i've seen this i think my officers we opened them up as
soon as we could we have two days where we say we want everybody in
because we believe that is everything you've talked about and i know even when i go in and i will
see them all and we will have a laugh and we'll talk about stuff that's not even in the work world but those
nuggets those little messages those little nuances that happen
are what makes us human it's ridiculous to think we do i heard google aren't
opening those up for another year and you think what the actuals stop this have they actually asked their people i have a young
daughter who's been working at home consistently since she went out to the world of work and it is not good for her mental
well-being and i have watched my children get up at 8 00 a.m
and go straight on zoom that was where's where's the travel time where you listen to a podcast or you
listen to a piece of music or you read something or you bump into someone on the street and say morning do you fancy your coffee yeah where's
that gone out of our lives we take this away and we take what it is to be human if
you when i did my high street report i talked about exactly what you're talking about
we lose this we lose what jane jacobs who wrote the death of the american city
back in the 60s well before i talked about this she talked about those little things where you bump into someone on
the street and you say morning are you getting a newspaper and you say can you daughter babysit tonight she said these little things are trivial
but the sum isn't trivial at all it is a social infrastructure a web
of security that makes us human the office is the same the office is the same now i started in my office was
saying you've got a baby you can bring it in bring dogs in this was like
10 years ago what you know we need to ease up and realize
that we need more of this in our lives i've had to sublet parts of my office because we had too much space
but we bloody went out and sublet and fought because we wanted to keep it because i knew
that this was deeply important especially to your generation and you know i know there's people and
and my kids have seen it they they said that the sort of 40 pluses yeah it's nice having some time i
understand that you can pick up the kid you of course but let's get that balance let's get that balance and you're right
the more we close down the more we squeeze our little souls
because those small trivial things are what make up our lives i know that so i
would be so pro it i i really think this needs to be the things that are part of our society which are
deeply important that do need bloody government intervention i know tories don't want to intervene and it's a free market and all that crap
transports one our high streets are one our national health service is another and the way we
work and connect i think is another so i would be putting this on the agenda i heard on one of those
what is it called question times which i keep getting asked to go and i think oh dear god um and i was listening to there nobody
was all these sort of aging politicians who weren't running businesses who didn't see the impact
of not of of getting together it's it's vital please please anyone listening and
if you're listening and you're a millennial or a gen z and you don't think you've got any power pull together get your pals and put
pressure at the top an awesome open back up i think that clip will go viral on
linkedin so that's that's great i think you can reach a lot of people with that one my linkedin's very highly engaged so i think that'll bang um but no i
you know i think that i'm more at ease because i think in the professional world it's going to become a battle
of um employees choosing where they want to spend their time and where they want to work and so my
objective here isn't to so what i what i tend what i feel like i saw was these kind of fragile dare i call them
leaders in business doing all this kind of virtue signaling on on social media and online going oh we're going to let our employees
decide and if they want to work and i i've said publicly like you as a leader you have to have a backbone and your company
culture should be reverse engineered from the mission so you know if you're if you're i don't know building cars then you need your
people at the factory but also work should be it should offer more than just pay and if it is to offer more than pay
something meaningful it would be community connection and these things so my stance as an employer is i'm going to create the
environment which offers you more community than you're going to get anywhere else good pay more free more flexibility
around things that matter in your life kids etc and i think i'll be able to hire all your staff that you have working from a zoom screen
at home and i think eventually you'll figure that out and you'll go back but yeah and that's my [ __ ] yeah
that's what i think i think it's a competition of like the anatomy i'm with you you know it's it's look you as i say
you're young i remember when i wrote work like a woman i was like looking at this and thinking who who created the code who wrote this [ __ ]
how do we want to work i want people in my business that have a voice that feel i will sit with a 23 year old and i know
we'll sit and have a great conversation as much as the 45 year old is running the business
i we've actually put that with these two days when the chief execs in we want everyone
in because this is the time when we learn this is the time we laugh and we really do laugh i mean i'm the biggest
joker the biggest kid in the office of mine and my daughter's been coming in so she can get some just some interaction she
works in food policy because something completely different and she goes mom you're the biggest kid i said i know i need people around me i
need it and i love to laugh and it's just fantastic when you're in an office and you hear
that and it's not difficult this stuff you know it's all about when you feel as confident as you do
you're able to give up that control yeah that's what you're giving up and saying
you know what i know who i am and i want you who works with me to know who you are
and so let's give up that control that doesn't mean that i'm going to have any lazy bath coming in and you know sauntering in
whenever they want and taking no they know i talk about the kindness economy the kindness economy is doing what's humanely right
it's not taking the piss so you have very you know strong ethos and ethics and guidelines
of what you believe your business is and where you want to go but let everybody be themselves
within that and part of that is connection i mean it's fine for me sitting in my north london
you know home working or i'm in the cotswolds what about the ones who i've seen them on zoom in their bedroom sharing a flat you're
waking in there and you're doing zoom and if any owner of a business or organization
isn't understanding that shame on you and think about it they're then probably
picking up a phone to do their dating then when they're hungry they they pick up the phone and open ubereats and deliver and order their
food and it's conceivable that this generation and i actually write about it my book i show how we're getting more and more stagnant as the years go on
because we're optimizing for productivity and financial gain as opposed to human connection we're actually optimizing we're doing
everything in our power to sacrifice human connection and socializing and even things like exercise and movement
for increased productivity and um i think it's time to you know i do i
think the government would be effective in intervening i mean oh i've given up yeah i was going to say i don't know what they ain't
going to come from them they had some like loneliness i think theresa may appointed the first ever loneliness tsar for the uk
who was that jesus i don't know but i have been knocking on your door there dystopian like image of this like these like tanneries
in the streets being like [ __ ] talk to each other like do you know what i mean like i just feel like
i think um i think it's going to come that's why in my book i think it's going to come from business and i think it's going to come from people like us
changing that 100 percent agree i think it's 100 politics i think once we get past this
little woke virtue signaling thing which leaders are doing now where they're like we'll just let our employees do whatever they want and they can just
be all out whatever i think then you'll have the second wave of that which is um which is reality um you need to talk
about it on your show you need to talk about this when you're doing business you need to get this out there you need to be a voice for that because
you know it's um it's only by sharing our voices and having an opinion doesn't matter who knocks us so who comes back that you go
no this feels right this feels right this is deeply important deeply important to the next generation
you know we've really [ __ ] this planet for you guys you know my generation i've you know we the generation before me the
the um the baby boomers they know that so we have to we have to hold on to something deeply
precious here and there is a movement and understanding is greater and deeper we were blind we were
blind consumers we thought that having it all was having more stuff and living a life while we slowly killed the planet
and our well-being so it has to be you guys that go no if we get one thing out of this that's
going to be there that we're going to change all those ridiculous ideas that my generation and the baby boomers bought
into quick one i'm trying to get in good shape for summer as i imagine a lot of people are
and just in time for summer you'll have released what i consider to be one of the most important best products they've
ever released i'm gonna have to say second to the rtd ready to drink yours which basically
saved my life on a daily basis it's this protein they've released 100 calorie 20 gram protein that has 26
of your vitamins and minerals in incredibly complete and healthy for you and the salted caramel protein is my
favorite flavor it tastes unbelievable and i've mixed it with water usually when you have protein powder
mixed with water it tastes awful it tastes like ass but this is genuinely delicious so if
you're going to start your journey with fuel or if you're a current customer and you've not tried the protein yet i highly recommend specifically if you
like salted caramel like me you give this a while back to the podcast you say they're having it all and having
Losing myself in the madness
more stuff we thought that was it which leads me into something else i wanted to talk to you about i read you'd said um
that you're in the public eye you're making more money than ever and it was extraordinarily exciting but at the age of 48 you found yourself crying
almost every day i was probably physically exhausted um
i just didn't get that joy you know i just was on this i was doing tv shows radio shows
i had my own collection i had the business i had two kids it was it was crazy
and and i was the nature i was the scent it wasn't like you know i had some husband who was
raising me it was me you know and i thought yeah but i and the more that comes you'll
know this the more it comes the more it comes the more it comes comes keep coming keep coming keep coming you got to do this gotta do that
and there were parts of it that was just you know incredible i looked back at it what some great years but i was exhausted
and you're not allowed to say that actually i was thinking about that at that time there would be those
you know women on the front of the sunday times magazine like that we can't show our pose but it'll be like that you can have it all they got eight kids
and they would get up and they would be doing you know yoga at 6 00 a.m and then having a global call with china or
whatever then you know they'd be bringing dropping the kids off at school while chatting to god those whoever
sorting out the day and you just thought oh god how [ __ ] is that life
where are you where are you and i lost me in that it there wasn't times where it
wasn't fantastic there was but where was i i didn't stop to breathe i didn't stop
to truly connect truly connect with me and i remember i
went away um to some very expensive spa place where it was all on shanty and downward dogs and eating
stuff and everyone's all this you know you go where rich people are
because you got money and you go and you discover you and um and i remember sitting in this
yoga session and i just was crying and i was like please stop please don't marry please stop and there's all these sort of
women in their lululemon and i was going just crying and i thought and i went in to um
there was this wonderful indian guru i used to sit in this little room which you could go and meet and chat with and
i remember going in to see him and he didn't say a word and i just was crying i didn't want to speak with him but i wanted to go to the bookshelf that
was behind him because i knew there were some books there and i picked up eckhart tolle's new earth
and i just took it and as i left he went that's the right one and i went back to my room and i read it
and i read it on the beach days and i was like oh my god i've got the world wrong i've just completely got this
wrong and that was a start of my journey
it took many years i'm still you know getting still partly hybridizing that life i'm never
going to sit in an ashram but i i discovered how to connect back
truly with me and stop loading this stuff in your life mary and and saying no two questions there
which is regarding this book this eckhart tolle book that you you talk about um a new earth what was it what was the
the key lessons that imparted on you about life and how you're living
i'm i was living totally outwardly to my ego and my persona marry portis mary with bob mary the
business woman marry the mother i was not connecting truly with who my spirit my soul
so everything was done to feed that and you believe that that is you you
believe that that is your personality you believe all of that you talk about you thought you'd become a bit of a caricature
oh for sure but i also milked that that was very profitable
but you know i knew it was brand mary the red bob the rings you know i've
always loved fashion awards lots but it was very much you know a signature so and um
yeah of course i mean i i advise businesses globally on brands i was i suppose a brand why itself
and i i just didn't want to be that anymore philosophy is very clear on this idea of like abandoning your true self
and the consequences of your ego you're out yeah yeah and it seems like such a
clearly losing game and i think people listening to this are probably have to be well you
are some stage in the process you've either um you're probably you're either at the start and you've not yet tried to
abandon yourself because you think that you know because the outside world has convinced you and incentivized you to do so
especially social media that'll have you trying to abandon yourself and become the kardashians whatever whatever or you
are in the process of um abandoning yourself or trying to and you're feeling the sense of despair and probably lack
of orientation that comes with that or you've come out the other end which it kind of sounds like you've you've got to where you've realized that
you try to abandon yourself and the only true answer is to to be yourself because everything else is despair you either succeed in
abandoning yourself as this one i think it's called stoddard this swedish philosophy used to say
if you succeed in abandoning yourself then you end up in despair if you fail in abandoning yourself then you end up in despair so the only
true true path to joy is to accept who you are yes i think you know
the thing is it's you know it's knowing what the truth is it doesn't mean that
we're not going to have on this we are truly connecting on a truth here i don't think we're you know performing but part of it is
performative because we are doing a job that's going to be this podcast but it's being on the path some people
never even know that past there you know most people don't and that
you know it i remember when i first discovered it and people like don't you know don't talk about that because
you might sound a bit odd on you know spirituality or blood don't talk about that and you're like and i didn't for a long while you know i
i even was chatting to a great producer at the bbc saying why isn't there a show on something like this
on the bbc like no don't mention spirituality in the bbc at the moment you're like what this this needs to get
out there and it's not hokey pokey stuff this is our truth and i think what i've tried to do is to
allow the people who work with me express that and know about it and we
share it we share it in the business and it just opens this whole thing up
and there are times when you have to be as i say performative and be i'm mary portas you know going out i'm
working i'm writing a piece or i'm doing a course but i'm rooted in who i am
deeply and i think it isn't whether whatever we call it whether it's spirituality whether it's our soul
whether it's our spirit whether it's our truth whether it's our vibration whether it's our you know whatever our vortex
or our frequency is oprah says whatever getting back to that you know i remember and i was listening to
the um lovely irish uh irish poet and i'll think of this surname and i'll think about it and
they'll all come to me after i've done this but anyway i remember him talking about when he used to give the
last rights he's been ireland and he'd go to give the last rights to whoever was dying and he'd go in
and he'd see these little pinched faces that had lived a life that wasn't in
line with their true self because they couldn't they had no choice and
he just said it used to make him feel so so sad and then he would give them the last
rights and he would literally see the pain on their faces their skin just un un stress
and un wrinkled because they were able just to be
and that is the greatest gift i think we can give to anything and and to our kids you know i mean i put them through a
great academic system because i could but i always said you choose i remember my daughter coming
to me when she just finished oxford she got into oxford and she was like um i was deeply proud
and she finished a degree and she said mom i know everyone's going to expect me to go in and make a lot of money i don't want to
do that i said why do you explain that to me like you know i'm really going to judge you on that
and um she wanted to do something that just connected not with which but with where her truth was and that's
the only thing i think we need to try and find in life now your truth probably was that you know you wanted to get to that place where
you were able to say i did this because that's the truth that was important to you because everyone else is saying you can't do something
you're not sitting in this system i was much the same much the same yeah i met some old school
friends they were like whoa you know my life because i was just always the one in trouble or
i remember getting 17 percent in physics and thinking i don't give a [ __ ] i don't give a [ __ ] oh my god i was like
17 i never felt embarrassed i was just like i knew i was a bit different as well though you know you felt different
i felt different but i wanted to be like the middle class girls that were living in charlie wood and i
came from the working class so it was the kids from watford that got into the grammar school that that were the
sort of that parents didn't have the money we used to get the bus out and then the middle class from charlie wood and all those areas just
their parents used to drop their cars and then they'd get to the sixth floor they drive in themselves i was like oh
my god i want to be this and then i went nah nah
i don't want to be that life oh my life i want my life brony ware talks about the same thing
she interviewed people on their palliative patients i think it's called on there who does this brony ware she was a an australian
palliative nurse i don't know if that's the right word and she interviewed people on their death bed and asked them one question which was what's your biggest regret
as they were dying wow the number and she released the blog and it the number one regret of the dying
as she writes in her blog was quote not living a life true to myself oh man i remember watching the film of
alan turing and it just actually heartbreaking and here was a gay man who could not live his life and i just thought that
has got to be i think that sort of the 50s and 60s was worse than any time
you know that american dream of the housewife and being the the two kids and living the american dream
and actually you had to suppress your sexuality your frequency your truth your love
your ability to soar isn't that just the worst torture torture
torture daily hourly yeah yeah subconscious torture almost yeah
and it's still going on in hollywood yeah you you married a man i did marry a man then a woman then a married woman
Labelling your sexuality
and i'm with a woman now well i never it's interesting i i don't
i don't know whether female sexuality is particularly different from male sexuality but i'm
i've been in love with two men in my life and i've been in love with two women
i've never sort of i never was a child oh my god i'm a lesbian i fancy linda evangelista i've got to do
something about it i know i had relationships with women i had relationships with men and
it just didn't ever bother me um but once i had fallen in love with the woman i
remember you know saying to my sister she was like but you're not a lesbian i said well i don't know what i
am do i have to put a label to it and the interesting thing is when i did and you know and married mal
that all the prides and the you know they'll grab hold of you and put lesbian
oh okay well i've got to do this for the sake of all of you and be a voice which i wanted to be but you kind of
also go now you're also labeling me yeah it was a really but i also don't want to let you down stone war
and i will do the opening speech at pride because i know you need women and i've just had another one that came through on you know lgbt
virgin radio mary would you go into right i don't want to be also categorized in that way because i'm not a former prison
as well though isn't it well it is but i also don't want to not be a voice because i think it's important for
you know when when i did uh meet mel there wasn't there was no women in the public eye besides sandy
toxic who were in same-sex relationships and i remember this
my children having to you know when they went to school there was no books on it i mean i'm talking what are we milo's
now 26 so i'm talking you know he was nine there wasn't so i thought i had to do
that and i did it and i don't mind doing it but you know there is a fluidity to it
labels good and bad yeah those kind of labels those like socially categorizing labels where they
put you in the label because they maybe want to understand you but because they want you to rep like lead the charge of a movement i get
that obviously young black yeah yeah you know guys there's not actually many many of us up here in the
young yes male represent category and i'm only actually half black i'm as
black as i am white because my dad's like my mum's black and i'm like i will represent the black people yeah stand behind me and then you feel
okay yeah you say yeah as you say yeah you know there's probably a net positive impact of me doing that for
society so i'll take on that uh responsibility but then i go back to well i know who i
am so write what you're saying write what you like and say what you like because
i know intuition hmm topic i've heard you talk about a lot you'd said previously that the biggest
Listing to your intuition
mistakes in your life had come from not listening to your intuition [Music] what comes to mind when i say that which
mistakes i think you know i i think i'll know when i'm needed to have got out of you know
relationships and it kept telling me something and kept telling me and you're like oh no no i've suppressed that i've suppressed
it in times where i've you know thought in business i don't particularly like
this person and yet they pay me a lot i've suppressed that
and it always ends up always you know you feel it you feel it and ideas
sometimes you know ah they just come if you're really really feeling free
and in tune they just come and they're they're wonderful it's been my it's been my i'm sure it's yours but
it's been my you know ability to sort of feel something deeply know that that's right
and you can get people that can analyze put data behind it logic and i've listened to them in the past and i've
let things go ah not regret but oh that you know even you know now
i i've always bought i've always wanted to do and it's just trying to get an idea you know a totally
sustainable secondhand recycled vintage take a whole space like a
massive mail that's closed down and create tomorrow's where you everything is about you know
recycled upcycled vintage remote and i've got to get on and do that but it's too big
but i just know it will you know and so i have to follow the instinct on on doing that
but i think just just sometimes you just it's the small things as well it's just the small things where you feel
it's come from there and you push it down because you put too much logic and reason behind it and i think in business we need to let
that open up so much more certainly in my area of business i
reckon we ended up with such so many crap businesses because logic data and systems overtook
instinct creativity and innovation and we need to bring that back and interestingly you talking about high
streets what has come back is people understanding the importance of connection and community
through high streets and we will see that coming back um and i you know i had the labour party
get in touch with me and saying they wanted to re you know look at what we were doing on the high street report 10 years ago
because when i did it 10 years ago they didn't understand that it was all about bottom line
all about bottom line what's your view on the younger younger generation coming up
Advice for the younger generation
you know there's a lot of i think we talked off off microphone about um some of the themes coming out of
you know this this uh instagram generation like you know it's like really binary cliches like find your passion
there's this idea that like um working hard is now toxic um and just generally what you
what what's your if you were to impart advice or you were to give a perspective on this kind of like instagram generation
who and their perspective of the working world um what advice would you have for them
i think you know the there's the good and the bad and the ugly isn't there i mean i think
it's i think it's a really tough world to be in that you are always on that's a very
tough place to be um and i purposely you know don't do as
much even though i should be you know because i just say i only want to do something when i really have something to say
and i know it drives some of my agents around the bend you know it's in social media yeah and i think it's deeply difficult i
think we've got two strands coming through i think we it's used as an incredible place for voice and change to happen and i think
the gen z's are going to be probably the best generation that we've seen in a very very very long time and the more
i read about the more my i have a social anthropology unit in my agency the more we research this
the more i utterly love them and i'm more i want them to make this world better and i think they will and you young
millennials absolutely i think and i think there's a lot that comes out of it that's fantastic
the other part of it is oh boy i would love to change what are now used as icons and
role models especially around beauty fashion and young women it is just too much to
live up to and i i find it that i find just terribly stressful for individuals
and the way that they've been sold how they need to look how they need to behave how their body needs to be what
their beauty regime should be it's it's ridiculously tough and i you
know i i live in a society where i'm seeing a young generation that are pushing against that but there's an awful lot of young women particularly
and men out there who how they are looked and how they're perceived and what their life is like
and and 40 pluses i look at some people on facebook and i think really you're still doing this [ __ ] you
need to go out there and show what new shoes you've bought or what you had for brunch and where you at
really really isn't it a bit of a pyramid scheme and not a pyramid maybe like a
network marketing scheme in some respects or some kind of like network effects because what's happening is you let's
say you've got i don't know the kardashians at the top then you've got people below them looking up at the kardashians and
thinking [ __ ] you know what i need to get fake bum and i need to change this and i need to change this and i need to post
when i'm wearing my chanel bikini on the side of that boat so they'd follow suit which then cascades
downwards and everyone's just trying to this is what i'm talking about the pressure i'd love the kardashians to turn around and say let's not buy any
more stuff and let's recycle wouldn't it be brilliant imagine what that would do for consumerism that's probably the
most impact they could have in the world is if they just cut out the fakery and yeah lived more ethically but they just
they're pinned back by the financial incentive but i you know when i was doing my research in my book
and looking at the spend on the pressure on young people who follow the kardashians to get the
new this the new that it's insane it's insane because i used to look back and think
well you know my mother couldn't afford stuff so we just we just put up with it but we weren't sold the marketing dream
we weren't sold this [ __ ] and this has gone so deeply into society so deeply that we
do need people like you that go this is just crap standing up and saying this is crap and anyone comes on dragon's den trying
to sell that crap it's almost like the way i see it is um like social media in this
that the world the kardashians it's like they're holding a bit of your self-esteem hostage and the ransom of the apparent ransom is
you've got to go get that bag too or whatever and then when you pay the ransom you get the bag
you don't get your self-esteem back and it just increases the ransom just increases now they're like now you've got to get an even better bag and it's just endless like that's
exactly what i wrote about i was part of that when i was creative director at harvey knicks i was i sold this stuff to people
thank you yeah bloody brilliant look i'm gonna make this sexy and and uh and it was it's not dissimilar
now it's just got faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and it is totally all based on i'm not
good enough i'm not good enough we have to convince them that there's something they don't have but need
we really need this revolution there is part that are doing it but there's a whole part of society
that are still buying into this this lack of self-esteem and we as marketers have been selling that
for years i've definitely been selling that yeah so at my previous mayor business
quick one as you guys might know if you've been paying close attention i'm in the process of starting a brand
new business and when you're starting a business there are a million things to do from branding to websites to all
sorts right logos videos promotions all of this stuff and so it's incredibly hard to do
all of these things when you were a one-man or woman band and that is where fiverr.com comes in and solves a huge
problem for me if you've never used the website before it is the best place to find freelance support across multiple
services in the most cost-effective and reviewed and rated way and i use it
in every sort of facet of my professional life including for this podcast sometimes and including
in my businesses and as i start my new business which i'm going to tell you about soon i've started to rely on it once again so
go to fiverr.com ceo and check out how amazing fiverr.com
is you said you know it was something that i i thought maybe i was the only person in the world that also felt which was
So you donât get excited either?
before we started recording you said that you don't get excited about things yeah i mean i have great things in my
diary or someone said oh aren't you excited you're doing that tomorrow and i just think no i just don't get excited
and you said you don't either i don't know well i so i didn't actually say anything but then my camera guy here jack that's worked
with me for some time says steve always says that and it's because there's people who will say to me oh my god you're doing this next week or you're going on holiday or
going to this place or you're speaking in dubai are you excited and no yeah when they hit me with the question i go
no no as if you're trying to work that through because i've never sat with anyone and worked that through or talked
that through and and but it doesn't stop me really enjoying like
experiences the experiences and there and now i don't put it up there maybe that's the thing
for me i thought and i might be wrong but maybe we're going to work it through now i thought my lack of excitement was a defense
mechanism because i also need to defend against going down when bad things happen so i think over
time i've just developed this character trait where i'm just here in the moment focused on what
i have to do right now and i'm trying to be stable and calm so i don't swing upwards with great news i don't swing
downwards too heavily with bad news and that also means i don't swing too far into the future or swing too far into the past that's a
really good maybe that's it because my friends get excited about small things and big things
well i've got dinner table at brat and you're like great but it doesn't it doesn't excite
me yeah i don't know that maybe that is maybe that is a subliminal thing that we've both done i i hadn't thought about that but i felt i
even had it like my my partner said to me oh you've got that aren't you excited and i said no and i actually have to
tell you i don't get excited but my girls going into therapy yeah you have to sit you down and tell you i
don't get it that doesn't mean i don't feel joy yes that doesn't mean i don't feel complete
but i don't get excited or maybe someone's going to listen to this some really
incredible psychoanalyst and they're going to go we'll go and we'll work this out and tell you why
it is really interesting because you as i think it's so important for you for you to say what you've said there which is you still enjoy yourself when
you're there and doing these things but it's like future anticipation
and i think that must come from living having lived a very intense life where the most important
thing in your world is being in the present right now and fixing the thing right in front of you yes
and you've probably not had a ton of time to sit but then also also i have to say the privilege of having had so many great experiences yes
you know so there's not really a restaurant you've not been to that's been a mate you know like you've been to amazing restaurants you've been to
amazing places you've done achieved amazing things so you're bro you're sort of like threshold of what
might it doesn't seem that anything excites me you know i remember now you've said something and i remember
just i i think it's being what you talk about totally connected i remember a true surge of joy coming through my
body [Music] when i was walking through a supermarket this is nothing to do with the supermarket
but i had my baby daughter in front of me and i had my husband with me with my
little son and i was totally in a place of joy in a
supermarket but there was something about this place of these two beautiful kids i had
love it's just and i remember this search coming and i'm like i feel really happy
and i've had other times like that and they've not been sitting in can at a restaurant they've
been really fundamental simple simple simple places
where i felt that surge of joy okay where you where you feel you're an elect
i can feel it now right the way you can put it and you can feel your energy going through your body which is beautiful
and i would rather have that than this excitement if i told you that later today you were
going to walk down the street and feel that same surge of joy that you got from the supermarket would you be excited
no if i told you now that when you walk out this this door you're gonna as you walk out down the street
i promise you you're gonna feel that surge of joy would you be excited to no but i feel that warmth and that
energy going through my body that thinks yes i want to be in that place but it's not excitement and because what
i was trying to figure out there is if excitement to us i was trying to figure out if we
the reason why we don't get excited is because we've realized that true joy doesn't come from the restaurant or from
the holiday or from the the going and doing the tv thing whatever it's actually really the joy comes from
something that's actually very hard to predict it's like those really meaningful moments and so when someone says are you excited to go to do
that experience on tv you think well that's not joy and in fact joy will come in those really random moments random yeah
i sat in the garden with my sister last week and i my sister and i love my sister she's just one of the great people i
know she was always quieter as a kid and she always let me be like she was three years older but she
was always like you know when she was 18 and i was 15 she'd take me out to the clubs like no one's done it you know
like she was like come on and i just sat with her it was just a moment we were just sitting together we
weren't speaking and it was just that moment where that connected you can see it in your face when you when you describe these moments
yeah your face lights up yeah that that's joy that's what that's why when you talk about the office and we
talk about the high street it's the trivial what we think are trivial that's what
makes the world that's what makes life that's what fuels us laughter in the hallways and those little jokes and catching up on what
happened on the weekend and stuff totally or like me trying to wash the dog in the garden the other way and
i my partner nearly was waiting for laughing because i couldn't get the dog i said bam over here the hose was going everywhere and it was
just that moment of madness and joy that the little dog running around the garden it was just those
things but also maybe we don't resonate i was just thinking then with the word excitement because think about what that
word means when i think of the word excitement i think that's not a that's not a state that i
live my life in never so when someone said are you excited i think well am i oh no no never so maybe there's a better
question which is are you looking forward to the experience or are you um i don't know maybe there's a better
question but i don't do that either yeah looking forward isn't because you're not looking forward to it you know are you happy you're doing it i
don't know
Making businesses kinder
your mission now in life seems to be focused a lot on them as you say like making businesses kinder and it seems to be much more
philanthropic than it's ever been before why why does that matter i don't know
just came to me it's one of those things that came to me a certain point certain time
well i i about five ten i can't remember the years
where they go but about seven years ago i looked at my business and thought
i remember it no it's not longer than that it was eight years ago and i my little baby son was born
and um this beautiful little man came into the world and on he he was born on the monday
and on the saturday my 18 year old son was going out into the world to university
and i mean obviously this you can imagine the emotions that are going through my body there's this young
man that's coming to this world and this young man is going out into this world and it was just visceral and i i i do
cry when i'm feeling you know um happy or sad or i listen to great music
i can it clears me especially if it's nick cave
and um i kept on crying and just this movement and i remember sitting
with milo who was going off to do the very bright land he was going off to do philosophy and economics
and we were just chatting on the bed i remember clearing his bedroom and there's a little cricket back there and i don't get emotional because i remember
going off to find the cricket bat and i remember also being really [ __ ] off because all the sports shops was closed and they become joby
sports and jiggy sports you know like no that's not a sports shop i want to go to a sports shop where someone says i'll
give you the cricket back and knows about sport and but i found one in in in sherburne where a friend lived
i found this little and i was looking at the crooked back and thinking all the memories you know it's just that lovely numb packing his stuff and i'm just looking
at his little hands sitting next to me on the bed or big hands and stuff what do you think you'll probably do because i don't know because
i'm doing economics it goes and i suppose i'll end up going into finance in the city and i was like i just remember this
like this deep and i remember sitting there and thinking [Music] that's not your frequency that's not you
i mean you're you're go getting your but you've grown up with me
and you're gonna have to change you [Music] to go into that world and then i looked
at the little horatio the baby thinking this is this is what we all do we all bloody have to change
and i thought actually i've done this i've i've changed i became you know when i was on the board of harvey nichols the
business woman when it was mary queen of shops when it was married whatever on the tv i was that
what the hell am i doing am i still doing this and so i went on that journey then and i
that's when i decided to change the whole way that i ran the business and i wrote work like a woman on that
realizing that actually what i had suppressed was my deep sensitivity and i called it
my feminine instinct because i do believe the power of the feminine has been suppressed over millennia
there's no two ways about it there's no two ways about it we have created a male dominated
alpha energy in the world because we killed and we through through the church
millions of women who were the sages who were we've suppressed femininity and
that power is the power that's going to take us through into the next part of the world and i
started looking at this and i started i never saw myself as a feminist because i'd you know look at me i looked
at my life why do i need to be that you know and i started to go what are we doing
with our children through work that we this young man has to suppress
his creativity his sensitivity to go and be a bastard basically because
they get to the top this was at the time of you know money power fame those are the ones your
trumps your philip greens you hear loads of what you unite them they're brilliant yes sir
this and i started to go on that journey then so that's exactly when it was it was
eight years ago nearly nine and i wrote the book created a new culture in my business
opened up started to talk about stuff that made me feel vulnerable started to bring in this more
compassionate way of working and actually connect with what would have been seen as
soft skills or hr department actually i believed were going to be the new power skills
love kindness actually no because before you know 12 years ago
if someone wasn't working like oh done out you know boom on to the next you're not
good enough how do you do that what's going on in that person's life i remember discovering one of our great
creatives suffer with depression and he'd actually told someone else
and one day he's like that i wouldn't have looked at that before okay how do we work with this so i started on that journey then and
then i realized that you know over the years that even the planet
that we were killing was all part of this the way that we suppressed ourselves in search of more
we've just killed the planet we've killed our well-being and i just kept on going on the journey and then i did a ted talk on it
um and they asked me to do a ted talk and i thought what am i going to talk and it just kept them coming up this
theme so i talked on when i called it we need the kindness economy we need an economy that isn't
about growth that isn't about money at any cost that just doesn't measure linear how do we create well-being
it's not that i'm anti-capitalism i like money how do we create a world to that and i started to go on it and then covered it bam and it was there
it kept going this is what you're meant to be doing mary and i'm looking at how to get back to make the same money as i did before
and all the while i'm chasing that my god my business is going there and this voice is going just there it's where you meant to be
and then one day i woke up and and i rang my chief executive i said i think this is where we need to go and she's
amazing and i'm also thinking well she's 40 something with two kids and she's you know
in this business with me it's all right me going this is amazing can we but i think we should go this route and
we talked about it and talked about it just and the more i talked the more it opened up and my head of strategy and my answer
proceed we were all like yes actually we need to be advising business on being better
better to people and better to the planet and that's how it all started and that's my journey now
that is it am i excited by it no but do i get up and think that it's deeply
in there with me and i just have to follow it now and that's where i'm i hope that
explains it no you haven't done it it's really powerful and i think it it perfectly ties into all the
prior themes of listening to intuition and um i think that's super super powerful i i
have two more questions for you one of them relates to what you've just said there which is um in a very practical sense what does
What does it mean for businesses to be kinder?
that mean for a business to become more kind you talked about people and planet but in terms of like
the boardroom pay you know all of it it's actually looking
and going we we know that simon sinek wrote the great books on you know
why rather than just it's looking at what your business
is here for what is your philosophy and your purpose really understanding that and connecting it deeply to you on a
human level first of all and you know you've got a lot of wokeness going on and
well yeah our purpose is to make the world better no you know what is your true
purpose as a business and now once you start to work on that and your self and i've done it through
the book you then create the environment through your people to how you pay them
through how you inspire them through how you connect your customers through your truth of how
you manufacture how you create how you collaborate
you create a different way of being a business that's not siloed it's not individualistic you move from
me to we so everything that you do you are thinking that bit wider than yourself it's like
being a mother or a parent in any sense undoubtedly
i would always put them first always not evenly always
so you think about that in your business doesn't stop me being me it doesn't stop me developing doesn't stop me opening up doesn't stop me
growing doesn't but i am being a responsible connected
kind individual we need to do this with the world and the reason i put people
planet profit in their order is the planet's going to go on without us we'll [ __ ] it and we'll die quite simply
and it'll regenerate it's done that as we know i said whatever
but we can make that change happen we can do it by being more humane by
being kinder and by creating commerce that feeds and gives social progress
as well as financial progress and it's possible it's totally possible
you know that now obviously some people go it's all right from us sitting from her money
doing that yeah i've made money yeah but i'm doing it
and there's people who are doing it who haven't and those are the ones i take the hat off to those are the ones and if i can just put
a bit of volume on it then i will because i've got a bit of a big mouth and i actually you know you know some of
the people i admire the most one guy in particular called novar he always talks about how if you want to start taking on some of these worlds the
world's big problems like the environment et cetera what you have to do is you have to make sure people aren't worrying about feeding their kids first
and foremost because i don't begrudge or blame anyone that can't feed their kids
that that isn't thinking about saving the environment you know what i mean because i would be taking course you know so there's a bit
of sort of fundamental social work that needs to be done for us to get to a place where well i mean we can look at
that in terms but it's again what was value my mother had very little money but she fed us and she didn't make us obese by buying
[ __ ] food that was too cheap yeah same with fashion and people go oh yeah but that fashion it's democratic everybody can afford it
you stand out some of those shops everyone's coming out with three carrier bags of [ __ ] that's going to go into landfill or we
don't market the hell out of it via that and we tell the truth that buying something that lasts and recycles
and upcycles and that you share is actually where the new sexy is sex is the word you know i it's
really important that is important i call it status status symbols we've moved to now we're
into status sentence how do we create a world where we understand that being sentient and connecting with
experience and life and being generous in the world is more important than symbols big move
massive move and we need to look at the brands we need to look at power in business and that's where i'm starting i wrote
Meditation
down earlier because you said the word and it's been something i've been very curious about the word of meditation what role is that played in your life
and why did you embark on that practice because it steals my mind and
your mind is the biggest tool you have that can just [ __ ] you over terribly or it can really ignite you amen
tell me about the upside of meditation as you've seen it well i started by doing little podcasts
to listen to someone tell me how to do it because i was a bit hopeless and me sitting still ain't great um
and it's just i i do each morning with it i only do 10 minutes and then i'll try and do it at the end of the evening
and i still my mind and i just connect and i feel my energy going to my body
and i clear and any time a little thing comes in that says i go thought and then i laugh at it i
don't get annoyed i just go and i laugh at the me that's the thought that just tells you all this [ __ ]
and then i just open up my energy as much as possible and then
during the day where i find myself where i might be going out of sync i just have this thing
that just says pause and i pause and then i relax and i could be sitting in a meeting like this and
where i might be wanting to talk more i just stop and let it come back in
and it's just helped me hugely closing the tabs that's a really good
visual closing all those tabs down but just they're not great lastly love
Have you struggled with relationships because of business?
relationships something i think very you know career driven
professionals like you um often tend to struggle with for various variety of reasons
have you struggled with relationships love holding together relationships investing in them i don't think i have i mean i don't
think it looks particularly great that i've got two um failed marriages but actually
they there were some brilliant years i knew they were long and they created beautiful things so i
don't see them as failure i genuinely don't see them as failure it's a part of my life and i
i've changed i i am not the same person that i was when i met or
and i'm on a very different part of my journey and that happens um and i think we can just get
so hung up on that you know i've had incredible i've had long relationships now i've never really struggled
with relationships i don't think no i've had pretty decent long ones
as i was on my own the last which has been the first time in in ages that was really unique for me you
know when was this just recently you know i split up with my wife melanie back in three years ago
and i was you know three years on my own still single now no but i'm not going to tell you who is
that'll be a nice headline [Music] who are you with i i i sound fair to
them you know because it's just no no one in the public eye and order would they want we want to be thrown into it but
but you found that's that's super yes dare i say exciting that's some very nice joy but
but but came in a i think i manifested it as well really yeah i just thought oh god now i'm ready for something and i i
genuinely feel i sort of opened up my we spend so much time feeding energies that just
are not worth it that you just have to keep pushing up in that three years what did you what was what did you tell yourself
because a lot of people when they when the garage is empty they just want to fill it with anything do you know what i mean because that
makes them feel they feel complete or you know when there's someone there they feel like they need someone just to fill the
garage but what did you do for those three years to patience i guess or you know you talked
about manifesting well probably one of the most toughest three years of my life at least three years i i grieved first of all the loss of your
marriage yeah you grieve and i think you have to grieve and um
[Music] covert hit not easy i had to gosh on
your own and or yeah you're on yeah yeah and you have your kids and you're resettling where you live so
you everything changed everything so my business changed
my marriage ended where i lived changed so it was a huge amount of change and
actually the last thing i was able to do was bring anyone into that i had to be with me um
[Music] yeah and it was it was very very painful very painful and
a lot and i i think it's only in the last six to ten months i've come through amazing well listen mary you've um been
just the best guest ever so hilarious and intelligent and honest which is amazing i need to be more
hilarious i was just thinking you're thinking of [ __ ] i need to be more funny am i funny you are funny yeah oh that's that's the only time you're
funny through being honest no this is the thing you're just honest and a lot of people they skirt around what they they truly think because they're trying to find the
correct politically correct words or phrases and you don't seem to give a [ __ ] which i think makes for great listening
you you're already there well yeah i i am yeah but maybe you're more descriptive
so it's even more hilarious but i you know yeah just thank you so much my pleasure and thank you for
rescheduling me another bit of a nightmare you were definitely worth it
i really appreciate it love and luck for all you do thank you please shine your light in the world that's needed i mean it i'll do my very best
[Music] oh
[Music] you

intro
in a fixed mindset people think that success is all about talent having the gift a
growth mindset is saying okay talent obviously matters it's a factor but it's not enough it's what we
do with our talents i wasn't the best table tennis player in the world i never got into the top 20 of the world rankings
but with that attitude i maximize my own potential i think leadership counts when it comes
to innovation i mean the way amazon conducts meetings then when they start talking the most senior person always speaks last
you'll get an unvarnished access to the insights of your brilliant team rather than
speaking first and everyone basically converging on what you as the leader has just said there are a lot of people with truly
brilliant ideas huge potential who never
act on their dreams but having the idea doesn't mean a thing you've actually got
to act on that idea honestly i think we shouldn't underestimate how damaging it can be if
[Music]
matthew syed he's written some of the most important challenging thought-provoking books in the self-development self-improvement
team development team building company building leadership space and his ideas are original they are
challenging they are fresh they are important he was an elite level sportsman and his ideas come from
the world of sport but also the world of business from politics from writing from culture from society he evangelizes
about diverse thinking about including more ideas about challenging leadership about
How do you define success
challenging yourself about what it takes to start and why most people
spend their life sitting on ideas that could potentially change their life but are seemingly imprisoned trapped and
blocked by their own mindset he talks about how some of the most talented people in the
world can fall short of their potential and how some people with seemingly no talent at all can
achieve miraculous things if you apply the learnings from this conversation i have no doubt that it will make you a better person it
will make your teams more innovative and it will lead you to living a more fulfilled life so without further ado
i'm stephen bartlett and this is the director ceo i hope nobody's listening but if you are then please keep this to
yourself
matthew everyone wants to be successful everybody i don't know one person that doesn't want to be successful so i think
it's probably quite important to define what that word means under your own definition of that
word the holistic definition not just a professional definition but how would you define that
well look it's great to be here steve i i think that's quite a deep question quite a philosophical one
really just getting started i know what kind of opening question is this i i um obviously as as a former sports
person i was a table tennis professional for for a number of years um success was defined in terms of
winning matches and achieving very uh clear tangible
objectives like winning the national championships or the the commonwealth and so the but i think
when it comes to life beyond sport yeah it's so objective in something like the 100 meter sprint
you want to be your pb and you can see it on a digital readout at the end of a race how close you've come or whether
you've achieved that objective in the life beyond sport i have to say one of the things that is quite
difficult i think for sports people to transition is it's more elusive more subjective
more ephemeral and i think it is a really difficult thing to define what you personally mean by
success i'm not 100 sure that i've defined it for myself yet have you have you i i well i i'm i'm
getting closer on a prof in a professional sense i what i would how i'd answer that question is
i'd say i think i'm successful if in my professional life
if i am striving if i'm taking on a worthwhile challenge
with people i love so the key terms there are worthwhile subjective to find out how you like
challenge which i think is um in integral to being motivated and getting up in the
morning and you know all the emotions you need to be internally uh internally fulfilled and
motivated and then with people i love which i think is just a really which speaks to community and human interaction which i
think is part of our human yeah and the yeah look that makes a lot of sense to me i i have to say what one
thing that given what you've just said you'll probably agree with i think the narrow way that success
has sometimes been defined in western capitalist societies has been deeply mistaken that it's all about how
much money you have in your bank account and i think we all know although you know it's a bit of a cliche
to say that it doesn't provide happiness certainly not of a sustained nature
i think that that thing about social interaction the thing that makes me happiest for sure
is putting one's heart and soul into a project like for example writing a book and then
getting a letter from somebody who explains in their own way how it has positively
impacted their life and there is no feeling like that for me as a writer and that
really is a powerful engine to motivate you to come up with a new idea for a new
book the fact that you know it's having it has meaning for other people not that they've paid money to buy it
and that money has been transferred via a publisher into my bank account that is much less significant i mean it's great
if you do get money for it you know you can look after your kids or you can do something with it but it's that
feedback that sense of making some kind of a difference i mean in a funny kind of a way that
that's why for a long time um as i came towards the end of my television squad i wanted to go to politics i thought that is the place
where you can make the most difference right you've got the levers to do something interesting and then i realized it was
not quite as funner avenue perhaps as as uh as writing why why is it that
human beings seem to get so much intrinsic joy from helping others i think this is a
great and deep significance and you know just to put a historical lens on this after the enlightenment the idea was of
human beings as individuals individualism was the great goal of
political life and i think we conceived of people as deciding uh to perhaps interact with
other people deciding to have families and you might remember margaret thatcher once said there's no such thing as
society there are just individual men and women and families i mean she had more to say
after that it wouldn't be fair to say that was her entire philosophy by any means i think she was a great prime minister
in many ways but but if you actually go back deeper in human history
when we uh our ancestors lived at the same time as the neanderthals the neanderthals had
probably bigger brains than us they may have been individually smarter but humans lived in tighter more
socially connected groups what does that mean it means if somebody learns something useful they can share it
with one of their kin and therefore they can also share it with their children they can get a
cross-pollination of ideas they can bring ideas together and then it gets passed down the generations and it was that
sociality that conferred a competitive advantage on our ancestors above neanderthals
it's it is i think our distinctive quality we are social beings to an extent
greater i think than any others except the insects like uh ants who for slightly
different uh evolutionary reasons cooperate at scale and there's an element of virtue
signaling social media that sort of seems to have exacerbated this amongst our my
generation in particular who all seem to want to change the world but can't necessarily tell you what they want to change they just want to be a
person that's changed the world that's interesting that's interesting because about a decade ago i started
looking at you know now i'm i'm believe it or not 50. uh he's a little great well i was going to say i don't if you
have to remember oil of are you late no that's probably the slightly older people will remember i don't use that by
the way but um i uh started looking at how aspirations have changed since i was in
my choice so when i was at university everyone wanted to work for the u.n yeah that was kind of considered the great
sort of panacea of life but 10 years ago a lot of people were saying in surveys of young people
what do you want to do in life what do you want to be in life and the answer was famous yeah famous you know not not to
have a body of work that gives you fame you know to walk to you know you want to walk down the red
carpet having created an amazing film but no they just wanted the red carpet and i thought that was that was a dangerous
thing and i i'm sure there's been a correction since then but i think the obsession
there's been no correction and i think in some respects it's got worse i've just it's a real phenomenon i've noticed
in my generation where after i'll come off stage doing a public speech whatever kids will come up to me and say i want
to be a public speaker too i never wanted to be i pursued my desire to start a business and a byproduct of
that was they pay me to speak on stage now and fame also in my view should be a byproduct of the pursuit of something
that's intrinsically important to you right absolutely 100 correct and that's why the obsession
with fame is a massive danger i think to uh to a culture um the the thing about
speaking so so a completely unintended side effect of writing my first book so i'm
finishing table tennis and i'm like you know what am i going to do with the rest of my life uh you know how am i going to define
success and i decided to write this book in 2000 when does it come out 2010 called bounce
yes and i said this side effect was being invited to give a speech at a big corporation an investment bank an
american investment bank and obviously you know as an ex-ping-pong player i'm thinking what is going on here you
know how am i suppo imposter syndrome and also you know i went to a school i went to a comp you know we didn't do any
almost no public speaking you know we we learn stuff we learn things in the classroom
but the idea of getting up in and speaking in front of an audience was kind of very alien
so i wasn't that good right because i hadn't practiced that i'd never done it before and i came off the stage
and i thought you know what i'm just not cut out for this if i'm invited again to give a talk to a company i'll just politely decline
then i thought and it took me about i know 48 hours to think what a ridiculous way to hijack my own development if you
actually had the right attitude if you had the right mindset you can probably learn these skills and
take advantage of these brilliant opportunities because you always learn don't you when you go and speak in an organizer so i googled public speaking practice
and the first hit was called toastmasters and this is like a global network of just
public speaking clubs where other normal people um go to the club to develop social
confidence and the one nearest me in richmond was in twickenham just over the bridge and there was uh franco worked at lloyd's on the high
street just the group you give a speech they'd give you feedback and the mentoring was a really important
part of it because you need a bit of feedback and you know what you could have done better and then about two-thirds of the
way through there's something called table topics where somebody writes the list of topics on cards
but no one else in the room knows what they are so you have to go to the front you pick it up and then turn around and spontaneously talk for a minute on
whatever topic the first one i ever did was the natural history museum you know that's terrifying right you're not used to it but you learn and you
develop that skill um so so learning how to speak publicly
it took me three or four years and i'm not saying i'm brilliant at it now by any means but my goodness how much
better when you have a can-do attitude towards it and that brings us to the topic of mindset
Mindset
really nicely you know i've heard you talk about having a growth mindset and a fixed mindset what is the difference
between the two so i think for thank you for what it's worth i think this contrast is
is so important i mean i can talk about it through my own life but you know in a fixed mindset people think
that success however defined is all about talent having the gift
uh having the genetic inheritance and you know having the personality trait in order to excel
a growth mindset is saying okay talent obviously matters it's a factor but it's not enough it's what we do with
our talents so people in a fixed mindset have two massive risks one they think they're so
talented they don't even need to try so think of a young person who's just been
invited to join the manchester united academy and they're suddenly getting money into their bank account they're able to buy
the fast car and they think i'm god's gift and they and the amount of academy coaches who
have come to me and said we don't understand it we had this hard-working youngster we invited them into the academy
and then they just went off the rails it's a fixed mindset they think their success is the short so they stop putting in the hard yards and don't
transition into the first team so that's one danger the other danger is people who don't think they're god's
gift but like me at goldman sachs you make one failure and you interpret that as meaning i
obviously don't have talent therefore i'm just going to give up you see what i mean yeah so that's the negative version yeah so you've got the
i'm super talent is everything and i've got it so therefore i don't need to try talent is everything
i don't have it therefore i should give up they're both terribly uh damaging i think a growth mindset it
doesn't mean that we think we're all going to be the best speaker in the world i wasn't the best table tennis player in the world i never got into the top 20 of
the world rankings but with that attitude i maximize my own potential and going back to your thing about
success that's not a bad definition now i think about it you know to try and be the best
that we can be in our own lives doesn't mean we're going to be the best who ever lived
you know not everyone could be muhammad ali or serena williams or or who or albert einstein but to be the
best we can be i think it's so wonderful and just from my own perspective i think
trying to fill one's own potential going on a journey that has some meaning there's something wonderfully um
uplifting something satisfying about that too i really like the combination of those two ideas this idea of being the best
you can be but realizing that it's a pursuit towards something that you may never get to
right so the journey and the journey towards being the best you can be at something which has a lot of meaning to
you maybe maybe that's the definition we were looking for now i think that that point you make about the journey is
really really important what was it i think it was robert louis stevenson said to travel is a better thing than to arrive
oh yeah and in a weird kind of way i can say i talked about trying to win the nationals but first of all in the nationals i remember
winning going home i was living on my own in a flat in richmond i got home and i thought is that it you know what i mean it was
the the fun was actually the training and the camaraderie with my practice partners
and seeing those small improvements through time i mean that's consistent with most high
performance athletes and um business people and i was reading this piece and i think it was in the telegraph about
um olympic depression where you have the olympians who train for the olympics they and whether they get a gold medal like
michael phelps who fell into depression or whether they lose either way the outcome is they just lose orientation in their life yeah and
and this is why i i and also i felt it myself when a company came along when i was 24 and offered to buy my company and i go home
look at right move look at all the cars i can buy and everything and i feel this sense of emptiness and like but then what what's my life
without this and genuinely that was like an existential crisis because i was like i can't sell this thing but the insecure
broke kid in me thought he was doing this to sell this thing yeah and it was just this really you know
it's one i think one of the deep paradoxes of the human mind i mean the the sense of anti-climax
when one achieves a long cherished ambition i want to be a millionaire i want to buy an aston martin
i want to win the olympic gold medal i remember talking to victoria pendleton oh yeah the olympian yeah because you
lit the cyclist you know you live with this ambition it's what gets you out of bed
in the morning right i want to win the olympic gold it's what when you're on the track she was explaining you know it's what makes you
push harder because you've got this this goal this destination that's pulling you this magnet pulling
you towards it then when you get it you wake up the next day and what on earth is getting
you out of bed what's causing you to push yourself that's one of the reasons i think people who make money very quickly
face massive many not all and this is well documented psychology i mean you'll know about the
people who win lotteries whose marriages can end who end up in in often depression i
mean that's not a cliche this is well established and i think it's because you get something and then it's like
what is left to pursue in life i do some interviews for the time sports
stars and i mentioned victoria pendleton billy jenkins yeah exactly the same
um uh david beckham um uh ryan giggs
uh i mean i've interviewed you know most of the the ronaldo most of the leading many of the
leading sports people and it's the same story and i think what i've noticed is that
as you did that capacity to take a step back and to say you know what i'm feeling low
feeling empty i need to find something else that's gonna galvanize me and and that's what gets people back on and
i think the antidote is being aware of that yeah and because then now when i achieve things
in my life i don't come into those achievements with this expectation of exponential joy
and so i can almost enjoy it more right you know yeah no i totally get
that i i trying to think you know yeah i think look just one of the things that i've noticed from
my own personal lives the more busy i've got sometimes you don't take enough time to
take a step back and to say you know this was a great thing that happened or or to be in the moment when something is
happening with one dude do you have kids no no with with one's children or wife or partner or whatever and i think
i'm slowly you know i write books on this stuff but i i i'm learning all the time and that's one of the reasons i want to
do the podcast when i've read about you i thought you've had such a different set of experiences to me i'll learn a lot from you too
we've now had two subscribers come in and watch from behind the scenes we're going to start picking more so all you've got to do if you want that to be
you is hit the subscribe button let's talk about failure than something you talk about at great length
Failure & moving out of your comfort zone
i think um tend to believe that a lot of the reason why people don't reach their potential however we define that is because they
are risk adverse and failure is something they just can't their self-esteem just can't bear
i think that's i think that's true my own sense is that this has been exacerbated
by the social media so you tell me how the social media it may have changed a lot since i wrote my first book for young people but
at the time psychologists had come up with this concept of the curse of perfectionism
and their thesis was that young people are obviously now on the social media a lot
and a lot of people when they're putting together their social media posts they do it in such a way as to make their
lives look really good you know this is the holiday i just had on this wonderfully sunny beach and um you know they might even airbrush
photos to make themselves look better and this is my wonderful performance on the piano and and the problem is
people then start to think that success is about looking and acting in a perfect way that's
massively problematic because why would you want to try anything new which is inherently a risk because if
you're doing something the first time you're obviously not going to be perfect um and if you do mess up you draw the
thing that goes back to the fixed mindset you draw the conclusion well i'm obviously not talented enough because i haven't nailed
it the first time around i think this was also bolstered by in your own reality television now i
think reality tell the idea of instant success instant gratification
overnight elevation into in into the heavens and if you you know particularly young
people think that success is like that they don't realize the incremental steps you need to take to fulfill your
potential because as you know most businesses succeed because you know
i don't know whether you're familiar with the american jargon but you get a minimum viable product you test the
value proposition early you find out the inevitable deficiencies in the prototype or the piece of software
and then you make adaptations in silicon valley they call it failing fast in other words they're failing fast in
order to get to a better answer if you stop the first time you fail or if you don't try at all you're never
going to get to an answer if you think of the history of science science is a success the most successful
human institution because scientists by and large are willing to test their hypotheses
you know they test it they look at the empirical evidence and they change it in the light of what the evidence is
telling them that is the basic pattern of science and and i think the problem is as he alluded
to is that if young people are like goodness me i don't want to look anything other than perfect it destroys their capacity to
grow and and to have a life of fulfillment because jk rowling
put it brilliantly she said the only way never to fail is never to try but then your life is a failure
because you've just stayed in your comfort zone the whole time i see that i resonate with all of that so much and there's specifically this
this idea i love the science analogy because seeing it as a hypothesis you write in science you you start with hypothesis
you're not romantic about it and then you go in pursuit and you you agnostically go and test it
right whereas what you're saying is you know young people or ambitious people generally will start with a hypothesis
and they will long in need for it to be perfectly incorrect and this is also why
businesses fail because founders just they just do everything and i i failed in my first business
for many years because of that because i was obsessed romantic about my hypothesis
being correct not romantic about the outcome which was trying to be a successful person right look i i think i think that's
really really significant and i think that's a great great way of framing it look by the way some scientists fall in love
with their theories yeah and they can't adapt it i mean there's been a few examples during the pandemic um and and by the way i mean i don't
know listen there's an interest in this but there's a brilliant study by philip tetlock who's an american psychologist
and he looked at forecasters so people trying to predict next year's gdp or oil price or other things of this
kind and he found a really interesting pattern that the highest reputation forecasters
who are on television the most on average make the worst predictions and can you see what
what is an error of ego an error of prediction is an opportunity to adapt the model in order to make it more
predictive in the long run but if you've been on the tv and you're supposed to be the god of forecasting
you start defending your prior assumptions and so people who have an ego that gets
in the way of hypothesis testing they are brilliant at creative self-justification
i think the people who are most dangerous to companies and innovation are intelligent highly
talented people in a fixed mindset they're just inveterate obstacles
to making the changes you need to change in order to get the business to where you want to go to or where you want the economic model
to get to and so on so i think it's the same in meetings you know i've
as you know i'm very interested in how how businesses succeed and the the forum in which we take most key decisions are meetings because
no one person has a monopoly on truth so you want to talk to other people but these can be really ineffective if
people think that when someone challenges you they're insulting you they're not they're testing your hypothesis we should think of meetings
as mutual hypothesis testing so that we can collectively get to the best uh strategy or idea and i think when you
frame it in that way you take the stigma out of challenge and dissent and failure
let's challenge that then so if if we've got a meeting we've got five 10 people around this table we've
got an intern over there uh we've got the ceo there got managers directors around the table
one new person one person's been here for 10 years you've got all these different sort of dynamics of people trying to
get promotions get a payroll oh my god the ceo's at the table i don't wanna be an idiot i don't wanna say anything dumb you know
and all of those like dynamics how do you get those dynamics out of the way and just become focused on
letting the best idea win right so this is really well studied um i think the thing to to try and
really convey is how dangerous the dynamics you've described can be
because what tends to happen in a very hierarchical organization where the ceo or the team leader has
discretion over pay and promotion is that people don't say what they think
they say what they think the leader wants to hear that's fine if the leader knows everything there is to know because
you're just basically ventriloquizing but so in a simple environment you don't need to have a team right you
just have the leader make a decision and everyone but when it's a difficult complex decision in other words the ones that confer a competitive advantage on a
business the leader needs to hear the different perspectives to make a better judgment but the extent to which
this happens a good example is in aviation so i'll describe a classic case in
in the aviation is a great area to study by the way when it comes to team dynamics
so this is united airlines 173 and it's a flight that took off out of
uh denver colorado in december 1978 and it's flying to portland in oregon
and as a plane's coming in on the final approach the pilot pulls the lever to lower the landing gear and you know when
you're in the cabin you hear it go down and clicks into place but on this occasion there's this really
loud bang the plane kind of deviates and the light that should illuminate on the dashboard to show that
the wheels are down it hasn't gone on so the pilot doesn't know if the wheels are down it's pitch black so they can't ask
air traffic control to look up so he puts the plane into a holding pattern above suburban portland
then they try and troubleshoot the the issue so the first thing is the engineer so in these days the cockpit had a
captain a co-pilot and an engineer the engineer goes into the cabin and on this particular model of aircraft when
the wheels are down two bolts shoot up above the wings the bolts are up but they're still not 100 sure right and you want to know if
the wheels are down before you come in so so the pilot they they radio to the manufacturer and that you know they're kind of
explaining what's happened the manufacturer is like yeah we think the wheels are down but we're not sure then the pilot's like i wonder if the
reason that the light didn't go on the dashboard is because of faulty wiring so he starts playing around with with
the in the plane still in the holding pattern as they're doing all of these different checks but at this point another
safety critical issue has come into play the plane's running out of fuel right and the engineer
knows that the plane is running out of fuel because he can see it going down to zero on the dials right
he has a big incentive to tell the pilot that the plane is running out of fuel
because otherwise he will die so you have this juxtaposition of objective information and maximum
incentive but in the 1970s it was a command and control culture you know the pilot was genomic
yeah the pilot was deemed to be the boss the omniscient um controller and the other two were
supposed to basically carry out that controller's instructions and they called the pilot sir
it was almost always a man right and and so imagine if the engineer says to the pilots
now why do we have a team we have a team because no one person has all of the information they're narrow in
their perceptual bandwidth other things are happening at the same time but if the engineer says to the pilot
you know what we're running out on pu of fuel the implication is the pilot didn't know that already the pilot might
get offended isn't he supposed to know everything and we know from this and many other incidents that
in that situation we don't speak to each other directly we don't test hypotheses directly we code
our language we mitigate our speech and from the voice recorder from the black box
we know that the engineer said instead of we need to land because we're running out of fuel critical information for the pilot to
make the right strategic decision he said oh we're kind of getting low on fuel here
and the pilot because of the insinuation he knows everything wasn't even listening so the plane crashes but not just that
plane a number of incidents in the 1970s of exactly the same kind happened
because communication was so skewed by this very steep hierarchy it happens in surgical
operating theaters famously when nurses can't speak up because they're worried if i say
something this is the surgeon you know the the the big cheese and
we know from you know for what it's worth from randomized control trial evidence lee thompson at northwestern university meetings are a catastrophe
the vast majority of them absolute disaster because people are not sharing information they're basically
playing a political game to curry favor with the boss so what you so that so the short answer is you need what's called
psychological safety it's i hate the jargon all that means is an environment where everyone feels they
can be candid and they can say what they really think and hypotheses are tested when google
did a big data analysis of his most successful software development teams psychological safety was
the biggest predictor of success because it means you're getting that interplay of ideas that's so important
it's interesting because you know these big companies well big companies by by definition i guess have more ideas
right but they are often the least innovative exactly and that seems like a bit of a it should
be the other way around you would one would think that the biggest companies would be the most innovative because they have more brains more ideas but they're just
that's what yeah yeah that's interesting point you make there so big you're right so a bit so well let's
think about that what would generate good ideas it's the number of ideas not the number of people if you have an
organization with a very homogenous culture very commanding control
a lot of sociological convergence you might have 10 000 people all thinking the same way i
mean you've seen professional services companies where you see the senior leadership team and they may look a bit different but
they're all absolutely thinking exactly the same way they've been there so long that's a big danger for companies see
with cities you increase the size of cities they become more innovative companies get less innovative because they get so much convergence
they have a lot of people but they think in the state it's an echo chamber basically right whereas startups sometimes
a startup might be an idea that's completely off the beaten track and then suddenly you've got this
opportunity to scale but even with startups you know often when they go public they start to lose their capacity
to to innovate and i think that's why you know i've written a book on it you need a culture of diversity so that you begin
to protect and and and value the um like the diverse ideas that enable an
organization to anticipate future disruptions and come up with new
The importance of creating diversity
talk to me about creating a culture of diversity in your in your business then if you're starting a company if you're running a company at
scale how do you increase the diversity of right ideas yes so um so the
the most important for me the most important thing by far is landing the argument as to why it
matters a lot of people don't think it matters i mean i remember going to an hr conference and the
the the speaker was talking about diversity is a
wonderful thing you've all need more of it and it will always help you do better as an organization
and this really awkward customer at the back said can i ask a question and uh like yeah okay
um imagine i am the coach of an olympic sprint relay team yeah and
suppose um i've got you said who was the fastest person in the world at the time was usain bolt
suppose i've got usain bolt in my team and suppose hypothetically i had cloning technology
so i could clone usain bolt to have four usain bolts in my four by 100 relay team there's no diversity in that team but
they're all very fast right yeah if you said you need to diversify your team
that would mean hiring slower runners i don't want to do that as an olympic coach and it was like the air in the room just
it's like it'd been punctured and everyone was like that's an awful thing but he was right that question was
you know in simple activities cognitive diversity of opinion cognitive diversity
doesn't help you if it's obvious what to do why would you want diversity if you've already got a solution a can solution
you just need to scale it you don't need diver but when there's a complex environment that logic
turns on its head so if you imagine for example you've got five people each one of whom
has one brilliant idea you might think you have five brilliant ideas but if they all have the same idea you've only got
one yeah all you need is two different ideas and suddenly you've tripled 300 increase in the creativity
of that group that's where cognitive diversity matters and if your mission is to solve complex problems
diversity is the cornerstone of how well you do it and once you land that argument people
start to at the moment people say too many people think diversity is a politically correct box
ticking exercise and when diverse voices come in they're condescended to they're not properly included
once you realize it's a strength organization start to harness it
to do the great things that they want to do i can imagine that organizations don't
typically organizations don't know what they don't know and they don't they don't know what they don't have as
well so if you don't see what i mean it's like an unknown i know so when the board when he's like let's say we've got six
white six-year-old board members sat around a table of a company that's really successful and
then they go you know what's their incentive to hide they think we've been doing great
we're all very smart you smart yeah i'm smart yeah you smart yeah i'm smart yeah and like how do you make the case
to them that they need to hire a black woman and that's going to help
when they've just been killing the game with these six white men right well it's okay so again you're
absolutely right to ask the question it depends on the context yeah let's say for example the organization
is uh an advertising company and they've traditionally been selling to
white middle-aged men who uh think rather as they do the the
if they only want to sell to white men then there may be no advantage
in hiring somebody with a different perspective if they're seeking to broaden their capacity
to sell to people from different demographics they won't have the tacit knowledge that they need in order to do
if you think of the cia they hired brilliant analysts in the post-war period and they thought they were the best
intelligence agency in the world but a lot of the information was obviously confidential it's only now we
can see how awful they were because almost everyone almost 100 of their analytical
team were white middle class west coast anglo-saxon protestant
liberal arts graduates nothing wrong with that background right but if you're trying to assess threats
emerging from around the world the soviet union how would you possibly
understand the probability of a conglomeration of different nations
falling apart if you've been brought up in a stable middle class family in america
how are you going to understand tribal sectarianism and the risks of radicalization
in the middle east when you come from that background you know when we invaded when when the the the uk joined the
coalition to invade iraq you know there was a genuine view that you impose democratic institutions and it will work
effectively there was no real understanding of the history of iraq and how those
institutions would be hijacked by sectarian interests because these guys had gone to university they'd
learned all sorts of interesting things but they had no deep understanding of the dynamics in that
country so if i was talking to the for example the director general the cia
i would be explaining you know what you know but in the complex world there's stuff that you don't know there's stuff that
people who think like you don't know be creative about how you optimize the diverse insights that can
help you do the job you want to do now if it was the cia demographic
diversity is critical you need to have people from different backgrounds who have had different experiences in order to understand
emerging threats for an advertising team it would be different for a team of economic forecasters i can tell you what it would
look like mathematically you want highly accurate individual forecasters whose models
generate diverse predictions because when you average them you get an incredibly it's called the wisdom of the crowds so
there are ways to do it i mean there are tools that we use with our clients to make this work and for what it's worth the really
you know obviously slightly self-serving thing to say but i think most of the innovative organizations are thinking exactly what
you've just said we need to figure out what it is that we don't know quickly have some tenuous sense so we can start
plugging these blind spots right and on that point of innovation which we touched on what are
How do we create innovation within teams?
the so running a business running a global business as it scaled i could see that we were getting less innovative you kind of get complacent
you build teams you get you know your teams get more comfortable with how it's always been done and then just
getting them to disrupt themselves becomes increasingly difficult especially when more people get involved things seem to slow down someone goes on
and you'll leave and then you say you've got a new innovative idea you put it on an email thread it stumbles around the email for
thread for four months nobody's incentivized to do that because they're all getting paid to do their current job and you don't typically have
like an innovation team so when it's everybody's job it's nobody's job these are all probably you know and then these are
then you talk about failure as well people aren't incentivized to fail in big organizations what are the parameters or
the factors or the dynamics of a team that does innovate
so i think i look i think that's all right and i i think it's a bandwidth issue i mean you talked about a team that's been successful thus far i mean
to take the legal profession which have you know used the billable hour for a very long time
have done a particular and they're busy and they're making money but i hope that it's not a particularly
unique insight to say that many of these legal firms will be out of business in a decade if they don't leverage machine
learning right and ai in all sorts of different ways and start to disrupt their own so you
can carry on being busy whilst your equity value is about to disappear right
so unless one is able to say not just we need to be doing things well for our
clients and doing what we've always done effectively but we need to also be thinking about how we do things
differently and better you may well be busy you may well have satisfied customers but it just takes
one competitor to innovate and you're out of the game so i think that that is a good way to
focus minds on sparing some bandwidth to that question of innovation
so it doesn't just get dropped it's tough right because that often means a change in personnel
yeah and nobody likes that idea in big organizations i think this about some of the big advertising groups like they call them the big six
and the big six have been around some of them one of them in particular has been around for a hundred years doing
advertising what are the big things like wpp publicis those kind of yeah and i was thinking you know in their
executive teams you've got people that have been there for 20 30 years then this thing called social media comes along
and they're thinking oh my god so it's not billboards anymore on tv um where does that leave me and i'm not
gonna know what tick tock and snapchat are and the threat of having to replace oneself i think often
and your ego often um means that you go down with the titanic yeah and you know for what it's worth
you see this in in um in in many different areas so i think i don't do you admire amazon as a company
admirer yeah i mean in some ways not in others yeah so they should pay more taxes yeah
yeah but i mean what they've done is just staggering right but i mean i think so i think leadership counts sometimes
when it comes to innovation i mean he's obviously no longer um ceo but i think if you read jeff bezos's letters to
shareholders they're all about the stuff that we've been talking about experimentation unbelievable commitment um you know we talked about
the meetings you know dissent and then commit um almost all of the
i mean the way amazon conduct meetings you know they will as you know they'll they'll read the the agenda item in silence
so that every single person is bringing an independent perspective to bear on what are the risks of this what might
make it how could it be improved what might make it fail and then when they start talking the most senior person
always speaks last you'll get an unvarnished access to the insights of your brilliant
team rather than speaking first and everyone basically converging on what you as the leader has just said so
they have a range of ways of trying to ensure they sustain but you know amazon will will probably
struggle but they've done well so far and it's it's i think it's a good case study of how to how to sustain it but it's not i mean
Social media, how do I keep up?
but i i've got to say honestly one of the things that i'm most interested in is you know i mentioned i'm 50.
i'm totally bewildered by social media and you obviously you you inhabit right that world you know it
you've got a nuanced granular understanding of the whole thing yes imagine you're me
right so now what do you know i i don't know i don't i don't have the
faintest idea of how to youthfully engage with the social i came to twitter late my tweets are
rubbish i mean look if anyone's following me thank you but i know i'm not very good at it but i
it's an alien world for me and i'm not i've never been on facebook speaking sorry so we're speaking right
so what should i do how do i learn how did you learn to speak toastmasters
well it's a similar thing but it isn't though because is it yeah it's i when i did my first public talk
when i was 14 and i'm i always say this i was i was speaking in front of like parents evening my i'm shaking my hands are sweating so
much in this paper shaking so much i realize i'm not gonna be able to read the piece of paper because it's moving too much so i just made up the speech
and it's a similar thing with twitter you just said i've done my first tweet awful tweets and then you're like it sounds like you
quit or you stop oh you were disappointed still there but i don't do it very much because i kind of i i say that i've
probably done a few thousand tweets but i came to it late and i i still feel that if you
okay let me ask you this if you had to summarize what you know yeah about the social media and and how
one engages with it how one you know one wants one's articles to be read you know how would
is it impossible to encapsulate that in a minute i would say so i so what i do
professionally what i used to do professionally is i'd go and do these talks telling people all about social media all the tips tricks techniques
algorithms all the psychology and really explaining it to them and then i'd end my talk by
telling them that everything i've just told them probably won't be the case in three to six months because it changes so much
and and what that therefore means is the only way to know what i know is to play with the toy as often as you
can and it's and so from this is why i say to people when they come up to me and say how do i become a social media expert
i say to them often like we'll name something you're interested in they'll go you know i don't know cars i'll say go make a car
instagram page and run it because then it puts you in the trenches and it makes it puts you in
a growth moment or so and it's just practice and it's that's all it is so if you want to become a
master of this thing that's constantly changing and there's ten updates to the top um four social media apps every single
week then you have to have a reason to be showing you've have that life has to be giving
you a reason to show up every day and open it up and look at it and and perform these iterative
uh tests which give you this feedback loop so for me the real savior for me as a social media
ceo and most of the things i went on to sell to clients were learnings that i got from two places the first is um in my company i
create this thing called ever changing landscape very very simple internal group everybody shares everything they know
every day oh my god i've just seen tick tock have launched this new button goes into the group we then text it to all of our employees
at 9 am in the morning every morning on whatsapp so and it's this constant loop of what's
new what's changing our mantra as a company became keeping brands at the forefront of what's possible
and what but that slogan appreciates the fact that there's a marketing director [ __ ] themselves because it's changing every day
and they want to be at the forefront of what's possible but they're [ __ ] so it feels like two jigsaw pieces i'm [ __ ] myself
because this thing's changing you're saying you're gonna keep me at the forefront of what's possible which is gonna make me look good to the ceo
we're gonna work with social chain and the second thing that kept me at the very forefront and made me good at social media
is i run my personal brand on social media which means that on linkedin instagram
twitter every day i'm either tweet and i've got a team that helped me now but i'm tweeting i'm looking at the numbers
doing a post looking in the comments okay that didn't go well click on the insights button loads of people seem to share this one
why is that ah maybe that's because there's eight posts and okay the subtitles oh my god look at the retention number when we did subtitles
yeah the retention so much higher click on the insights oh my god look so when we do that at the start of the video
80 of people fall off in the first five seconds of all of my videos so i've got to do something special in
the first five seconds and it's that constant learning over 10 years then people call you as a expert it's
not i just been playing with a toy longer yeah and that that i mean it's great to hear you say that because i think that's the pattern of
learning in pretty much all fields every field in all aspects of life yeah i mean that's science right you're
getting the iterative feedback exactly and the more granular the feedback i mean if you know
that people are switching off the video after five seconds or ten seconds better than just knowing yeah that 50
dropped off over the total time so so it's the granularity and speed and objectivity of that feedback so playing
with do you think that um so you may think this is a cop-out but say you're you know it is me now trying
to get if you if you're a writer yeah and you obviously got a lot going on yeah in terms of coming out with the new
but do you think it's outsourcing i mean obviously you can you could outsource it to a brilliant person to do you could outsource it to a
brilliant person to do a lot of charlatans a lot of snakehole salesmen so it's fine how do you know what's good when you don't know what's
good well that's one of the reasons well i've as it happens i have tried to do that and i've had a
number of proposals there that i'll check with you okay that's what we'll do in exchange i'll help you find someone that that is
actually good um that's the quid pro quo right you could have a lovely
what i would say is you can learn one channel one or two channels with no matter how busy you are um and
if you do learn one or two channels the impact it will have on your business your as an author as a
as as a you know someone that um shares their ideas with the worlds and creates blogs is tremendous you only
have to learn one or two channels better than 95 percent of people and to do that you just need to use it
every other day and if i was you i'd be thinking twitter i'd be thinking
it depends medium is an interesting one i'm going to give you three twitter linkedin and medium i wouldn't bother
with instagram if i was you if you're a writer and you're your your the audience that you speak to with the
ideas you convey linkedin twitter super easy to learn and i i know that sounds like really of
course i'll say that because like but those two platforms i think will have a exponential impact on your business
that's interesting so probably i i so somebody in my office handles the linkedin and and instagram but i've i've not
really been on them enough and learned so this is really really really helpful do you think that social media
has been a force for good in the world because it's difficult i mean i don't know if you you've been following the news on
that the last week you probably have the last 48 hours but i see you know we talked a bit
earlier about how we can converge with people who think the same as us and we've obviously seen
that on certain types of social media where you get these echo chambers trump trump the filter bubble other
things of that kind but at the same time you have access if you want it to lots of different voices and people in
certain types of societies can blow whistles or things that are going wrong you know i i think the the the political
consequences of the social media are among the most important of my lifetime
um i obviously am not a native and you know i have a particular analysis
what's your take on that so the great things to come from social media the first things that spring to
mind are important ideas being shared at scale and change happening faster than it ever possibly could have
so you think about key movements around lgbtq rights um you think about certain causes you
think about atrocities happening in certain parts of the world having a window into those things and those ideas spreading very
quickly and the consensus being arrived that quickly therefore actually been taken
quickly therefore changing political change happenings at light speed i think is amazing um i
think one could say being able to make
some type of connection with people in faraway lands however on the adverse consequences of
social media the biggest ones for me are um the the things like instagram
which create which will ultimately lead you to believing that you're a piece of [ __ ] and not enough and how does it do that because
everyone's life looks so good everyone's amazing um so that does happen on instagram of course yeah i mean the algorithm will
show you um the prettiest people typically typically the prettiest people that have the best lives and then
obviously there's this almost like black mirror-esque ranking where if i post a selfie and i'm not
looking on my a-game i'll get less likes so that's like the the world's going um
five by ten steve today and then i come back with the filter and i'm posing and i've done a little
photoshop here and the face tune here and i come back look at my fake stuff and it was instagram oh well done and then it's incentivizing
me it's you know positively reinforcing me to live a more fake more shallow more materialistic life
that's so interesting and and people do you know they change their phones to look better i write about this in my
book the the ceo of an app called facetune said that um facetune is basically an app that
allows you to very easily without any editing skills change completely how you look you can change your skin color that make
you make your face have no spots on it you can suck your face in your hips in and it it's so easy to do and um
and on top of and so the ceo of that company said that he hit a gold mine and he says openly he says i it was just a gold mine
the amount of downloads that app has had from young people who want to change how they look is staggering then you have this other
thing now with which with these face filters where i can put a filter on and it will just clear my skin up and
suck my face in just a little bit and now people you know people can't operate without them i think i'm
probably guilty of it too if i can just press this button and it's going to increase my prospects of dating and i'm going to go back to the stuff if
you don't tell me you're having problems getting data i mean that i can't well actually
people can't see you
you've been on it he's been on here oh has it he's a great guy but he was like all these that's the two sort of iconic
young entrepreneurs but this thing about instagram is really really interesting
really interesting so you think it is actually incentivizing people
constructing there is no way it isn't if you so let me give you some more information on this so um when
when they did a stack this vast report on which social platforms having the most adverse impact on young
people's mental health instagram was stand out it's a visual platform which is um
ranking you on how you look and the algorithm will show you the richest smart the richest most beautiful most
successful people you've got the kardashians on there with 150 million followers who are
literally have been in the last couple of months um been like a paparazzi person took the
photo of them on the beach and then you got to see what they posted and it's they don't look the same and
you've got 100 million girls following this person who is lying about the fact that they don't have cellulite
and they're not a normal you know because this is these are normal things we all have you know cellulite and this and this and the rasher and spots here but that
and you think about how we attribute the value of anything in our lives through contrast and in which the context in which we see it
so if you put i talk about this in my book as well if you put three tvs on a wall in an electronic shop
people will think the most expensive tv is too expensive and too bougie they'll
think the cheapest tv is probably gonna break and not very good so typically they go for the middle one whereas if you remove them the two in
which you the two next to it then they make different decisions and you've seen this with like ash's paradigm and you see it
on menus and the way that we attribute the value like i would be the prettiest richest most successful person on planet
earth if there was nobody else on earth because it's all a measure of comparison and instagram is a billion people
measure of comparison where do i rank you've written about this in yeah yeah yeah i'll give you my book yeah yeah i'm
gonna read it was it how to be a happy millionaire no it's the title is happy sexy
millionaires and i'm i'm kind of trying to instagram people instagram bait people into buying the book right
right right because much of buying books is virtually signaling you know you're right right so the other thing that intrigued
me on the way here today was listening to the podcast where you say this is my podcast you know i'm slightly
embarrassed about don't tell anyone about it whatever you do yeah you know i would never have i would never have thought of that as a way of
having a handle on the part i love that absolutely loved it but it's in funny kind of way it's kind of like as a parent
Human psychology
it's a bit like reverse psychology vegetables what getting your kids to eat vegetables yeah yeah but but you know i think the
true the truth of human psychology probably you know i mean you mentioned ashley hey by the way you know on psychology and on on the
global reach of twitter you talked about ash's conformity uh experiment that's that varies
systematically around the world so so uh in in western countries
more individualistic countries people deviate more from the herd and explain what that is
because yes so um if i if you're thinking of the same experiment the lines yeah yeah so so solomon ash one of the most
famous experiments in in modern psychology he um drew a number of vertical lines
um uh which were of the same length and then a fifth line
that was significantly different in length to the other four and then he got people to answer the
question do you think these i think i've got this broadly right do you think all of these lines are of the same length
and if you have people answering that on their own like 99 say the fifth line is of a different length to the other four but what ash
did is he got you know 10 confederates to come in and say oh they're the same and then oh they're the same and then
the third person oh yeah they're the same length and the fourth person they're the same name then when it gets to the actual subject
of the experiment they're like oh my goodness if all these people think that it must be the same and so they say yeah
they're all the same so they're effectively disbelieving the evidence of their own eyes in order to fit in with the
crowd now that conformity bias which surprises all the people is stronger in other parts of the world
than it is in in western can i just add as well on these lines when you see these lines
there is no possible way that that small line is anywhere near the size of the other
lines but as you say because of conformity these these participants just go along with it
and it just it's just beggar's belief that that's how human psychology works but there is a good reason for it if you
think about it i mean every now well is there a i mean there's a number of different theories about why it happens but one of them is
that occasionally um one can get things wrong that seem obvious
and if there's a lot of people who are independently saying the same thing that's very good evidence of what they're
saying is true um and so humans i think that bias evolved probably to enable us to
take advantage of the wisdom of the crowd but crowds if they can i mean crowds can converge on things
incorrectly but not independently of it so if you imagine a stock market bubble that's one person buying another one
seeing that person buying and then another person seeing those two buying and they get a bandwagon effect whereas
if 10 people independently say that these two lines are different and you have no reason to believe that
they're lying that's a good reason to start doubting so i think there but but you know the reason i mentioned
it is there is this global systematic variation in psychology so you may have heard of
uh something called the fundamental attribution error um where we tend to blame people for
things that are things have gone wrong because of the situation that's much stronger in the
west than it is in the rest of the world cognitive dissonance varies fundamentally even visual illusions um vary around the
world and the reason i mention that is i think it's helpful for businesses to
understand it but i think it actually reaches into our deep history and how human societies evolve which
which is the topic of my next bible i thought you might be interested in that okay so you guys know how much i
talk about huel and how much sure has changed my life and also how hewlett is the reason why much of
the reason why i'm in the best shape of my life i definitely think that if i hadn't had heal ready to drink i would not be in the shape that i am
and i'm stronger than i've ever been maybe two times stronger than i've ever been but what i want to talk to you about today is hughes brand new
product which is just launched last week which is the hule protein and he would have never had a
protein product but i was actually slightly involved in the testing of this product and it's amazing so i have pretty much
all the new flavors here and my favorite flavor as always if you know me you'll know this and a lot of people send me this in my dms a salted
caramel if you're looking to increase the protein intake in your diet and you're thinking about getting in
great shape over the coming months which i think a lot of people are then i would highly recommend you try
the salted caramel fuel protein why try that 100 calories per serving which is
staggering 20 grams of protein and it's got like 26 of your minerals and vitamins that you need to function
and have a healthy body it's also vegan and dairy-free it's also gluten-free no artificial
colorings like a lot of protein products have and no artificial flavorings at all that is the heel way to make
nutritionally complete good food for you give it a try send me your snapchats
instagrams tweets whatever you do if you try it and also send me your progress because i i get so many dms now from people that
are taking huel and that have seen significant changes in their life um and it fills me with joy that i get to talk about a product
on this podcast every week that you guys love back to the podcast one thing i i certainly do want to talk
What stops people reaching their full potential?
to you about as well is how as an individual because we've talked a lot about companies um and teams how as an individual one is to
reach that this is a super broad question and i hate asking broad questions because you tend to get broad answers but how has an individual one could reach
their potential or what what are some of the fundamental things that block people from reaching
their potential we've talked about a fear of failure um we've also touched on the idea that
people don't start because of that fear of failure and they don't get the feedback loops but what are the
other common sort of threads that you see in the reason why people never get near their potential in life
so so in addition to those things so fixed mindset fear of failure risk adversely all the things we've
addressed the other thing i think is i've become more interested in it's related to what we've said but i
think it's different is is what you might call initiative or agency
or proactivity i remember having an idea this is in the 1970s early 1980s i was
going to table tennis competitions and carrying this very heavy bag blue holdall ascot hodl and thinking my
goodness this is really doing my backing and it was just retrospectively obvious
that the solution to a problem that many people had who are traveling a lot is to put wheels on luggage
right wheeled suitcases which we all have now but having the idea doesn't mean a thing
you've actually got to act on that idea right you've got to say right i'm going to try and design
something i'm going to try and sell it to a department store i'm going to try and market it i'm going
to try and buy a shop i'm going to have to pay rent i have to go to the bank and get some debt
that is a there is a massive difference between a dormant passive idea and one that you act upon
another example i lived on richmond on a road in richmond when i first moved there in my mid-20s
and it had no off street parking what i didn't realize is that enrichment parking is a nightmare
because all the houses have less parking spaces than there are sorry
there are more there are less parking spaces and there are houses and so people park on the street and then they get taken up but you end up having
to park 10 minutes away a few doors down i notice at the top of the road there's a
house with a parking space that is always empty i thought to myself i should knock on
the door or i should write them a note and so i'm willing to pay rent or to buy
it from you but i never got around to doing it and then a few years later i was at a house
party and this person said i used to live on montague oh really that's interesting i lived there too
he said yeah i had the house at the time i said what with the parking space he said yeah what i never understood is that no one ever
came and asked whether they could rent it and i thought that idea was in my head and i never acted on it why because there is a there's a
fundamental inertia in a lot of us between you know it's easy to have an idea it takes a bit
of you know i remember when i was injured in table tennis and you know i wasn't practicing i wasn't doing anything and i
sat at home you know just posting the letter felt like an unbelievably tough thing to do you have
to go all the way to the post office by a stamp you know oh man it was like
i'm struggling you know this this the psychologist i've got interested in recently is a guy called michael fraser he's a german
really interesting guy and he looked at the unification of germany right after
the fall of the berlin wall and you know the west german business like this is fantastic we're gonna have this pool of really keen workers
and it just didn't work out because the east german um generalizing a little but the east
german workers had worked in in a communist system where all the decisions are taken by the party
bosses and so if a machine broke down instead of taking action to fix it they would just wait for
the boss person to come along and fix it for them if they needed the telephone number they
would wait and they wouldn't act on it and i think that being able to richard branson
you probably know i mean i got to know little you know he talked about how i mean i think this is probably
well he this is the way he tells it you know virgin atlantic he he was flying to the british virgin islands uh to meet
his girlfriend uh he has a stopover in miami uh they're bumped off the flight they delay
it to the next day and everyone sat there going this this is a disaster then he thought well hang on a second i could charter a private plane
which were which were in the airport so he took the initiative probably a few
people had that idea what about chartering a private plane but he actually picked up the phone and
said right how much will it cost to charter a plane you know ten thousand dollars he then went around
to all the people with a blackboard saying version you know flight this is the amount per ticket
some people bought it they managed to take the flight and then when he got home he rented a
boeing and and went from there and i think that proactivity is absolutely critical
you go to school for all those years you get to 16. but what about going out there and
you're about to take a decision about what your future career will be you know in my day when you came out
university some people would be in the same career for life and you take that decision without going in asking people what was it like in
this job could i perhaps work for a day in this job a lot of people i went to university with took jobs without any of that proactive
analysis of what it would be like now you as an entrepreneur have this in spades i want more entrepreneurship in schools
i want proactivity instead of learning business studies concepts this is another experiment by michael
fraser instead of people doing an mba he gave them a short course on
converting ideas into action he calls it the action cycle those entrepreneurs compared to a control
group uh you know had you know 25 i can't remember the exact amount but five times
more successful businesses or twenty percent higher profits it was uh published in science magazine so you
know i think that's a really really big deal that's a mindset i just can't get over this idea that you saw that that car
parking space and you know you didn't you didn't knock on or send a letter and i'm trying to understand linked also to
um what you then talked about with richard branson at that airport with the with the blackboard going around and
trying to sell this airline that he'd just come up with what is the mental like cultural mental
psychological difference between the people that sat there and thought i'm just going to accept
this situation as is like you did with the driveway or like the other passengers who had just been cancelled did
and the person that takes the initiative what is it about them and what is blocking i guess the better question is what is blocking those
that are sat there on the airport floor thinking [ __ ] i'm my life is over um or i can't find a car parking space
what is blocking them and is it this is my hypothesis there's some kind of mental equation we're all doing very very quickly
that's weighing up the effort it would take and also our perceived outcome of success our perceived chance of success
in endeavor um and and coming to the conclusion that it's just not worth it or possible i don't
think that's what i i i would reject that hypothesis i don't think people make a rational calculation i think it's more habit
once you're used to doing things once if you've been at a school where and
some people are lucky enough to go to school where you are encouraged to to make things happen
to you know some schools you know they are actually asked to start a business
to pick up the phone to to um to engage with other people as they seek
to do something you begin to it becomes a habit the idea of writing a letter and dropping it's like no big
deal that isn't a barrier for me it becomes a it becomes second nature i can tell you from this parking space i was
you know i was just in a it was just pure inertia i hadn't learned that entrepreneurial mindset i did i mean
that took me a long time to learn as well and you think i'm just thinking about how i would teach someone
to take be proactive i i so for i i've thought a lot about this too and i i i think you get people to do it so what
fraser does in his courses he keeps linking ideas to action you're not allowed to have an idea without acting upon it
he calls it the uh the active ingredient so you get into a habit of so so one uh
uh uh one of the entrepreneurs so so he's done these experiments in europe and in africa um but in one of i mean he tells great
stories about it but it's such a long time since i read the papers um so i think habit doing it again and
again and again you begin to get into the routine of linking ideas to action i i honestly
i think we shouldn't underestimate how damaging it can be if we if we just continue to go
with the flow and we're not prepared to to break it from time to time then you're kind of just a puppet to the
course of life i guess in some respects right and i think uh yeah i think there are a lot of people with truly brilliant
ideas huge potential who never act on their dreams you had the dream
but think about your dream that would remain dormant in your head had you not acted these are
distinct phenomena the idea and the action you can have ideas and
dreams without acting on them i just my yeah so i get a lot of dms from people you can imagine the dm's are i've
got a great idea and you know that 99 of people you speak to
are never going to do anything about it because right the the hardest part is is doing it's just day one it's like
think of the name of the company but they they just well i call them sofapreneurs they have the idea on the
sofa it never makes it a part of the sofa and that's like 99 of people and i i wonder
what the barrier is between like starting i i sometimes hypothesize that it's because of this culture of
perfectionism and this culture of needing to start at a perfect point with all the resources all the knowledge all the contacts the
right team which is not the case i mean if you look at how ben francis started his business where i started
mine it's googling on a computer how do you build a website and doing that for three months
um but i but i always i always wonder i think we could we would we would unlock so much potential
if we were able to get people just to the starting blocks and we can't they're all on their sofas
yeah and and yeah i i yeah i you describe it brilliantly
um a couple of things that might be worth throwing in there's a guy called mike barton he was chief constable of of
durham police and he kept getting rated the highest by the independent inspector
of the constabulary and i remember i was really intrigued by this so i i talked to him and met him
and he said that if he could he would ask every wannabe police
officer to take one year off to start a business and for it to fail or to succeed just so
they started learning using their own initiative because that is what great policing is about
um stanley mcchrystal stanley mcchrystal was the head of the task force in iraq
after the invasion that were trying to quell the insurgency of al-qaeda and at the time
it was a real you know it's a top-down model people at the bottom were passive if they wanted to get anything done they
had to go up the chain of command get sign off and it would go back down so lacking agility and not really using
their brains and he pushed authority down the chain of command people could do
they could as it were initiate action against al-qaeda targets if they thought it was sensible to do so
and it had a big big effect on the success of the army the number of operations but also the percentage of
successful operations so i think that you know i think there's a lot of different people who are
who are working along the lines that we're talking about right now but for me education is a key and i'd like to see
more work done in schools to really equip young people with this active ingredient
Whats the biggest things you're a contradiction on
you've written i think we said six books right six books now um they they center around topics like
high performance and mindset and and the like um what's the biggest
thing that you're a contradiction on in terms of what you can write about and know and and profess to the world
but then you struggle with in your personal life to implement that's a great question
that's a great question i've never been asked that before so one of the things i'm thinking so so i i
you know write newspaper columns all right sports column for the times and the political column for the sunday
times right and and i think one thing that i try to do is read
other people who disagree with me because that's a really useful thing because either you really understand why
you think they're wrong or you realize there's a weakness in your own argument but now i think about i think
the last fortnight i haven't i haven't been doing that enough so i must remember that as a discipline to
to constantly read those sources that i know are going to be different i've got a question for you by
the way so this is another one that i'm thinking about a lot um what do you what did what's your view
Wokery & cancel culture
of the word woke so if you're if you're my age that you know people what your cancer culture yeah
um is that a good thing or about which which which
part so i mean i was actually funnily enough i was listening to pierce morgan um talk about the word
woke last night oh yeah it was like a 16 minutes australia
interview and i don't know why it just came up in my i watched 60 minutes australia because i'm in the algorithm so i'm in the echo chamber so it's
serving it to me every day and he's done an interview in the last 24 hours regarding meghan markle and explaining
you know he's being a bit of a crusader now saying i was cancelled for standing up for my opinions he's like really going for it now
um and so i don't really want to get in the definitions because then people are just
gonna but so cancer culture i think is a bad thing because i think
i mean we saw one yesterday where the qriket player who said some very you know racist
things 10 years ago when he was a teenager has now been suspended from the england cricket team 10 years later
he said a couple of things you know about you know he said something yeah i don't want to repeat that because
someone's going to click on the daily that's my column is that what you're writing about yeah i
mean i it's racist i'm a person of color and i think it's ridiculous that he was cancelled yeah he said some stupid jokes some
stupid slightly racist jokes 10 years ago are we really going to create a culture where we're going to rid him of his
livelihood for some stupid tweets when he was a teenager because i tell you what i don't know a single human being that's not
cracked a slightly inappropriate either slash partly racist joke in their lifetime
and this idea that publicly we're all angels perfect angels who are here to judge
others to the same standard of false perfection that we portray is just like deeply toxic and then also
we're now on the on the idea of like free speech we're now stopping the best ideas
because we're judging them based on whether they fit or not and this is again we talked about divergent thinking and thinking having
more diverse thoughts and accepting them and welcoming them and interrogating them for their merit not whether they fit
i think is is awful and my last point again is um there's been a couple of moments black lives matter some other issues
where i've my opinion has been in neither camp and i you it's just you know
totally unacceptable because i would so black lives matter issue i did a post you know the narrative was if you don't
speak out then you're a racist silence is violence and after um george floyd was was
tragically murdered i did a post saying listen people process traumatic events in various different ways
some just going to social media and posting about it isn't actually a very human way to process trauma
so if someone isn't speaking it doesn't make them a racist and also you know and and and the problem with the
thinking there is people will look at your opinion and say he's not wearing our football kit he must be one of them and because he's
not wearing our football kit the socks the shoes the shorts the shirt he must therefore believe all of the
things that the right believe and they put you and it's so binary you there's no appreciation or space for
nuance it's not the way to get to the best ideas right look i i i'm really glad to hear you say all that i agree with
everything you said and i'll add one other thing so i concur with all of those three points i think they're very powerful
um the other thing i'm from a half pakistani half wealth background you know so i've
had the p word a lot in the 70s and 80s and i'm sensitive to to racial
discrimination i saw my father not get from a brilliantly talented person not get
promoted because of its color um and that you know it leaves a real scar
on someone growing up the other thing is i think it's a complete absence of an analysis of how to improve
the lives of people from ethnic minorities um cancelling somebody who sent a tweet
nine years ago in their formative years it is almost like a fig leaf for true
action civil rights movement was a great thing in america in my opinion martin luther king
the civil rights act the voting rights act but i think we have to acknowledge that
it hasn't achieved many of its most basic objectives if you look at the number of black people in prison the education gap
the income and wealth gaps i think there's a real empirical question about what we do and it's not going to
help those massively important demographic statistics yeah to cancel somebody and it's it's almost
like it's a it's a it's a surrender when we should be doing things that can have a tangible
effect this is what my my post said it was nine slides long or nine tweet threads and the conclusive point
was i'm going to be black forever so if you want to help me and my my future kids and my kids kids
a black tile on instagram or a hashtag doesn't actually address the problem canceling someone telling organizations
they need to donate doesn't actually help the problem if you really cared if your care was genuine and not
survival oriented or virtue signaling orientated you'd probably be thinking about systemic issues and you
can't capture or you know or you'd be reading or educating yourself which are all things that won't take place in the public forum so
go at the systemic stuff or you know educate yourself that that to me feels like a more genuine way to
change things yeah hashtags black tiles canceling does it just seems like you're ephemera you care more about
yourself right um it's kind of not it's a kind of uh it's a kind of narcissism i think or
at its worst it can be that yeah the people react to that post do you know what on that particular one
everyone agreed and that's crazy because no one was saying it and it's like it because i'm a black guy
it was like i gave them space to disagree so it was actually on instagram it did 600
000 likes wow which is a lot of likes right it did hundreds and hundreds of thousands of records
it's one of my best i think one of my best performing posts ever and it was funny because you had like i don't know three black people in my
in the comments section being like yeah yeah i meant to be like angry at me but then when i'd asked them
i'd say which one of these um the slides do you disagree with and tell me the sentence you disagree with
you can't find something you disagree with in the post it's the sentiment that this is not the party line yeah
by the way one other thing the wisdom um the cricket magazine wisdom.com
have managed to find a post from an england player that was controversial i think racist or
or misogynistic but before they were 16 years of age so they haven't published the name yet
but can you imagine if that person was suspended for for something they said when they
were effectively a child because we we talked about failure if anyone who aspires to the england
cricket team never says anything publicly never writes a school essay that might come back to haunt them you know you never the way we learn is
by saying things and then being challenged you don't lose all of that if you basically
just either toe the party line or say nothing at all that's a that
would be a catastrophe for a dynamic liberal society imagine
that all the progress that would have been lost right had people not stepped outside of a party line and instead you know stood on top of
podiums and made speeches that people disagreed with and got them stoned and shot and i mean that's where most progress seems
to come from it seems to come from an outlier well that's right and and you know i
mean it might sound old-fashioned to say this but you know jon stewart mill um locke the founding fathers in the
united states what used to be called the western miracle you know the fact that economic growth
was was very close to zero percent for the first two million years of uh
the species to which we belong right i mean it was very very tiny throughout our history you know somebody who was born
in if 2000 years ago and somebody was born 1500 years ago would have seen very
little change in society and then economic growth started taking off
in the 18th century and now obviously it's doubled and trebled and quadrupled and
we expect growth to be two to three percent a year and if it's if we have two consecutive quarters of
negative growth we call it a recession one of the reasons that happened is because of exactly what you say
people were freed from the constraints of the party line you could say something
that for example the religious authorities didn't approve of that the sun is the center of the solar system
not the earth you can test hypotheses you can say the world is older than 6 000 years you start to adapt your
understanding of the world that's science that's technology and i think the more construct you know
now free speech doesn't seem fashionable these days but those ideas in addition by the way
to things like due process the thing that has made me trend the only time i think i've ever trended on
twitter is when i defended due pro so the idea that in order to be punished for
something you have to have had some kind of an independent process some independent tribunal to
establish having listened to different sides of the argument whether the
crime had taken place now that again is something that takes societies a long time to create a
an independent rule of law you know judiciary that's in and and people were like that's
outrageous because i was defending somebody who had been accused of a racist remark and i said yeah racism is wrong but
let's wait for the process before this person is sacked the implication was i was defending racism itself but that is not the same
thing but i worry a bit that we're losing that uh that distinction i think there's certain
people fighting back yeah yeah and that'll be maybe it'll swing back the other way yeah i hope so i i i would hope so too um
self-belief i'm very intrigued as to um you know some certain people in our
society are more self-believing than others um you see differences in
um genders and races and and backgrounds and i think a lot of people in my dms i'm
and this is where the question comes from i have so many young kids in my my dms that are struggling with um
How does one find confidence and self-belief?
confidence or lacking self-belief and i wondered if you had any words of wisdom for those in my dms
that can't find confidence and self-belief
i think for what it's worth that self-belief self-esteem
other things of that kind of overrated um and the reason goes back to something
we said earlier i mean there was a movement in the 70s and 80s in western education to build self-esteem
in young people and the way to do it was to let them succeed all the time
right so you won't remember this but it would you give them easy tests get them to pass and give them lots of
and then praise them for how super talented they were they get all this self-esteem and they can change the world people were so worried about undermining
self-esteem that there were no losers in sports days at some schools i don't know if you have you heard of
this everyone's a winner yeah everyone gets a sticker and that was all about building it was called the self-esteem movement
right but it failed and the reason it failed is because people would keep succeeding
and you know they'd get all this self-esteem and then then they'd be given a difficult test
right or they would leave school and they'd actually hit the real world where they would fail
and what happened all the walls of their world would come crumbling down oh my goodness i've never felt before right self-esteem
that is frag and people would protect their self-esteem by not trying new things right and and that's a disaster
self-esteem can be very fragile i i like to talk much more about resilience we want people we i want my children to
be resilient to try new things to mess up but not to be devastated by it
and that i think is a much better quality now it may be that when people are talking about confidence what they really mean is resilience
i want to be able to walk into a room give it my best shot things don't go slightly wrong i'm going to carry on
regardless every person who's a success has had some really tough difficult
moments and i just think that's an inevitable part of learning how do we build resilience in ourselves
growth mindset is very strongly related to it so instead of um you know for parents out there i
don't you probably have a very young audience i'm showing myself but but uh the parents out there it's very easy to
praise young people for their talent you're super they've just drawn a picture you're
super talented you're the next picasso you think they're going to develop all this self-esteem
the problem as i've said is that you know the moment they draw something that isn't picasso as soon as they get negative criticism
oh my goodness i'm no picasso after all um much better thing to do is to praise
them for the effort or the process well i love the way that picture
that the colors fit together they think oh right if i want to develop as a painter i have to make the colors fit together in a more sophisticated way
you're aligning their mind and motivation with the journey they need to take to
fulfill their potential so it's good experiments praising for effort praising for process
is a much more um positive thing than praising for talent and fixed attributes it's interesting
because in my company i came to learn that um the most effective way to get my teams to innovate was to
praise them for the effort and the process as opposed to the outcome because if it became about the outcome the successful failure of the experiment
then um which is largely actually outside of their control right when you're doing so if i say to
my team right we're going to build this website and we think it's going to do this whether it does that or not whether this
product market fit whether it's a success or a failure isn't actually in their control the bit they can control is starting doing it and the process of
getting to the point where we press go live and so we what i learned in the last year of my business was we would
celebrate the um conducting the experiment not the outcome of the experiment exactly right actually that is exactly
the same thing and it's interesting that if you look at r d you know um have you had a six sigma yes yeah so so
one of the things i mean one of the big massive i mean six sigma is a great process you know like lean manufacturing or um
uh uh your toilet pro things of that kind it's basically squeezing out variation
isn't it so if you imagine making a car or you know manufacturing car all it
takes is one component in the engine to be of the wrong size or specification and the whole thing won't work
so six sigma is about delivering and executing with no variation
but when you're innovating you need variation you need to try new things if you're trying to create a new
computer program a new website or a new drug and you don't know which combination of ingredients they're going
to create it you need to try lots of combinations if you penalize people for failure oh my god and you're only
judging them on the outcome and it fails and then they're like stigmatized they will never try
you need you know that's where failed fast car yeah you've nailed it that's exactly the insight that i think is
is is important and i guess the last thing i want to talk to you about is leadership um and how to how one can
How to become a better leader
become a better leader in whatever field of life you're you're in whether it's sports or whether
it's business like me um what are the attributes of successful leaders
well i i think um i think it's a very difficult job
leadership yeah of course it's extremely difficult i don't know if you'd agree with this but i do think even in a psychologically safe you know
where people can speak up a leader still needs to make the decision i think it it can often lead to
confusion over who's in charge if it's a completely democratic organization oh god yeah you need leadership so i believe my
own view based on evidence is that you need social hierarchies in order for organizations institutions and societies
to succeed but you want those hierarchies to work so leadership i don't think you can outsource it
you need to make judgments you need to take ownership of those judgments but i think if i had to say one thing
okay i'll give you my and this is based on knowing a lot of like you know many many leaders in lots
of different contexts over a long period of time i think the best leaders
have a hybrid approach to leadership okay and what i mean by that is when you're evaluating
what we should do next you need to be humble you need to encourage different ideas
and you need not to be threatened when people dissent because that encourages
people to speak up but when you've made a decision and you've found the destination and
you're going for it i think you need to then have confidence and you know you need to galvanize
that's where charisma comes to the fore when you articulate the mission because at that point having different
ideas you know you're already on the way that can often be quite disrupt i mean obviously you do need to change the
trajectory if you know something but i think that and funny enough in sport you see so humility and evaluation confidence
and execution it's the same in sport so if you imagine you're a surgeon or or in
surgery if if you're humble at the time you wield the scalpel this might go wrong i don't know everything you know
your hand's gonna be if you're tiger woods on the 18th you want to be absolutely confident when you take the pup
execution but then if the surgeon says i'm a genius i'm brilliant you know i'm confident i don't need to learn they'll
never evaluate what happened and therefore won't improve i'll tell you what made me think i want
some ghosted david it's like a fixed mindset right complacency creeps in and you two say that again we're talking
about the surgeon that's sure there right and it's the fixed mindset analogy you made
right and then complacency creeps in it's a disaster because what you want to do after a
surgical procedure is review it in a completely honest way so you can
find out things that you did wrong and could improve but if you have utter self-confidence i don't need to improve that's exactly as
you say a fixed mindset response you don't improve through time beckham i ghosted his autobiography a few years ago
and he told me about when he took the free kick against greece how old are you by the way 28 so you
won't even you won't remember this i remember i would never forget two it was the world cup qualifiers and
he ran to the left corner i'll never forget that's right that's right so his extra time he needed a score to get through
and teddy's sharing him trying to take the ball and you see on the video beckham snapped and he said when i took that freak i was
a hundred percent i was going to make it that's a useful thing to have right but you meet beckham
away on the training pitch the humility i need to improve the way i take free kicks i need to look at the things that
went wrong in the previous game i need to just see that so leaders need to be both humble
and confident depending on where they are on the performance side when they're out there executing
confidence when they're evaluating reviewing humility i think most of the best
leaders have it you know sachin adela at microsoft is a great example of that
humble you know their market cap has grown over a trillion dollars since he took over
you know very humble person i've met him a number of times great great person but there is confidence when he's
galvanizing his team towards a decision that they've debated and discussed i think
that's so true i was just running through all the great leaders that i know and those um those attributes seem to be
there even you know a good example is sir alex ferguson ria ferdinand sat in the chair and he told me that sir alex ferguson is
obviously known for the hairdryer and being very clear on what he wants but then if so ria went to sir alex ferguson after a
game and said you know you didn't support my brother anton got racially abused and then rio
wore a shirt in protest of it alex sir alex ferguson was really angry rio went to him after
the game and had a chat with him and alex alex admitted he was wrong yeah and held his hands up and i somehow
managed to make it up to rio within a couple of words but you know that's that's right that's
exactly right that's but it goes with with ferguson he always hired
constantly you know assistant managers who challenged his perspective you know uh carlos quiroz
mike phelan mullenstein mclaren he also would often do competitions
for his players to guess who would be in the opposition team he would go to other clubs and watch the way they trained
ferguson came from from govan from a very working-class background he never lost his capacity to learn
never and he was always had a certain level of humility but once they were out there and performing
he was incredibly self-confident and i don't think that's a contradiction
interesting it makes me kind of reflecting then on how important it is to be curious throughout your life
even when new technology like social media pops up and you you're a little bit disoriented by it
and i see that in really great successful leaders that i know in my life business owners ceos
the ones that are the most curious um tend to have the best long-term outcomes
and longevity and i think it's hard to teach curiosity um i do i do wonder myself because
obviously i made my money off social media and even now i'm getting too old for that are you still working in the
business no i'm not working in the business anymore now i've resigned at the end of last year so now i'm a free agent working on a new
business but in a similar industry slightly different um much bigger
ambition um i guess and i'm working across multiple industries so i'm like working in a psychedelics biotech firm that's about
to list for you know several billion dollars i'm working huel i'm on the board there and
work with that team i'm working in a variety of different companies all around the world that are in mental
health consumer goods social media um you know and i think i've done that as
well because i as i talk about my book i want to like resist my labels i want to stay curious i want to stay
emerged in worlds that i don't know i'm working on a blockchain company at the moment which is web 3.0 using ethereum and
smart contracts and it's my i like being diverse in my thinking because i actually think that's where creativity comes from in a weird
way and the one of the things that enables me to have this podcast is i have a very diverse view of the world and a
very diverse view of organizations and people and that will make me good at it sounds like a crazy thing to say like
we're putting on a theatrical show in manchester sold out it's like this it's called the diversio live there's a
big choir all this all these really amazing things and when i look at that show what it is it's a culmination
it's a very very different show but it's a culmination of all these random experiences i had in my life going to the theater for the first time
listening to a choir watching kanye west um a light show i saw and all of these little things and so i think
you know i mean you you write about it you talk about diversity of ideas i'm going to send you a copy so my
latest book well a couple years ago now was called the power of rebel idea is a power of diverse thinking i'm going to
send you a copy i want to have a copy of your book i'm going to read it i'm going to read it this week
oh wow that's fast well how many words is it is it very long no no no no 17
000. 70. no no 55 000
yeah yeah okay it's interesting you'll be particularly intrigued by i think by the first couple of chapters which focus
on social media the world we're living in keeping up with kardashians generation et cetera et cetera well i've got to say
uh you know i know we're coming to another you are you're exceptionally articulate oh that's a huge compliment so i i kind
of you know i uh i'm interested in that because
i think um you know i definitely didn't have that when i was at school i wasn't able really to put sentences
together you should do a podcast you just have the most amazing voice i've got to tell you my brother found an
old tape of me being interviewed as a 15 year old [Music] when i got selected for a national team
i just really start i think we need more of that learning how to you know communication is so important
getting our ideas across so that somebody can understand not just what we say but what we mean
yeah and i think that's a i think that's a radically learnable skill you know a lot of the top
speakers have practiced it youtube aside it's one that's in decline because of screens typing
well yeah that's true yeah yeah yeah you have to talk to each other anymore yeah zoom anyway listen thank you so much for
your time it's been such a pleasure to to meet you you're you're i mean you're an individual that's had such a tremendous impact on
the thinking especially of people in the professional but also self-development world i remember reading your book
a long time ago on a plane bounce and how intrigued i was by um the emphasis you put on this growth
mindset and practice and being teachable and your your your where you are in life not being
set in stone if you're willing to put in the work and practice and um yeah i mean my team here are also
huge fans of yours matt over there's read all your books and he he'll read them in 24 hours this is this guy's a monster
thank you
and good luck with it i'm going to follow you with huge interest from from now on and uh you're about to
hit the main stream aren't you dragonstone hasn't been brought yeah good luck thank you

Transcription:

Intro
[Music]
there are very few people maybe just the five of them on planet earth
that have gone through what my next guest has gone through over the last decade very very few people on planet earth
that can tell you the stories he can tell you and talk to you about the lessons he's learned liam payne is a
miraculous inspiring complex very honest very vulnerable very open
book today he's going to tell you about things that he probably shouldn't say and topics that he probably shouldn't
talk about but just imagine imagine being catapulted into stardom at 14 years old and becoming
what many consider to be the modern day beatles he toured the world with one direction
they had their ups their downs their mental health crises their scandals their relationships and
everything in between you know if i was 16 years old and you asked me what i wanted to be if i could
you know dream up my life i'd probably say professional football player or being in a boy band and traveling the
world seems like a life that we'd all give everything to have but what you're going to hear today is very different
and it might just change your mind it certainly changed mine so without further ado i'm stephen
bartlett and this is the driver ceo i hope nobody's listening but if you are
then please keep this to yourself [Music]
liam crazy crazy year society all of us have had with this whole lockdown situation place wanted to start
Lockdown & the gym
it's just to ask how it's been for you it has been interesting i feel like i
got the lock down the first depressive part of lockdown a lot later than everybody else because
our work went through the roof and basically it was interesting because i had to learn
styling makeup hair all these things that i wouldn't usually do when i'm with my team and i lost
everyone because you couldn't have anyone close contact so i just had me and a camera guy that was staying with me so every job was like i mean we even had
one day where we set up our own green screen and we set the green screen up from 1pm until
10 and then record it till 5 o'clock in the morning so it was like a whole day so we were busier than ever and then we started doing these online shows which
weren't really great um with a company called veeps which was good and then i stopped working which i
thought was going to be really good for me because i was tired and it was actually the worst thing in the world for me when you say you stopped working
describe your day at that point um i mean i was just finding myself on the sofa
for the whole day just watching randomness i've seen everything on netflix on your own uh no my partner's there at
the time okay yeah it was it was it was wild and it was
dark because you can't really go anywhere you don't really know what you're doing and and and and i felt like my career was
kind of in a funny place at that point as well and how i was agreeable with it at that time as well if that makes sense are you the
type of person that needs to be kept busy i think so i think i've had a
crash course this last year in learning to have my own time because i mean you imagine from from about the age of
16 17 we were daishi every day so when you don't have a day sheet it's like what the hell do i
do and then the other part of it's like you don't really learn what you enjoy from that point either so it was that that was quite difficult in lockdown
because you have so much time to yourself and then it was like i saw something the other day about toxic
productivity did you see this i've seen this obviously they got a new ism yeah for everything but it actually made sense to me if i'm not doing something
that's that's productive i feel like i'm going backwards so that i'm trying to make i'm trying to force moves and i suppose that
was one of the things i think i learned most about myself i don't have to be doing something every day to feel good about myself where does that come
from do you think that need to feel like you're moving forward or it feels like backward motion i have
no idea i think i'm just quite driven in that sense have you always been like that since before one direction
you know i think we we just always worked like i started i was first on tv at 14. so that's young
it was tweaking an audience specs which i think that point was like 20 million people which was wild so i was like 14 years old so from then
on my life's just been like doing the same thing over and over and over again until this point so i don't know
at times you fall out of love with it and i think that that trying to find you know and also you're not under any
impression this isn't going to stop at some point like a a life span for a average pop
star i've been i've outlived most lifespans with that sort of thing which has been amazing really really cool and i think part of
that's probably from starting so young but you know it's going to end at some point so you always want to find something else that you're good at
so it's kind of safety cushioning this is what investing has been my
god-sending that because i started that really young as well and trying to think about how i would do this or how i do that asking like
you know like our old managers and and people like that what they invest in and stuff like that which kind of makes me feel safer and does
that that comes from a plate like mild paranoia that this might go someday right 400 it's like doomsday profit like probably
you know do you worry a lot generally uh i think i did
up until the last few months i mean having a lot of time i think a lot of
people had this same sort of thing alcohol it was just really it was getting earlier and earlier
yes easier and easier to go to and for me i don't know i it's i think there's there's a slight
little bit of social anxiety as well in it that you know it was already hard sometimes to go out places for the thought that
you might like packed or whatever you know there's always that extra level of stress so for me i've always been quite
withdrawn so talking about lockdown so you go through that sort of depressive period i think we all went through that and i
think um for me what i kept thinking about is like if you just um go with the lockdown
you're like someone like me would just probably like hang around bed on my lap you know my laptop what i had to do was
like proactively steve get up and do something today go put your shoes on [ __ ] you know what i mean but then the thing what i found about
that was sometimes you ain't superman and you're gonna have a bad day and my thing is if i don't set
out with my aiming to do that day then i become more depressive that makes sense
but it's just like i think the main thing for me i mean i've always called it like a small victories thing and that's why i love the gym
because if i've at least been to the gym that day then i've done something but then i started to like branch that out more that it was called a family
member you know i spend some time with my son make sure i get face timing because it was the first point of it we couldn't see each other it was the longest i haven't seen my son in a long
time um which was difficult but then it was like as long as i've done one of those things in the day then it doesn't matter
if i didn't do anything else and it's like what i found more than
anything at least with alcohol with all the stuff it's like boundaries there were no boundaries so you know if you're on zoom you can
quite easily hide that you might be a little bit tipsy at the point you shouldn't be so it was like creating your own
boundaries creating your own routines and that's where i think everybody struggled the most without routine and i noticed
you had a dog here yeah which at the moment that's one of my things i think i'm definitely going to get a dog because i need
routine i need it so you start you start drinking more and more during the
lockdown you realize you get you're aware i put on so much weight i was eating badly and kind of described describing it as a
bulking period it was a dirty bulk don't worry about intentional i'm doing it for a movie role
yeah that's the best new new excuse if anyone asks you put weight yes for a roll it's coming out you know 20 20 too um
yeah and i put a lot of weight on and what got me i did one performance on tv it was with the baftas actually
and i was disappointed myself but like i was always a fairly sporty kid and kept moving and like i didn't look how i wanted to look you
know what i mean there's anything wrong with that but just in your own self you know how you feel about it and obviously they say the camera adds 10 pounds it
definitely did um and i saw myself for the first time i was like oh my god like i've completely let myself go in this
and it was fine i kind of needed it and actually it's been the best outcome for me because i feel so much more
secure in myself now and i feel like i know where i'm at again which is good have you struggled to maintain
consistency with the gym i know i have if you look like i did i did i mean
training partners is the best one for that you know and and each of you put putting a session together and throwing in different moves
because then you're doing something that's a bit different you know i mean we recently my training partner i got to like a point where we're like a stalemate with
the stuff that we're doing so then we we started like branching out to different gyms and they have different kit and then you know um but i'm fair i'm fairly good
with keeping myself on the go with it um i mean like i said the only problem for me was
just alcohol you can't train and drink and anything you can't do it all at once you're gonna be a rock star are you gonna be a star industry yeah that's
your choice and do you think you've gotten a bit of a sort of addicted personality in that regard where you'll get into something
and just go all the way i mean as an as an addict i want to say no but i know i definitely do um yeah 100 i i think but
there's a lot worse things to be addicted to than then look after yourself so yeah what's been the the upside for
you a lot of people listening to this well especially coming out of lockdown now there's a lot of people that weren't able to go to the gyms because they were closed
and now that you know some people just need that little bit of a push to understand what the value is of the
gym um and what's it what's the value of the gym been in your life i think because you're
going twice tonight the value of the gym yeah yeah i mean i wouldn't call the first one the first one's more of like a wake up
let's call it a vinyasa like a yoga type i the first day i went to the gym in lockdown i went and looked at the gym
because i was like if i go in there and start moving around and throwing stuff and whatever else then i'm i'm not going to want to go the
next day and you have to slowly build it up but don't go in and think you need to do 45 minutes because they're running the
magazine that they said this there's no quick route for me it's three you need three months for any significant change that you have and then it's like
start 20 minutes 15 minutes just go and feel it out and then you'll find after a while the exercises you're like
oh my god i only have five more minutes in here and i need another five minutes and guess what you can have them so then it's slowly like we've got we're
up to you know an hour an hour and 10 minutes now so it's like from starting at 15 20 minutes but for me
it's just like i say it's been able to get into bed at night and have that small victory to know at least i did this and it was for me it
wasn't for anybody else that's i think that's important and you're not doing it to try and
get a sick i mean everyone's doing it low key to try and get six-pack but you're doing it because it's a lifestyle decision for your yeah
i mean i recently started jiu jitsu and it's for me i want to be able to do
what a lot of these guys are doing like the funny thing jiu-jitsu is super humbling because you just get thrown around like
it's like a tiger eating a gazelle or something i mean it's wild so it's like as soon as it happens and i was always quite a small
dude i've never been like a big guy um i mean even when i did my underwear commercial i was still like
80 i think i was 75 kilos which is super light right super life so when i'm in the gym people are like
throwing me over here and i'm like i'm going that way today am i then i'm over here and it's like so i put i didn't want to put some weight and i put too much weight on at
one point i was like right i went alpha leather but it's more for the the fitness side and the jujitsu side that
i'm training as hard as i am if you want to come in and meet guests like liam and myself we've now had two
subscribers come in and watch from behind the scenes we're going to start picking more so all you've got to do if you want that to be
you is hit the subscribe button i wanted to ask you some advice i've been announced as a dragon on
dragon's den and how do you feel about that by the way it's pretty cool it's cool because
you're a dragon like when some kids want to grow up being a dragon yeah yeah i know i i watched it when i was
12. so it came out when i was 12. i used to watch it and i've never missed an episode wow that doesn't matter i said to the team i used to pretend i
was a dragon sit there pause the tv give my verdict at 13 years old
all this stuff um the bit i wanted to ask your advice on is when it was announced you know i had
Dealing with being famous
my little moment 15 seconds where like all of the press talk about you your twitter blows up
lots of attention what advice would you give to me about dealing with this kind of noise
because you i mean there's not many people on planet earth that have dealt with noise like that right
i think don't it's a really fine line between getting too wrapped up in what's going on and
not being wrapped up enough in it if you know what i mean really i think i think you know the things that hurt you the most because you know they're honest
so when someone says something new like if they hurt you then you hurt you a lot then you know there's some truth in it
because it hurt you if it's ridiculous you just go that was funny as if they said that you know what i mean really so i think there's a there's
a fine line to tread with it and i mean i've gone through eras where i was just like a little clap back attitude driven you responding where as
soon as someone would say something i'd be like right well then let's go with you and then i was i mean i was a bit mean and nasty at points
actually it was a bit bad but when you're a teen growing up in it and people are like basically bullying you
and they get paid for it it's like that's a bit outrageous so i'm gonna have my say who's got the biggest mountain you know what i mean but then it's like someone
said to me over time it's like you know if someone says something about me in the press in this country and then i say something about them
it ends up on e news and then they've made america i didn't get anywhere so it's like don't bring people up to
your level if you don't think you unless you absolutely have to and one thing i would say don't lose your phone doing this notes
if someone pisses you off write a note about it as if you were writing them a letter and then let it go
just don't send it and then it gets all your well you would tweet out but you don't
say it that was the best thing i ever did it was the best thing i ever did really yeah so pop open your notes then
i just remembered one imagine [ __ ] out no it's crazy because you read stuff and i was saying to you
before we start filming like i've got a baby apparently and a wife and then you know yourself i know you're doing
really well yeah and i just thought you know it's crazy that um there's not a high regard for truth
you know what i was actually on the way into this i wanted to speak about this because obviously there's a lot in the in the
world at the moment about freedom of speech and the press freedom of speech which i agree with right we should we don't need to dictate laws
my only problem is and my biggest problem around corona was the fact that the media were allowed
to twist our thinking about corona as much as they wanted to and they're still doing it now
but the fear mongering isn't helping anyone you know and these people aren't sat there i know i've just written a great article my boss is going to promote me
oh yeah but you just decrease the value of the pound so your wages that you think are worth more are now worth less
well it's a struggling industry right i just don't get it i'm like if it's a medical thing and it's the world that is in trouble
maybe there should have to be something in place that says this is true or not that they have to put a
disclaimer and say you should take advice from your local government [ __ ] like we all read you for advice
and you are offering us a disservice by telling us non-truths about stuff it should be regulated
yeah i get that there's a hairdresser's account for me for people going oh my god i can't believe what that liam payne's done this week
what's he done now you know i get that but for corona yeah yeah we don't need to be going oh yeah have you read the thing about this
new variant that's come from over the border yeah i can't believe it like someone from america phoned me the other night like oh you're gonna be able
to come here soon i'm like no i ain't no chance but we don't none of us know we're all confused because we're being
spouted fear which i just think is terrible social media doesn't help either because there's screenshots knocking around
whatsapp group saying all sorts of yeah i mean that as much as this technology advancing on us
it's like this slow road i mean it's almost like the coins thing at the moment with the the
bitcoins like there's some coins they're actually seriously there to do a job in the ship and then there's like the [ __ ] elon musk coin yeah there's nothing
but just disrespect to love like five billion like a bunch of like it's
actually nuts um you said earlier you made a comment you said that um your partner at the time in referring to
Your relationship status
lockdown does that mean you are i am indeed you're single yep me and you both
where are we going no i'm saying to myself i feel like i feel like more than
anything at this point i'm more disappointed in myself for the keep on hurting people
that annoys me i've just been not been very good at relationships and i know what my pattern of things is with relationships i feel at this
point i'm just not very good at them so i just need to like work on myself before i put myself onto somebody else
and i feel that's what you know that's why i got to my last relationship i just wasn't given a very good version of me anymore that i
didn't appreciate and i didn't like being and i can honestly say that i feel better out of it i didn't feel good for
doing what what i did but it had to happen i mean that's the corniest way of saying that was the best
for both of us whatever cool story bro but it just feels like that very self-aware for you to know that
you were oh yeah no i know it was a problem so i need to sort myself out and i already
feel good so it's got me more concentrated you know and i hope she's happy what is it you've discovered about
yourself in relationships that you're trying to work on you know what i mean
one of our old managers went to therapy from being a manager of one direction so we can imagine how that feels like the
rest of us definitely need some and for me most part i was really regressing from therapy because everyone was pushing me
into it which is the worst thing you can do like it's almost like becoming sober for instance you have to want to be sober
to start with not people taking your toys away and you're going oh my god so it kind of felt like that whereas this
time i kind of threw myself into it even though i didn't want didn't really want to inside i threw myself into it
made my own choices and i think for me my life's been so controlled to a point day sheets security guards you know
anything and it's all everybody else is dictating puppet master crap over the top of your life then you just get to point where it's
like you have to take some control by yourself and until i started to do that with my life then i was living for everybody else
and i'm a complete people pleaser anyway so it was like nothing in my life was about serving myself which then that just put
me in a bad place and finding enjoyment from other stuff that i don't need what did because i've always considered
therapy for a bunch of reasons and the thing is it's still such like a
taboo kind of crazy thing and i get it i do get it i was i mean i was on the phone to louis from my band talking about it today and it's like
there was one moment last week and i mean my manager's my best friend he's been saying to me for a long time you'll have that one awakening in the middle of
it where you'll think about stuff tonight i mean i hate words like awakening and i hate this like hollywood perception of
like reflective work what the [ __ ] is that you know what i mean but i get it but at
the same point i'm like i don't know you keep it for you but it's like i had this one moment that
that i found and i was like oh my god that's just unlocked so many truths about me and it was so insignificant for something that happened when i was
younger and it was so to me it was like a family joke but now i'm like oh my god i've been living my whole life as that character
and yeah wild wild you'll love it scary really scary you don't know what you're gonna find it's like no that's it it's
wild but i'm i'm so glad that i one went through what i went through this year and two that you know i think this
year's forced something out of all of us and for me it forced me to really look at my life and go
what the f are you doing like grow up and that was the point and you say don't try to work on that but did you regressed from therapy
yeah i always turned away from it and i was always like oh i don't i don't need therapy i'll sort myself out you know your own worst enemy at that
point i'm really keen to understand what makes you a difficult you know
specifically what makes you a difficult person today i ask this question because i'm difficult to put a few
people in it coming on down his best friend oh my god every ex-girlfriend we've got a behind
the curtain now that would be a weird room imagine that drops down in there oh my god
what would be the the consistent theme as to why you're difficult today if i think i i think my problem i struggle
to be on my own sometimes really yeah struggle be on my own and i think i'd dive in and out of
relationships too quickly and i've not had to spend enough time on my own to really learn
about myself if that makes sense i honestly just need a minute i need to check myself but i'm really
i'm really keen so you needed to spend some time on your own to kind of understand yourself because in a relationship context you find
that you kind of you're in and you're out a little bit too much is that what you're saying yeah and i i i don't know i think the
biggest problem we have i'm proper perfectionist terrible terrible terrible
so when it comes down to relationships i'm always trying to star the relationship as we all do you put out this complete false character yes like i
might as well go in costume that's why i'm like putting out something that he's not there
is the person is absent from the room it's like they tag teamed on the way in on oh it's you for this bit yeah i'll join in later on and uh i just yeah
i just need to stop doing that and then kind of like one encompassing someone else's life with
your crap rather than like just doing your thing and laying out your store from day one that's my
biggest problem and i feel for my for myself i don't lay out my store i'm like willing to bend to someone else's store and then i'm annoyed at why
they don't like what i like amen so then i'm like oh okay but if i just laid out the stall early on and like yeah i go up at 5am and go for a run
well how are we going to deal with that so he's either in or it's not you know what i mean it's not not to not compromise because some things you'll be like okay
that annoys you fine but yeah for me i don't i don't do that i lay out a completely different
it's like a war worth when you wanted an artist or you know that's i've really debated that i'm
gonna personally especially recently because the girl i was into is very into everything that i'm not
into like like she's into like horoscopes and like i don't know what's wrong with us whatever i don't know so i'm there like
[ __ ] looking at horoscopes being like no yeah because you're trying to make spiritual people scare me
but at the start of a relationship you become more like them they become more like you and then there's a couple of weeks months pass you just regress to actually who you
actually are well you almost like i feel like i hide resentments from people sometimes and i'm like
something annoys me and i'm like oh no it's fine but instead i'm thinking jesus christ i wish she didn't do that and then so then it's like then over
time i'm like every little thing starts creeping in and i did this in my job really badly because i would bend to my
job and let my job overtake things that i didn't like doing steve will vaccinate like videos for stuff
and rather than going no until one day i just was like i hate everything and now it's almost gone back the other
way now i've had to still reset that like i'm starting to call people in to do what i want to do rather than bending to everybody else's stuff
you know and this cr you'll probably experience the same in this you're pulled every which way you know and it's always about
impressing whoever's behind the lens whoever's in the audience so i find i feel conversations with crap that i'm
saying that doesn't really help me because i'll go home thinking why the hell did i say that what now i'm that guy oh my god you know
and then and then it's like but i was saying it because i thought it would entertain the other person it wasn't about me stupid
it's really fascinating that you're so self-aware of all these forces at play because it feels like you've spent a
long time really analyzing and looking at your behavior i think that that can that can have its benefits and it can have its problems as well i think
i'm like over critical at points but you know you can't win everything being a
Being a perfectionist
perfectionist yep it's an issue yeah what how to talk to me about what that means
specifically in your life in work in relationships steve in everything steve's manager who sat behind the
camera um i feel like we should publish i know what i love about this is that
but steve my fans think that like steve's like doing something to me so they're always like oh liberty fellaini he always looks for steve but it's only
because i like him because not because he's like harming me as a person but then there's like a hashtag liberty for liam like they think
i'm like sort of like prison child there's going to be all these other people who are just listening on the audio and think
you're calling my name steve
so my one thing i really got into over over lockdown was art and drawing oh interesting something i've done since i was younger and
the point was find something to do that doesn't make you money was the whole point of the exercise i
was like okay cool draw it i said to the person who gave me the advice at the time i was like i
guarantee this turns into something hold for later on in the conversation um so i started drawing but then what i
found was i was so bad at starting the task blank sheet of paper and all that because i was so worried about what
might come out that i was like i'd sit there like if something's not quite right i like it can ruin my day in a drawing if
something goes wrong and it's not quite right i'm like oh my god like i hate it that's the kind of thing
and how did that go okay i mean the thing is once i got started and got onto some stuff but then it was like
sometimes in that respect then i was drinking to draw pictures because i was so in my own freaking way and it's the same
writing songs as well you can do the same thing with everything you can trade out all that crap and it's like that's why you know people
might smoke a bit or do whatever when they when they make a track but it's all about getting out your own way and i
feel like now i feel much more like i know who i am and i know what i want to do so i don't need to be in my own way i'm going
to go you know i don't need these additives they only make me worse anyway in the long run right oh my god yeah
tonight today it might help but tomorrow it's going to it's probably true and are you still drinking reviews
Alcoholism
no not some no no i've been sober just over a month now i think it is hey my business partner he um when we
started the business became an alcoholic about three four years in because it was just too tough and then he had like
severe suicidal ideation he actually didn't tell me at the time and this is why i was reading about your story i could relate to so much of it because
he i didn't say what i was going through to him he didn't say it to me and then it was like after we'd solved the business that he
was like i used to stand on the train platforms and think about jumping in front of the train and i was like and he never told me and
but there was and you i didn't know what alcoholism or really mental health was at the time but i'd go downstairs 3am in the morning
and i'd open up the laundry room and he's in there with a bottle of wine at 3am the lights are off and he's just drinking it sat on the clothes i'm like get off my
[ __ ] clothes i was like what the hell is going on but you know and i read similar things
similar sort of story or narratives in your story where you know you were having moments of that
that kind of like ideation you were having moments of suicidal ideation and yeah i mean
there's there's some stuff that i've definitely like never never spoken about to do with it it was really really
really severe and it was a problem and and and it was only until i saw myself after that i was
alright i need to fix myself there's a few pictures of me on a boat and i'm all like blowing out and i call it pills and boo's face
and i was like this like my face was just like 10 times more than it is now and i just didn't like myself very much
then i made a change and the same thing happened this year with with that sort of thing as well but the problem we had in the band and i
don't blame anybody for this i don't want to seem like i'm whining or moaning oh my god look at my life whatever but it feels to me like when we were in
the band the best way to secure us because of how big it got was just lock us in our rooms and of course what's in the room minibar
so at a certain point i thought well i'm going to have a party for one and that just seemed to carry on throughout many years of my life and then you look
back how long you've been drinking and stuff you're like jesus christ that's a long time even for someone who's you know as young
as i was um it was wild but it was like the only way you could get frustration out in the day
or being like trapped and you know i spoke about to somebody about this and in child development you know as a teen
the one thing you need is is freedom to make choices and freedom to do stuff and it was the one thing that although we could do anything we wanted
it seemed from the outside that we were always locked in a room at night and then it would be car hotel room stage
sing blocked so it was like they pulled the dust cloth off let us out for a minute and then
and then he's like back underneath here and i'm like so crazy because you're right the public will think the absolute opposite we think uh
One Direction & the costs
one direction those guys have got total freedom all the money and what they can do anything everyone's you know in their
nine-to-five jobs just thinking i'd love to have that level of freedom that liam payne has to do anything but you can't do anything
right it's the opposite no i mean because we were young i mean i actually wanted to speak to you about this then as well
so obviously you've reached stratospheric heights young age it's like what i found was i didn't know i was the
boss until a long until like a few months ago i still don't even feel like i am now like i'm such a child
and everyone i work with is like don't be right older than me and wiser than me and i'm like what the hell am i doing
here with these people so it's like you you you know when we were 17 i thought the security guard was like in charge of me like i was like oh
can we leave the room no okay then not to worry i'll just stay here that's what it was like so i didn't know what the hell i was doing
you know what i mean it's like and no one there's no guidebook they don't give you a little dvd on the way and saying here you're a
pop star this is what you got to do so i'm like in the room like what are we allowed to leave and then eventually
that becomes like an angry person and i was because there was points where it was toxic and
it was difficult don't get me wrong we had the best time ever we did but there was moments where
through you know i mean there's a there's a big movement on it at the moment and people overworking and
like you don't realize you have a choice at that point but in those shows sometimes they don't
give you the choice because you want the dream but you have to realize there is a sacrifice for that you know
rather than it just and like i say i never want to come on on these things and whine about stuff like i made my own choices in life
you know being an alcoholic doing whatever else that weren't my choice so you know it it doesn't have to be
whiny but it's just like there was a sacrifice and i know what i did sacrifice to be here you know everything what i've come to
learn everything in life all the good [ __ ] comes with a cost oh and i've i've learned just from my
own experience like my success my sex is very different from yours we went very different paths
but came with a clear cost because you can't go from being uh 18 year old kid that's like nick in
chicago town pizzas to feed himself to being to building a company by 300 million within six seven years
what a great sentence that was by the way like i was a [ __ ] loser like loner like i was in my room
first summers upon summers on my own for just you know because i couldn't my parents weren't talking to
me they said don't call us and to go back to university years on my so he wasn't speaking to my family no friends because i couldn't even
afford to see him that was the cost for me and what that made is someone who again isn't very social on the weekends
i spend 99 of my time alone and people are like oh my god i'd love to be i'm like well
and then and then i have the same thing you have which is my brain is always has a thousand tabs open and i can't just go
and sit on a sun lounge during tan like tan tiny nights what's my brain
gonna do then sitting in the bathtub as well but that's it you're right and you know what like think about someone as simple as
someone who like plays guitar the amount of time you have to spend alone with that instrument you're gonna be missing a couple of other things that
happen in life exactly and that's what it's like exactly and that's for us for us as teams growing up you know i think people like i said i
started at 14. that's nuts like i was in my school i remember very clearly the moment that
that that x factor like moment happened when i was when i was younger and i was playing football on a field and we had an all-girls school right
next door to us so i'm just playing football like it's a normal day i've had a few like people like shout me out on the street where i was like oh i'm you know
14 years old the whole school from the other school is on the fence i'm like banned from
that field for life at first how does it feel it was wild
but what their people dialed yeah it was it was amazing i was like i went from like zero to like i was the you know it was i
think i always say it's people i wasn't world famous when i was 14 but i was famous within my world so it's like well i didn't leave
wolverhampton and everybody in wolverhampton knew the hell i was so i couldn't go anywhere so you know and at that point i can't
afford a security guard i'm not special enough to have any of these like additives i'm still on the 7948 to
you know my little my little christian school and then what happened over time is and
you know people are people they they do what they do but there was there was one significant moment for me where i knew that i lost it and i wasn't
gonna go back on x factor to be in the band which would have been wild by the way i would not have been here right now um
but there was a moment i was in a mcdonald's with like a new girlfriend i had at the time and it had been two years since the show and i noticed my
shows decreased in number decreased in capacity and decreased in wages so i was like
down and out at this point so i've had fame and lost it and i'm like nearly 16 years old so that's difficult
to deal with anyway at that age and then i'm in mcdonald's because everyone still knows who i am i'm sat there and i literally remember
about take a bite this nice juicy burger someone on the stairs goes x factor reject and the whole restaurant
looks at me right i'm 15 years old and it was just horrible what a scumbag thing to say
i know but it was like that's that's the thing it's like it was almost like a shout out to say oh you think
you're special but you're still here in the most wolverhampton i guess you've
got to understand where that comes from though from that person what's going on well someone said something to me today it's not what you do it's what's happened to you
which i thought was quite i like that quick interjection as you know you'll sponsor this podcast
and i've been the biggest evangelist and customer of the brand for for many many years i drink cure for a set of very clear reasons if i
don't drink heal i skip meals because i'm very very busy and the meals that i end up skipping it for um don't tend to be the most sort of
nutritionally complete fuel is nutritionally complete it means that in sometimes in 20 seconds
i can get a meal in a bottle that tastes great that's going to take care of my health and for me
as you would have known if you've listened to this podcast for some time my health is my first foundation today you'll have released a new product
it's the huel protein powder 20 grams of protein in a hundred
calories roughly tasty as [ __ ] and it's vegan highly highly recommend trying it i've
tried it i love it and i'm going to evangelize it for about it from now on so tell me what happens from there so
you i don't want to go too much into it because i know you get asked this stuff all the time so we don't want to go over old tracks but that was your first sort of
experience with fame you then kind of you feel it declining ice cube says some stuff to you in the mcdonald's
Your NFT project
live life carries on and then uh yeah on the point because i really want to get to this i know you're working on this nft project
yeah and it's based around this feeling of being it's based around the idea of this it was it was like a i want to call it a
syndrome i don't know what it was someone told me something about fame you enter fame the age
you you leave fame the age you entered it so for me that was 14 right so i'm screwed like i'm the 14 year old forever child
so that was always a big fear of mine that i have to grow properly now from what one direction gave me i grew
massively in some respects to the point that yeah i mean you all have experiences when you have conversations about business deals and i'm the director of
like i was a director of a half a billion dollar industry at 22. and i'm like what the hell does that mean all it meant was i got to sign 10 times more forms than
anybody else wild right so but then in other things like if i'm trying to pay car insurance
i'm useless so that you don't grow in other aspects of your life because you have other people do crap for you like picking up my post
i'm the worst person in the world i just forget about it you know that must lead you open to be to be taken advantage of
right because they know that there's some things you don't know like you're saying oh yeah yeah that's it and you're you're
deluded in your growth of whatever but this is where the nft idea kind of came from and it but it first started as this
this little drawing that i did and now i wanted to make my own character because i was like i'm really good at drawing
but we have printers for that i don't need to be a printer so then i was like i need to make something so i made this like ethereal creature that was i wanted to
3d print and stick in a uh like crystal glass box and the idea is that he's depressed
that he's it's like a wasp in a beer glass type thing ah okay magical creature can't get out sort of thing so then we kind of came up
with this peritoneus idea around fame and what does that lead to and for me the way it speaks to me and
the way the art speaks to me is that i was afraid of the idea of losing
you know having keeping the child with me i was trying to it was like a monkey on my back trying to get rid of him whereas for now the idea for me is more
based around you know how do i enjoy that because what i love when i see my son
is that he can be whatever he wants in that moment you know i'll be over the house and he's like you're a bad guy i'm a good guy
and i'm like that's great and then the next day he's one of them girls from frozen no no i'm
doing this it's magic powers today and i'm like wow like we lose that and that's a lot of my problem when i'm sitting doing a task or
whatever the belief system in me has been trodden on through life that much that now i've forgotten about that
they have the ability to do whatever the hell they want so why would you ever want to lose the child within you in that sense
wow and that's coming out as an nft soon coming out as an nfc uh in like two weeks i think it's quite
scary it's wild because i just made it i made it one day in lockdown and then sent it to my manager and we enjoyed the
pieces it was but then it just kind of grew into this thing at the same time that nfts were growing right that's the thing i mean have you
how many people ask you what nfts are by the way um so many of them a lot of people like
i'll get dms all the time and you know i'll try and describe what it is but i think if you say something with enough conviction people just believe it anyway
so i'm like you know broccoli yeah i'm like no i'm just saying anything yeah i know what it is i've studied it i'm working on a few projects at the
moment with nfts but um i'm just you know with all these emerging technologies and whenever something's new
i'm kind of like probably a little bit like you and christian i know you're very very entrepreneurial and investing a lot now um i just want to
be in there like a sponge so i want like a a flag in there just so i can learn so
yeah well i mean i think that's a common misconception about this sort of thing as well is that you always come up with the idea
that's coming to you rather than like you say being that sponge in the middle of the room if you're not part of the million dollar conversation you were never part of the
[ __ ] conversation and that's literally it's like be in the moment like rather than trying to make decisions or
you just have to learn about that stuff and you don't have to know everything you just have to know someone that does know something you know what i mean yeah
the thing is you get older i think the wildest thing is that people those phrases that they used to say to
you as kids like when i had my child my mom's saying to me oh like you're growing up so quickly like blinking
you'll miss it and like you're a kid you're like yeah i'm sick so i chill out but then as you get older you're like watching it and i watch my song i'm like oh my god
yeah he's telling me off now they grew up so fast my niece i mean
i've got a child of mine according to the daily mail but you know just like this where did you get those legs from
um i've been teaching mine to swim i mean we had a really good conversation today and it's like it's a whole new
learning experience once again there's no handbook and you're just like out there on your own i still feel like a child in so many
ways as you've learned from my nfc yeah yeah but i'm watching him and like i played him a trailer a movie trailer it was
this simple i played him trailer for a thing and we watched it and we both like i like that let's stick that on it was just disney's
rayo and the dragon thing it was about you you and your newfound friend and uh
so we sat there and then i turned the film on and the first shot of the film was from the trailer he's going why are you playing this
again i'm going no no it was we watched a trailer no but why is it on
the tv again and it kept like bits get flashing and i'm like oh my god this is not helping me so then i'm like okay let me how do i
explain this i was like you know like if we like have a plate food and like i feed you a little bit and then you go oh and you don't want it then i take it away or if i feed someone
you go oh yeah and i give you the whole thing i was like that's like this and then he's going yeah but why are we watching it again
you must do you get scared as a dad about doing the wrong thing or the right thing because you say there's no handbook so you're like
if you feed him this or if you say this he's going to start saying the c word at school like i do oh when he did swear
once i was happy i wasn't around for it because i couldn't be blamed and there's a way to root out find out whose swear word it is
because it wasn't a combination i would use oh really so i knew it wasn't me mummy who was it who was it we won't go
into that you said i don't normally loop back but there was something you said which which again my mind thought oh that's
Where would you be if you hadn't gone on X-Factor
really intriguing is you said that you weren't going to reapply for the x factor potentially where do you think you would
be and i'm going to ask you various iterations of these questions where do you think you'd be in your life now
if you hadn't have applied for the x factor so you won the business plan that's what yeah yeah that's what you really want to hear do you want to hear this yeah you know hey i'll lay out for you
this is this is my this is actually my like plan b systems range child okay
so i got a job at the same time this is really wild work experience week at school my dad
worked at a factory and i was always obsessed i was like this is adult lego and he built aeroplanes i was like this is amazing i'm gonna do that
so i went and i built airplanes and they had like a little collection for me different i did like 400 quid and everyone i was like what did you get
paid for your work experience so i was like nothing i was like oh i got like 500 quid but in the middle of my work experience i went on x factor so it was
almost like i was trialing my two lives almost like uh what's that sliding doors film or whatever it's
called a butterfly effect or oh yeah yeah so my thing was i got a job and
secured one there for an apprenticeship which was like 22 000 a year or something and then i was like right i know my
sister paid 60 pound board at the house so if i just like board at my parents house it's 60 pound in fees
then i can save up the other money enough to buy my first house and then rent it out all right so i was gonna collect the
rent buy another one and then move into that one and then it was almost like a conveyor belt system nice you had it all
planned out i had it ready to go and then x factor room i mean you say your your favorite tv program was dragons then mine
was i watched help my house is falling down and location location location and stuff like that when i was a kid i was like
obsessed yeah and then for enough my manager does loads of properties are you in the odds
are you into property i love property really i i wasn't very good at it at the start but i'm getting better
you need to teach me some stuff because i have zero properties i'm renting this place um i was going to say to you um with them
when you do a show like x factor what a lot of the sort of people that come out the other end of these shows
often say especially i mean very few have had the success that you've had right but i can imagine and i think i've i
think i might have read this somewhere before maybe from little mix is you you feel somewhere in you that
you still have something to prove because talk to me about that i mean because
your success was is just stratospheric it's like in a league of its own it's wild so to hear that you feel like
you still have something to prove is surprising well i mean i think there's a problem that
us as people we all want something that we feel like we made but the older i get and the more things
i'm like privy to you don't really make anything on your own ever like i think it's just about ed
sheeran the rights on his own even he doesn't write music on his own so it's like for one that feels a little bit like that because you were in the band and i
suppose for each of us as members we wanted to see what we could do and i you know i'm really happy with my success
as well what i don't know is how how much of this idea was was mine
to go with as to be in the music career you know you worry about like the life that you might have missed over i was gonna do this whatever
i always quite like the idea of the army as a kid that's something i definitely wanted to do sas yeah i love the idea of the army and
boxing's another one i mean i've been i've been fortunate to have a bunch of fun stuff um but yeah i think you
always feel like you have something to prove and i think the end of the day you're just you're only really proving it to yourself because no one else really cares everyone else just looks at
you as what it is and it's not that you want to beat your brand because no one will beat our one direction not one of us in our
lifetimes in another lifetime somebody might might crack something i mean bts have had a really good go at it they've done
really really well um but we were like the new wave of the beatles and even still people just didn't say we
beat the beatles you know what i mean you're never gonna yeah it's different different era exactly and that's that's what happened
with our fame as well we were just that of this era same with justin bieber right who the hell has beaten that run come on they
won't they'll someone will be different exactly exactly so it's just like i think in the end it's you're only like
fighting against yourself i sound like rocky barbara now i'm really intrigued by all of that
because you you also have these five so you have five band members they all go off and do their own solo careers
and i always are you do you compete against each other do you try and stay out of each other's lanes are you thinking about oh my god i don't want to
be seen as doing you know what this person's doing i think we did compete with each other at a point
but i think it's all fairly like it's laid out as it is now and we've all had our success in completely different
areas and also musically we didn't really go down the same route i think harry harry's done amazing you
know i mean first album he had the one song off which is really really well and then his second album he found himself and that's that is your
awakening his eyes that's when it really clicks i don't feel like i've had that moment within me yet i've written some songs recently i'm
really proud of and happy with but i don't feel like i've had that moment yet stripped that down came out and it was we did a billion
streams and i could have never asked the town i could have never asked for that in a million years but when i was making strip that down i was
a box of frogs i was nuts it was wild i didn't know what the hell was going on and also i didn't know what the
what the you know the hot potato i just landed on me are we just a billion streams it's like it literally is like hot potato one
minute's here the next minute it's gone so you know i'm excited to see what the next
the next six months of this brings you know um i'm excited to see to see we have
some a really cool song in the pipeline um which is really exciting wow really exciting
then the song one of the first ones i've actually written myself um
with some other people i didn't write by myself um but it's yeah the first one i've really liked and i think i got so used to carting
around other people's songs and not embedding myself creatively in what i do because i was scared to find out who i was
so it's almost like that's the thing when you're selling yourself you have to know what the hell you're selling and i'm you know i'm sure
most people wake up every day going i don't know what the [ __ ] is going on and you have to fail to find that out right yeah
because you're gonna have to try some [ __ ] experiment oh my god and it's like so say like you're like geeky kind of
growing phase between say 16 to 21 if you're lucky it might
last a bit longer if you're [ __ ] you i did that in front of everyone and there's some terrible outfits
there's some terrible haircuts you know and that's some great that stuff is there forever i've gotten away with a few heck yeah
i feel like you've had some great ones the short haircut i think not a lot of people can pull that out i gotta have like a melon head thing at the back so i
can't i can't do that people think i'm an alien but um no you've had some good haircuts i've gotta be honest when i read something about um strip
that down you said that you were almost scared of the success just as much as scared of
the failure oh man i mean no one trains you for the moment it goes right right so you leave one direction you've got
your big sort of debut single coming up and you're scared of the success i was really worried because i know what that can
bring to you what can i bring well i've never i i finished a day one of the one days
that stuck out for me the last few years where i did a whole day's promo in new york and on the night time i was on i think
it's an andy cohen show or something and they had a drinking game and someone asked me a question about one of my
ex-girlfriends and i did not want to divulge what the hell went down and it was a drinking game so i i was like they were
like we can fill it with water but me being me was like no if i'm playing i'm playing for real so i'm like necking tequila oh gosh boom
and i'm wasted i get home at half past one bear in mind i started at like i want to say eight o'clock in the morning i was then asleep and i woke up
at half past three for vocal training to be in central park at seven for grooming at five and in
central park for seven o'clock bear in mind i've been to bed at half past one so i know what it can bring in that
that crap will send you insane i don't remember some days i was here like that will send you round the bend
but it's the you if you want it if you want it it's out there for you you can go ahead and take it but it's like you have to be
a workhorse to want to to do this and i think a lot of artists would say that coming out of it but i don't think it's
you know it's unfortunate the demand in our industry and also the demand of how quickly people receive information now
you know our 30-second time like goldfish time span that we've got now
i mean i definitely have that i'm the worst and it went really really [ __ ] well
it went really well and then it was like you know the problem we had was it was like having a baby the thing
was nine months to get the number one in america so it took nine months to work the record just to get the number one
so if you can imagine singing the same song every day for nine months and having like one or
two songs to back it up with it was like pretty like
i'm sure somewhere that must be like put down as a method of torture yeah i can imagine you must but this is the
job man and it's like it's listen the first few shows of anything are amazing and then after a while it's like you'll find bits that will like great on
you and whatever else but you know i've been so lucky to have the career that i've had and and
you know let's hope for more of that that's that's what i think at this point but it's learning how to deal and
channel that and what's your relationship like with the rest of the boys i'm sure you get asked this all the time
Your relationship with the rest of boys & touring
great with most of them um i think everyone's settling into themselves at this point i
know i am for sure um uh i had a lovely phone call from harry the other day was checking in on me and
and it's almost like some people got sixth sense for you right that you're going through something so they'll check in and he's very much like that he's a lovely lovely
boy i i love him to pieces and then um louis i speak to a lot um and we've always had a really
really close connection and the funny thing for us and i've said this a lot but we we hated each other at the start but
it's almost the people that you grow closest to you know i mean i'll say it because he bought it
quite recently but you know the whole thing gonna talk about the reunion like for me i'd rather be talked about it sooner
rather than later because i don't want to it's tough touring touring that that
sort of record and then and i enjoyed touring for what i enjoyed it for but there's parts of it that really really [ __ ] me up man in a sense i'll be
honest with you um but none of us talk about it it's like his taboo subject like oh we can't get back together what do you mean oh my
god like us in the same room what the [ __ ] is that about what [ __ ] you up about touring uh
my dad said it from day one lonely hotel rooms man getting locked in that room is not fun when you've been exposed i mean i've come off gigs before
i did a gig in in dubai i was really worried no one was gonna show up it was one of my first
solo gigs by myself and i suppose i'm uber self-critical i'm always like i don't know what the hell is going on
so i get to this park and the capacity for the park is like you've never seen i'm looking at like a
park i'm like the hell and i'm thinking we're getting paid a lot of money to be here this is gonna be really embarrassing if nobody shows up
and i don't know anybody in dubai i can't even call 10 friends to be here so i'm like at dinner i'm not eating my
food and whatever else then i get back to the gig and there's people chanting and kind of liam
and i'm like okay there's people here oh my god i can chill i get out there and i'm like awash with these sea of people
and i noticed the sound systems hella quiet behind me this make any sense i'd get through the gig and you autopilot
the hell out of it when i got off stage they're like oh you broke a record you're on a list with michael jackson there's 110 000 people i'm like
and i was like i i sh you know i got back to my hotel room and i was sat in my room on a chair like this
and i was about to go to the maldives with uh with cheryl and bear and i'm like i don't think i can go to the maldives
right now i can't move off this chair how did you feel on that chair shocked why like for to go from like i don't
know who's going to be here to then i looked on the thing and it's like oasis robbie williams
all these amazing you know ac dc all these outdoor gigs amazing outdoor gigs and then just me and michael jackson and
he's in there like three or four times he's you know he is the list but i was on the same list i'm like what the
it can't be easy like go with a white hotel room it's almost like you know like in that
in a movie where they throw a grenade and he goes and then everyone's like and you still feel like you're like oh my god like
yeah because i've done 9 000 50 15 000 in sao paulo i mean i did a talk with obama that's me name-dropping oh wow
but um but it it they're not chanting they're all very quiet i mean they clap
at the end but but how did it make you feel you just feel like a diff i can completely relate because i i was
thinking last year i lived in new york city but i was i was speaking around the world 50 weeks of the year so i was home four weeks
and yeah i go back to the hotel room sometime you know i haven't eaten because of the adrenaline um and yeah it's very lonely and you're
like were youtube and what do i do now yeah but 110 000 people screaming your name
and you're performing i had the prince or the king or the something to buy dancing to strip that down oh wow i need
to get that one country conveniently you can't strip it down which i thought he was up dancing yeah we were talking about the touring
here the touring park really messed up so the hotel rooms yeah a return of one yeah you know i i
saw like a thing of people being like angry at x factor these last few weeks and i wanted to say something about it i don't really know what to say on my
terms because i feel like there's obviously going to be some people in there who are bitter
and you sign up for this show you don't really know what the hell you're getting yourself into but i would agree and i we've actually gone out of our way as a
team to make this possible for me and i think a record label just bought
into the idea of what we've made and i was the guinea pig right so pick the craziest person in the
room to start with that's a good place to start and uh we made this this thing to like
care for people in the industry because we don't have unions we don't have people to look after us
and i was a kid you know i was a child when this happened to me and i'm very fortunate to still be here today to be
able to tell this story but for most people they feel abused or or something in some
sense so i just think that there needs to there needs to be a self-care
a care system within these shows because if they're gonna move people through these shows and use
them to make television they can't just like let them off afterwards and i could never watch x-factor because i was always
heartbroken because i'd been the guy who made it really far and then got let go and it ruined me when i was 14 i
was crap at school depressed like it ruined me at one point but i've also
then been the guy who i think my dad actually came out and said it in in the thing we were filming once he was like
you've been told no more than any winning x factor contestant or like any successful exercise thanks
dad it's great to know what an unusual experience wild
if you were to tour again would you do it differently would you have i don't actually even know how i would tour again i i really want to and and
like i want to put i i always said throughout this solo career i'd let my song book speak to me
and i don't think my songbook has necessarily spoke to me enough to get me off my ass to go somewhere yet i only became a solo artist because i
had to strip that down i wasn't gonna do it i was gonna leave it alone music yeah i was gonna leave it hell alone i was
like survive once thank you very much but now i'm back in why
because the song i knew it was right it felt right with the song whereas i haven't had that and this this year the song that we have i feel really
right about so i would rather let the music do the talking than me come out and try to force him i mean
he's such a fast-moving industry these days it's one of the biggest races in the world right if we had a start line for how many musicians there are
trying to make it right now and who's going to outwork the other one we'd need a very big track um so it's just kind of got to that
place that we don't need any more useless music in the world in my eyes it needs to mean something
said there's something you know in the previous answer that you've said online which is that you're lucky to be here one of the
I am lucky to be here, have I hit my rock bottom
most moving things i've ever seen which honestly disturbed me and stayed with me my entire life was that
avicii documentary and the way that his management were pushing him and he had social anxiety
and oh god it just haunts me you know what with those things
i mean i've spoken to managers who have lost people in different and and you know i've definitely put strain on a lot of people in my life in the back you see
it let's be like a basically different person i don't like talking about it um you know i i think it's hard
it's just as hard for the team around you at points as it is for you because we didn't all know how the hell
we got here everyone's kind of looking around like we don't really know how the hell we got
here so where's the next move and there's always someone who will pull you through i've been very very fortunate now with the people that
i had to pull me through my my bits um and it's you know and that's why i say this care system is so
important right we music is the lifeblood of a lot of our things it's the background to our movie scenes when
we're sat in the back of the car looking long fully out the window but then we don't want to look after the thing that's kind of feeding us that
much you know what i mean so i think for artists in the sense they do need that i feel that it doesn't need to get lost
in translation in other things it genuinely needs to be a care system but then everyone's over therapy these
days in that sense anyway but it's like if you want it it should be available you know is that was that is there a
moment where you look back and say that was the lowest moment for me that was the pivotal moment a few of them i was worried how far my rock bottom was going
to be where's rock bottom for me and you would never have seen it i'm very good at hiding it no one would have ever seen it
but rock bottom i mean i don't even know if i hit it yet you know what i mean i feel like it's
like one of those little graphs you see when it's like oh we hit the the uh you know my biggest support the
market support yeah it'll be there at least a support level oh my god you know it's the same thing
so it feels like i can even make that choice now and and pick my last moment as my rock
at the bottom or i can make a new one and make a whole new low that's my choice you you said online that you were
you had previously been masking your emotions and feelings and this was something that you were trying to trying to get over
um said you you tried to learn to deal with your emotions instead of masking them
how important has that been this is something i really struggle with because anyway because i was ceo of a company you know 27 years
26 27 years old 700 employees and that's wild wild is it all around
the world these adults are double my age and i have to be right my business partner
he'll tell you yeah he fell away right alcoholic upon all this weight depressive anxiety
fell away so i'm carrying him because i need because we're we co-founders we're seen as a unit so
when he's out in the street and i don't he won't mind me saying this because he's been drinking all day with the team and he's stealing bottles of wine off
other people's tables just total strangers and he's doing things in public which you get arrested for
with parts of his body that i'm not going to talk about when he's doing those things i'm getting a phone call i'm 26 and i
have to not only manage him in my business partner but then i'm having to manage all the impact that's had on all of our employees
and i felt that i could never talk or be vulnerable you are the thing
i find so that's why i said it's not people don't realize it's not just you know and what happened to
avicii is terrible by the way and i haven't seen the documentary i didn't watch i actually knew someone who knew who worked with him he wrote with me as
well and he said that what he saw was going on was not good but for the most part for a lot of these people
there's usually somebody in there that's not very good but everyone else is trying to help and you
don't see the effect it's having on them as well you live and die by the sword i live and die by myself that's it but the person
who's behind trying to pick up the shield to help me they haven't even got the [ __ ] sword they're just diving into battle for you and that's
the difference you know what i mean it's like people miss out on that bit so it's never just on that person you know what i mean
a lot of my stuff first you know if i hadn't had the help i had i don't know where the hell i'd be right now so that's a credit to you in a sense
it's um it's super super tough i think with the um the bit that i i really respect you for
though is you're very open about it you talk about it you talk about going to therapy you talk
about your lows you talk about being unsure if you would even be here and that's going to do a lot good for a
lot of people i hope so i mean like the worst bit for me is i think it
seems so much as a tool these days to hide behind the points and for me it's never about that situation i'm just telling you as
what it is and it's that's the bit where i think like i say i don't want any of this to get lost in translation i am not
one percent moaning about my life i i love my life at the minute my life's great it's had it's upside it downs but it's
you know yeah i think i'd rather talk about it and it's therapeutic for me and it's been a really good chat by
the way this is a cool chat i like this chat a lot there's been some [ __ ] ones i mean yeah because i'm genuinely asking you
questions that i give a [ __ ] about yeah that's it that's the point though and i'm telling you to think this if it matters to me not trying to hide behind
some sort of [ __ ] thing you know and like i say i think there's
many people who have this effect on on on therapy and all those things and sobriety and i ain't saying everyone at home by
the way should go sober i ain't telling them to go vegan i ain't telling him to do whatever i'm saying this is what i did and it worked pretty
okay for me so far so you know you're making you made a movie you wrote
You made a movie?
a movie right i've been working on something for a while and me and christian spoke about a few weeks ago and it's funny that it's based around
aaa but i had a really weird aaa experience the first time that i went into well for anybody that doesn't know uh
alcoholics anonymous right um and i my first experience was with russell brand
which if you've seen game to the greek or any of those other movies i went to his house and i love
russell there's something about that sentence which i can't get over my first experience was with russell brandon okay i mean yeah exactly all right so i'm in
his house i'm in this dude's house and i've only seen him on the movies and
as a comic and i you know my bookie wookie i love that stuff and like so i know a lot of things about him but i'm not i'm a really shy person when i first
i'm like oh my god like so he makes me a coffee and we sit talking about our experiences and i've never seen someone look at me
the way he looked to me like find you a man who looks at you like russell brad looks at you when he's listening to your stories because he like
looks into your soul i was like i was born again and then we went to this meeting it was
an all male meeting and there was everything in the meeting from prison guards to ex-soldiers to ex-cons to post-men to
bin men to everything and then me and russell brand so i'm like this is the weirdest room i've ever been in my life
we're in like some old like community like church room or whatever and then he's he's taking the chair in the room
so my first experience with aaa was like the best experience ever because it was like he was just doing stand up it was unbelievable he was
doing stand-up and then they aimed no it's like they they have one who chairs them the idea is that if they say like oh can
you talk about uh relationships now as affected by alcohol then he'll tell the story of his alcoholism or or you know narcotics
thing and then you're linking from his experience to god oh my god i'm the same as you and that's how it works um i'm gonna give the whole
script away because otherwise i'll tell you the whole film but i i kind of came up with this film and i actually i haven't spoken to russell
which is the first thing i have to do because it was from him that this obviously i'm in a movie right now like
and i'm one of the characters and i'm sat here going i don't know what the hell i'm doing here but apparently i'm alcoholic and i've got a problem oh my
god what's going on um the walls are closing in yeah exactly the wolf wall street was in
the corner over there i don't know it was wild so it's i'm excited about it and i think it's really funny i showed
it one of my friends um and she was she really liked it she left a lot of it so we'll see quick one as a serial
entrepreneur that's currently building multiple projects across multiple industries everything from the marketing industry to blockchain

what else is going on in your life in terms of like business and investing and projects and stuff like that when
What does the next 10 years looks like for you?
you think about the direction of travel that you want to take over the next 10 years which direction do you want to focus on
and go in you're investing tons you've got your own businesses now everyone's going to say the same thing to you every time you have an interview
they're going to say when is the reunion i mean i've had wild my business learning curve from the day i first got
my like first check and i went to the manager i'm like what do you invest your money in because he had the biggest garden in london i
was like he's a good place to start he had the biggest home garden which you don't think he does anymore steve do you
okay apparently he doesn't do more but apparently he did when i was younger he did so i'm like trying to ask him like what
are you investing he's like on about gold and whatever else then you learn about safe haven currencies and all these other things then i started to branch out a little bit more a little
bit more um then i went on to properties which was always the one i wanted to do and then when i was 19 i nearly bought
a fighting agency which was fun a fighting agency bammer i got bought into by bama when i
was 19. so i roll up to this in like my like burberry coat thinking i'm an absolute bad man because i'm about to buy like
england's ufc oh okay okay fine right so i go to this arena in manchester i'm
looking capacity he's not great everything else but i'm looking at all the stuff and you're a kid so i'm a kid
and i mean i remember being in front row of the fight and some guy behind me obviously doesn't like the band very much like sit down shut up whatever else
every fighter then after got out the ring and shook my hand and i just kept looking behind thinking are you still got to say
do you know the guy with a scary clown mask you just need that other guy's nose off like he's my friend he's myself i was like yeah exactly and
then and then i went met everybody afterwards and i got into his company but unfortunately the deal wasn't great i
put it through one of my investors that i have and then it's like people try to catch you out and this was always my biggest problem i
very fortunate to live in some lovely places and every time someone would show up at my door to do something and the job would cost 500
pounds they would try and charge me 50 grand because the house was big and i'm like learning early on like and
but don't get me wrong i've spent some money on some stuff i shouldn't have spent money on you and me both um
uh yeah i mean i'm going to go into detail today lots of money like my thing i always say to people is like i will tell you
where i lost as much as i tell you where i win you can't make mistakes though right yeah hundred percent and like my point is i'm not i'm gonna do
better than whatever my last mistake wasn't sure that's the point if i trust myself enough it won't matter in the long run
when you think about money though you know you didn't come from money you didn't come back
when you started i read that your dad had tons of debts and stuff like that and so you your relationship with money will
Your relationship with money
be very very different as you've gone over the last decade um than a lot of other people because to
you it's probably something that you thought was you built up more when you're younger right yeah and i think as a kid growing and especially if you like rap
music as well it becomes a computer rap music made me spend a hell of a lot of money um i would say yeah i mean i have one of my
friends over recently and my family my dad made decisions in our house of what was going on and stuff and
he did them for the right reasons so i stand by that and he doesn't need to feel any pain in that whatsoever because
he wanted us to go on holiday and go to america and he would bury himself and he was so stressed he said at one point in his life
he woke up and he couldn't remember his own name because he was so far in debt that he was only covering the interest which i can't imagine how that feels
i mean it probably feels exactly same how i feel some days with the other side of it which is wild and we won't get into that but at one point in my life i mean my
friend um professional poker player now but he was quite a rich kid at school because he was like playing poker
since he was like 13. so when we would go down to to get breakfast i couldn't afford it
and he'd buy me like 20 p's worth of toast and i couldn't afford it
nice which is wild so then when you get money i didn't know my family were poor but they were [ __ ] you know we were not in the good place
so how did that impact your relationship with money when you finally got it um were you a splurger would you
points yes on certain stuff i would but not i'm more of a warrior than i was a splurger i was like because of where i lived and
where i was from i knew it could disappear so i was always really cautious about protecting what i have and only spending
what i earn that's money and happiness talk to me about the link a lot of people there isn't one yeah so
it's a myth so i think money i think the way to think about money and i mean there's a beautiful thing i had as a kid
and when we used to go to church the woman got a five pound note out and she said uh have you ever read a
five pound note and i was like no i haven't i was like five like now and she's like uh if you read it it says
i promise to pay the bearer of this note five pounds some money as promises which i thought was great but if you develop on that
and conversations i've had with people money is is care and the ability to relax on certain
things life's going to kick you in that nut sometimes and you're going to need something to help those around you
so it's never so much been for me about spending money on me and sometimes i have to remind myself to shop because i'm terrible and i'm
one of those people who like will go on a shop fill a basket and then just not do the rest of it i leave it there and i'm like oh yeah i
feel like i bought something now that's good at least i did something fun with what i'm working my ass off for but i'm not like that so it's like in terms of with
things with my family and different things that happen like my dad's debt for all those sorts of different reasons i'd rather have it on hand and if
something god forbid happens to any of us you know my family are the last people that ever asked me for anything i'm the first one
to go this is why we do what we do you know you have a son beautiful child
Your son applies to X-Factor what do you say?
um he tells you that he's gonna apply for axe factor someday this is a
tricky one this is a trick i think his mom's hoping he's going to become some like yoga person
his mom's very chill these days um he says i'm getting instagram and i'm going to do x factor what'd you say to him i mean
he's got the best advice from the parents around him for the long run i guess but i don't know i i think is that one
obviously we protected his identity to start off with and that's not being pretentious or anything other than the fact that
i want to give him a chance to be bare first before he has to be oh your mum and dad are so-and-so you know
and i made my choice to be where i was at 14 15. so i figure he can make his own choice then too we'll have a good
discussion about it a long discussion because i know what effects that can have as well um
but i would never stop him doing something he wanted to do i'd let him know the risks and i'd tell him what was going to happen
you know and and and better that than you know my parents didn't really ever experience
any of the things i've experienced before i got this they had no idea what i was signing up for would they change it probably not
but they would change some things that happened in between across the way i bet 100
so he says he's going to do the show you give him the disclaimer and the warning um what would you rather he did if you
could as a dad you could be that authoritarian you could choose would it be to walk in
your face something that he enjoys do enjoys doing every day and i mean that's i say that lightly because i think
everything that you do depending on what kind of person you are becomes annoying at a point doesn't matter what
job you do it's not how i really got to do that again you know like my dad i used to think my dad's job was the best job ever like build an airplane
adult lego like i said as my dad's like do not end up in that bloody factory that's the last thing you're going to do
um would you want him to follow in your footsteps though uh i hope we did it better than i did
really yeah i don't know i think um sometimes you can get lost in the connection part of
this game and i think that's always been a difficult thing for me to connect with people because i put so many barriers up before you get to actually what's going
on that you you know it's almost like hurdling them in a way why do you think those barriers are up
protection i think it's protecting people from what's you know if you turn up in the disguise every time then you can always blame it on the disguise the
moment you're not wearing one you've got nothing to blame it on and what what is it that your your
What donât we know about you?
manager over there stephen would know about you that you probably i know in terms of
like in a box in terms of like what you know someone who knows you very well would um say about you that we wouldn't
expect just from what we see online you talk because you talk a lot about this wearing this mask and you know being
wearing a disguise even in your relationships i'm really trying to understand because we've been we've been here maybe now for two hours whatever and as time goes on
and on and on you get to know someone a bit better you know and like my barrier goes down a bit yours goes down a bit we get more
comfortable and i'm like who is that person behind there that people don't know because
i don't know i mean i think in certain part for me having to translate it for music is difficult and i am opinionated to an
extent sometimes they can get me in trouble with some [ __ ] and i hate that that really does annoy me because it's like everyone's into hard to so they want to
say about something right you can disagree on you know yeah but i think for me i hide behind humor a lot
i make everything i can funny and then that will leave it to not be as offensive okay interesting
i really want to i really want to get an idea of when you you look towards the future professionally what are the what what is the
positioning that liam payne is is hoping for you i guess you know from what you've described for bear
you just want to be doing things you enjoy yeah i think so and i think that's you know there's been a slow road up to that point and it's just doing things for the right
reasons i mean we're in a beautiful age right now you are your own press which is actually great for artists if
we learn to do it the right way this whole thing i used to hate was going on and off
talk shows going on and off and doing this doing everything else that seemed to be for everybody else and it was promo in your record but then the record bites and you get
nothing out of it and it's like everybody else got there five minutes but the record just didn't do what it wanted so it's like
you know i want to experiment with the way i promo my records so make sure that the record is taken before i go and
halfway around the world it's going oh look this is this great song and then no one hears it oh great well you know what i mean but it's
like almost you know i think the music industry and listen up people i think the music industry is in a place where people
need to throw out the old the old you know marketing format for these
things and it's almost like when you see companies that try and do tick tocks don't do it like that because we can see
right through what you're doing you've made a tick tock and haha we're supposed to laugh but it's not funny and it's the same for the music industry
it's like there's a new way that people are promoting things now you know billy eilish came from a bedroom and did this and did it
and it worked out really well but it wasn't the same format that you used back in 2010 even i mean
the way the industry's changed while i've been in it it's been wild and i've only been here i've been here a decade just over a decade now but it's insane but i just
think record labels and and sometimes people spend budget on stuff that they don't
need to do you have your format you have your fan base grow it organically properly
not not through you know i don't know the way we're doing things
at the moment because sometimes it's just i don't know why the hell we're doing this social media your relationship with it
Social media
that's been my industry for the last decade um good thing bad thing what's your relationship with at the
moment i think it's good i think it's a difficult thing to manage
i love the idea of what tik tok does but for me i don't get sucked into my
phone with like watching stuff constantly and you do and you need to be on your on your like learning stuff and and you
know it's start funny video whatever else but if you're for you page it's just like funny dogs and
yeah it's [ __ ] then you're in a what the hell's going on you know that's what that's what it does to me i'm like god really so i i don't know it's um
i've seen a lot of different technology coming in and go out of my industry from the time from twitter and you know i honestly
think there's a strong case for saying that we owe a little bit of our success to the way twitter was because worldwide trends weren't a thing
before one direction before one direction one x factor whereas on that night we could trend everywhere
and then people would go oh my god what's this so you know magically oh the biggest band on xbox was the same time twitter came out it doesn't it's perfect
storm stuff you know um so i think it's great i think we have a funny way
like i say with the coins that you know the markets just had the most weird few
months of people making hoe coin hog ho coin plus ho coin extra ho koi in this and there's 90 of them and i'm hearing all of my
friends going oh did you buy doggy doo doos 21 no no no i bought star
star porn over there you know i mean i'm like what the hell have we do we doing we're talking in code
you know and it's like that but rather than the technology that works ripple ethereum you know things that have
real world application rather than coins that are hey everyone i made a coin that's about you know tripods for cameras
this tends to happen at this i think at the start of these like exponential bubbles you get this and then it weeds out the crap weeds aren't the crowd
that's what's happened recently to me like the markets took a big dip because they're trying to weed out some of the
the stupid stuff and because it's an unregulated thing it's like but i find that that's with the same
with social media we need to weed out the bad stuff and focus on the good there's a lot of debate at the moment because of the racism that some
footballers footballers have experienced marcus rashford did a big post the other day that uh you know how do we how do we
stop people putting monkey emojis or any kinds of like abuse on you know because what happened what i
think is happening from a psychological standpoint is they see liam payne they think he is up there on that mountain that is not a
human being if i throw a rock and i hit i might get a little bit of attention from him
so they they pick up a rock that's why i'm saying to you to start about bringing people up to your level in a way but it's not so much for them that they
could they can get away from from from not saying something about that you know and i mean they have to speak up
about it and it's difficult and we are going through a really fast
moving area with everything in the moment i mean you wish there was an algorithm that would just beat that right but they will find some way of
spelling it differently and it will just you know verify i think they verify everybody's idea i think that would kill 99 percent of it yeah
i actually thought of a thing for this for voting because voting for me was always a really difficult thing we all have our
iphones we have our thumbprint that goes on why can't we verify fire thumbprint to get accounts and then that's on your
record there's that great black mirror episode where that woman's going through life trying to get these likes and she's like
desperate oh i got a please i need to be in this neighborhood but i know i was a five star this morning like oh my god
you need a horrible crap on the way darling i'm sorry but that's what life will eventually be policed by i
imagine in a way speaking of black mirror um i guess this is a strange tangent but um i
i when i had johan hari on the podcast last week one of the key themes here is that all this technology and social media has
like taken the meaning out of our lives because like dating now happens on these screens people order their food by like tap tap
tap and it shows up at the door um even now with covid um we're now working from screens we used to have an office
or you know offices we could go to now it's all screens and it feels like the world is getting more and more so what's amazing is we we
were all so worried about technology pushing us away from each other when kobe hit right yeah it was the only thing that saved us
thank god when kobe did hit which i thought said a lot more about technology's good sides
than they did about the bad sides i mean it's up to you how you use your platform in the end and what you let it do to you like i say i enjoy tik tok but i watch a
few videos and i watch things that people send me i don't really have a for you page i don't really go through it constantly
because there's you know i mean it's difficult with kids and screens man i i have one and i watch him
and i'm like i really want to like you know we go i make him go out and do stuff and sometimes we fall out
big we have rows about really yeah yeah it's not sometimes it's not good um but he's learning with it you know
and it's that it's like you say for all of us we are the guinea pig generation for these things we're learning you know we're the first
yeah we're the kind of civilization to be affected by an algorithm and to be connected what about the people who first experienced hay fever they figured out
their way around that you know what i mean it's like for me it seems like we will figure out the right things of it but it's weeding
out the bad sides of it and what it does like i think if your tick tock screen is advice
and videos about learning stuff or like stuff that you're actually really interested in you enjoy not just random funny crap because
that's what you've been framed was right you want to find yourself watching you've been framed all day really because that's what you're doing
or even worse on instagram keeping up with the kardashians oh look she's amazing she's 10 out of 10. oh and
she's rich well her life's perfect and look at my live site here in my box you should see this pot noodle with my cellulite yeah but that's
actually the illusion because i i bet you of course it's an illusion but it's an asian design to destroy your self-esteem
isn't it it's like yeah but i also think there's i think there's a fine line between these these these things and and accepting and
accepting everybody and all this stuff is is a given but i don't think that in the process of
that we want to lose the thing to settle for ourselves you know there was a big debate about me on
on loose swimming at one point uh i was all right with it was okay i understood what they were saying but i
worked really hard for for what i did in my underwear commercial you know and it was my it did overtake my life in
certain respects yeah for sure it did but it was actually an aim of mine it's one of the only things i've ever aimed for was to try and do an underwear commercial so
i remember i went to my meeting with the company i was working with and they were like no no we don't want to do that with you and i was like no trust me just trust me and they gave they
preferred them they put their trust in me i went and trained my ass off and i got myself where i wanted to be but then it was like people worrying about people's
self-esteem looking at the picture and whatever else i get that but i quite enjoyed the idea of looking at someone and being like wow he's
that's cool man like i'm gonna go and get that why did you want an underwear commercial i just thought i could do it i thought i
could and i wanted to challenge myself in the gym to it was you know it's hard to be
strictly about look in the gym sure not function which that was the bit i battled with myself a little bit but it's like
yeah i i think you know you want to go out and get it going and get it it's it but i don't think we should like i say in accepting everybody let's
not lose the idea of striving for something as well though because it's alright to say yeah i'm i'm perfect was that an advert i saw
somewhere the other day and i thought are we really that narcissistic do we have to call ourselves perfect for everyone to be okay with each other like
and like i might get in trouble for saying some of this stuff but it's just like my thought is like i want to teach the next generation to
strive for things as much as i wanted for them to feel confident in themselves but it's like it's almost like being a
parent right you're gonna mess them up somehow like if we start saying we're perfect i guarantee next we'll be like well that's not worked out well so let's
rewrite the plan on that one you know and it's i just think everyone's you know give each other a break and just
go do what you like have you have you figure it's taken me some time um to try and
What makes you happy?
understand what it is that actually makes me happy yeah i used to once upon a time when i was broke this is a big one yeah
i used to i was gonna end on this big question but i used to think it was like oh i'll get a lamborghini and then i'll be happy
and like that's why my book is called happy sexy millionaire because i i thought that i wrote in the first page of my daughter at 18.
i wrote range rovers bear in mind i didn't have a drama listen and i was stealing chicago time pizzas at the time um range rover sport will be my first
car i'll make a million before i'm 25. i'll get a really hot girlfriend and i'll work on my body image what i
meant is i'll get a six-pack i just don't want to write that and i thought that is the goal of life i
get those things range rover was my first car i made a mini profit five and i'm like where is the confetti and
if that's not it then what the [ __ ] is life i mean what happens when you wake up and every day is a dream
i mean i don't mess you up i often have looked for the moment in life where i bang my head and i might be in some sort of commerce
dream that i've invented for myself like that i was that messed up as somebody i was like i'm sure this is the simulation guys
like i must have made this wall because i can't be here because of where i was yesterday yeah so it was you know there's those
wild things that if you let them creep in they will f you up bad someone says something to
be quite interesting the other day our view of what we hunt for as humans
has changed we don't hunt for food anymore we hunt for success it's almost like the target went from
animals and corn and food to friggin lamborghinis and
and that sort of stuff but that's what we strive for now at like even point like you were saying earlier about you're you're so glad you're here
because that supplements your food sometimes you're that driven by your drive that you forget you're gonna
eat sometimes and i was the same at work oh my god i'm terrible like i'm known for skipping lunch breaks and working through the day to get home
quicker because i can go without i'll just muster on through but think about that you've gone past your basic survival
instinct to you're writing against your health for like yeah coins yeah exactly but i might
miss this thing good that i'm exactly the same it's something i think that we struggle with in in this respect and it's like
priorities i don't know anything about what makes me happy at this point i really don't really no i really i've i've found a
couple of things that i think i'm interested in but like the thing is once you start making money on these scales and things
that happen it only becomes the drive that's interesting to you if it's gonna fast-forward you somehow and that's not
that toxic thing that we've funny enough we've come full circle but that's it's the same sort of thing and i think
i think it's a big problem for me because if it's not i'm thinking why am i and that's why drawing for me was the biggest one of the time
because i was like this is what children do why should i do this and then funny that i drew something that was about being a child was that
it's weird how things go full circle in that respect but yeah it's i often struggle to get on
with something if i don't think it's forwarding me in life somehow rather than just enjoying the moment or going out and watching the sunset one of
my one of my biggest things made me happy while i was training was 4am getting up in the dark and this sounds like
i am some sort of psychopath and i was but you're like go into the park run for a
little bit and then stand another thing and watch the sunrise was the best thing and you know why it's [ __ ] free
you can stand and watch your sunrise and go wow thanks for another day sort of thing i know that sounds really woosar and like really far out spiritual but i
didn't for me it wasn't like that i just enjoyed seeing how beautiful this moment was and i was the only person in hyde
park running at 4am every single day and it was some of the best time i've had in life
they've done studies kind of linking to what you're saying there where if they give someone a game and i wrote
about this a little bit if they give someone a game that they enjoy people will do it and they'll have high motivation to do it
if you then pay the same person to do the same game their motivation will decrease i have a
big problem with this so you can love doing something and then the minute you the reward starts to become extrinsic which is
external which is money your motivation decreases and this is why it's it's very very important even
for me with this podcast i started it because i love doing it love meeting people when it starts becoming a commercial
thing it moves into being a job and then the science says my motivation will decrease so it's interesting though because you talked
about your drawing you started drawing because it was a and then it becomes this and it becomes an nfc and then it becomes a business and then you know
what to do and then you're like oh my god i don't want to do this i'm here again yeah exactly yeah exactly you said you've not figured out what
makes you happy definitely not yet now that's me in a few years and i i think
i mean so what have what's my conclusive point been for what makes me happy
professionally it's super clear for me now having a and these are keywords so a worthwhile um challenge
that i'm doing with people that i love and i've i i've come i've come up with that based on a ton of things some of the things you've said
fit perfectly into it when you look at tyson fury when he's not in the gym depressed when you look at goal um olympians
whether they win or lose at the olympics they get depression because they've
reached the mountaintop and there's nothing else to strive for and so when i was going through my notes i was thinking the day that someone offered me 50 odd million to buy my
business was one of the worst days of my life and gary vaynerchuk i know you're doing some stuff with him he says the same thing when i spoke to
him on the podcast he was like the day when i buy the new york jets will be the worst day of my life he's
like i hope it happens on my deathbed because not having something to strive for
and this has been a big struggle of mine for men you lose orientation yeah right when you're training for the
olympics we're going this way this is our purpose in life when the olympics is over you ain't got
no [ __ ] direction you're like well i mean look at this and talking about direction my that whole thing for me and that mountain for
me was 1d and music after that like i said you're never going to keep up with what we did
like we sold so many records and we did some we broke so many records we did so many things you know i mean we were in stadiums
every day 94 000 people every day like i was in like i used to break into wembley stadium
on the night time because it was fun and i was smashed and i thought these people aren't going to recognize me i've broken into every major stadium in
america honestly and people used to chase us on these like police like little squad bikes being like hey sir you're not supposed to be
in here and we'd run because it's like a game attack i swear to god it was this one time we we opened up a door and found a zamboni
you know the thing that squashes the eyes and we accidentally emptied the like two tonne of water on the floor i
don't know i might have to pay for that night um yeah so once you reach that height
i suppose one of the reasons i struggled the most out of it is because you're never really going to reach that height again and then it's almost like a limbo and also not knowing
whether or not we're going to come back are we going to come back everyone's asking i don't know and it feels like pressure to come back it's almost like your your parents going
when's baby two are coming you know what i mean now we gotta have another one so that's that's wild to me and
and and having to deal with that at a young age i was i was always going to mess it up somewhere is what i would say about myself because
that's like he says the worst day ever you know the day the band ended i was like thank lord for that and i know a
lot of people are gonna be mad at me for saying that but i needed to stop or it would kill me um and i was like thank the lord and then after that
trying to like funnel your way back into society be like hey guys i'm still here turning up at tesco's in a lamborghini
like an idiot you know i'm like what the [ __ ] am i doing and and for a lot of that yeah i agree with
a lot of that that statement it's you need to have something to strive for and i feel like
i'm finding that a little bit more now and learning to relax yeah you've talked a lot about this
learning to relax learning to just be you know a lot of people be part of the moment man be in the
moment and like i'm like this is [ __ ] but it's true if you can just sit you know and enjoy something for what it is for
five minutes have you tried meditation my ex uh cheryl is very big on meditation
um she sent me one the other day and i got told off for not doing it again meditation gets me in trouble these days um no i need to i i
did a couple of things in meditation with my old personal trainer that were quite good but i just my mind's so [ __ ] busy
i can't shut it up like the moment i'm trying to not think about so i'm like oh yeah but what about if we just did this next week and
i know you'll be exactly the same that's what i'm saying i'm like trying so [ __ ] hard with this meditation let's do it together every morning and
i'm like steve close the tabs and every morning i'm sat there and i love that on the [ __ ] floor of my shower because it's like it's like it
looks like it's from thailand and the water's pouring and i'm like just don't think about anything and then i'm like i'm planning all my schedule in my head
i'm like liam's coming for the podcast man what should i speak to him about and then you know john will be doing the two senses thing where you like
think of like what you can hear what you can smell i've tried all of them i've tried this one with beads where you like hold the beads and you just
like the simulation not bad he's good in the shower as well
if you like close your eyes then pick two senses which you can choose like feel oh interesting so your mind can only
do two senses at once so once you shut some of them off that's technically meditation because you're in the moment
but i still don't feel like i've had that you know i'm not a monk at this point i wish i was i think it's important though
i do i get it i do understand it but i also think imagine if you could get your mind just to be in the present moment fully
and just be if i could have done that at school i hadn't been i've been top of the class but my mind's
going oh yeah what are we going to do lunch time i'm not going to give up so i'm going to keep trying every morning naked on my bathroom floor that's what i want to
keep doing worthwhile challenge with people you
love so worthwhile you define it yourself right challenge means it can't be easy because then your
motivation won't be high and then surrounded by people you love for me that is where i've figured out my
happiness lives and so upon leaving my company that i'd founded for ten years now i'm like learning to dj doing a big theatrical
play at the albert hall which we've directed and produced i'm just trying i'm throwing my hand at everything biotech no i'm the same you know and that's what
What's your next âmountainâ?
i was thinking with you from what you were saying like you're never gonna top that mountain so where's what is the mountain i mean we've done
so many random you know the trip to namibia without was one of the things and we jumped we did a
world first of the canyon swing in namibia which was really crazy and wild and i thought i
might die on national television but that is okay um what else did we do are doing this nft things really interesting
um doing the online shows because we were one of the first people to really like pioneer with the company
you know my team were massive massive behind that um but it was almost like making a tv show every week with new
songs and songs i hadn't sang since whatever songs i'd never heard before and i just would turn up and do it we
did really really well and i loved that um i don't know i've had i think i've had many many many jobs i've got like a
laundry list to the point where when the sensors came i didn't know what the hell to write i didn't want to write performer because i think it just sounds like such a badge
off job of like it doesn't it doesn't encapsulate anything that i actually do i mean we design clothes for hugo
underwear modeling loads of stuff so um do you think maybe you just need a really big
[ __ ] scary terrifying goal that you really care about well i mean someone had asked me to go and do
everest at one point and i was like i don't know i might die on that one but does that not make you a little bit like
right now we've got something to aim for get in the gym yeah i mean in a way i'm already there's something i'm cooking up in my brain i'm not gonna
i'm not going to talk about here okay doesn't come off but i'm cooking something up at the moment it's very dim orientated i'm definitely going to give
it a big big go some things piss me off um interesting um and i thought i just had to do it um the
one thing i say what the one thing i'll say about success and about these things if i'm honest about happiness i think it's learning to have
respect for yourself i mean there's a lot of things people say about don't base yourself on others and never look at other people in that
way which i actually think you need to throw out the window because there's when i was like it's almost weird i learned it from my
character design when i was designing coats i didn't start from nowhere and how i learned to design characters was like
how do you make a dragon have you never seen one i don't know why dragon anyone so they mix it with a with uh exactly
this is funny so they mix it with a lion mixed with a snake mixed with a crocodile mixed with a dinosaur
because they're the ones that we have so they base them off of stuff so i like look at people who are my heroes and i think what is it that i love about them
that i don't think i possess yet and then that's how you know you can respect yourself and i think
that's the most important thing for me is if i get up in the morning i respect myself i go to bed on night time i respect myself i'm happy
but certain things are about my life and even this moment i want to change but it's like christian bale for example i
love his acting girl like go-to and i mean some things he's done his career have been really unhealthy when he did the machinists and
stuff like that but i like that drive and i like the fact that he like buries himself into a role and stuff and i've never learned that
quite yet so that might be one of the things i want to steal exactly if it's almost yeah it's like taking people's stuff but
you're molding it into your own character we were talking today about avatars which is obviously a huge
market at the moment people spend so much time on their avatars on their games when they've started something but in life you are your
avatar you do whatever you want and it's like if you're making your avatar and you've got to go and do 10 free kicks to earn
the next ronaldo but you're like oh i'll get in there and do them the moment someone asks you to do something in life to earn something you're like oh i don't want to do it
but it's like that's why i was trying to think how we explain that to kids but that's the most basic analogy i can come up with you know
children's book children's book i had an idea for children's book actually but we didn't finish it that's a lot of the real things about
look at why he's smiling at me well we've talked about so much today um
so much so much inspiration and you know a lot of the questions i asked are based on so it's amazing amazing conversation and um
i really really respect and appreciate your willingness to be open and honest about all these things because you're helping so many people you don't even
realize it i i do hope so you know and um i think you're just a tremendously inspirational guy you're
you know an incredible entrepreneur which i don't think people are fully um appreciated yet because you're very you're not you've not sort of disclosed
all of the investments and businesses you're involved in but i think that's certainly coming i think we might have a bit of a
a european action culture on our hands if i say so myself um but yeah thank you mate honestly you
know you've been through what is a unique just tremendously unique
experience over the last decade nobody can understand it other than probably the boys you did it with and uh from that you know there's ups
there's downs but this is life right and um you sharing it has brought tremendous value for me so i know it will
definitely bring huge value for our audience so i just want to say thank you no i think mate thank honest this has been one of the
best chats i've ever done thank you i'm excited to see what you bring to the table on dragon's den i can't wait to watch it
i'm buzzing i'm buzzing maybe you can come in with uh some of your ideas though i know i'll come and pitch something can you imagine you should be a dragon
ball style i was actually maybe not coming in disguise we'll do one week where i'll like deck the [ __ ] out of here i'll just come on
and be like right i've got this idea for swimming pools on roofs would you ever be a dragon um oh i think i'd be a terrible dragon
i don't know i feel bad for people and i wanna like oh no just like i'll buy it
i'll take it thank you brother appreciate you i appreciate thank you
you

Intro
the most effective strategies for dealing with depression and anxiety are the ones that deal with the reasons
why we feel so bad in the first place we need to stop asking what's wrong with you and start asking
what happened to you if you think life is about money and status and showing off you're gonna
feel like [ __ ] it's not like i'm explaining quantum physics right and we've all had that experience where you crave a consumer object
you build up to it you get it you get home and you just feel flat is it's not the trauma that destroys you
it's the shame about the trauma and giving people ways to release that shame is an antidepressant god
change is really possible
today we have a real treat for you this guest today johan hari is one of my
all-time favorite ever podcast guests ever and i'm not saying that to blow smoke up his ass when i had the
conversation with him and when i started reading his books many years ago i can quite honestly say that no book
i've ever read in my life has had more of a positive impact a more transformative impact on the
topics that matter most to my fulfillment and happiness than the work that johann has done he is
a comedian on one hand he's an incredible storyteller he spends
a decade writing his book so you know the information he's going to share with you today is both profound it is evidence-backed
and it is compelling true important and everything that our society at this point in time
needs to hear this could well be the most important podcast i've ever recorded
if you asked me if there was one podcast that i wish the world's got to hear it's definitely this one
above all of the other podcasts i've ever recorded this is the conversation so without further ado i'm stephen
bartlett and this is the dire ceo i hope nobody's listening but if you are
then please keep this to yourself
[Music] johan it's uh it's a real pleasure to have you back on the podcast you are one of my all-time
favorite guests top three i don't know the order but you're definitely up there these other two i don't actually
Why do you like writing books?
and not just because of the conversation we had but because you changed my fundamental beliefs around depression mental health
the importance of human connection and everything in between and that had a really fundamental
positive impact on my life it's also you feature heavily in my book i talk about you on this podcast all the
time so you know the amount of times i've plugged so really what i brought you here today was to get the royalties from all the friends no but no but i do i
talk about this podcast all the time so give you an old bag of crisps please that's all you're getting that's why i
wanted to get in the podcast because you know you changed my life and i'm not saying that's no smoke up your ass i
genuinely mean that with your book lost connections so the first question i have is like completely
off track but i've just finished writing my book published it's all great and everything you're you're onto your third fourth book now
yeah yeah talk to me about why you like writing books what is it about writing
books why are you doing that oh for me i write books because there's a question
i want to answer for myself that i don't know the answer to at the start so we'd lost connections i wanted to
there would for me there's always a core mystery that i want to understand right so we've lost connections to core mystery was two
really simple things when i when the book came out i was 40. uh all throughout my lifetime depression and
anxiety have increased in britain the us crossed the world i wanted to understand why right why is it that with
each year that passes more and more of us are finding it harder to get through the day i wanted to understand it for a personal reason
which is that i had been really depressed myself i had done everything i was told to do by my doctors and i remained depressed
or chasing the screen my but before that um i had a kind of core question which was
you know we had a lot of addiction in my family one of my earliest memories is of trying to wake up one of my relatives and not being able to
um and i wanted to understand what causes addiction and what can we actually do about it i
want to understand a personal level but also at a social level what we could do about it so for me i always start with a core question um
so a book i'm been working on for the last 10 years that i'm sort of writing at the moment about um something i have to be careful what i
say about a series of crimes that have been happening in las vegas for me there's always a core question a
mystery and then i'm like okay i want to take the reader on a journey
as i try to unsolve this mystery i tried to solve this mystery for myself right
so um all of my books are long journeys where i you know for both
books i traveled more than 30 000 miles went to a crazy mixture of people and for me the best journeys
are not where you find yourself everyone goes are you on a journey to find yourself to me the best journey is where you find other people
right so i think about the crazy mixture of people that i've got to know for these books who i love who are still you know important people to me from you know
for the addiction book i think about chino hardin who's a trans crack dealer in brooklyn who's one
of the smartest people i've ever met uh rosalia retta a hitman of the deadliest mexican drug cartel
he's unfortunately not one of the smartest people i've ever met but uh you know or for lost connections uh you know i think about these people will probably
talk about these people in berlin who transform who's starting from position a terrible depression
transformed their city in their country i think about this couple homeless couple i know very well
in vegas so for me it's always about finding people and solving mysteries
and i write to figure out to try to understand the world and to figure out what we can do about the world you know
so for me it's it's i would i can't imagine writing a book where i felt i knew in advance of course i've
got ideas when i start right i don't start as a blank slate but i can't imagine writing a book
where i felt i knew in advance i was standing above the reader and going well reader you know i mean there are books that do that you know if you've
been in it i'm a journalist i'm not an expert right so if you've been an expert for 30 years on
uh just read a fantastic book about octopuses right if you guys spent 30 years studying octopuses he knows a [ __ ] ton about octopuses i'm
very happy for him to stand above me and say let me tell you a little crazy [ __ ] about octopuses that is crazy [ __ ] right
but that's great it's called other minds i really recommend that book um but i'm not that i'm not an expert so
for me it's about the journey come on the journey with me come to all these different places come with me to a favela in rio come
with me to the killing fields in mexico come with me to a gulag in vietnam let's go on the journey let's figure out what
the [ __ ] going on and of all the books and this is i know that i can probably guess the response here they'll hold like i'll choose your
favorite kid which one oh chasing scream i have a really easy answer to that because only because um
so chasing screams a book i wrote about the addiction and and the war on drugs and it's because
it's the book that i've it sounds uh so fagrandizing and wanky
but it's the book that i've seen do the most good in the world it's a place where i've been to so many places where people have used
that book and the things that to me the happiest moment in any book and the whole process of writing
is when so i track down people i think are really interesting and important uh so to give an example there's a guy
in vancouver called professor bruce alexander one of the most amazing human beings alive
who did a really important experiment this transformed how we think about addiction called rat park i suspect we'll talk
about it and bruce you know that experiment was known before my book and before my ted talks
and stuff but as bruce says you know it got a huge boost from that and and and that evidence is now used
was used in norway where they're just on the brink of decriminalizing all drugs um in all sorts of places in mexico i
remember having a surreal conversation with some mexican politicians about it in all sorts of different places
and to me the most exciting moment is when the people i've written about get in touch with me and say oh people are contacting me because of you
because they've read about me and it's that moment where you feel that you've been a conduit between someone who's doing something
really important and people who needed to know it and to me that's like the blissful
feeling you know so chasing the scream just because um that's that's what that's the book
i've seen do the most work in the world you know what i mean quick interruption today we have luke with us behind the
scenes watching this podcast be recorded luke is a subscriber of this podcast and as i said in the previous podcast we're
gonna start bringing in subscribers to watch the show being filmed to sit behind the scenes to and to meet me and
the guests if you want that to be you all you've got to do is hit the subscribe button wherever you're listening to this podcast
so let's talk about rap park i i read about this study numerous times but i think it's you know
you've probably talked about it before but i think it's so important and foundational for so many reasons and and speaks actually speaks a
lot to lost connections as well in many respects um but i would love you to tell the story of rap park and
exactly what it what it is you know rap park was for me i found it very challenging when i learned about
rap park because i realized that all my life i've been misunderstanding some of the things i was seeing right in front of me so like
Rat Park
i said we had addiction in my family we still have addiction in my family it's very difficult
and when i started doing the research for chasing the scream god 10 10 years ago exactly 10 years ago almost i am if you'd asked me let's say her in
addiction because i was close to me if you said to me john what causes heroin addiction i would have looked at you like you were thick and i would have said well stephen
the clue's in the name right yeah obviously heroin causes heroin addiction right we've been told this story for a hundred
years that's become totally part of our common sense it was definitely part of mine so we think we're sitting here in east
london we think if we kidnap the next 20 people to walk past your flat in east london
and like a villain in a saw movie we injected them all with heroin every day for a month at the end of that month they'd all be
heroin addicts for a simple reason there's chemical hooks in heroin that as you use it
your body starts to crave you want more and more of them and so at the end of that month people would have this tremendous physical hunger for
the chemical hooks right that's why we call it being hooked um and that's that's the story we have in our heads
now that story is not completely wrong it turns out it's a very small part of a much bigger picture
and the first thing that i remember the first thing that alerted me to that was in my research i was interviewing
doctors and experts and it was explained to me right here in britain if you and me step out
into the street and we get hit you get hit by a truck right god forbid terrible loss to the world
um you'll be taken to hospital and if you say you broke your hip you'd be given a lot of a drug called
diamorphine right diamorphine is heroin it's much better than the [ __ ] you'd buy just like the
road from here on the street because it's medically pure heroin right and anyone watching this if you if
you're british and your nan's had a hip replacement operation your nan's taken a lot of heroin right now if what we think about addiction is
right that it's caused primarily or entirely by exposure to the chemical hooks
what should be happening to all these people in british hospitals who've been given a lot of powerful heroin
some of them should be leaving and trying to score on the streets you should be meeting people in their name meetings who say well you know i started i had a
hip replacement this has been studied very carefully it never happens right i remember when i
learned that i'm just thinking the first person who told me that was dr gabor marte
and i remember thinking saying to him gabor that can't be right how could you have a situation where
you've got someone in a hospital bed they're using a [ __ ] ton of really powerful heroin they don't become
addicted and you've got someone in the alleyway outside who you know is shooting up actually a
weaker shittier form of the drug and they and they do become addicted how could that be and i only began to
understand it when i went to vancouver and interviewed professor alexander professor bruce alexander so bruce explained to me the story we've
got in our heads that addiction is caused primarily or totally by the chemical hooks comes from a series of experiments that
were done earlier in the 20th century they're really simple experiments um
your viewers can try them at home if they're feeling a little bit sadistic and bored in covid times right not heroin is it
no they don't have to try it you take a rat you put it in a cage and you give it two water bottles
one is just water the other is water laced with either heroin or cocaine
if you do that the rat will almost always prefer the drugged water and almost always kill itself quite
quickly within a week or two right so there you go that's that's our story that's that's how we think it works but in the 70s professor alexander was
working where i met him on the downtown east side of vancouver which has a lot of he's working with a lot of people with very bad addiction problems
and he starts to look at these experiments and he says well hang on a minute you put the rat alone in an empty cage
it's got nothing that makes life worth living for rats all it's got is the drugs what would
happen if we did this differently so he built a cage that he called rat park which is basically heaven for rats right they've got loads
of friends they've got loads of cheese they've got loads of colored balls they can have loads of sex everything that
makes life worth living for rats is there in rat park and they've got both the water bottles the drugged water and the normal water
this is the fascinating thing in rat park they don't like the drug water they
don't use it very much none of the music compulsively none of them overdose so you go from almost 100 compulsive use
and overdose when rats don't have the things that make life worth living to no compulsive use and overdose when
they do have the things that make life worth living and obviously we are not rats we're more complicated
but the core of this there's lots of human evidence that i can talk about but what what this taught me and a lot
of the other evidence taught me is the core of addiction is about not wanting to be present in your life
because your life is too painful a place to be and it actually makes you realize why our approach of punishing people with
addiction problems is such a disaster actually makes the problem worse the opposite of addiction is not sobriety although that
is valuable for some people the opposite of addiction is connection and we're living through a great example of that right now just
just i think two days ago the government announced massive increase in alcohol-related deaths massive increase in other drug-related
deaths in britain and in the united states why would that be right we i think
rightly in order to suppress the virus which we had to do we have had to become more disconnected
and that has caused an increase in addiction now that tells us something about what was causing addiction all along and what the paths out of
addiction are so i thought it was a very long answer perfect answer and obviously with the with that in mind you know covert
has um accelerated the um adoption of remote working which i
Working from home, living through screens
you know there's been a lot of debate around that whether it's a good thing or a bad thing my stance is pretty clear i think it's
an awful thing and i say this because you know after reading your book i understand that um
connection organic connection in our lives is has this like has been on this sort of macro decline and one of the like
institutions in our lives that has held that together has been the office so like most of my friends come from
working in a big office you know if i think about where 90 of my connection comes it came from the office
and to think especially as a young person who hasn't got a family or kids whatever that that is also now going to move to a
screen i think is a [ __ ] terrible idea to be honest um i wanted to get your your thoughts on that because i think
i i don't i think people think of the convenience factors but we thought of the convenience factors when we in we created social media and
dating apps and all these other things but the unintended consequences of the convenience tends to be
you know stripping us of connection once again and like what do we have left like everything else is on a screen now
so if you take away work from me i'm like i probably wouldn't see anybody like porn you know i can do that online now
dating swipe swipe swipe so it feels like you know the last institution of
connection is being uh is that war i think that's really interesting i
think there's a there's two things i was thinking about as you talked about that stephen one is
what a lot of us get out the web the relationship between social media and social life
is a bit like the relationship between porn and sex and she mentioned porn because i'm not anti-porn porn's going
to meet a basic itch right um but no one you know spends an hour looking at porn and feels
like satisfied and seen speaks me physically not the way you do after you've had sex
right unless you're having a very bad sex step
in a similar sort of way you know it's not that the these
a lot of these technologies are attempts our unhealthy relationship with the technology itself is neutral
a lot of our relationships with these technologies are attempts to fill
holes in the way we're living right phil whole but unfortunately we're talking about porn but you know what i mean um the the the and even if you just
think about when the internet arrived right the internet arrives for most of us the early 2000s or 1999 i got my first email
address in 2000 and a lot of the things that we're talking about had already
been going rising for a long time big increase in loneliness before that and what happens is the internet arrives
and it looks a lot like the things we've lost right you've lost friends here's facebook friends you've lost status in the
economy here's some status updates but they're not the things we've lost it's like giving pawn to a sex starved man in
prison or something it's not the thing you've lost right i mean it'll meet a certain basic hitch but it's not the thing you've lost
and if interacting through screens met our basic needs as human beings we would all be very happy zooming all
the time right sitting on zoom would be as good as sitting in the office right you know and people often say to me why
do you travel to so many places to do all these interviews why don't you just talk to them on skype or zoom and
always say because you get 10 of the experience through a screen people don't open up to
you they don't feel they've met you i wouldn't remem all these people i'm describing to you i can picture them so vividly
people have interviewed zoom i can never remember even what they look like right so these forms of interaction they've got a place you know look it's better to
have zoom in a time of a plague than than nothing which would have been the alternative in in the context of covid
but it's not it doesn't we evolved to interact to look into each other's eyes to see
each other to interact in three dimensions we did not evolve to interact through screens it doesn't meet our deeper needs
that is why i've never done this podcast over zoom despite the temptation yeah so we we started doing
in just we started we upped everything in december and really started going for it you know built the team and all these things
and that's obviously in the middle of the pandemic there's flight restrictions no one can fly in and we've got the most amazing guests in
the world that want to come on via zoom and i just said i do this because i enjoy it right
that's like the fundamental reason that's the reason why i'll keep doing it for the next 10 years and i would not enjoy doing it over zoom
it would become like a job to me because i like meeting people and obviously the the conversation we have now
you can feel the emotion you can you can hear the you know you can see it my eyes you can see at
certain points you know you can feel what i'm thinking and that unlocks for a podcast that's meant to be a little bit more
um deeper it unlocks that depth we've had you know tears and we've had all sorts and i formed real friendships
from it so many pretty much all of my guests i feel like i'm friends with it straight after because of the vulnerability so i just i just made a rule that i
would not do anything over zoom and when people ask me to go on their podcast over zoom the answer is the same i don't want to do it and i with my team
my office is actually downstairs so we come in every day there is one thing about work i think everything you
said is totally true so there's one thing about work i would say which is a slightly different point uh but relates to remote working which
is so uh i mean we can talk about some more detail if you want but for the purposes of this part of the conversation
there's a lot of evidence that um lacking control over your work makes you depressed
right i'm sure we could talk about that more um one thing that people do benefit from i
think from zoom not actually funny interestingly not so much in covid times as evidence people are working
more hours under kobe than they were normally partly because zoom meetings take so damn long
um but some people i think as we come out of this which we
will as we come out of covid um the pandemic some people i think would like to have
more leeway about when they are in the office oh yeah and would like to and i think
it's interesting when you look at the research on this it's not so much the ratio is it 20 at
home it's whether you can choose yes it's the amount of agency you have
um so in that sense i think that's where and of course we didn't have any choice
about coping but the that's the bit where i would say we'll probably have some value going forward 100 agree
i i actually wrote about um motivation intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation and one of the
big factors of people feeling motivated in work is as you say autonomy feeling like you have
control of your work and and that's the that's also the balance that i've always tried to create at my companies which is
um one way you can book um as much time off as you need without having to put like tell a
computer and ask it for approval and there is no bitchiness there is no one that's going to look at you the next
day and be like oh you've had a couple of days off and giving people the same level of freedom that i've always had has been super
important um but at the same time like i'm i've been super clear even though it's an unpopular narrative right now
i think this remote working future where you know these companies are coming out and doing all their virtual signaling
you know whatever i think it's a load of nonsense and i think they're actually harming people by supporting the idea that we're
going to all especially younger people live our lives through screens and i think that people are going to figure this out i actually
think people have overestimated the stickiness of remote remote working because the narrative is companies that
offer remote working will attract all the staff all the good talent so you're gonna have to do it but i actually think companies that are
able to offer community and much more than work which is for me is what a good job is much what's the
it's the friends you make the experiences you have the challenges you're driving towards together the worthwhile
it's like the worth while striving for a challenge with a group of people you love for me that's like become my
my the reason for why i live i i managed to get it down to those three things which is people i love uh worthwhile challenge
right and i don't know how that links into your work but that's i think the most foundational i've managed to get with like my reason to live is like
oh at least my reason to work so if i think like you've gone to a really important um
one of the most important things that relates to depression anxiety in your own life which is meaning right so there's all
this i mean it's funny exactly a year a little bit more than a year ago a year and a month ago i was in moscow
it was the last thing i did before i got covered it was grim i interviewed this fascinating uh russian
psychologist called um dimitri leontyev and his um so his dad had actually been a super
famous uh so his grandfather had been an incredibly famous psychologist but he's a very distinguished psychologist as well and
um i remember him saying like um british and american people british
american philosophy if you go back it's very often about happiness the belief that you should try to make yourself happy
right obviously it's in constitution the pursuit of happiness right and he said when russians hear that we
just laugh right that's a child's game trying to chase happiness it's the child's philosophy so
you can't you don't have that much say about whether happiness will come and go he said what life is about is not happiness but
Finding meaning within the machine
meaning right the pursuit of meaning and actually when you've got meaning in your life you can tolerate a lot of
unhappiness and you even think about something as simple as uh a dentist or a good example
a dentist drill right so if i now took out a drill opened your mouth and you know jabbed it into your teeth and
it was agony because that would have no meaning in the context between us it would be different it would literally be torture it would cause you
terrible suffering and you'd be traumatized for ages but you've been to the dentist and they've done that right and it didn't traumatize you most likely
some people do get traumatic dentists that's a different story it's rare um why because it had a meaning right you could tolerate the
pain because there was because it was for a purpose all right if i don't tolerate this pain my teeth are going to get [ __ ] up right
um it's worthwhile and i think that's one of the things that's a big
a big driver depression anxiety is one actually it was one of the two hardest causes of
depression and anxiety that i wrote about lost connections for me to it was the one one that was most chat one of the two that was most challenging
for me was this crisis of meaning so for thousands of years philosophers have
said if you think life is about money and status and showing off you're going to feel like [ __ ] right
it's not an exact quote from confucius but that is basically what he said right but weirdly nobody had ever scientifically i'm looking to is this
true how do we know no one had actually scientifically investigated this until an amazing man i got to know
named professor tim casa who did an incredible amount of uh spent 35 years researching these
questions he discovered loads of things but i think for what we're talking about there's two in particular firstly he discovered exactly as the
philosophers warned if you think life is about money and status and showing off
all the values you get from advertising instagram everything like them the more likely you are to become depressed and anxious by a significant
amount and secondly he discovered as a society as a culture we have become much more driven by these
junk values right they've been rising all throughout my lifetime your lifetime and and i was talking
about well why is that right and there's many reasons that i go through the book why does that make us feel so bad um a key reason i think is just
it trains us to look for happiness in all the wrong places right you know your technical crew know
everyone knows everyone watching this knows you're not going to lie on your deathbed and think about all the likes you've got
on instagram right you're going to think about moments of love and meaning and connection um but but as professor casa put it to
me we live in a machine that is designed to get us to neglect what is important about life right
we live in a machine where we are bombarded more 18 month old children know what the mcdonald's m
means than know their own last name right so from the moment you're born you are trained to think if you don't
feel good there's a solution for that work harder buy [ __ ] display on instagram to make people go omg so
jealous right that is the script of our society and it's it's like kfc for the soul right you're
not going to find happiness there but the more meaningful values are lying
just beneath the surface right nothing i just said i mean it's almost like a hallmark card at the level of banality everyone knows that at
some level and yet we don't live by it and this is true of a lot of things to learn from lost connections it's not like i'm explaining quantum
physics right it's not like i'm not that i could do that it's not like i'm explaining at noam chomsky's linguistics or something
these are things at some level we all know but we live in a machine like professor casa put it
we live in a machine that has taught us to neglect to mistrust our own instincts about what will give us a good life
and to and to pursue um other things instead do you know what i mean does that make sense of course it
makes [ __ ] sense to me of course it makes sense do you feel but i really feel the reason it was challenging is
because i could see how much of my own life was driven by
these junk folks i was never a materialistic person i was never i was once nominated for an award as the worst dressed gay man in britain so i
was never like a kind of did you in material no i was beaten by david furnish who i've always thought was very well dressed so i show so much i know but you know
a big part not i was never like i was never like trump it was never 100 but a big part of my life
was driven by trying to think about how people perceive me managing people's expectations does it
still yeah of course it's still a part of my character but it's a radically smaller part of my personality than it was
uh 15 years ago because i was thinking as you're saying that i was just thinking i was thinking this is also
true but again the question posed my mind was how would i get out of the machine
when so much of the things i enjoy keep me within the machine so
you know i could i could abscond and go to bali and go and live on a beach and just you surround myself with a couple of
friends and you'd give up my louis vuitton shoes i don't have a ton shoes but you know what i mean give up my lamborghini
which i also don't have and i could i could escape but much of the joy of my life comes from doing things like this having conversations
with people like you which means that i have to live in london and then to promote this i'm gonna have to use instagram and social media and then i'm
gonna get a little pat on the back from the algorithm if it's good or bad and and so in the pursuit of some of my
intrinsic joy and fit goals i i'd have played with this a lot i
i i'm i'm putting myself in the machine and i can't see another way to live the best i say to myself the best you
could probably do steve is live within the machine but just live much more consciously know that you're in the machine and it's
the minute that you don't know you're in the machine that the machine becomes your puppet master and then i'll start [ __ ] buying louis vuitton again so it's funny there's
doing things you're saying louis vuitton because i once a party met calvin klein and until that moment i i thought calvin
klein was a fictional character like rory mcdonald so someone said oh this is kevin clinton i almost said i like the clothes and then i was like
is this like it was it was like suddenly meeting you like ronald mcdonald or something
so i think tim caster discovered two answers to actually lots of answers but two specific things that he discovered
that i think really help answer your question so and they operate at different levels so
what can we do about the fact we live in the machine there's two things there's one thing that's going to sound very big and is very big which is we can dismantle the machine
the machine was created by human beings and it can be dismantled and again i went to places that have started
that sao paulo in brazil uh city was full of advertising it was doing people's heads
in they banned outdoor advertising people felt much better do you remember the campaign that happened here when was it
it's in the books it must have been at least four years ago five years ago maybe there was a campaign on the tubes skinny
too i know this is funny yeah exactly somebody who don't remember there were it was a picture of
a super ripped guy and a super lean woman and it said
are you beachbody ready right and it was an advert for some john i'm so out of touch with sorry i
know so what was it a protein shake it was like a a protein a powder
right right right i'm so unhealthy i don't even know what that powder would you conceive of what you would do with that powder except snort it which i
assume is not what you did but anyway and city khan just banned it just said you know what this makes people feel like [ __ ] it's got an insidious
vile message which is if you don't look like these people i.e if you're like 99.99 the population
you're not fit to go to the beach just banned it there was a campaign to vandalize that poster which uh people vandalized
it just with the slogan advertising shits in your head so that was a great slogan so you can do
a political thing we don't have to allow all this stuff right um and we can build up to that in
all sorts of ways smaller steps and one is a more personal one and that's something i now do i have a
group of friends we talk you know once every couple of weeks we talk about okay what are the times when we've been
tempted by [ __ ] you know like uh we had the conversation the other day and one of my friends said you know oh
she'd got retweeted by some famous person and it lifted her move for five minutes and then she was like i need more i need more i
need more and then we're like okay but did you write that day she's writer she said no no it distracted me i didn't
write and we're like okay but and of course you only had to say it don't you oh yeah
that's the thing that gives my life meaning that's the moments when i feel flow not the sugar high of you know um i've tried to remember it
was it was someone really famous um so just having these so i would say
and and those things are complementary by the way when we have those conversations with the among ourselves it makes us
feel more powerful to take on the aspects of the machine that are [ __ ] us up as well what you've
described is like a counterbalance right because you've got the machine whispering in your ear every day every time you log on
social media walk down the street look at the internet look at the newspaper and it's saying bye louis vuitton
[ __ ] and then what you've described there is just by having someone um in your ear once in a while going
down by louis vuitton live your life for you know intrinsic your intrinsic values you know things that actually matter it acts as a bit of
a counterbalance and it's so true because i know this stuff right done a lot of reading about it
your book really helped me understand it lots of other books i've you know you talked about um
professor tim casa read his writings after you wrote about it in your book i know this stuff yet
once every quarter i'll pop up in the whatsapp group with dom and sophie and i'll go
what about a lamborghini and they'll and they'll they'll respond to me i mean dom goes [ __ ] get it because he's this
he's bad egg but um he's like you might as well know but um
but my all it takes is one of my good friends to go to me but why do you need that and i go yeah of course you're right but this is what
tim casa puts him really well i remember him saying it to me we all
have a need intrinsic values but intrinsic values are very fragile yeah and they can be very easily
hijacked by signaling around us which is why
you're right we need to counterbalance it we also need to actually get less of this [ __ ]
please right and that's a social thing that we can fight for right there's all sorts of there are countries that regulate these
things sao paulo banned outdoor advertising there's all sorts of things we can do we but also
um it's not just that we're bombarded with the advertising externally we then police that among
ourselves right when i remember when i was a kid and people were obsessed with nike sneakers and i was a kind of fat
kid who sat in the corner of reading i didn't give a [ __ ] about um uh basketball and yet i wanted these things right
why did i and it wasn't it partly it was exposure to advertising but actually it was more um
the way we police it among ourselves so once you set and train those values people then police among themselves so
that's about how do we undo that and it's partly about saying people how does this really make you feel right
very occasionally you will meet an extremely materialistic person who will tell you that donald trump
would be a good example right who will tell you this makes me feel good and yet you look at them
and you see that they are achingly unhappy right i've rarely seen a more unhappy person
than donald trump um so you can see but one of the dangers of these values
is one of the reasons that makes us they make us feel so bad is that those values can then pollute
your relationships when you measure it scientifically people have high levels of junk value what called extrinsic values is the
scientific term people have high levels of extrinsic values junk values have less successful relationships that
break up more often because relationships where you value the other person for
very superficial external things like you know do other men feel jealous when they see me with this person
um those aren't good relationships right i've been in uh so many of them you were nodding very i
thought yeah it's just exactly yeah no it is and um you talked about how you know there's the fear one of the
reasons why people are less happy in those relationships is the fear that this person would leave if i lost my money or my looks whatever
and then you alluded to the point that i was thinking most about which is um you formed your connection with them
based on something basically extrinsic something superficial so you have these like surface level connections
and then your life with that person you don't your psychological needs don't get met because you don't have the you know
in my case like an intellectual connection with them you can't talk about the things you want to talk about you haven't formed that basis on a deeper
level but then i just wanted to this is if this was a confession box here's what i would say in the same way
that as a young 28 year old guy who's been successful um uh you know i guess that word in my ear
that just says buy a lamborghini like a little kermit every three months i also get in the same year from the
same little [ __ ] evil kermit says to me there's that a hot girl
who's completely i don't know i don't want to get cancelled because i've got some stuff coming up in the media but there's that hot girl who has made
herself look um beautiful on the outside do you usually see the distinction stephen
right like there's nothing wrong with sexual attraction in front of people we don't want to counter pose a world of
junk values versus puritanism do you know what i mean it's like sexual attraction is one of the great joys of
life yeah i was just trying to i don't want to i don't want to say it in in the words
there is that person who offers nothing more than um just they look good they offer
nothing more and the same way it says come on steve go for it
and every time i've gone for it it doesn't take me very long to be miserable in that situation and then on the other hand i've got
these other this other person in my life who is the antithesis of that who is all substance
and um something in my life tries to sway me back to the junk people but i think there's a thing about
um i in several ways i think what you said is really important because it's not like there's this category of
saintly benign human beings who are immune to all these temptations and you know we need to be more like
that every human being is a conflict of intrinsic and extrinsic values and extrinsic values are
a certain measure of them is healthy right desire for external success is nothing to be ashamed of
uh finding people hot and wanting to have sex with hot people is perfectly is something we all have right at the
expense of a meaningful relationship it's like a balanced diet isn't it you want to have
um you want these you want these things to exist in a
balance with all your other motivations but what i don't think
what definitely doesn't work is because i tried this myself i remember being quite cut off from my own um
status seeking behavior and sort of not owning it and i think actually
when you just acknowledge oh yeah this is part of me this is a part this will always be a part of me there are some pleasures to be found
there it's not it's not barren right um but
you always want that to be one part of a much bigger picture then you can have a healthy conversation with yourself and with other people
about these aspects of yourself that's very different to and especially if you live in a society and culture that is all about
getting you to be that one thing and you know presenting as images of success
i mean you and i both met lots of rich people and i've got to say they are the most
miserable bastards or you're one of the very few cheerful rich people i know right
if i think about says a handful who are happy and they're almost always uh i'm trying to think of
i can look well one person who inherited it so i don't count that um some artistic people like a few
people who pursued their artistic dream like elton john and became really rich he's happy
after a [ __ ] rocky journey as everyone knows and the machine that's [ __ ] us all up do you believe that because it's
Are we struggling to form meaningful connections
making us all care it's conditioning us to care more about extrinsic values and these like you know all this nonsense do you
think it's in it's it's hindering our chances of forming meaningful romantic connections i for just from
what i've grown up in this instagram era where it looks like everybody's getting prettier on the outside and everyone's getting uglier in
the inside because instagram and the machine have told us that this is what society values
how big is your ex how white is your why how perfect is your hair you know
so it feels like life is gone okay the game everybody get in get in everybody get in okay you're gonna this is how you win you'll
get the most points in life if you have the best hair the best uh eyes the best
boobs you know biggest six-pack chest that is the game do you understand
everyone's going yeah okay okay and if you see someone that has that as well pam on the back and we go okay cool and
we've had ten years of this black mirror experiment so all of our values have gone you know extrinsic and junk values
and i think we're struggling to form meaningful connections because that didn't the
machine told us that didn't matter you know it's funny after the book came out a group of people i did not expect to so
i was absolutely inundated on it was particularly my ted talk about it came
out inundated on instagram by massive instagram
yeah um start what we call it influences
like really people with some of the biggest instagram followings in the world
messaging me saying you're so right i feel like and i remember getting a message i always say who it was but from someone
who was a big instagram influencer messaging me saying i'm so depressed
i don't want to get a bed in the morning my life is terrible i didn't hear this person also i clicked on the instagram page and literally five
minutes before sending me that message and five minutes after yeah she had done a kind of glowing my life is you know i can't know the words
but you know kind of my life is so great um bragging and and i really
yes but the thing i would say that is so important about this it's a
funny thing to say i know it might sound odd but the widespread nature of our depression anxiety and addiction crises
in one sense although terribly painful and horrible and excruciating and i've been there
is a positive thing because the system is not working for more and
more people and it becomes harder to defend this system and these values when it makes everyone feel like [ __ ]
right at some point you have to go you know what this ain't [ __ ] working for us so think about where we are i lived here
as i said for 10 years right just not far from here so tower hamlets you know i mean the tahoe says some of
the hot i think if i remember rightly when i lived here it was i think it was the constituency
in england that had the highest level of poverty right um so there's a lot of distress in tower
hamlets right i mean and by the way you can be distressed and not be poor a lot of this distress is happening in middle class and wealthy areas but think
about where we are look for signs of distress connect with the people who are distressed fight together with them for
something better and of course that has to be something people do i can't tell people what the signs of distress around them are and they'll be different
in you know um a coastal village in kent to you know glasgow where my mom's from to
the isle of skye different there'll be certain shared factors but look for the signs of distress i mean
you're spoiled for signs of distress they're all [ __ ] around us right i mean think about um the number of
people who drank themselves to death in britain last year and how much that went up as we said and then meet them where they are
because god change is really possible right and i think about that in my own life
you know i'm gay right i didn't hear the concept of gay marriage till i was 20
and my friend andrew sullivan wrote the first book advocating it right literally i did never crossed my mind i remember the first person i was ever in love with
when i was 16. i never had a sense of a future didn't even occur to me that we could get
married it never even entered my head right um you think about the scale of that transformation
i remember just before kovid i was on the tube and there were these two girls who can't
have been more than 16 and they were making out and i was staring at them and i think they thought i was like an elderly person
and i had to go oh no no i'm gay i'm just really this is really moved this could never happen when i was your age like i said i just thought i was like a
mental person but the the how did that happen right it happened because ordinary people
came out they appealed to other people around them lots of heterosexual people saw that it
was pointless to be cruel to gay people and they could be loving and accepting instead and that change happened unbel you
basically got 2 000 years of gay people being horrifically persecuted and then like 70 years of this from
from less than 70 years 60 years from send them to prison to yay they can get
married right so absolutely change on when we talk about things like oh
you know we're trapped in this machine that's making us depressed right that can sound like such a big thing right we had
2 000 years of homophobia right and i'm not saying we've completely overcome it obviously but there's stunning progress right
the things we're talking about are much more recent inventions than homophobia right like infinitely more recent and
homophobia terrible though it was only ever affected a small part of the population the things we're talking about
[ __ ] make they don't make everyone depressed but they make everyone less happy than they could be so these are you know these are
absolutely things that can be challenged they can be challenged in individuals lives and we can deal with them at the
political level as well it requires a transformation in consciousness which is happening
and we can talk about addiction if you want in places that solved that made extraordinary changes in that
and massively reduce their addiction deaths that i went to but we need to understand this
differently and we need to listen to our pain we need to stop insulting our depression anxiety and addictions
by saying they're a sign of weakness or madness or purely biological although there are
some biological contributions and start listening to them listen to the signal as a society
and as a culture because it is telling us where we need to go and what we need to
do i've been a hill fan for a long time as you obviously know by now but in the
last six months i've got a real opportunity to get to know the people to get to know the ceo of huell which is
james to get to know the founder which is julian the teams that agonize over the ingredients that go into these amazing
recipes and i can honestly say with my hand on my heart my appreciation and admiration for huel and its people
has multiplied by a factor of 10 because and this is the singularities not only are they nice people
but because i've seen first hand how much they are non-negotiable about the values of huel they will not
compromise they will not compromise on the the goodness of the ingredients that goes into the products the amount
of proteins and minerals and these things regardless if they can't get to where they want to get to with the products
they will cancel the product i've tasted products and they've said we've not managed to make it this we've not delivered on our promise of
veganism we've not added enough fiber so we're canceling it and that sort of non-negotiable set of values
has made me realize that they have my back when i choose cure let me talk about you okay
How good are you at making connections
and your connections yeah and your romantic connections your friendships and all of those things sometimes i find it fascinating that
obviously since you know people can know a lot of stuff but applying it to oneself is challenging
i've you know some of my my favorite guests that i've sat here with i'm thinking about jamal kreishi who i sat here with who's like a
you know you one could call him like a motivational uh coach you know probably doesn't quite
characterize who he is but my last question to him was um are you good at taking your own advice he went
absolutely [ __ ] not he was like i'm the least motivated motivational coach in the world so my question to you is how are you
doing with your connections in your life in your mental health and all of these questions
i think people are often most articulate about the things they most struggle with right so and it's interesting because
sometimes that's presented as hypocrite give you an example there's a left-wing political who but there's a left-wing politician
i know who is incredibly articulate about greed and how terrible it is and is incredibly
greedy right now you could look at that and go that's hypocrisy and of course at one level a kind of
boringly obvious level it is but to me what's more interesting is that is a person who's internally struggling against his own flaw
right that is a person who has this force within him and is genuinely trying is so articulate
because he's wrestling with it all the time and so i think um in a sense taking your
own advice is sort of like the fact that you needed to articulate the advice suggests that internal struggle do you know what you mean yeah
i think about um ian foster one of my favorite writers who famously said only connect
who was someone who really struggled with connection um partly because he was a gay man of a much earlier generation
who uh well his connections his loving romantic connections were a
crime right so he was really there were other ways in which he struggled with with connection as well
so in terms of myself um i was always very lucky with friendships
um all my life i've had amazing friendships for me um you know i said before there
were two causes of two cause out of the nine causes of depression anxiety that wrote about in
the book there were two that i struggled with a lot and this so one was drunk values the other
it this was a hard journey for me in the book i learned about this through a story of
a scientist discovered it who i met and she explained i think people understand it better if they know the story even though for like a minute
you're going to think what the [ __ ] has this got to do with what he just said but just bear with me so in the mid 1980s there was a doctor
called vincent felitti who um was approached
he was in san diego in california and he was approached by kaiser permanente who are one of the big not-for-profit
medical providers in california and they came to him and were like we've
got a problem and we need your help and the problem was
um obesity obesity was massive rising hugely exploded since then but it was
rising and rising and they were like look nothing we're doing is working we give people diet advice we talk to them about nutrition
we even give some of them personal trainers nothing is working so they just gave him a quite big budget
and said just do blue skies research work with really obese people just figure out what the hell we can do so dr felitti starts working with
uh 250 severely obese people people who weighed more than 400 pounds so people
who are really you know in terrible danger he's working on this thing
he's interviewing them he's thinking what can i do and one day he's talking to one of them and
he has an idea which sounds like it actually is a quite stupid idea he said what would happen if really
obese people literally stopped eating and we gave them like i know vitamin c shot so they didn't get
scurvy we gave them like vitamin shots would they just burn through the fat supplies in their body
and get down to a normal way so with a [ __ ] ton of medical supervision they try it
and incredibly at first it worked there's a woman i call her susan that's not a real name um who went down from being more than
400 pounds to 138 pounds it's amazing right and people are like how can this be
what's going on uh and her family are like you've saved her life and then one day something happened they
didn't expect susan cracked she went to kfc she wasn't kfc that's me projecting whatever it was
uh some fast food place she starts obsessively eating and pretty soon she's back at her
dangerous weight not where she'd been but a dangerous weight and dr felitti called her in he's like
susan what happened said i don't know i don't know
and he's kind of dumbfounded and he says well tell me about the day that you cracked what did anything happen that day it turned
out something had happened that day that never happened to susan she was in a bar and a man came up to
her and hit on her not in a nasty predatory way in a nice way and she felt really freaked out and she goes and she starts eating and
if he's like huh what's the significant could this be significant and then he said to her saying he never asked his patients
before he said susan when did you start to put on your weight in her case it was when she was 11.
and he said to her well did anything happen that year that didn't happen any other year anything when you're eleven
she said she looked down she said yeah that's when my grandfather started to rape me
dr philippe interviewed everyone in the program and he discovered that more than 60 percent of them have put on their
extreme weight in the aftermath of being sexually abused or assaulted and he's thinking what's what's that
about how what and susan explained it to him really well she said overweight is overlooked
and that's what i need to be this thing that seems so destructive and of course
it's bad for you to be severely obese was performing a positive function for all these people it was protecting them
from sexual attention right um and just things like ah this is
this is kind of interesting um so he but this is a small group of people it's 250 people it's not much you can't
draw big scientific conclusions based on this so dr felitti goes to the cd center for disease control who fund a lot of
medical research and he got funding to do a massive study everyone who came to kaiser permanente in san
diego so more than 17 000 people for a whole year no matter what for headaches schizophrenia broken leg
anything got given two questionnaires first part says
did you have any of these bad experiences when you were a kid things like sexual abuse severe neglect that kind of thing second
part said um have you had any of these problems as an adult it was initially only going to
say obesity but and this is where it comes to our story at the last minute they had loads of other things like depression addiction suicide attempts
and at first when they added up the figures people they were like no there's been a mistake added up again because the figures were so extreme for
every category of childhood trauma that you experienced you were two to four times more likely
to be depressed obese and addicted but when you got into the multiple categories the figures just went crazy
if you had six categories of chance of trauma you were 3100 more likely to have
attempted suicide and 4 600 percent more likely to have an injecting
drug problem i mean these are just insane figures you very rarely get that in science right
and i remember dr felitti saying to me like that that he he realized
it was like there had been a house fire and we have been focusing on dealing with the smoke
not on dealing with the fire right dr robert ander who's one of the other scientists who worked on it said to me
he realized when you see things like obesity depression addiction we need to stop asking what's wrong with
you and start asking what happened to you but it's kind of difficult to talk about
this but so dr felicia is a super nice guy right if you met him you'd really like him when i interviewed him he was
like 81 so ages ago lovely good decent admirable man
and when i interviewed him in san diego the first time i was sitting with him
and i was getting angrier and angrier and i actually ended the interview early
because i was getting so angry i remember walking to the beach in san diego walking around thinking
what the [ __ ] is this about why am i so angry with this lovely old man who's done this amazing research that's helped so many people
and i'm thinking so when i was a child i'd experienced some
very extreme things from an adult in my life and i had i didn't want to think about
that i didn't want to uh i didn't want to think about that in relation to the depression i had
experienced i didn't i didn't want to give this individual power over me now
um but one of the reasons i'm glad that i went back and carried on
talking to him is because of what dr felicity do you think is really relevant to what you're asking so
obviously they'd asked all these people who came for healthcare about their childhood trauma so suddenly they've got all this data so
they said to people's gps don't call them back in but next time they come in look at the
childhood trauma thing and if they've experienced childhood trauma say to them something like this i see that when you were a child you
were sexually abused or whatever it was i'm really sorry that happened that should never have happened to you you
should have been protected that was a failing would you like to talk about it and 40 percent of people did not want to talk
about it but 60 of people did and they wanted to talk about it on average for five minutes and then it was randomly assigned some
of them were told we can go to therapists to talk about it more what they found was just five minutes of
an authority figure saying i'm so sorry this should never have happened to you that alone
led to a significant fall in depression and anxiety and people who refer to a therapist had an even bigger form
and what this shows it fits with a whole load of other evidence from people like professor steve coles at ucla professor
james pennebaker at florida state university is it's not the trauma that destroys you
it's the shame about the trauma and giving people ways to release that shame is an
antidepressant so for me
learning that and it's one of the reasons i made myself put it in the book and talk about it is so very often people who survive
abuse as children internalize the voice of the abuser right almost invariably the abuser says
you made me do this you're a bad person you made me do this right and so although of course there
was never any point in my adult life where i thought that was a rational you know there was never a point where i would have if you
you know if someone had told me they had been abused and told me negative things they'd been told i would never have thought yeah the
abuser was right obviously i didn't reckon with that internalization in my own life and i
think it meant that a lot of the time although i always had great friendships
with romantic relationships um they would i would often cauterize them
at a certain point because i didn't feel at that time that
i deserved to be loved i didn't feel that i deserved to be treated well so it would mean that sometimes i would get into relationships
people who didn't treat me well or sometimes if they did treat me well i would end it prematurely
at the point at which they were treating me well because i've internalized so many of these negative
uh and destructive and untrue ideas and and the process of thinking that
through obviously i had a therapist as well the process of thinking that through and releasing that shame made me
much more open to know love you know uh because i didn't
it was possible to overcome that does that make sense stephen does that are you still on that journey oh yeah and i think anyone who you know
how would i put it yeah of course of course
and through all of your your work and your writing you've you know you've highlighted to the world but also clearly to yourself the importance of
that um of romantic connections well it comes right back to where we started isn't it
why do i write to understand to understand things i didn't understand at the start to go on a journey there are things i
want to understand um and and sometimes they're big things
right um and sometimes they're very personal things and sometimes they're both uh and then to track down okay who
who knows a lot about this who's found interesting things out about this and go and sit with them and kind of pester them and keep going
back year after year until i feel i understand it and i feel now i understand it
and i gotta say it's quite frustrating watching some of the kovid debate at the
moment because um there's been this big increase in addiction depression
and a lot of the way it's taught even by super well-meaning admirable people as almost everyone in this debate is
so many of the ways in which people are encouraged to think they are helping
people with the best will in the world and with a good heart
often strip these things of meaning so there's a thing for example that very
well meaning people say which is so depression is just like you know depression is
a disease like diabetes you know you wouldn't shame someone having a broken leg
they're absolutely right that depressing anxious people should never be stigmatized but actually that that's not the way you remove stigma you
don't remove i mean no one ever doubted that leprosy and aids were biological phenomena and you might notice there was a damn
lot of stigma about them right saying something is biological and it's true there are some biological components we can talk about if you want
some biological contributions your genes can make you more vulnerable to these things so they do not write your destiny
um but but sexting is biological does not actually the there's some good scientific evidence it it increases the stigma because it makes
people think god those people are really different to me they're like a different species what actually undoes stigma is to say although there are some
biological contributions any of us would feel like this in this situation actually that your pain makes
sense there was a moment that really all this really fell into place for me as well as one of the two totally revolutionary moments for me in
the research for lost connections i went to interview this south african psychiatrist called derek summerfield
and he told me this story about something that happened to him so derek was in cambodia in 2001 when they
first introduced chemical antidepressants for people in cambodia they've never had them in the country before and the local doctors the the cambodians
were like what are they they didn't know what they were antidepressants
and and derek explained and they said to him oh we don't need them we've already got antidepressants and he was like well
what do you mean he thought they were going to talk about some kind of like herbal remedy like jinkobeloba or something
instead they told him a story they had a farmer in their community who worked in the rice fields and one
day he stood on a land mine left over from the wall with the americans and he got his leg blown off so they gave him an artificial limb they
did that in cambodia because they've got a lot of land mines and after a while several months the guy goes back to work right so he goes back
to work in the rice fields and but apparently it's super painful to work under water when you've got an artificial limb
and i'm guessing it was pretty traumatic to go back and work in the field where he got blown up the guy started to cry all day
after a while he just wouldn't get out of bed he developed what we would call classic depression right this is when
the cambodian doctor said well you know that's when we gave him an antidepressant and derek said what was
it they explained that they went and sat with him they listened to him
they realized that his pain made sense he only had to talk to him for five minutes to realize why he felt so [ __ ]
one of the doctors said well we realized if we bought this guy a cow he could become a dairy farmer he
wouldn't be in this position that was screwing him up so much so they bought him a cow within a couple
of weeks his crying stopped within a month his depression was gone it never came back they said to derek
so you see doctor that cow that was an antidepressant that's what you mean right
now if you've been raised to think about depression the way we have that it's primarily or entirely a malfunction in your brain
that sounds like a bad joke i went to my doctor for an antidepressant she gave me a cow but what those cambodian doctors knew
intuitively from this individual unscientific anecdote is what the leading medical body in the whole world the world health
organization has been trying to tell us for years right your pain makes sense if you're depressed if
you're anxious you're not weak you're not crazy you're not in the main a machine with broken parts
you're a human being with unmet needs and what you need is practical help and support to get those needs met so one of the
things we have to be asking as a society and culture is what's the cow for the things that are screwing us up right what's the cow for
the things that are making us depressed instead of seeing depression as a malfunction we've got to see it as a signal that's
telling us the person is distressed and and has unmet needs and and together
help them get those disparate because what the doctors didn't say is all right mate this is your problem you're on your own right together they
help to solve the problem we've got to solve the underlying problems for which depression is a signal
and you said you tweeted um about this you said um there is good evidence that after covid
we can reverse our spiraling depression and anxiety crisis but to do that we need to radically
expand the menu of responses to it yeah think about what we were talking about to give one example just from up
the road social prescribing right every single doctor's surgery should have a social prescribing wing
it should be the first thing that is suggested certainly for mild and moderate depression uh is figure out if the person's lonely
and disconnected from the natural world if they are suggest they might prescribe and there's a real power in doctors
prescribed not just saying oh you might want to think about this because people feel so disempowered to find each other in such a
lonely and atomized society that's one example obviously the last third of lost connections is loads of very practical examples and
we have to do that in our own lives right like we can socially prescribe ourselves yeah i think there's an authority in doctors
absolutely we can we shouldn't we should be doing it for ourselves we should be urging other people to do it but in a culture that's become so
disconnected from understanding our needs and actually where we've been told a rival
story that has some truth in it you know there are as i stress a lot in the book i have a
chapter about this there are real biological contributions to depression and anxiety that can make you more sensitive to these problems
and can make it harder to get out but what's happened is an overly simplified biological story
has become the main thing we say about depression when i went to my doctor and i was a
teenager and i was felt like pain was leaking out of me my doctor who was a very well-meaning
decent person just said the same wrong with your brain and all you need to do is drug yourself right and chemical anti-depressants gave
me a little bit of relief for a while also gave me really severe side effects in my case although not everyone
and ultimately i remain depressed right so what that story did that over simplified story which has some truth in
it for some people well that oversimplified story did is cut me off for many years for
13 years from exploring the deeper causes if right early on there's no criticism
of my doctor they're just part of a system you know that's not of their own creation and a lot of doctors want to do
better and want to have better options to give people that they haven't been offered them themselves
and it cut me off from a deeper more nuanced story that helps me to find a way out of my
depression so i think one of the things we've got to do is help people to find stories that make
sense of their pain because that's the way once you understand why you feel something you can begin to find your way out of it
but just being lost in a haze if you're just biologically broken no one is there are some biological contributions
but no one is broken by their biology no one is no one is with there's nobody
who with the right support can't find their way out but with the right support is a crucial clause there
that we have to build as a society that we have not built right we just haven't built got me thinking
psychedelics
about psychedelics for a number of reasons because psychedelics you know it's been of a
i think there's a bit of a revolution going on in the the perception of psychedelics you know we had the war and nixon's like war on drugs in the like
50s or 60s or whatever it was i wasn't alive then so excuse my uh inaccuracy but we were
lucky you dodged the bullet of nixon not a good guy yeah i wasn't there either but i'm not ready to talk about him but i just i know that he was
pivotal in like you know slamming the the gauntlet down on the the chance of even researching some of these compound
psychedelic compounds but what i've come to learn over the last six months working in uh you know one of the
world's leading um sort of psychedelic and non-psychedelic mental health companies which is a tie
and spending some time there is how remarkable the s these stats evidence and findings
are um for things like psilocybin which is the compound derived from magic mushrooms at helping those with
treatment-resistant depression to overcome um their you know their their feelings
of depression and it matches up perfectly to the philosophy and really the
the perspective that your book gave me on mental health because it approaches the um the
what's the correct word to use the indication of treatment resistant depression from the stance that something has
happened to you and that thing might live in your subconscious you know and it's an unlocker of that
thing in the same way that therapy might be for some for some people but what's your you know having written this book and studied
depression for so long and anxiety what do you think of psychedelics so as
you know for the book as chapter about psychotics because i went and interviewed the leading experts in the world on this people who've been doing the
cutting-edge research i interviewed them in um johns hopkins in baltimore at ucla here in london at ucl at nyu
and somewhere else oh in brazil and um so i'm strongly informed of psychedelics for some people it's a slightly
complicated picture in a way that i think helps us to understand what's going on so think about treatment you mentioned
treatment resistant depression some really good research was done on this here in london by david professor david nutt and dr
robin carhart harris they get people who've been depressed for a long time and nothing's helped them and they've tried lots of things
and nothing's helped them and they gave them remember rightly three doses of psilocybin in the active
component magic mushrooms might be wrong on the number but something like that and exactly as you
say huge numbers of them have a it's amazing they feel the strong
feeling of connection to the natural world to their own traumas to everyone around them as
anyone as you see psychedelics experience a really profound spiritual
experience and that deeply lifts their depression and anxiety
so a taste of connection this wasn't true for literally everyone but it was a very high percentage an intense feeling of meaning and
connection helps to lift them out of their depression there's a coder to that which robin talks about um
so i'll give you an example one of the people who told me about it's a woman in the program who worked in um she worked in an office in like a
coastal town in britain that was quite kind of run down and grim should be very depressed she goes she
takes the silocybin her depression lifts she feels deeply connected and then she goes back to work in
the office and she comes back and is like i can't go around my office acting like
we're connected we're all equal nature is beautiful i have to live in this disconnected way to exist in my
office right so over time her depression comes back because she's had a taste of connection but then
she goes back to live in a disconnected landscape right a disconnected emotional landscape
and i think um so what the evidence shows is the way i think of psychedelics is
administered in the right way of course that's an important clause what they can do is give you a taste of
how it feels to be connected to have meaning but i think of that as like
a compass that can point you in the direction you need to travel it doesn't do the j it gives i mean it
gives you a flash of what it's like to be at the end of the journey but then you're back at the start of the journey and you know the com you know
the direction in which you need to travel what it doesn't do is do the journey for you right or not for more than the six
or seven hours you know you're you're under the effects of the the psychedelic so and this is true of a lot of the
i mean there's some i'll come to some complexity of the evidence in a minute but so most people are not going to want to
take psychedelics a huge amount at the time right i mean there's some exceptions amanda fielding i don't know if you met her so amanda who people don't know amanda
is um kind of amazing uh british heiress who's a great champion of psychedelics
who um seems to remember i don't want to get it wrong cause i didn't write about her so i didn't uh i don't remember the
exact number but i seem to call her saying she took psychedelics for the whole of 1986. so just every day right so some people will
have the means and want to take psychedelics all the time but that's a very small part of the population right so
what what we know works is giving people psychedelics
to give them a sense of what it can be like to be connected and then helping them to integrate into their lives ways they
can bring take that connection forward so there was a guy i interviewed who was part of the johns hopkins study
who had had this very profound experience with psychedelics his dad had died when he was very young
no one had talked to him about his dad's death when he died it was just kind of silence and when he died he had this vision
where his he saw his dad he found his dad in a wood and his dad said to him you know you
built up these walls to protect yourself but we can take these walls down now you're safe go and seek right because
he'd been cutting himself off for so long from from things like romantic connections
and then when he when the psychedelics the effect of the psychedelics the immediate effect of the psychedelics
went away he then started becoming like a very deep meditator doing all sorts of things that kind of
built in that that that sense of connection into his life so i think
that that to me is the great value of now there are some people who say they have more enduring effects beyond just that immediate taste of connection and
the my kind of compass metaphor so the good evidence for that would be the johns hopkins study so the guys at johns hopkins did her
amazing scientists did it i always think about this in relation to my mother because um they took really long-term smokers so my uh my
mother smokes 70 cigarettes a day and uh there's an amazing there's a photo of me and her two at a time
she's like there's a photo of me and her when i'm uh about six months old i found a few years ago
where she's um she's breastfeeding me smoking and resting the asteroid in my stomach and when i showed it to her she said my
mother's scottish uh what i showed it to her she said you were a difficult baby i needed that cigarette
[ __ ] [ __ ] but um so they took people like my mother who a super super long-term
smoker she's been spoken since she was 14. and they gave them i think it was three doses of silocybin over a few months
and 80 of them stopped smoking and a year later 60 of them were still non-smokers so
there's some evidence of though positive long-term outcomes it's quite a small study so yeah i think this is a really
important i think some people oversell it and say it's the answer which is not right but i
think it can be a very useful tool when i talk about with depression what we've done up to
now is basically since the since the 90s
is with depression when people present with depression almost all the time there is one option
on the menu which is chemical antidepressants which do give some people some relief um
we need to radic that needs to stay on the menu but we need to radically expand the menu of options
and psychedelics are another great example of something that should totally be beyond the menu should be available to
people in a medical context and i would argue outside medical context as well i mean it's part of the argument of um
my book chasing the scream about how we need to end the war on drugs and move towards regulated models of
access to drugs for all sorts of drugs so yeah i think i think it's really important i think we're getting there as
well it's uh you know the public markets and the commercial model and the amount of investment that's going into
psychedelics is just staggering a thai have raised i think 400 million in the last 24 months it's another thing
where you know we're thinking about change when we feel like we're up against when we are indeed up against these very powerful forces
what think about cannabis right yeah when the day george w bush becomes president in 2000
15 of american citizens support legalizing cannabis today it's 70 and because new york just
legalized uh that hasn't started yet they've just voted the legislature voted to legalize now half of all american citizens live
in a state where cannabis is legal right so you think about how quickly that happened cannabis being unbelievably
demonized from the 1930s to the to the to like your lifetime yeah um
and then this huge shift in opinion really quickly because people saw it in practice right
people saw cannabis legalization and practice colorado went first um mason taver who led that campaign i
interviewed a lot for chasing the screen just all it takes is one place to breach the damn two places washington state did
at the same time and people are like oh is this the thing we were so [ __ ] afraid of oh actually you know it's you know
pretty straightforward just i feel like social media has played it played a role in this because
is Social media helping us rally together
we now have this like connected consciousness of like a whole country or the whole planet where we can we can pick up on an idea
share it and like virtue signal it signal it rapidly into existence into where we all go yep
that's right yeah like a whole country can do it when you think about if you go back hundreds of years before the advent of the internet
if the king of the land or whatever the politician had said something we couldn't um sort of get together in
the same way and um form our own opinion as this like because i see like i think about twitter as this one brain
and one day it will say you know same-sex marriage is great and that idea can very quickly
become adopted because you can get that idea to like a billion people and basically vote
it into existence using like you know likes and retweets and a couple of influences
and so i you know so i would have said that if you i would have said that 10 years ago what you just said i would have had the
optimistic view i think the evidence since then has gotten you're definitely right one of the good things about social media is we're
geographical distance feels much more collapsed and we feel much closer to the whole world ideas are spreading yeah and i
just but if you look at the mechanisms by which those ideas spread this is not inherent to social
media this is inherent to the current business model of social media so if you look at my friend tristan
harris uh has done his totally interview has done a really important work on this he was a google engineer
who uh saw what was happening inside google and and spoke out um
so if you look at how these ideas spread so we tend to think of it as a neutral playing field right
so here's a good idea gay marriage psychedelics help depression whatever it might be
enters this level playing field some people like it it spreads it grows right now sometimes that happens of course
but if you look at um so these business models of premise the business model of youtube twitter facebook is all promised
on you pick up your phone now you scroll through twitter you scroll through facebook the longer you are scrolling the more
money facebook makes obviously because of both exposure to adverts and because they're learning more about you every time you do anything
so their business model is premised every time you put down your phone it's a disaster for them
and every time you carry on scrolling it's great for them so they've designed very complex algorithms to figure out what keeps you scrolling
what keeps everyone who walks past this building scrolling and it turns out because of the quirky human beings that we could talk about
well if you want things that make you angry will keep you scrolling longer
than thing things that out things things that outrage and anger you will keep you scrolling longer than things that make you feel
good if you see something that makes you feel good it makes you want to go and be out in the real world if you see something that
makes you angry you want to keep scrolling you want to express your rage right if it's enraging it's engaging so
although that's not the goal of youtube and facebook they want you to be angry their algorithms are figured out
angering and enraging content keeps people scrolling longer therefore although it's not the intention of the designers
the the practical effect of these apps is they are designed to make the algorithms
function in such a way that they will feed you things that make you angry and upset so this thing that you thought was a level playing field
right oh good ideas will prevail bad ideas or die out is not right actually on in the main it will select
for things that make people angry so you look at the nyu study if you look at the um the figures for
the 2016 u.s presidential election i think the figure was 19 out of 19 out
of the 20 most uh shared stories on facebook were lies like actual lies like
the trumpet um donald trump was endorsed by the pope right which was not true in fact the pope criticized donald trump um so you see
when you think about infowars the disgusting filth uh this guy alex jones who
uh is a a cynic cynic not even not even a lunatic a cynic who says
things like the sandy hook massacre didn't happen the parents were are liars they're crisis actors so
you think about you know how many children it was 26 i think were murdered at school
and he unleashes a mob against these parents whose children have been murdered where those parents
have had to move loads of times because they are hounded by his supporters threatening to kill their surviving children
it's hard for me to imagine a more evil thing infowars in the 2016 election
more infowars stories were shared on facebook in the world than the entire new york times washington post guardian
and bbc combined so you think about this landscape that is enraging people
um so it's not now you don't have to have a business model like that social media doesn't have to
work that way right you can have all the good things about social media the collapsing of social distance the
connection of the world without that if you have a different business model we can talk about another time and tristan talks about that brilliantly
but so i i i get what you're saying and i understand
there's a truth in what you're saying which is we can hear ideas more readily but there's a cost well it's not just a
cost there'll be a cost in any model but actually we're communicating through a poisoned mechanism that doesn't promote the
spread of good ideas that actually promotes the spread of false and uh hateful ideas um and we've got to
fix that as well as um yes then we can have all the joys of connection without this you know
infowars [ __ ] or or other forms of i completely agree um and you you know i saw you'd written
your new book & your writing style
when you went off to write your new book which we're not we're probably not allowed to talk about on this uh my publishers will tase me that's fine
they've told me very specifically i'm super excited to read it it's january next year january next year yeah
how exciting yeah can you you can say the title that's on amazon uh it's called stolen focus
nice okay i'm not i'm
why you can't focus and how to think deeply again okay but my publishers literally don't i can't do an american accent
that's a [ __ ] word they don't actually smell like that i've told them like they're the they're actually like very nice new york
we won't talk about that but um what i would like to talk about is focus
what are you doing in that process where you're writing you're writing a new book now what are you doing are you out researching you're on the
internet you're reading other books you're speaking to people what are you doing so i spend a lot i spent a long time
researching my book so the book that i'm gonna the book that i'm writing now which is about i'm really not meant to talk about
because it's about a specific set of crimes that uh other people have written about i don't want to i don't want to set up the
journalists but um so i've been going there for 10 years and i've been getting to know the people
10 years and i've been deeply researching it for 10 years and there's a thing about
um when you're trying to understand a subject whether it's depression or las vegas or i'm writing a biography of name
chomsky that i've also been working on for a really long time and i probably won't write for another 10 years at least
there's a thing about such an important part of my books is people opening up to me
and people generally don't open up to you the first time they meet you you know they think who is this person why
does he want why do you want to ask me these very personal questions what's going on here generally people open up to you at the
end of the second year so for me it's so important it's incredible privilege and luxury that i get to do
this um for me what's so important is this very long span so i'll spend ten years
writing in in this moment since you know what i'm doing at the moment so i'm writing about vegas so there's a couple tommy and shea
who i knew over many years uh when he was murdered um and what i'm doing at
the moment is i've got all the audio i've ever recorded i've got hundreds of hours of audio with them i
paid to have it all transcribed and i'm just reading through just mounds and mounds of transcripts they keep all right
that's a scene that's a moment ah i forgot he said that you know this is that's the time this
happened to us that's the time we were you know in caesar's palace and then oh yeah and the guy so it's just going
through so at the moment i'm in the stage of what i think of as finding out what jigsaw pieces i've got
i'm not even assembling the jigsaw at the moment i'm just going over okay and you know there'll be i'll read 300 pages of transcripts and think oh we've
got nothing that time you know and then another time there are days when you're like oh they were so articulate that day or
this crazy thing happened so at the moment i'm assembling the jigsaw pieces and then
probably in two months i start to put the jigsaw pieces together so i'll i'll have some i'll like index it and
i'd be like all right okay so he talked about his childhood in hawaii
this time that time that okay then you put all that together and then you go oh okay this is this is where he described
gambling all right okay so you're trying to piece it all together slowly over time be to do that you've got to initially
immerse yourself in the actual place and go back a lot and build up a huge reservoir of just stuff and
the other thing and this was hard for me because i was a newspaper journalist for a long time where you know everything had to be
you know you've got 24 hours to write it you don't have time for dead ends you have to have a high tolerance for
dead ends so for every expert i've quoted to you i need to be 10 experts who were decent people and told me nothing i used in the book right there's
a great uh i know absolutely nothing about nature so this could be [ __ ] but there's a metaphor that thoreau the american
19th century american writer used where he said um apparently if you want to find a beehive and you don't know where the
beehive is if you stay in a place and wait for a bee to come along and catch it in a jar just keep it there
for a couple of minutes it will fly off in the direction of the hive so you let it go and you run and it the b is faster than you will
then you stand you follow it as far as you can and then you wait there you catch another bee let that one go
follow that and if you do that like 30 times you'll find the beehive right i don't that's true but that's what thoreau says um and i think of writing
as a bit like that it's like you you start with a subject it's really big
why are so many people depressed you look for people who've talked about an interesting way you go and talk to
all of them and then at the end of every interview you say who else should i talk to and you're going to talk to all of them and you say who else should i see and
you get this kind of growing concentric circle until sooner or later you find the person who like vincent felitti i interview i can't
tell you how many people are interviewed about childhood trauma and depression many of whom you know were nice people who told me nothing of
interest and i forget who it was it was a chain it was a chain through about five people who said someone said
you should talk to vincent felitti who's he went to san diego and you're like ah this is this is the thing right and and
some of that can be sometimes you're lucky i knew in chasing the scream i want to tell the story of a drug dealer
and i remember chino was the second drug dealer i interviewed him to be the guy in baltimore and i remember chino uh first thing he
said to me almost the very first thing was i was conceived with my mother who was a
crack addict was raped by my dad who was an nypd officer
and i was like tell me more and i never looked for another drug dealer i was like she knows my person right and china is
an unusually incredible human being in all sorts of ways he's no longer a drug dealer he's um he
he arrested no no he was arrested he was wreckers but he uh he now campaigns to end the war on drugs
and actually had shut down the horrific spafford the horrific youth detention center that he was detained in he's a
completely incredible person but um yeah so sometimes you're lucky and you don't have to do the long chain you just find
the right person very early and sometimes you spend five years finding the right person
but for me it's a the the fun is the the journey right the part of the fun
sometimes it's the fun of getting an answer vincent felitti you're like oh i now understand childhood drama and addiction
and depression but yes it's a long a long journey but i i i'm really lucky i just love you
sometimes you meet writers who go it's agony it's agony and i always want to go can't [ __ ] work in a call
center for a week and come back and tell me how difficult i'm not saying there aren't challenges in writing there are but anyone who is a
writer a professional writer whose attitude is not everyday thank
god i'm an atheist but metaphorically thank god i get to do this job i'm so lucky
that's got to be your default position it's a it's an incredible privilege to get to do it i know that sounds hashtag blessed and wanky but
like it really is like a great um to get to kind of investigate
complicated things and try to find answers and explain them to people who need to know and there's a lot of
people who need to know the answers to these questions it's a great thing but that's clearly why you've written so
many great books because you have a intrinsic
joy for your work because the lengths you've described there ten years five years three years the air
miles you must have done to write these books there's a whole part of greenland that has melted because there you go yeah i i i i'm not
going to [ __ ] i finish i wrote my book um over the space of a year and a half but
i wouldn't have done what you did i i and and that speaks to where my intrinsic
motivations and joy comes from i enjoyed the process of writing the book but the thoroughness that you put
into your books is just staggering to me because i don't share that intrinsic joy for the process which
you clearly do um but you have a lot of intrinsic joy for the other things that you yeah exactly important it's a shame it's just shame
to some degree i think part of my conditioning of growing up in the social media era where we get instant gratification
made the the thought of you know when i've got a instant instagram story i can do or this
five-year book project but that's why i really restrict i give you an example i won't say his name but there's someone a contemporary of mine a british writer
who's now based in the u.s who is one of the cleverest people i know a
totally brilliant i mean just politically intellectually just an outstanding
person and 10 years before if he'd been exactly the same person 10 years before
he would have written three brilliant books that changed how people think about the subjects and i've watched and it's been really
depressing as he just atrophies his energy tweeting
all the time and he's got a huge twitter following and i'm not saying that doesn't do any good it does sound good but and ever whenever
i see him i you know i mean uh in the cities and i would say he he you know we i see him and he's just adult and you know
there's a line um and ginsburg the poet said uh i saw the best minds of my generation consumed by
madness i feel like i saw the best minds of my generation consumed by twitter just [ __ ] i'm not saying there's no
value in it but atrophying that energy and i've been there right um years ago but
and so for me you're right a huge part of writing a book is deferred gratification i've gotta
interview people for this biography for example i'm writing noam chomsky he's an incredible person i interviewed someone two days ago
knowing i'm not gonna look at that transcript for seven years right and knowing
somewhere down the line i'm going to be glad i did that interview because that person is quite old and they'll be dead if i
wait seven years and you know and so you've got to be it's very hard to defer gratification if you
Social media
can get an immediate hit of but it's a very shallow hit right when i meet people and i quite feel
difference right sometimes people come up to me in the street and they go uh i follow you on instagram or whatever and there's and
it's a very shallow connection and sometimes people come up to me and they'll say i read your book
and they will even their physical demeanor is different it's like being approached by someone
who is a friend right and they will always have some not always but most of the time have some
much more detailed story i always feel like i feel like if someone follows you on twitter it's the equivalent
of shouting to you across a crowded bar whistling exactly whereas if you're lucky whistling i'm
slightly throwing the pint at you and glassing you but whereas if someone's read my book i feel like i've gone on holiday with them
right the level of kind of intimate because it takes a long time to read a book right deeply personal it's very and they've been in your head
right they've been injured childhood yeah they've been and they've and they've been on this if they remember it's a really big journey right so
there's an intimacy to that so i think it's it's worth it comes back to what you're saying
about porn right you could spend your whole life sitting at home wanking over porn right i'm not against porn right i look
at it myself but sometimes but we all know the hard work of having a relationship
is ultimately going to be more satisfying than your whole life one can overpower right speak for yourself exactly okay
very
and i feel like a lot of life is on that principle right like of course you can to me the people i
know i mean i know who look who are tweeting all the time and i know a lot of people with really big twitter followings
it's not just that they partly it's their atrophying their lives on [ __ ] also it makes them really
[ __ ] unhappy i know someone i won't say who but someone who's got a very big twitter following
who's got an ex it's a bit like our instagram inspired so we're talking about before huge instagram photos sort of huge
twitter following bumped into in the street a good few years ago now again like miserable as [ __ ]
right and made more miserable by i mean i think about someone i know this is not a famous person someone i know who
uses a uses a lot of meth and is on twitter all the time and
genuinely if you said to me should this individual quit twitter or meth first i would say quit twitter it's
worse for him right i don't mean that as a glib joke not that meth is so great but it it
it just has such a negative effect on people the thing i dislike most about it is
for me um [Music] almost everything about being an
effective person in the world is about being sincere and open-hearted
you know with humor and comedy and all that stuff but you want to be sincere and open-ended and what i don't
like about church and i think again it's one things i feel happening to me as i look at it is the voice of twitter the kind of
generic voice is you are sarcastic you're cold
you're one-upmanship a one-upmanship all of these things that are antithetical to
just a good life right if you want to succeed on if you want to win at twitter
and i've seen this happen to so many people i know um how do you do it be sassy be nasty
be maximally judgmental there's no tweets and going oh this person's screwed up but we all screw up sometimes let's you know
let's forgive the person to move on there's no tweets in that all the tweets are in kill the person destroy them escalating outrage because
of the algorithms because the way they work um binary exactly just
it's not a forum it's a forum that promotes unkindness and aggressive certainty when
almost everything in life that's meaningful comes from kindness doubt listening to people also
encourages people to respond to different to me the worst possible way to go through life
is to inc and again this is a big lesson for me i think about chasing the screams person
is a good example i can say worst way to go through life is to meet people who are different to you
and say that they're terrible and condemn them right to me that almost all the pleasure
in life is encountering people encountering people who are different and listening to them and think oh this person's different to me that's really
interesting i think about someone when people i most admire in the world is a woman called christina dent
who read chasing the screams which is why she got in touch with me so christina is an evangelical christian
in mississippi who's a republican right pretty different to me i'm a gay atheist who
hates republicans right and christina um so christina
is very opposed to abortion and she put her money where her mouth is she believes that if you're going to say
that women shouldn't have abortions you've got to help them look after the children that are then produced so she fosters a lot of um children
in mississippi and if you foster children in mississippi you know most of the kids who get taken away from their parents
their parents have addiction problems so christina gets to know lots of women with addiction problems the mothers are
the kids she's fostering and because christine is a fundamentally kind and good person
she's just like she starts thinking why did no one help these mothers years ago why are they criminalized why
are they put in prison and denied access to public housing and all of these things someone should have
helped them so she starts learning a lot about drug policy one of the ways was through reading my book chasing the screen and
she set up a group called end it for good that is evangelical christians in mississippi who are campaigning to end the drug war
right and i got to know christina well she's an amazing person and i think if i
had ever interacted with christina on twitter if i got to know her through twitter we would hate each other right we would
look like diametrically opposed people in fact she's a friend of mine i love
her she's a fundament i mean really a deeply admirable person right
often that that kind of connection can't happen through
anger-fueled algorithms it can only happen in fact angerfield algorithms will destroy those
connections right and so i used to remember what was it that happened
something happened with theresa may who i'm sure you can guess i was not politically sympathetic to
and i was about to tweet something nasty about her and i knew it would do well on twitter
i'm trying to remember what this was it wasn't when she resigned it was before that i was about to tweet it and i just thought i don't want to be part of this
[ __ ] machine do i part this even someone who deserves to be criticized as i believe you know powerful all powerful people deserve to
have criticism and i think theresa may deserved a lot of criticism because i disagree with a lot of things she did but she thought what is this adding to
the world other than more spite and more anger and more cruelty there are ways to oppose harmful things
that are not cruel and angry and and i just see so many people that i've known for years
you know senior media people who i just feel have been poisoned by these ways of interaction it's made them
cruel and i don't see any superiority i was crawl when i was heavily using these sites it's made them
cruel and mean and petty and and and worst of all i'm persuasive yeah
you know when i see people because i think i won't name the person but i think if someone is one of the most
followed uh political people on twitter in britain boris johnson no no no no uh
kirsten i'm not gonna go through it but not a politician but someone who's a publicly political person who i knew
god 15 years ago who was a thoughtful interesting person when i met
them and is now just cuddled with uh anger and
when i met this person you could have sat them down with any ordinary british person they would talk about politics and they
would have thought about what he said you know they wouldn't always have agreed but it would have been thoughtful now
he could talk to maybe five percent of the british population who would fire up to share the anger he has and 95 just be
like what is this this is just so aggressive and hyperbolic and over the
top and i don't blame this individual it's not his fault you've got a step away from these things
you what i don't think you can do is be in the middle of it be looking at it all the time
and not be made crude or meaner by it i just don't think you can i do think we can change the algorithms in ways that
would mean that we wouldn't have to be like that but we're a long way off that right so for me
if someone's listening to this now and i had to ask you the very binary question
should they delete their twitter instagram or not in the so we're always encouraged
to think in these d and it's perfectly good question but we're always encouraged to think in these deeply individualistic
ways right it's a bit like think about global warming biggest crisis in the world terrible disaster right um and we're
always encouraged to think uh global warming's so bad should i personally
recycle more should i personally buy this and not that and the truth is your individual consumer choices make no [ __ ]
difference to global warming what you have no virtually no power as a consumer what you have is a huge amount of power
as a citizen right we've got to if we band together as citizens enough of us and demand that
everyone has to do certain things that are necessary to stop to to deal with the climate crisis then
you have power and agency you personally tweaking your individual behavior i mean don't do grossly harmful
things and i feel we mentioned my own flying that's obviously a harmful thing i i never fly just to go on holiday but i do fly a lot
to go to research my books and that is a a big burden but it's much more meaningful to focus on
collective activity so if people want to think about the harm that twitter does the heart that facebook does i would say go to the website at the center for humane
technology run by my friend tristana harris which is about putting pressure on the truth is my friend james williams who's
a former google engineer brilliant guy lives in moscow he always says talking about you know
should i individually delete these things it's like thinking the solution to air pollution is should i put on a gas mask
well all right if the air pollution is really bad in beijing you might want to put on a gas mask but a much better thing to do is to you
know as citizens demand we deal with the sources of air pollution right which can be dealt with
in a similar way deleting your twitter may well be a good thing to do i don't use i don't ever look at twitter
almost never i use go through buffer app but that's the equivalent of me putting
on a gas mask it gives me a very short-term personal uh protection but if i then go
out into a society where people are being made angrier more politically extreme
having their attention destroyed because they're all on this stuff me putting on my own [ __ ] gas mask it's worth doing i'm glad to protect
myself but that's not where we should start thinking about it right but if i'm a selfish bastard and i want to be happier
should i delete my instagram and my facebook and my twitter i must i don't give a [ __ ] about everybody else this is
me being you know just pretending um i just want to make sure that my life is more peaceful
less chance of depression less chance of anxiety should i delete twitter and facebook and instagram i
mean i personally would say you know i mean i have it because i'm a crudely because i
want to reach people with my messages um you know and there's a mixture of that
some of that is the kind of benevolent thing i think these things are important and people need to know about and some of that is a more junk values uh i want to sell my
books right but um i don't feel i could tell an individual
they have to make their own assessment what do they what do they get out of it maybe they're you know promoting their charity or whatever i don't know
that's all following kim kardashian i mean what i would say is know that it
comes with a huge cost now you only you can weigh is the benefit
worth this huge cost yeah and there's some people who for whom it will be right and there's many people for whom
it won't be but i would say the constant focus on individualism even if you're purely selfish
to me it's a bit like okay imagine we were having this conversation in 1937 and we're really worried about the rise
of the nazis yeah uh and people who worried about the rise of the nazis let's imagine they were
saying well i'm signing a pledge saying i personally will not invade poland right that's very nice i'm glad you're
not going to invade poland but someone's going to go and have to stop the people who are going to invade poland yeah yeah in a similar way
fine say i'm not going to participate in these hateful anger field agreements good good for you just like you shouldn't invade poland
but someone's going to have to stop the people who are polluting the society and [ __ ] us all up which doesn't mean shutting down facebook and twitter it means uh
changing their business model um which absolutely can be done i mean as james williams always says the
google engineer i was talking about um the acts existed for more i'm gonna get this wrong the
axe existed for more than a hundred thousand years before anyone thought to put a handle on it um the internet has existed for less
than 10 000 days sure but we can change these things if we want to it comes back to so many things we're
talking about people need to know that they have power you are so much
more powerful than you think as a citizen incredible changes can happen
when enough people persuade the people around them right and and do it in a spirit of love and compassion
i think that's the perfect way to end this conversation hooray optimism exactly well and it's not even
like a kind of airy theory at all let's be honest it's true it's very practical margaret mead the anthropologist said
never doubt that a small group of committed citizens can change the world it's the only thing that ever has it reminds me of um
watching martin luther king's last speech where he said to this huge black congregation on this stage he said um he was telling
he said i'm like you know will you guys get there you guys get to the mountaintop he goes i don't get there with you
but you guys get there and at that time you never would have imagined that america could make the progress it's made to as you
said to the point where it's got a black president now and when he said those words it sounded like you know wishful thinking or whatever
but obviously the world um to some degree you know last couple
years haven't been the best you know example of that but we got there well progress is possible there's obviously still a long way to go
on as you know much better and i don't want racism and all sorts of things but huge amount of progress is possible and
we must never we've got to never discount the progress that's been made because that's very disempowering actually you know i remember uh you know
even just things as simple as of course we've got a huge way to go on gender but i think about my grandmother's right
that's not some distant past i know my grandmothers i loved my grandmothers i knew them well obviously um
when they were the age i am now my grandmothers were not allowed to have bank accounts in their own names
my swiss grandmother um wasn't allowed to have a job outside the home without her husband's written permission he could legally beat
her he could legally rape her he didn't but he could in fact it was legal for men to rape their wives
everywhere in the world when my grandmothers were the age i am now there were no women leaders there were
no women leaders of companies there were no women leaders of countries um there were almost no women elected
representatives right this is not some distant past and i know we've got a lot and it's very aggravating for women to hear a man like
me mansplain this i get that um but and because especially because we've still got so much further to go but
you gotta always bear in mind the incredible progress that happened and how did that happen right
women didn't blow anything up they didn't you know uh tear the society down they they they
banded together and they fought for something better i mean my great my swiss grandmother didn't even have the vote when she was 42 years old right and my
scottish grandmother had a [ __ ] hard life right incredible transformations and changes are are
possible we need to seize the power that we have because we were talking before we live in a machine that's designed
to get us neglect to neglect what's important about life we also live in a machine that's designed to make us think we are not powerful
a machine that's designed to make us think we can't change things or the only mechanism to change things
is to change the way you shop right and there's some value in changing the way you shop but um
pick up the power you have right as citizens you have we have incredible power
we are all better off because of the power the previous generations have seized you know think about you know
i'm gay you're black think about what the lives just two generations back again black people were in this country
they were a lot grimmer than our lives right um so incredible changes are possible we
just need to fight for them thank you i always say thank you to my guest at the end of the podcast for
various reasons but obviously and i know it probably makes you feel uncomfortable because i just repeatedly blow smoke up your ass but
um the uh you know you can literally bless no no not with the cameras but the effort you
go to to put this work together is just like outstanding right and there's so much as
we've discussed there's so much like there's such a lack of patience and a superficial nature to the society we
live in and people want instant gratification but the delaying of the gratification and doing the hard work
i i just you know it's just a tremendous service that you're doing to our society at a time that needs it the
most and especially the topics in which you're sticking your finger into and poking to
understand our topics that are at the very heart of much of our sort of social problems and
um it also present much of the opportunities if we find the right answers so thank you you've taught me a ton
i can't wait for your new book right when people ask me at any point in my life they asked me to recommend a book i
always say lost connections because it was that transformative and um yeah um and what's your twitter handle all right
what's my snapchat my publishers give me this [ __ ] horrendous blurb please
knock it out but i meant to say if anyone wants to know where to get the audio book or the book then go to um for the depression book
www.thelostconnections.com because it turned out there was a [ __ ] band called lost connections
who knew and the uh um and the addiction book is chasing the
scream as in dot com uh and they on those websites you can find out where to follow me
everywhere except snapchat because i'm strongly opposed to so and your new book's coming soon
and soon yeah i can't wait [ __ ] me that's going to be amazing and people can uh also watch the film adaptation of chasing the screen
which i meant to plug the oscar nominated film adaptation uh which is called the united states versus billie holiday and is where do we
go in britain on sky cinema in the us on hulu and you should interview andrea who
played billy holliday who is beyond a goddess and a [ __ ] incredible person
lure her i'll give you an intro she's she was nominated for the skirt did not get it i am the true victim of covered because
i would have been in the oscars as one of the producers and i was gutted that didn't happen anyway
plenty of time there for you for that to happen exactly no one suffered in covey mode
thank you so much anne cheers thanks so much i really appreciate it

Transcription:

Intro
ben fogel ben relentlessly pursues adventure risk and challenge but this doesn't come
from a place of strength and courage it comes from the opposite this if you
think you're gonna fail you're gonna fail you just have to have this positive attitude and it was only actually working with
olympians that i've done now when i climbed everest i realized you need this confidence verging on arrogance that i
will get to the top of this mountain three weeks before he was due to be born naturally and we lost our third child
and it was an awful awful experience that affected us profoundly i became really
introverted i'd go to events and i'd find myself going to the loo and just sitting sitting in the little cubicle for the
duration of the whole event big mistake we got death threats and worse
i i shouldn't have shared this idea in a social um media platform
but i was amazed at the vile vitriolic abuse
[Music]
ben fogel he's a tv presenter broadcaster and author he's climbed mount everest he's trekked
across antarctica and he's rode across the atlantic ocean ben relentlessly pursues adventure risk
and challenge but this doesn't come from a place of strength and courage it comes from the opposite
from a place that you would probably never expect this was such a diverse conversation we covered
so much and so many things ben has been on the most incredible journey tearing up the script and
ignoring the standard society sets for all of us on this never-ending continuous journey of rebuilding himself
as he says in his own words and that journey has been inspired by one simple idea
his desire to take back control of his own personal narrative something he believes
we've all lost control of and this podcast is going to take you on a journey from the need to a positive
attitude to resisting your labels to taking leaps to rediscovering the importance of simplicity in your life that ben has learned from
living in the wilderness and to answering the question that we all seek to answer pretty much every day of
our lives which is how to be happier and how to be more fulfilled so without
further ado i'm stephen bartlett and this is the diary of a ceo i hope nobody's listening
but if you are then please keep this to yourself [Music]
ben uh as i read through your story your books your interviews and i i
remember remember watching uh a youtube documentary of you sailing across the atlantic many years ago
um obviously the most sort of striking distinctive standout thing about the way that you've
chosen to live your life over the last couple of decades is your seemingly
insatiable appetite for adventure risk challenge uh extreme adventure
as it relates to everest and things like that where did that come from i think it's do you know it's not
necessarily an absolute thirst for adventure i think it's about kind of
Where does your thirst for challenge come from?
finding the real me see if i go if i go right back as a child i was
so shy i had no confidence i failed all my exams i was hopeless at sport and actually i think
it i think all of the things that i've done since have been about like rebuilding
and it sounds it sounds a weird way to describe it but it's not just i'm not an adrenaline junkie
there's there's this assumption that maybe you know that that would be how to
describe myself but it's not that at all actually those are the things i do are really really slow
you know like rowing across the atlantic took best part of two months walking across antarctica took many many
months climbing everest took many months so actually if if it was jumping off a mountain base jumping or
going uh on a motorbike or even a mountain bike down a steep slope
i hate all that it's too fast i quite like this slow movement but i'm quite good at
long endurance events and all of those have been about rebuilding my confidence and what took
your confidence or why didn't you have confidence i think i think it's the fact that i was
i was hopeless academically for many different reasons undiagnosed dyslexia um a kind of
a slight mistake maybe not on my parents part but they my father's canadian he wanted me to be
bilingual so i was sent to a french school and i just i just i just didn't
i couldn't do the french school the french system and with all apologies to any french watching or listening to this it's just
quite a hard system the french one and and and it was quite it was quite um strict
and i'm just i as a child i just i was surrounded by dogs dad was a vet mum was an actress it was all quite a
liberal my actual childhood at home was quite liberal full of actors um lots of drink
lots of animals around it was i suppose crazy but normal for me but then in this french system it was
very rigid and and it meant that i didn't learn any french and my english went backwards
so when i went back into the system i was way behind and it and the result was the combination of
that and dyslexia just meant i was hopeless i could barely write and i and i failed all my exams and i was
surrounded by people who were better than me at everything everyone everyone seemed to be more handsome when it c
if it was the boys they had more luck with the girls they were better at playing um sports because they could actually
kick football unlike me that have i have two left legs and and they were good at um academics
and when it came to the exams they just they didn't even you know they could be up all night watching stuff and then the
next day turn up for the exam whereas i was just i was almost making myself vomit i was so nervous about the exams because i
knew i was gonna fail and this is this is the first thing i convinced myself i'd fail
and of course i ended up failing because what i've discovered since is that so much of what we do and
what we endure and how we intest ourselves is here in the mind and if you go in with a negative attitude which
i had then it's self-fulfilling and and the result was hopeless is
everything and it just stripped me of my confidence i i had you know i just i didn't
believe in myself and that that went right through you know probably into my 30s if i'm to
be really honest i think that was always lingering over me this little voice just telling me that i was uh that i wasn't good enough
at what i did and did that voice come from your own assessment of yourself or was
was there external forces bullying or your parents or no my parents were amazing you know
my parents have i don't think they could have done more for me than they did i think it was
no i think it was all internal if i'm to be honest i think there's a pres i think there was
an external pressure to conform because if you think about how
if you take the schooling model in the education model it is kind of about conforming because exams
are all about getting the the correct grades we're we're learning to
a specific model that has been um set by the government and and it's it's sort
of painting by numbers when it when you think about education and if you don't hit those targets then then you've
effectively failed the system and for me you can hear from my accent you know i'm i'm posh i went to a
private school mum and dad worked really hard to send me to a private school and actually there was a great guilt
that the fact that they had worked so hard to be able to afford to send me there and yet i still failed
so i think actually a lot of that voice was internal and actually i wish if i could go back
in time i wish i could kind of shake my shoulder shake a young me on the shoulders and go
just don't don't overthink things just chill out a little bit
Overthinking & building confidence
and we were you a chronic overthinker i was and i still am absolutely i still overthink things if i'm to be honest i
i i to work in the medium that i work in is a little bit strange because i don't
really belong in this medium when i say this medium you know front of house as a presenter because
i've got a really thin skin and i overthink everything so when i read something negative whether that's on
social media whether that's a newspaper review whether that's a journalist that has written something um which i don't like
um or which doesn't seem true i take it really personally which is
kind of really strange because i should have i should have been able to overcome that after 20 years and i'm almost there
stephen i'm almost there but one of the reasons i'm happy to talk about it is because i know so i'm i know i'm not
alone i know there are many many people out there who are high achievers who've done brilliant things in life
but are still burdened with their own voice of doubt and through all of these challenges i've
done i've been able to really build that confidence and i'm i'd say i'm a few hundred meters from the summit
now of peak confidence and i can't wait until i'm there i hope i do i i hope i reach that point
what is it about those challenges and this sort of slow monotonous nature of those challenges or just the challenges themselves or challenge
as a you know as a as a construct itself that helped you to build confidence because i'm
one of the most frequent questions i'm asked in the comments section of this podcast or on instagram or anywhere else
is um how do i build my confidence and i think we live in a culture especially on instagram where it
seems like everyone else is super confident and chasing their dreams and we we never get to hear the whispers
of their self-doubt so it might feel like we're the only ones so i guess my question is
how how did those challenges build your confidence
it happened by accident so that's the first thing to say i didn't chase it thinking this is going to help
it was like a slow series of blocks that were built so it started when i failed my a-levels and
i went off traveling i went to costa rica a place that i know you love and i went to university out there
and i think it was spending time in a different culture in a different culture country with a
different culture different language different religion away from home away from mum and dad
and and first of all i had to kind of think on my own i couldn't defer to other people
up until that point i'd always kind of dad what do you what do you think mum what do you should i do you know i i i didn't trust
my own judgment so first of all that was gone so i had to stand or fall on my own decisions and
then secondly just the immersion in this exciting new place was just i mean it just
it it was the most exciting year i've ever had if i'm to be really honest and i decided then that that that's what
i wanted from life i didn't want to conform by getting you know i i didn't want the degree
the the um the job the mortgage the sitting in an office i didn't want to go down that
conventional route that that is why because i didn't
i didn't feel like a conformist i did i didn't want to be a sheep i wanted to be the shepherd i didn't want
to just conform to the expectations of what society deems is successful why because i'm just making sure you're
not playing you're not you're not doing it just for the sake of devil's advocate just to go against no not at all i'm not i'm actually not a
contrarian i'm not someone who says left just because the other person has said right i'm really not a concern if
anything for someone who doesn't like criticism i should probably stand back and therefore i should sit on the fence and
become the sheep but i i'm i'm you're gonna discover as we chat i'm a
ball of contradictions yeah so so nothing kind of makes sense um i just know
what i have learnt over the years but for me conformity maybe i was stripped of that
just by the fact that i couldn't conform when it came to exams so i couldn't conform to what the
what the system wanted me to conform to and therefore i wasn't going to conform when it came to other things i wear
shorts all year round i'm not you know i stopped wearing a suit ages ago i kind of
slowly as my confidence has build has built i've found myself straying even further
from conformity i think i'm going to end up one of those ridiculous kind of english eccentrics wearing a bow tie
Conforming
you know you know the one like walking around with a cat stroking it because i kind of that that's how there
is this kind of there's an enemy that i have never i still haven't really fully found but i
knew i wouldn't find that person sitting in an office on a computer
in a job that society expected me to take just so that i could follow the
narrative and the narrative being as i've kind of explained you know getting a good job that you can
then um get a promotion you get the the good wage you might get a bonus
you can buy your house you can get your car you marry you get the dog you have the children and then you
end up retiring and then you do all the things you want to do and here's the key because is it the journey or the
destination so for me it's 100 the journey yeah yeah so many people don't see that but you
should but this is where you and i have quite a lot in common okay we're maybe what we're doing now in life is
very very different but the fact that you will suddenly just wake up one day and go
yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna resign from yeah honestly it sounds everything you're saying like i want to make this about
you but i feel like i've been on the same journey as you're saying with the you know one day you might have the dog and whatever which is just trying to get
closer and closer to who i actually am and um trying to find the courage the strength to
um not allow society to write to tell me what my how my story has to
be yeah so who's and this is the thing isn't it whose story is it yes is it yours or someone else's of
course it's someone else's story and it was written at another time in another age if we're talking about marriage and these
constructs in our society for someone else in the circumstances they lived in and they probably weren't happy anyway
so to think that that same narrative and storyline would be would equal happiness in stephen bartlett's life in 2021
is uh you know probably patently false like but don't you find this strange i'm not
going to don't i'm not going to tell the whole thing although i'd be quite happy to because i think you're a fascinating person but it is strange isn't it that archer i
don't think you have you know yet okay so so i've got two young children aged 10 and 11. so
obviously i'm really aware of the system that they're now in that failed me and i'm really nervous about
that fortunately i married someone who's really intelligent and has the thickest skin you'll ever meet on anyone in the world so actually
my children are pretty resilient much more than i was and i owe all that to my wife but
i digress if you think about it it's still a strange thing that children are expected from the age of i
don't know four or five to go off to nursery and then to school where they're in a classroom with four
walls it might have a window if you're lucky you've got some teachers that may or may not be really invested in their job i
don't want that to sound disparaging to all teachers because i know a lot of teachers put a lot of hard work in
but it's still a gamble as to whether you're going to get those that are just doing it for the job or those that are really passionate and driven and then
it's just about ticking those boxes isn't it get the exam grades that the government have set so that
they can then go look hurrah we're doing a great system yeah gcse grades are all up
a level grades are all up it's all looking great look at the number of people going to university and i'm like hang on
what is this expectation that everyone should go to second to further education to university it's
not i get people calling me or emailing me getting in touch with me on social media saying how could do you
think i should do a degree in filmmaking and in broadcast at
university i'm like no get an apprenticeship job if i could do that i'd take on apprenticeships
no work your way get experience and uh and and it just i find it really
odd that in 2021 we haven't changed this is a model yeah i
i i did a tv show called um called secret secret teacher with channel 4. and i was i had the same bewilderment
about the education system and what how it was incentivized for grades and league tables and not based on the child's like intrinsic
passions and who they want to become because obviously for me i was running multiple businesses in the school all the school trips had
done all the vending machine deals so our school made money from the vending machines and yet i was kicked out because i wouldn't go to health and social care
and push a plastic baby around the school like i wasn't interested in that so like the school viewed me as lazy but
really if you think about it the school was lazy for not taking the time to understand who i was at that age but in filming that show i
learned something very valuable about how the whole system works so i went inside the school got to sit down with the head teacher and i was like
how does this system work and he said um the better the grades we get the more students come to the school and
we get paid per student so he gets uh let's say four thousand pounds from the government per
student that they have so his whole incentive is grades grades grades grades and it's just like
a business they have customers and the more customers they get the more money they make and then as it as you got the
you know the the institutional lad or whatever universities are the same the more they send to university the better their
their rankings if their rankings are good more parents will choose that school it's a business and it's incentivized by
money at the heart of it and if at some point you could take the money out of the system um then you'd be able to fix it but that poor head
teacher he was the ceo and he said i won't be able to buy pencils if we have a hundred less students come next year
so we better be on that league table um and then i realized what was what was wrong with it you know these are good
meaning people incentivized badly yeah um and it's ha and it's how we change the system though
you know because that's this is where i could turn the tables on you and go listen you've done these incredible um startups you've been incredibly
successful and i i know there have been a couple of entrepreneurs who have attempted dabbled
in the school uh model and how do you do it it's kind of obvious to me one of the problems is
that there's so many children how do you make it financially viable to give everyone
access to um you know a a a fair education for them
and to to have bespoke systems for every single pupil cost a lot of money but i in the same
way as i'm talking about apprenticeships you know i'm a keen advocate of like a national service not a military one
but i think everyone aged 18 should go off and spend a month with the nhs with the fire
service with the police service um just volunteering to see what maybe working in the school system
and and if you imagine now that if if all parents got invested in the school
and volunteered to go in and help with the classes and help paying for different things i
just think our education our education system could be in a different place i completely agree yeah i think it's um
i've i i did say when i left social chain that the challenge i'd take on would be the education system so who knows let's see but uh i i came
to learn that it's like anchored in place from all angles by parents who believe that success for them as a
parent means their kid going to university so my mum was disowned me because it made her look bad that i left the
system then you haven't but culturally for lots of people it is still really really really important my mother
is african so yeah she left school at seven years old and all of my friends who live
in various countries in africa or or in latin america it is or india it's still to to have
further education and by the way obviously to have further education for vocational work like being a doctor or an engineer
you know we we really rely on on all of that but i think we have to change our attitudes
because can you imagine stephen this is what i find really shocking i i work with people now
who are um working on production who've left university with 40 grand of death and they're now and
they're scrabbling to pay that back and get a job in the world that they want to work in in this
post-pandemic or middle of pandemic um world that we're in right now i mean that cannot be a good way to
start your life kind of in debt is that not part of the system and it's so unnecessary i mean you what you spoke to everyone
about internships for me is is the answer getting experience right however that might be
and at my company we employed 700 people at the time that i left and i couldn't tell you who had a
university education or not it just it was such a low down on the list of things that actually mattered number one
is obviously what are they capable of in terms of experience um and then the piece of paper i did i didn't have a
[ __ ] clue who had gone where or what they'd studied because it just doesn't matter in reality
I don't know if I'll ever find who I really am
um but anyway i wanted to ask you get back to one of the points you said earlier you said um you don't think you'll ever you're not
sure if you'll ever find out who you really are could you expand on that what do you mean well i think we're all
the the product i suppose of our experiences and who we are
and and i think if you look at if you look at life as this journey and not just a
destination then we're constantly evolving and changing and and growing and i think however much you
try to be yourself you you become a bit chameleon-like and and
you end up you end up kind of the lines between who you are and
what everything else is does begin to blur a little bit so the way i look at it you know i
started off as this deeply unconfident shy child that then kind of
morphed into you know how i started when i was on one of the first reality shows which was
called castaway i was sent to live on an island for a year and then i kind of became this posh real reality show
contestant and then i started working in daytime tv and i became a daytime tv presenter and
then i kind of became a broadcaster and and you're i see it all the time you
become stereotyped so you whenever when whenever your name is is written it will say
you know it will have either an amount that you made or it will have the company that you
started but is that really is that really you so so if you or i went on strictly come dancing now by the
way that would be changed instantly and it would then be stephen from strictly come dancing or ben because you're only
you're as you're remembered for the last big thing and that constantly changes but it then
means it's quite hard to leap away from that so if you're suddenly going to decide actually i'm going to become a
an mp now people be like well hang on no no that's not the narrative and what
happens i i think what happens is you you become blinded by people going i'm just not
really sure this is right because that's not that's not really who you are that's not part of the narrative that
i think you were going down for the book that you're writing of your life and i don't mean the physical book but just the
metaphorical one so speaking of books yes in my book i have a chapter called resisting your labels
and it's exactly this exactly what you said so i refer to it as your label and i say that your your label comes
with a set of instructions implicit instructions about how you have to behave going forward so my labels would be
i don't know black social media ceo and with that comes a set of instructions as to how i'm expected to
pave in the future and that can be imprisoning right so one the reason i wrote that in the chapter is because leaving social change i have
that same like existential moment where you're like okay so who the [ __ ] am i you know and society's going
you'll be safest if you just [ __ ] carry on with the social media ceo thing yeah but at my heart i'm like no i'm i
no one was born with a passion for something that didn't exist when i was born social media i'm a guy with a bunch of interests
music and creating stuff and curiosity and how do i go back to those fundamentals for my life and not the
label yeah well i'm i'm slightly obsessed with the label because society loves to label us and uh and and
it's and you'll never get away from that but you i say you would never get away from it
it will always be there in the context of social media and the the print press and and
um broadcast journalism but you can i have tried to challenge the status quo
a number of times with different things that i have done in terms of challenges um and other things the the
problem is that i did so many of those challenges to get away from just the daytime tv presenter
or just the reality show person that then i became the adventurer who does those things and the expectations
you know whenever when i climbed everest two years ago part part of the disappointment was
people going oh yeah of course you'll do it of course you'll get up but that's what you do yeah of course you'll get up the
mountain i'm like it's not quite as simple as that that's you know i'm not a natural mountaineer
you know this is the boy who was hopeless at sport it's still a tremendous challenge but i i love
i love just testing failure because i'm deeply fearful of failure
because of having so much of it in in my early childhood you know just to to back up
some of the data i've already given you about how hopeless i was as a child you know i ended up going to about five different schools i actually went to
three different universities in the end um uh took my driving test eight times
so it kind of it failure became a really a word that i was really
fearful of and and as i get older i find myself actually
kind of um i find myself confronting failure on purpose as much
as i can to to try and become less fearful of it
i think you have to confront your demons believers or not and and failure so if we go back
to the challenges for example um because they're one of the things that kind of have really defined me you know
i somehow managed to row across the atlantic ocean i should have i should have quit there
really you know 49 days in a little boat you know for for those who never saw it it was a 20-foot rowing boat you know a
couple of oars me and an olympic rower and it's pretty dangerous out there it's the middle of
the atlantic ocean you've got waves that are 30 feet tall where our boat got capsized we nearly drowned we hit you know
it was the most amazing adventure but also pretty scary and quite dangerous and i did that and reaching the other
end of that is still probably the biggest achievement of my life and you know a lot of my wife sometimes says why do you
not just quit there because quit while you're ahead same i could say to you come on you've you did this amazing tech
startup uh and i think a lot of people would think that you've made all this money just sit and enjoy it but but that's not
but then you're just taking life like the destination and you're thinking that well there you are so money is everything and
and money i think money is a really fascinating thing for me because i am not money motivated i know people
may go well you can only say that when you've made enough money to not be motivated by money and they have a point money buys
security money gives you the opportunity to do some of these big challenges i'm a i told you there's lots of
contradictions here um and i'm aware of all of those things but we also live in a world by where success
is defined by your monetary value so when i you know if i google you
and i look you up every single one has a sum of money of various values right next to you so it's
Monetary value
next to your buyer so listen by the way i think it's something you should be really proud of if you have if you have managed to make that
that much money i think that is that is your everest that is testament to
dreams that lots of people have but i think we need to change this notion that being wealthy is a sign of success in
life if you if you look at the model that jacinda adam was trying to do in in new zealand it was to change gross
national um product to to change what the country's values are by including the happiness
index and the kindness index and how what what a good nation you are and how healthy you are
and your obesity levels you bring into all of those things because for me as a parent
i want my children to have the security of having enough money to put food on their plate and a roof over their heads but
whether they make huge amounts of money is kind of irrelevant as long as
they are good rounded kind happy individuals yeah i think you've
never known that this is actually why my book is called happy sexy millionaire because when i was 18 all i wanted in life was
to be as it says in the front page of my diary range rover sport a million pounds before i was 25
because i was it's the same similar to what you've described the thing that had invalidated me as a child was being the only poor family
in a middle class area and never having anything no birthdays no christmases and everyone on holiday so obviously that was my insecurity and
i chased it as an adult and then i got it and then it you know but by the way just
to reiterate i i think to have a goal like that is so important whatever your goal
is i'm just saying i think to to have the the pure monetary goal
maybe isn't necessarily for for everyone now for children shouldn't necessarily be the priority it
can be a it can be a byproduct of being successful you know when i'm sure you get the same thing when when i go and give talks in
schools and i go say what does everyone want to be when they're older you know i get a large number who just want to be
famous and and i always say to them that's it's all very well i i get why you want to be famous but there needs to be
substance to that fame so you need to be famous because you have succeeded in business because you're a great footballer because you're
a great actor or actress and uh and and then as a byproduct of all of that you can
become a great millionaire and and um and and sort of
reach those dreams as well yeah so again exactly what you've just said there i think there's a the distinction for me
is like whether the goal was intrinsically or extrinsically motivated and the kid there that says he wants to
be famous is pure is actually saying i would like people to like me i want admiration my goals as when i was younger were
clearly i want to fit in i wrote millionaire but what i meant was i'm insecure and i want to fit in
and obviously upon reaching that goal because it wasn't ever intrinsic it wasn't ever something that i wanted inside of me
it was just to try and satisfy the approval of others it felt like nothing one of the things that's integral to
performing at the highest level is nutrition it's something that i i i guess i took a a long time to
finally believe but that is why having hewlett's response for this podcast is such a privilege
because there was a time in my life especially when i was early in my business career where i wasn't getting the vitamins the minerals and i wasn't having a sort of
nutritionally complete diet i was if you look at some of my old photos i was definitely lacking protein as well
and a lot of that maybe it was an excuse was because i was um i was busy and
when i discovered huel when a guy called mike walt passed me in the office wearing a heel t-shirt and shaking a little bottle and
you know upon my curiosity of asking what was in that and why he was drinking it it really really did change my life it's
almost religious my love for your but for good reason and if you haven't checked it out i would um i would employ to check it out
because it's only going to do good in your life when you asked asked me earlier about whether i believe the journey or the
destination i just don't think the destination exists every time you get there it moves off into the distance like a mirage
yeah because as soon as you've got that car you'll want the better car as soon as you've got the house you'll want the house in the south of france
so we're constantly changing our goal posts because we we i think it's human nature you know the
grass is always greener i think of all the sayings i really do think that is the one we
all look at other people and and social media is a fascinating medium now isn't it because effectively
social media one of the reasons i think it's having such a negative impact and when i say social media you know the the
kind of twitter instagram why i think it can have a lot of negative impacts on people is because
it's it's almost it makes people feel jealous because people are projecting uh it's i don't want to use the word
fakery but it's it is an edited world isn't it however whatever photo you do it's a
it's a tiny second of your life that you've thought about how you're going to compose that photograph or the image that you want to project
how you're living and uh and i think that is all built on
this notion of of wanting what other people have but it's even worse because then you get ranked on it yeah likes comments yeah
and then and then you know you post you post a certain photo and then the likes are down half and you think oh my god i'm [ __ ] ugly
yeah you think the world can i put my hand up
and honesty i i feel the same i i i'm you know someone who's 47 you know i
should i should know better now but i still look at uh my instagram accounts and and if
there aren't so many likes or if there's one negative comment amongst hundreds of really positive ones
i just look at at the either the low figure or the the negative comment because i think it's human nature that we're kind of
we're drawn to this this sort of um this notion of competition
and is life a competition i i i kind of wrote about this at length and um i've realized that
value is um obviously just relative so the analogy i get i gave was that
i was really happy with my nokia 3310 but in a world of iphones i'm devastated to own a nokia 3310 it's
the same [ __ ] phone and they have these um really remarkable studies that show
how we attribute value value to things including ourselves where they'll put like three stakes on a menu
and um if there's a really expensive stake in a really cheap one everyone picks the middle one
three tvs on a shelf people pick the middle tv because they think that one's too expensive that one's a piece of [ __ ]
and they're just using the context are you in my head now because this is exactly what i would this is yeah yeah yeah exactly so and
i might but it's just we a trip we attain value by the context we see something in
if you remove the other two tvs this now becomes the best tv in the world and it's the same with us i said you know in a world where there's no other
humans i am the prettiest richest most successful person on earth but you put a couple
and this is the crazy thing about social media you're comparing yourself to fake like a fake context and
and you you can never win right because you get to see your bts you're behind the scenes you look at them you think i got spots
and i'm fat what's that pouch down there and no one else has got that so it's a losing game and and so i
implore people but you know because i work for 10 years in this [ __ ] game so i implore people just to make their context way healthier and real
um and for me that means that i meet 95 percent of the people i follow i have like if i go on my instagram now
there'll be 15 people and five of them are in this room do you know what i mean because i just want to play this game
and even though i'm aware of it my lazy ceo brain has been wired
from the for 10 000 years to make snap judgments snap judgments to keep me alive i can't
Social media and Trolling
stop it you know so i just have to be conscious about the way i use these tools
yeah i mean i think it's a it's a fascinating world and again as a father with young kids who are terrifying
embarking into that world i i i'm struggling to find the tools
to arm them for the battle ahead yeah and i'm aware that they can be fantastically
useful that you know that it's amazing the the interactions that you can get you know is it's it's how i'm here
today i wouldn't be here if it wasn't for uh social media chatting to you now so i i'm aware of
the beauty of being able to share things it's just how we get away from
kind of the the fakery if if that is the term to use and and the abuse you were talking about
a second ago negative comment one negative comment can throw you off mm-hmm the kind of the the whole world of
trolling fascinates me because deep down i just know that those people that write
the nasty comments sometimes aren't even real sometimes they're just disgruntled and
it's probably no different to how life would be in a pub there would be some person in there that would go
muttering under their breath the problem is on social media it get it gets kind of brought to the surface
and for whatever reason i think we probably know newspapers love to then regurgitate what that
single individual spotty teenager in their bedroom has written uh as a as
validation they sort of validate it so i i had a funnily enough during the first lockdown
my daughter thought it would be nice to get the nation to sing happy birthday to the queen and
i realize there's lots of people who aren't monarchists i understand that we're in a country where not everyone agrees
on the same thing but i thought it was quite a nice sentiment and foolishly i decided to let her use
my twitter account to kind of ask people to do it big mistake we got death threats and
worse uh i mean the vile abuse to my nine-year-old daughter partly my fa
you know i shouldn't have allowed her to i shouldn't have shared this idea in a social
um media platform with a g with with my daughter i realized but i was amazed at the vile vitriolic
abuse and that was partly kind of enhanced by the press who jumped
on a few negative comments wrote about it and as soon as they had written about it
uh it went i mean it i had to give up twitter i actually um abandoned it and haven't i haven't
gone back to really crazy there's a lot of talk at the
moment about what social platforms can do for this type of behavior and i just
i always come back to the point of like i'm gonna tell a little bit of a story here so when i worked in silicon valley for a
little while for about a year when i was 20 after i left my first company and i got to see behind one of the big
social platforms that was emerging at the time and it taught me something about humans because someone in the daytime who was a
very civilized school teacher just being completely honest would get his [ __ ] out at night
because of anonymity and what it taught me was that people good people are capable of pretty
alarming things if you allow them to cover their face and there's a piece of jealousy and
evilness and darkness in all of us um and anonymity allows you to be both yeah and so
until platforms don't allow people until we verify people who people are when they sign up
and there's no and there's no real and there's real world consequences of the behavior it's never going to stop yeah and i agree i agree it's the anonymity thing
so you know the number of people that say just get up just just ignore it and i do largely so i still
use instagram and occasionally you know the odd troll flares up and i do ignore it now
um occasionally you know i get a bit more stung than than other times but i think you know
it's symbolic of the world that we're we're living in right now and i think anonymity can be quite a dangerous thing
wokeness wokeness woke wokeness is fascinating
Wokness
wokeness is it's fascinating and it's really complex now especially as a
documentary maker i go off to to countries all around the world and and
i've been accused of of um gross xenophobia just because i go to these countries now
and maybe make a documentary about a local group of people who live there
it's seen by the extreme woke brigade as being as other ring people this is
the this is the woke term right now don't other people so by by taking a document i know it i mean
it is laughable but they're quite but they have quite a strong voice and and i've you know i've had to talk
about this on other people to other people is to make them feel like they aren't a part of
normal i mean this comes we've come full circle right now so other ringers to make people um kind of
feel like they don't like the specimens or something yes specimens basically so to
other so effectively going if you imagine you know going to a group
of indigenous native um uh people who live in the brazilian
amazon where once that was seen as you know anthropological study of how people
live and what they do now it's seen as sneering and laughing at people because
you're othering them and you're showing look look at them still hunting with spears and bows and arrows now this is the wokery brigade who
interpret it like that i interpret it as a great celebration because more often than not i kind of
been seeing how we should be living and how we should be um treating nature and the flora and
fauna around us rather than living in big cities where we're fantastically wasteful and we're
destroying the planet actually the the this kind of nomadic way of life or this very simple hand to
mouth way of life i i go and i i feel i feel huge admiration and i'm not laughing or
sneering but there are lots of people that interpret that form of television as that now i've just given you one form of
vocary right now and there's is so we all have to we have to think about everything we say
and everything we do and is that cultural i've just got a kilt i've been sent a kilt because
it's the big global climate conference in glasgow later this year i'm going to
be up there in scotland obviously the kilt is is the national dress and i was asked if i could wear a kilt
with a special environmental fabric so i've agreed to do that but i can already see when it comes to
that culturally that by the way i'm a quarter scottish as well but i'm not even going to try
that because it wouldn't it wouldn't get past the woke police because it's cultural appropriation i was going to say if you
went to the amazon jungle and you saw that tribe and you showed up with a spear and a skirt but you know if
so if you look at what bruce parry used to do where he would immerse himself and he would live there i don't know if you
remember bruce perry he would go and live there for there being with a a group of with a tribe somewhere
and he would adopt their native dress whether it was just a little you know whether it was a very simple
skirt whatever it was and he would live as they do i don't know if you could get away with that now
because it would be seen as a mix of cultural appropriation othering people um and it should be
we we should leave people to live as they do without trying to mimic it that's that
that's how it is interpreted by some people where is all of this wokeness going because i feel like it's gaining momentum
and i i worry about the trajectory i'm like it's not is it going to come back this way because it's been i feel like
society has swung in a work direction maybe because of social media it's kind of like reinforcing reinforcing all of
us on our echo chamber yeah that's perfect you're perfect that was good good you're bad bad that's bad he's bad get him but surely
you know this probably more than than i do that you have extreme wokery on one side
but then we have the extreme we've got kind of fascism and the complete opposite yeah on the
other side and that 4chan and yeah and that whole world is is equally
more obnoxious yeah the racism the xenophobia and then you've got walkery here and
it's just like everything else in life it's everything has gone like this so you're either in or you're
out you're up or you're down it's black or it's white it's there's no middle and for
everything i've just said to you about not wanting to be the sheep and wanting to be the shepherd i i'd quite like to just be a sheep amongst
quite a few others in a field kind of having a reasonable conversation it's very very hard to have
a sensible conversation now because people have gone to these extreme sides
it's probably easier for the newspapers to write stories and to highlight the workery than it is to do the fascism because
that's really ugly and and it's deeply offensive to so many people but we see it you know
we know it's on social media you see what's happening to footballers the racist abuse that they get and we do read about it but the wokery
for some reason is something we hear about even more and maybe it's used to try and counterbalance the really
ugly side of racism and xenophobia and and anti-semitism all these things that are equally
rising um and i don't know how we get back to this middle just being a sheep in a field
because i i you know i long for a good solid conversation i
i can't sit at a table now with people i don't know really really well and have a conversation about covert
because that's politicized i can't have a conversation about politics because that's that that went ages ago i
can't have a conversation about brexit i can't have a conversation about indie ref 2
i can't have a conversation about what's happening in northern ireland i can't really have a conversation about
international policy and by the way i have more interesting conversations and just says these i am actually quite fun sometimes but i
really like debate and i like hearing what other people have so when i travel to other countries
my favorite thing is chatting about their interpretation of what's going on and and uh and i really thrive on that but
we can't anymore because it's become too emotional people feel it's really personal to them
or they're too afraid to talk about it in the first place you talked at the start of this conversation about not wanting to be
imprisoned by society's conventions this is a form of imprisonment isn't it of course yeah and it and it and it
which is maybe one of the reasons why i still find myself drawn to far away places so the show that i do
new lives in the wild where i go to live with people who've dropped off the grid they've they've woken up one day and they've
decided i i don't want this life anymore sometimes they're millionaires sometimes they're just everyday folk who
have got bored of the nine to five job and they've gone to live in the jungles of bali in a little cabin in alaska
and uh and i really covet their lives i really admire their lives i'm really jealous of their lives because
they've simplified it we're living we make we've made our lives pretty complicated haven't we really if you think about it oh yeah
um and actually if you strip it back what do you really need in life will we you know you need shelter you need food
you need water some good company we've really realized that with the pandemic i think people have realized
that we're social we need to have friends and family around you need a smile on your face and that's
kind of it and everything else it's a distraction or it's an extra bonus
isn't it you know to to you know have a fine wine or whatever it is you like in life
but all these people that i've spent time visiting i've done this series for 10 years now and i've been to 100
places um all around the world that simplicity is is really attractive and they don't
worry themselves about those big topics i was just you know describing there
it's it's kind of unimportant to them what happens with brexit doesn't really matter for the person that's chosen to live on
a tiny little island up in norway who lives hand-to-mouth catching fish each day
and there's i i've i find it really kind of hypnotic and mesmerizing to spend time with people who have
stripped their lives back to the absolute bare essentials and the assumption is
that that they're really enduring and they're suffering and they're surviving but that's not always the case
sometimes it doesn't mean their lives are easy but almost all of them are happy almost all
of them have have abandoned the complexities that many of us are stepping around they don't have to deal
with walkery and trolls you know all these things are very first world problems although they're not actually they're
the the the developing or the lesser developed world i should say um i suffer from all of these um
these things as well i was on a uh to speak to the point you just met i was on a motorbike like a little crappy motorbike
in bali don't know two weeks ago and i'm just bombing down the street in the field
sunshine walk going through the little villages and i had this like real overwhelming sense that i'd lived my
life wrong and i got off the bike and said to my friend and it's so crazy and i don't think me and him will ever
forget this moment before i could say the words to him he went god isn't that what life's about
and it was just being on this bike having no problems no care in the world but also seeing a culture where they
also they live in such a simple manner that made me reflect on the decisions i was i've made
in my life and it's such a remarkable thing as you say those people are typically their lives aren't easy but they seem to be
much more at peace than the successful first world quote-unquote
people well there's there's a great kind of story that's kind of hypocritical but i
suspect it's true a tourist goes to west africa let's say they're in senegal they're on a beautiful beach staying in a hotel
he he's on the beach every day and he sees a fisherman go down and cast his line over the story it catches a few fish and uh and after
the week he goes to him and says listen i think why don't you invest in a second rod so that you can catch twice as many fish
and then you can sell twice as many fish and then eventually get a net and then you can get a boat and then you can start selling dozens
hundreds of fish thousands of fish and earn even more money so that one day you can retire
and do what you want to do and the man who's fishing says what fish and i just i just think there's a
lot to be said in that because it's about chasing these goals and and what your goal is
and and i think if we too many people are kind of blinded by and again coming full circle this notion of life is a
destination and eventually you're going to reach this nirvana this this this glorious place where everything's
perfect where you you just lie around i don't know everyone has different things they dream obviously you know someone just wants to
go and play golf i have no idea why i don't know but someone just might want to play golf all day someone might want to play cards
Failure, self doubt and self belief
all day someone just might want to just move to the south of france and sit and drink beer all day someone might want to go surfing all day
whatever it is but there's no reason why you can't be doing that throughout your life you just have to think outside of the box
don't you you just have to have this positive attitude and you know this comes back to what i was saying to you as a child i
realize this if you think you're going to fail you're going to fail so every driving test all of those ones i told you i failed
i would get in the car and this booming deafening voice was saying you are going to fail and sure enough i'd
mount the pavement all right i got stopped by the police once because i wasn't wearing a seat belt yeah on a driving test
but because it was almost like self-fulfillment of my mind's attitude and it was only
actually working with olympians that i've done now when i climbed everest i went with victoria pendleton the cyclist
when i rode the atlantic it was with james cracknell and i've been lucky enough to work with some other olympians that i realize you
need this absolute confidence verging on arrogance that i will get to the top of this mountain i
will reach the south pole because as soon as you go into an event where you're
there's any self-doubt it's it's it it will be self-fulfilling you must know
that you you yes you know that but it's like it's a fake in my view like i i
really i'm i'm quite repelled by this culture of like people looking in the mirror and saying
you are going to be a millionaire you are great but d because i my opinion of how beliefs work
like so i always use this example this millionth time i've said this if i were to hold your loved one at gunpoint now
and say believe i'm jesus where i kill them there's nothing you could do to actually believe i was jesus
you could only lie to me because that's not how belief works but as you've proven beliefs take evidence
and you've built that evidence for your challenges right so like just just telling yourself to believe something doesn't work even if
everything is on the line um but if i suddenly turn this into wine and then start levitating yeah you might think
wait wait a minute but this is but but you're you're taking it slightly too literally when it comes
to what that is so here's the thing i i th there's a man called mark boyle who
who um lives in ireland a fascinating man i think you should get him on here he has lived as the moneyless man and he
gave up everything and tried to live without any money for a year and he ended up with a with a house
is is what he did by trip by charming trading up uh literally just working his his way
through the system but never ever ever using money it was always trade and barter and borrowing and i don't think there was
any stealing not that i know of but i love this notion that he had an absolute confidence that
this would work and that he would be able to do it now with something like everest you're
right you couldn't just take someone off the street and say believe you're going to climb this mountain and you're going to
get to the summit because you need to do with the acclimatization you have to get yourself physically ready you have to understand
about um high altitude and and you have to understand the the the basics of climbing at least uh
so you you're right but if you even with all that if you go into that arena as such
into the mountains with any doubt it it's it it's going to be a
self-fulfilling prophecy that you won't succeed so it's i think this idea of
belief that you can you're right it's much more than just looking in the mirror and going i'm going to be the best musician in the
world this comes back to school kids who aspire for fame you know i think it's a
the kind of the x factor britain's got talent has a lot has a lot to answer for because it's
kind of made this illusion that anyone can be whatever they want in life
now part of my whole i i suppose part of of of the story that
i tell is that that you can follow your dreams but i always give say that with the caveat it has to
be reasonable if you if your dream is to be a top footballer you're
but you have to be but if if you know if if someone comes up to me and a a youngster says i really want to just
be um a top footballer i want to play with a premiership club i don't see why they can't but there has
to be a there has to be a base level of pretty brilliant football from a start you said i mean of course so i
think you have to be realistic with those aspirations if someone wants to be a top
neuro scientist or a top doctor i don't see why they can't but they have to have it was going to be impossible
for me i wanted to be a vet uh and i think i would have been quite a good vet but i just didn't have the academics so i didn't even get
off the start plate i think it's a really important thing to reiterate to people that i do believe in
that mindset believe you can aunt middleton who's been on here he's another keen advocate of that just believe in yourself this positive
mindset but the positive mindset has to has to also um marry up with
ability and skill so i completely agree with the um because i genuinely when i
think there's a butt coming here yeah no so it's it's actually not a but to your point it's a it's a it's a question about how
to achieve this point because i completely agree when i've been asked um what my talent was i was like
can't spell can't do math still probably dyslexic just never gone to check um but i just always
believe that's what i've always said for my whole life i always believed i was gonna bit so think about what i wrote in my diary as a kid that didn't have a driving test
and his parents weren't speaking to him with shoplifting pizzas gonna be a millionaire within four years gonna have a range over sports can be my
first car i didn't even i and i genuinely believed it and for me that was my
mother gift that life gave me was this like low-key delusional belief and that took me out and so when i was
living in moss side stealing pizzas and stuff i started recording it in my diary and doing little videos
and it's crazy in the first page of my diary i lied to my diary i said i'm recording the these um this journey
because a production company has asked me to because like you lied to yourself i
lied in my own because i i couldn't i i almost didn't know how to say to my diary
that this was going to be part of a story i was going to tell one day and i and it's not that i'll share my diary
the first page of it it's like because and and also because i think i'm going to have to tell this story one day that is a guy that saw himself
on an island and knew he was getting off the island and wanted to like wasn't dwelling on so i completely
agree i think the only reason i'm here is not because of smarts my parents were completely broke um obviously i had privileges of being born
in this country well born in africa actually but um it was just that i always believed i'd be here
however when i try and impose that onto people and tell them the importance of self-belief and i see these people who have got
their confidence just absolutely in the bin because of experiences they've had or their dad when they were four years old told them that they're a piece of
[ __ ] and my fluffy words you know when they're 35 aren't stronger than those words that
their dad said to them you know i struggle to try and tell them how to get to that place of genuine self-belief
because as i said you can't fake it if stephen had a shred of doubt in moscow i'd still be there
so like what do i say to that person well it's the building blocks of life isn't it it comes back to that so if you
you know the the series of challenges and things that i've done in my life
have slowly built themselves up so i started on that year on living on an island in the outer
hebrides now if you strip that back it was it was pretty simple it couldn't really fail it was hard work it was hard being
away from people no no contact with the outside world no no phones mobiles
family i didn't see anyone for a whole year just this small group of people well once i did that it was kind of
that was the fir that was like the foundations i was like oh my gosh well i've done this and then and then i
put the next block in which was running the marathon day saab six marathons in six days i'd never even run a hundred
meters stephen and suddenly here i was agreeing to run across the sahara desert and i managed to get through that i came
last but i didn't manage to do it and and these building blocks have just gone up so when you
say to people you know when you're trying to encourage as i do as well people to this self belief it has to be a
realistic self belief to of the slow building blocks of life if we come back to kind of
reality shows because i'm slightly obsessed with reality shows and and and this kind of what's happened over the last 20 years
what it's done is it's given people this belief that anyone can become world famous overnight and and i've
already alluded to britain's got talent x factor but big brother love island all of those shows
because it takes everyday folk and it catapults them onto the front pages
of newspapers five million followers overnight on social media and earning
quite a lot of money but how long does that last for now for many people you know it's the famous
andy warhol only 15 minutes it doesn't last very long because what happens is there's no substance to it
there's no roots and what happens is the next show comes along and they're cast aside but what also a
lot of people do is that they the leap from one brick to the next is too high and if you if you go too big
it's doomed to failure i remember funnily enough i think one of the reasons why me a reality show
contestant is still working in tv after 21 years because i should have my 15 minutes was
up a long time ago i think the reason is more because of the things that i turned down than the things that i i agreed to do
so i turned down some pretty big shows big prime time saturday night shows that a lot of people who work in tv would be
like i would do anything for that but the leap was too big and i didn't believe that
i i think i i think the the um even though i like to confront risks i
like to be realistic with those so k2 is a far more dangerous mountain than everest i could have gone straight
to k2 but instead i want i want to do a sensible building block up
to that ultimate challenge and i think right back to television i think if you if you if you take too
big a leap then um the the reality of continued success
um is eroded away when you think about some of those opportunities that you were given that you turned down what was it about them that made you
think it was too big of a leap because i'm trying to answer the question for my viewer which is how do i know if it's too big of a leap i think you just have to be
sensible about what you're capable of i think so it's this really fine line i told you i'm full of contributions so
i'm telling you you know i'm sitting here kind of saying to people follow your dreams don't be told that you can't do it nothing no dream is
too big um you know believe in yourself and and you're halfway there you know i really
do believe in all of that but you also have to be sensible so i think okay so here's the thing i
reckon that i i'm the son of a an actress and i believe that i could be an actor i
always wanted to be an actor i got rejected by all the drama schools by the way because i couldn't remember my lines but that's a whole other thing
um but i still think i could be an actor and and i have quite a confidence that i could
but if i was suddenly offered a steven spielberg film yep i wouldn't take that now because
my ultimate goal is to try the acting thing at some stage in my life when it's appropriate but i don't want to do it
on in such a big extreme explosion
of public ridicule if it goes wrong now
together with that i add this sort of confidence that yes i will be able to do it but i'd prefer to start in a little pub
theater with 20 people just on a smaller stage and build up because there has to be
and i think we all have to agree with this as well as this confidence and this
self-belief you have to have the skills yeah if you don't have the skills there's just no point and we're just being delusional
and it's no different to that instagram fakery of of of showing people this idyllic life when
actually that's just a tiny little one second of actually what was a really miserable weekend because it was the only time the
sun came out and someone you threw on a bikini i didn't throw in a bikini you know you get my point you know to show that instant moment of
of perfection so i think there has to be um an actual skill and you have to earn it
i think you know this this instant gratification just doesn't exist
there is a few examples and you're you're one of those where you were able to write down i'm going to be a millionaire
i'm going to have that range rover sport and you did it and and you are what gives so many people hope
but i failed mm-hmm i failed in my first company but it doesn't matter but but that
doesn't matter surely failure if you haven't failed you haven't been trying hard enough yeah do you think i think the the people who because i i
realized that quite early on if you haven't if you haven't failed at various points through your life then
then you're you're being too measured with the challenge that you take which is a failure yeah which is a failure which is a
failure in itself yeah yeah i i yeah so many of the things you
said there i was i was just you know i was captivated but i was wondering whether you're if you're so you said you were a contradiction at
the start of this conversation but then you've also alluded to the fact that you like to to not be on either
pole and you like to be like the sheep in the field which actually probably makes sense because you can appreciate the need for ambition
but then you also appreciate the need to have self-awareness right so it kind of puts you in the middle of the field well if you think about it
it's a really weird thing because i'm actually again true to the to the contradictions you know the son
of an actress i've kind of got the jazz hands and i quite like talking and i like being on stage as such but i'm also still
quite shy so i kind of like being in the wings i want to be on the stage then i want to be in the wings and i want to be on the stage and and
the same goes for kind of how i project myself so i
want to be part of the conversation but then i don't want to be part of the conversation i don't i don't like the uncomfortableness of it i want to be a
politician but i i couldn't bear the you know the the the focus and the the
um the derision that you're going to get from one side or the other and i actually think once you've
accepted that because i think a lot of people i'm sure a lot of people are like that really and once you've accepted that's
who you are you just work out how to walk those stepping stones and kind of move around
it and i kind of do this i dance my way through it and dip in and dip out and i have moments where
i kind of i wish i hadn't kind of uh i wasn't on the middle of that stage but
i am so i own it and it's it's back to this whole thing i do i do believe
you kind of have to own your narrative it's very easy to let someone else steal it from you i think i think i actually read that in
on the last page of the first chapter of your book it said um the ocean talk the ocean had taught me
to take control of my own narrative and believe in myself when you were talking about um what you learned from the sea in your book
inspire the lessons from the wilderness and that taking control of your narrative point really stuck with me
um because obviously society writes your narrative i had a major announcement this week as you've probably all seen on
social media or in the newspapers relating to a tv show that i'm doing and um it was just a great you know it's
a great example of the power of the platformfiver.com because i wanted to make this announcement using
using visual effects and visual effects are typically staggeringly expensive the quotes that i got back from agencies were like 40
50 grand to make a very short 60 second video in visual effects it was staggering right i wanted to show me turning into a
dragon um and i used fiverr.com who were the sponsor of this podcast and we made this really cool short 45 second video which
shows me transforming into a dragon check out the video go check out fiverr.com if you've never used it just the most
cost-effective way to get creative services done i've used it for the last three and a half years of my life one of the things that i picked up a lot
of from listening to your interviews and your books was your about your relationship with your lovely wife
Your wife, preventative marriage concealing
and you're both very vocal about the dare i say not radical but the sort of
like innovative way that you've built your relationship in various areas one of the really interesting things to me was this idea
that you have preventative marriage counseling
yeah tell me about that and why do i need it so so my so my wife marina we've been
married for this will be our 15th year together wow she's half austrian thank you she's half austrian and she's
she's got skin like a rhino it's unbelievable uh as in can i just say that that
in terms of uh be not ever being offended she's got glowing skin her skin is really it's
really she moisturizes the whole time she doesn't have this big wrinkly grey
skin oh my god i'm blushing i'm going to get in so much trouble for that but she is she she's really tough she's
really resilient she's no nonsense she doesn't beat about the bush and we're very you know i i am by my own
admission a much more sensitive soul now it doesn't mean she isn't sensitive but but she's she kind of calls a spade
a spade whereas i might say well that is a spade but you could probably could use that as a
could you do what i mean i kind of because i want to please all the people and i don't want to offend so i kind of find myself kind of
dancing around a little bit in the middle there you go whereas marina has always just been straight down the line and our
our kind of our relationship is has been built on me being away a lot because
outside of the time of covid i'm probably traveling eight months of the year so there's a lot of time away but that's
how it's always been and we have a really solid relationship and and we we had a terrible tragedy about
um six years ago when we lost our third child a little boy willem who was stillborn so
he is so three weeks before he was due to be born naturally um
unfortunately marina had something called a placental abruption and he died and and it was an awful
awful experience that i've kind of spoken about before but it affected us profoundly much more
than i thought it would that that the feeling that this emotion of
losing someone you'd never had a chance to meet is is something i'd never experienced before
and i couldn't quite understand my own emotions and and added to that when this all happened
i was on the other side of the world i thought marina was going to die so it was a big very
impactful part of our relationship and we sought counselling afterwards to help us through
the complexities of all of those emotions and it was through that that we we kind
of realized that actually our own relationship we we talked about things that we hadn't talked about before
outside of the the awfulness of that situation we talked about are very different characters and how
how we kind of tread around one another and i think a lot of a lot of relationships
have that they don't you you might joke about your very different personalities but there are certain areas that you
know oh no i can't ever say that i couldn't do that well why couldn't you you should be really really honest the best
relationships are ones where you can say anything to one another without fear of offense now i've already said that i've
brought a thin skin so i'm easily offended and marina has offended me many times over the years and i've offended her and
and i think this this marriage counseling prevention
came was born out of that and about a year afterwards marina we were struggling a little bit it was
such a profound thing that it affected us because we had different ways of dealing with with the grief of losing that little boy
marina was was very tearful and then she'd be totally fine she'd have big tears and
was fine and mine i became really introverted and and and uh and i became really anti-social
didn't want to be anywhere i remember going trying to go to big events i had to go to some big red carpet events and
literally just arriving and just saying to the driver just drive on i could i couldn't go
or i'd go to events and i'd find myself going to the loo and just sitting sitting in the little cubicle for the
duration of the whole event parties i would find myself just literally arriving
saying hello hello and then just literally diving out the door because i think it's because i couldn't control
[Music] i couldn't control the the narrative this narrative that i wanted to be in
control of i didn't know who was going to come up were they going to talk about my loss were they going to there were
there were things i couldn't prepare myself for and and those two very different
approaches and two very different um uh kind of emotions that marina my wife and
i had meant that it did create tensions so we saw someone and and she was the one that suggested that
once a year we just go and speak to her as a preventative and you know it kind
of just makes a lot of sense you know marina i've told you already she's very straight laced and she's very straight and she was like well why
wouldn't we why wouldn't we just go and with someone there say tell you what i do find really
frustrating it's when you always do this or you always say that if you do it in a home environment
the natural reaction usually it's going to be over dinner probably had a drink you're going to be even more emotional
and go i don't you'll become defensive i i defy any relationship to say they
that that doesn't happen but to do it with a third party who is trained to kind of be non-judgmental is a very
good way of speaking to you via that person without fear
of getting really emotional because marina and i are also really we do get really emotional we probably
argue once a year but when we do it's massive people may be surprised because we do
we're we're highly emotional and we get it's really tearful it's not there's there's no uh black eyes or anything but
it's a really but you know we don't argue very well and what we found actually was
that speaking to someone else once a year has has i can't remember the last time we had an argument we really we haven't for
years and years now which is saying something because i you know i'm also all for honesty
you know in this world of of kind of social media fakery i i wear my heart on my sleeve and i've
always been really honest so talking about the loss of willem talking about my dyslexia but i think it's
really important that you're very honest especially if you live in a very public sphere
hearing that you've not had an argument for years is a pretty incredible achievement one would say in
a relationship why how how why well i think it's part
i think the fact that that we speak to the same person every year for only like
an hour or two twelve months apart though yeah i know but it's because it all come because i think we we are
able to just be really really honest right there and then and and by the way i'm
that does i'm not saying our relationship is really you know it's not one of these
um wedding cakes perfectly formed everything is idyllic birds flying around chirping
it's like any relationship it's strained and and and we get snappy at one another but we've learned to resolve i think
conflict resolution is there and i'm what you know i have although i kind of try to be i'm an optimist and
and i try to be smiley and happy as a more often than not
i still wake up some days and i'm feeling a bit under the weather or i do just get out of bed the wrong side and i know when
i'm a bit more snappy and marina now we we have we are armed with ways of saying to the
other person you you're a bit irritable today you seem a bit miserable you're not much fun to be around
we we can say that in a way that doesn't the other person doesn't jump to a defense game i'm not you're the one
that's annoying me just i mean that it turns into that that argument and i think if you
learn how to speak to one another and that's what we have kind of been armed with it it is just a
great way to to kind of avoid those unnecessary arguments listen some people have really fiery relationships and they
thrive on it we've got friends that kind of need that they have big battles and flames
and then and then they make up and it's all fine and i've got some friends i just find that exhausting yeah it's a mental health awareness week
this week and um one of the things you said earlier on about going to going to those events and like you know telling the driver to carry on
Anxiety and looking for happiness
going or hiding in the toilet sounded similar to you know shades of um
anxiety maybe even ptsd to some degree um does is that what you think you were
experiencing at that time were you anxious i was super anxious no
without doubt i um anxiety um uh panic attacks you know
all of that happened for about a year i experienced a lot of that really i just just and i think it was
because i had lost control i wasn't able to protect my wife i wasn't able to protect that little boy
and i think my my the the um reaction to that was to try and take
back control of my life and the only way i could take back control of my life was to control my environment and and things were out of my control
when there were lots of people around and i didn't know who i was going to be talking to and about what and where and when i was going to go away
and and all the things that i'd lost control of i wanted to regain control of and yes
anxiety definitely came into us and i'm i've never suffered depression as i'd
call it but i have every so often always coincides with the full moon which is a bit weird but i i
get i get what i just call the dark cloud and even if everything in my life is perfect i just have this kind
of for a couple of days it does kind of happen almost every month just a couple of kind of gloomy days
when it's difficult to feel happy and optimistic i don't think i would define it as depression because i
think that would be demeaning to people who really really suffer from what is known as depression i have
lots of friends who are suffering and have suffered from clinical depression but i think it's human nature you know i
i you know i am an optimist i am happy most of the time but i also feel that little cloud of
of just darkness and it's and it comes and goes and i can't i don't know when
it's there um or why it's i know when it's there sorry i don't know um why it's there and then it it sort of
disappears and for me sport has been my way so active to be active has been my way um for
about 20 years of getting rid of that has that always been there has it always showed up no i think
it i think it probably showed up about i'd say about probably just when i
started in this business and the pressures i think say 20 years or so i think it's it's it started
being there and it was i i came quite late to kind of doing exercise and it's not
bulging but i said that's not my kind of form of exercise but i went for a run just before coming
here oh you know so i most days i will do something and it just sets me up for the day
and it it keeps that cloud away sometimes it's quite even that doesn't work but i've got i've just got
different different ways of of trying to kind of keep the cloud away super interesting really
interesting really interesting so many questions to ask within that i am
i have i've gone through my life i think probably in the same sort of optimism and you know generally
really happy but you know i i do worry that uh as the pressures of my life get more
intense that you know i feel like i feel like when i was growing up i thought mental health was was not a real thing and it was like
crazy people and i was like well i'm happy i'll never be and then i had i remember one day i had anxiety for the first time and i
just couldn't understand it but what it did for me was told me that i'm susceptible to
everything health depression and all of these things um but yeah i mean it's good to hear
that exercise has been a bit of an antidote but the other thing we're coming back to labels so a bit like i don't need
of course you know i've got dyslexia i think you know you might be able to go to a a
doctor and he might say yes i actually did suffer a bit of ptsd um but actually i think if you're strong
in yourself and you're strong in your self-belief and you've got a good kind of family dynamic around you you've got
a strong set of friends i think i think you should be able to navigate quite well if you learn the
tricks of dealing with it and like i say for me it has been um a lot of reading i i love i i
read a lot about happiness um the the there's a great book um about happiness and i've
got a complete mind blank of the author but he hypothesized about happiness is it something that
um we're is it is it something to strive for it's a bit like the destination or
the journey is happiness something we're striving for are we work do we find happiness or is it other things that are
disguising the happiness and and hampering it so if you think his
theory is that if you look at a child children are by and large they might
they're going to be crying if they've got a dirty nappy or they're hungry or whatever but by and large their emotion their default
emotion is it's laughing think of children in a playground yes they have little that you know they their
tears come very easily but the default is happiness and when does that start
eroding away kind of puberty and the anxiety you know those anxious times of when you're just you know when sexuality
is coming into your life all those things probably do start to affect that happiness but then moving on in life and this man
had done fantastically well made millions and exactly like you were saying about the cars as soon as he made his first million
went out and bought his ferrari sat in the ferrari and then was like well yeah i've got it i've done it now
and now what and and it was this constant aspiration so the hypothesis is that actually we're
we're kind of adding apps almost things to us that are making us unhappy rather than striving for this happiness
thing because if we're if if the happiness is the ferrari or the million pounds range rover sorry i got it wrong but if
but but if that is your goal for happiness the human nature of
always wanting more is going to mean you're constantly searching for happiness and you're going to have it fleetingly and then it will
go and then you'll get it again fleetingly and then it will go but actually if we take away the things that are making us
unhappy whatever that is social media get rid of it
living in a big city get rid of it you know you've just got back from bali yeah i i saw a picture of you under a
waterfall i mean how how but but tell like how happy we were you
in a nice warm place out in the jungle in a waterfall listening to nature
all around you i'm gonna do something now one second so i actually wrote a little paragraph i
wrote a paragraph in my book about being sat by the river in bali yeah i described the words of how i feel and it's funny
because the chapter's called and i'm not plugging my book here it just seems like it's the best way um the chapter's called the journey back
to human and the reason why the chapters called that is because i'm hypothesizing that i think we've kind of lost our way
and being sat by this river in bali was it felt like i'd come back to where i was meant to be
here we go as i write this chapter i'm sat at an indonesian jungle in bali by a gloriously glistening river with
the unobstructed glare of the sun overhead bearing down on me there's this perfect light breeze stroke in my warm skin and an earthy floral
smell of the jungle surrounding trees occupies my senses i came here to live in hubble as i sit here and you may have
experienced this if you spent time in nature i feel at peace as hysterics might have described i feel tranquil it's hard to explain
this in any other way than to say that i feel like this is where i innately belong my primitive survival orientated senses
are often used prehistoric devices like pain and discomfort as a usual way to guide me away from danger and towards safety seem to be telling me that this
is where i should be the absence of discomfort and stress and pressure is telling me that this might just be
home and it's what you were saying there about like the removal so when you said did i feel happy
the first thing that came to head was like i didn't feel unhappiness there you go right so i didn't feel like there was no
notification but that is such a fascinating notion this idea that it wasn't you just
felt a default just yeah human you felt just your tranquil the story yes they use the word tranquil right
so all this noise that we get you know we're here in central london right now and when i say noise i don't just mean
the the police cars and the ambulances and the the pneumatic drills
i just mean all the all the things the shops that are saying you should be buying this you should be getting that the
newspapers that are telling you about other whoever your rivals are we all
have rivals the the social media promise of someone who's having a better time in than you there's someone who's someone
else who's still in bali when you're not there it's all these things and i do think they have a habit of making us
unhappy and it's weird isn't it because we think that those are the things that will make us happy you know being on social media fishing
for those likes the the um uh buying into the kind of
commercial world and trying to keep up with the joneses now that's where money gain coming back to
this that's why money is seen by so many people as the cure for everything because with
money you could go to bali you could get the better car but once you've got it as as you know
it's like well actually that was quite fleeting yeah and and this is funny because when
you look at the ways that we're medicating mental health disorders now um we went through this phase of
thinking that it was like a biomedical problem so we would give people like ssris and you know try and correct the serotonin with these chemicals
and the more modern treatments all seem to be trying to return us back to
probably what you go and see when you go to the the tribes that you you see in like the amazon which is
human connection movement like we used to hunt for our food not like [ __ ] uber and delivery um uh so connection with nature which
again you know nature's therapy i mean this is you know there's a lot of people who've realized especially for mental health
you know back to the mental health week there's a lot of people who have seen the the benefits of nature so in japan
and sweden for many many years now they've done something called forest bathing uh and and forest bathing is
like many people do on the beach but instead you just go into a woods and you lie on the floor and you stare at the
canopy and just imagine now i want you know everyone who's watching this to just imagine all those leaves
rustling in the wind birds you know because once you stop walking in a wood is so many people kind
of go we're going to go for a walk and they just march through often have headphones on
and it's like well you're not connecting with that yeah you're just you're racing through but actually if you just sit there
animals start coming out you start noticing colors you start noticing a flower that wasn't there and don't never underestimate the power
of that to just reconnect us to you know where we're supposed to be really we're not supposed to be in big cities living in
apartments with your own um you know with with running water and things it's it makes it very comfortable
for us but uh i think most of us really kind of belong in a jungle in a woods on a mountain
on the ocean closer to nature do you know you hannah hari do you know who that johann hari he wrote called lost connection yes of
course yeah he's going to be sat there in two hours amazing he's coming and we always talk about this particular topic but yeah it's one of
the biggest revelations i had in my life was that um much of my ambitions were taking me further away from like
being human so you know living in the heart of new york city um i could pretty much go through a
whole day without moving ooh you know the uber picks me up takes me to work takes me back home i use the same glass screen to all of my food i
don't really see anybody because i lived alone uh and then you look at the stats and you know new york is 30 times
30 more likely to be depressed than bali or you know something crazy like that but um yeah i
and as an adventurer and someone that's spent time in nature um i find it so fascinating that you've
you've you've come to the same conclusion about the true nature of happiness what is your goal now though we talked about
What is your goal?
there not being a destination when you think about what your goal is what is it i think again true to the
contradictions i think we all need goals i think we have to have something to aspire to something to be working towards
but i don't have contrary to popular belief i don't have a little black book that says right okay we've done that now
i'm going to cycle around the world and now i'm going to climb this mountain
it's not like i just have a list of things but i'm kind of i try to live my life as a
yes man so i like to seize opportunities i think the human nature default of no to think about things uh really
carefully is something i've tried to wean myself away from and i tried to kind of say yes
to things on a whim a little bit more so i think i think my goals are about continuing to test
myself continuing to confront failure risking what i do now given i've kind of got you
know i write books i do tv presenting um and i do adventuring um
i think i'd probably quite like to find something else whether it's acting
whether it's politics whether it's there you go i i'm all for trying also yeah i'd love to
know if i have a voice maybe i'll become a singer i'd love to you know i wonder whether i could compete in the olympics and is there any sport where a
47 year old could like start from scratch and really you know test themselves and and work
their way up to the sport there are a few believe it or not i think that we don't so i kind of i do have i kind
of think big but i don't have absolute goals they're not written there but i think
i think a bit like you were saying you you would like to kind of tackle the education system i would like to make a difference
because i think the older you get you're still way too young stephen but the older you get you start to question
why why have i done all these things because if you think about if you just break down those big challenges that we've been
talking about it's quite egotistical you know you climb on mountains hey look at me you you walk across a pole i get to come
and sit and chat to you all about them and say how brilliant i was but actually what what's the point
there has to be more substance to why i did those things and and more importantly
how i can um how i can translate those into something useful for other people so i i
would love to again work on an education model work with other people to
actually be able to start making a difference because my life up until now has all been about me it's been about self
building about about building my own self-confidence and that's quite selfish and and i would like to
think of myself as a or i'd like to be more selfless and i'd like to do things for other people that
doesn't mean i haven't done stuff and i've done a lot of charitable things and philanthropic things over the last few years but
i kind of feel i'm moving towards a time when i really would like to focus on
um trying to improve the system because if the likes of you and me and
other people don't do it it's never going to happen we can talk about it we can sit here and look all
smug kind of saying this is what needs to be done and kind of nod our heads but if you don't action it it will never
happen because politicians are just busy doing their thing and they'll they'll kind of just do what
they can but they're never going to be able to to to break those glass ceilings that have been set
by previous generations and i guess from what you talked about earlier about you know gradually picking
your battles i guess you know you've done so much in your career as well from everest to the shows you've done to all the other
achievements you've had that you're in search of an even grander battle yeah i like i like a battle
but the battle doesn't have to it's not a it's a battle within it's it's not a you know this term of
of a battle i think some people think it is um it's against another person or against a
system or against a belief or you're battling against the trolls or the wokies or the
fascists but i i think the battles we all have are the battles within
and i think as soon as you start accepting that that's when we will start kind of taking mental health
more seriously than we do because it's really obvious to me that you know that how your brain feels and how what
your brain is telling you is is far more powerful than any kind of broken bones that we have and it's kind
of weird isn't it that we still you look at someone who's been in a road accident oh poor you you broke your leg
you see that injury and we can relate to it and we we winced it but here what goes on
beneath the the skull is is deemed as something kind of still a bit taboo and it's not it's not really
taboo because people talk about it but you still meet a lot of people who are like nah it doesn't care it's no just
get over it come on just just man up uh just uh you know just just believe in yourself
and you'll do it and as much as i'm saying you need this this um self belief it's far more
complex than that it is and that's what makes giving advice so difficult
right because you give it from the basis of your own bias yeah and advice is is bespoke
so i i could you know i get like i say many people asking how can i do x or y it depends on so many things
yeah and and and i can't really give that advice it's a bit like a doctor giving a prescription
i can't really give that unless i genuinely know what your ability is what your aspirations are what your
you know what what your mindset could be all of these things come into it but if
we could start you know helping people within that context
i think we would be in a very different place he's scared of dying no i'm scared of i'm scared
Are you scared of dying?
for other people but i'm not scared of dying which sounds really glib i know but i genuinely am not and and i
don't know why i've had many near-death experiences maybe that has i've had to i've had to look very
look at those clouds and think that i'm i'm heading that way quite a few times and maybe that is what
makes you less fearful when you've been so close to it but it's also perhaps that
i kind of i don't think i have many regrets in life i've kind of seized those opportunities
but i'm deeply fearful for those i love um and and
the void that would be left which sounds really kind of egotistical but i know how much i feared about
losing my parents or loved ones when i was a child super interesting that idea that i feel
the same i'm i've after i stopped being religious at the age of 18 i um i was actually scared of dying when i
was religious because i thought it was going to go somewhere right and then beyond that point um gradually as i've achieved more in my
life i've got less scared of the idea of i think well you know i've been true to myself and that that seems to be the
most important thing as it relates to and you you've referred to as regret there have you got any regrets
not really not no because i've tried to it's kind of one of the ways i've tried to live life with no regrets and
Have you got any regrets?
you can you're only likely to have a regret let me change i was going to say you're
more likely to regret the things you didn't do than the things you did do but i know that's not true i think plenty of people have made
made the wrong decisions we've all done that but no in all seriousness i don't think i i kind of i am an
optimist and i try to see the positives in everything i've done and all the decisions i've made and all the things
that have happened in life and i i honestly i don't think
i can say that i regret anything because it's the it's the old cliche
what doesn't kill you makes you stronger and i think even those things that i could maybe say well
probably wasn't the best decision something good has come of it there's gonna be so many
ben 18 year old ben ben's listening to this right now who listened to this and thought you know
what i'm really low confidence and i've been knocked and you know i'm not sure if i'm good enough
Advice for unconfident people
and i've been called a failure by my job dad whatever it is what do you say to those people having
walked you know live their life what you say to them what's the advice you give them don't don't buy into someone else's
narrative that's what you're doing by listening to the failure whether it's absolute words
coming out of someone's mouth saying well you're no good whether it's whether it's even perceived
narrative that you go into a pub and everyone looks like they're having more fun than you and and the girl or the boy doesn't want
to be with you they want to be with the other person i think i think you just have to
own your narrative you are you in this world of what are we 6.7 billion probably got
that wrong but in this world of many many billions of people there is no there is no other stephen yeah that is
fact yeah there might be someone similar there might be someone with the same abilities the same body type maybe even
looks a bit like you but you are completely unique because your personality
um belongs to you and don't try and change that don't try and be the person that other people want you to be be
the person you are and it's it's it's a really hard thing to buy into because i spent so much of
my life trying to be the person i thought society wanted me to be always embarrassed that i wasn't i was either
too posh or i wasn't posh enough i was either too successful or not successful enough you said i mean it's it it's almost like
you're always just trying to fit in but actually once you own your narrative
once you're confident that you are unique in whatever way it might be it might be a geeky kind of unique it
might be a cool kind of unique it might be a quirky kind of unique but that's if if you can own
your personality your narrative and accept that you're halfway there
to this self-belief and this confidence and and that also means not trying to buy into
someone else's narrative you might think you want to be the if you're the geeky one you might think you want to be the cool kid you might
think that you want to be playing in the first football team you might think that you um want to be
sitting at that top table but that's not necessarily where your personality um
uh wants you to be and i think stop wanting and start being
very powerful i am it took me back to something i read from this swedish philosopher i can't remember his bloody name but
he was talking about how when you try and abandon your true self you'll despair if you fail or
succeed if you succeed in abandoning your true self you'll despair because you've abandoned yourself if you fail you'll despair because you
you've attempted something and failed at fitting in so he took the conclusive point of this flowchart he wrote 200 years ago was
that the only way to fulfillment is to to to be um and i just i mean very very powerful
and your your story is um incredibly inspiring for so many reasons but i think mainly because of your willingness to share it so honestly all
parts of your story and i know that will help a ton of people because the stories that you've told me about yourself especially when you're younger
and the lack of confidence are it's my dm's are full of young men young you know women that are
desperately trying to uh um understand why they um they don't feel adequate and so i
want to thank you for coming here today thank you yeah it's truly fascinating i don't know what i was expecting us to
talk about but i'm glad we talked about all the topics we did um and i just hope that you know
we we could do a lot more people in the world that are willing to be as transparent and honest um um warts and all so thank you so much
because this is exactly why i started this podcast and it's gonna be super valuable to all the people that listen well listen thank
you so much it's been a pleasure being here thank [Music]
you [Music]

Transcription:

Intro
to say that professor green has faced and overcome adversity in his life is such a gross understatement he's self-aware he's honest he's
critical of himself where he feels he needs to be i've got to do some work on myself here
things need to change so as you push things down they coming sideways i can't keep projecting my problems onto other
people and blaming them you know what if i ever see you again i'm gonna knock you out
and people are like wow do you wish you could go back in time and change what your last words to him were no of course not because that
anger was just it was that constant it was him being in and out of my life him being such a kind generous gorgeous
man but being such a [ __ ] father i felt like he was threatening me and i felt like i was
right to stand my ground i didn't expect that five minutes after that he'd walk up behind me and put a broken bottle in my neck
i got my phone i called my name and i just apologized for all the work she had put into me that this was how it was going to end
[Music]
to say that professor green aka stephen manderson has faced an overcome adversity in his life is such a gross
understatement there's moments in this podcast today where you realize
how unfortunate his life has been at certain moments and how much of a seemingly unfair start
he had that it almost doesn't seem like it can be true and we know professor green we know his
music i grew up listening to professor green's music we know his documentaries more recently and how inspiring and
vulnerable those documentaries have been and most of us will know about the tragedy that met him
in his early years when his dad decided to commit suicide but it's interesting to see how all of
these events came to shape this man a man that is empathetic a man that refuses to be bitter and a
man that has overcome and thrived despite all of this professor green is a remarkable person
he's a remarkable guy he's self-aware he's honest he's critical of himself
where he feels he needs to be and because of that because of the content the documentaries and the music
he's made he's one of my sincere inspirations especially as it relates to mental health
and the change that he's been able to make in the conversation this is a an honest conversation today and it's one that i think everybody should and
needs to hear especially men especially in the world we live in so without further ado i'm stephen
bartlett and this is the director ceo i hope nobody's listening but if you are
then please keep this to yourself [Music]
i did a lot of research on you and i i've listened to podcasts you've
Most pivotal moments from your early years
done and i've read um parts from the book that you you authored and i i want to know from your
perspective what you think the most pivotal moments were from your early years that came to shape the man
that you became later in your life wow let's start with the big ones yeah
we went straight into the waiting small talk to her it would be really easy to draw from
uh some of the the more dramatic events i think because they're the more obvious um and they're they're highlighted quite
often they come up in conversation all the time but i think i don't think that their specific
moments in the same way i think the the worst traumas that i actually endured weren't
any single moments they were cumulative they were things that happened over time um i think it was probably more a case
of my or what shaped me being cumulative as well it was the time
that i spent with my great grandmother i was sort of a six of us in the flat when i was born there was
me my great-grandmother my grandmother my mother and my two uncles so my nan's three kids
my mum was the first person to leave the house when i was a year old she was a consistent she know she was
she was there consistently throughout my life but my name was my legal guardian when i was by the time i was three
and at a point where my nan could have started a new life for herself she took on the responsibility of of her
mum and her grandson but it was amazing because
you know apart from the ancestral [ __ ]
sorry the ancestral shirt yeah well just you know you think like my great-grandmother went through two world wars whatever
relationship she had been through the relationship that she had with my grandmother all the problems that they had as a
mother and daughter the problems that my nan had with my mother the problems that my mother had with my grandmother what were
these problems um i couldn't tell you because they weren't my problems but they existed and i was aware because there were
arguments and there was stress and there was shouting and there were financial problems and struggles and there was robin peter to pay paul me
being shuffled off into a room when you know a money lender had come around to you know pick up money and
conversations and that i wasn't supposed to be privy to but in a three-bedroom flat it was about
as big as a room that we're sitting and it was quite difficult to avoid being aware of these things um but
there was a lot of good people who skype must be really tough growing up in hackney but i didn't have i didn't know anything i
didn't know any different you know it wasn't like i grew up in wheelchair until i was 13 and then it was just airlifted and dropped off in hackney and
told to survive you know it was all i knew but in hindsight there was a lot that
wasn't mine to take on but that i absorbed that that stress and that anxiety definitely seeped into me and i
was a very anxious child i was always man i got a tummy ache but at the same time i was really fortunate
because when when people talk about you know kids who aren't brought up by a or both parents they normally miss out
on the nurturing that i definitely didn't because my great-grandmother was always at home she hardly left the house
not least of all because of her age um and that time i got to spend with her
it is probably what made the larger part of what good is in
me or encouraged the good in me you know i would run out into the living room which was where she slept on a chair that folded out
every morning when that weird holding screen was on the bbc with a little girl holding that puppet with that which in hindsight is
quite scary you're really weird um but before the cartoons would come on and you know she
would read to me i always remember her blue blanket that i'd jump underneath and she taught me to read well ahead of
my years you know basic numeracy and stuff when i went to school i was ahead of most kids because of that time spent
with my great grandmother and i enjoyed learning so i saw validation in the right places rather than throwing
tantrums at school like a lot of people did because they weren't getting attention you know in single parent homes parents
have a tough decision to make do i go out and work and lose out on the time of my child but
be able to provide or do i lose out on the money that i would make which would make supporting
a child easier it's a you know that's a conundrum that's a really difficult situation to be in
i was really fortunate i didn't lose out on that and i think it's that that's what shaped
me you know it wasn't any of any single event really it was that period of time
and you said your mum was the first to leave the house yeah she so my mom was 16 when she had me um wow
yeah my dad was 18. they were separated very quickly um and my mum had a lot of growing to do
i'm more than twice her age and i've just become a father i can't imagine you know being a parent
or having tried to have been a parent when i was 16. i don't know yeah 16 yeah my crazy age to
well you're a baby yourself aren't you 16 it's like very much so yeah and how was your what was your
relationship like with your mum from that point onwards um so
me and my mum we've had an on-and-off relationship in in the latter years of my life i don't talk about it too much um
loads of stuff about how they're about my relationship or lack there over my dad because of how his life ended
um but you know i always i was brought up to not air dirty laundry and my mom did try she did
you know and like i said she was a much more uh she was a much more consistent part of my life than my
dad was you know she made she made the effort has it taken you some time to get to the
point where you can be compassionate about
your experiences with her i think it's taken me some time to get to the point where i can be compassionate about my
experiences with everyone that i was involved with growing up um and i think i got to that place quite a
while ago and it's quite it's quite liberating man it it's it's quite freeing because
that i think holding on to anger you know it becomes resentment and that leads to bitterness and and
bitter is not something i'm interested in being i think a lot of people get you know end up quite bitter and
jaded quite early on and that determines the rest of their lives
and i used to be quite scared to even say the words i'm
happy because i would worry about what was round the corners that i couldn't see around now i'm never gonna develop the power to see
around corners um and worrying about what's out of your control um and preempting things that may or may
not happen is not the healthiest way to live um it's not great for your mental health
it's not great for the quality of life that you have because if you're constantly worrying you know i can enjoy a lot of what um or be happy
about a lot of the things that i've achieved with hindsight but actually when i was going through the early years of
of my of the successful part of my music career there was a lot of things that i didn't
enjoy in the moment as much as i should because i was worried about dropping the ball because i experienced loss quite early
on um and come from quite a disadvantaged background and i wasn't used to a lot of
things i was starting to encounter i was scared of of loss and of losing it and dropping the ball you know it's why
i didn't take holidays i would attach a few days here and there on to work but i felt i was you know scared to
enjoy myself or to to let go of that kind of almost incessant need to keep working
because i was worried about losing it but i wasn't enjoying what i had so did i ever really
have it um and it took me a while to get to a point where you know i'm in a place where i enjoy
things as they happen and life is a lot more pleasant because i don't spend my time catastrophizing about what may or may not happen
um not least of all because i've survived things you know and i know that
[ __ ] does hit the fan and things do happen it's quite likely that i'm gonna get through them so i can worry about them happening and
ruin my life day by day because all i do is worry about what may or may not happen which
is also distracting and doesn't allow me then to focus on the things that are in front of me and that are important
which will build a happier a steadier a more consistent life for me or i can i can deal with things as they
come knowing that i have the strength and the resilience in myself to handle things um and it's taken me a while to get to
that point it's taking some therapy as well but it's kind of it it's it you know
i i feel quite calm and relaxed in saying right now that i am happy and i feel quite secure and that i
can handle what may or may not come my way talk about worry then you referenced earlier
you'd say to your i think your nan that you had a like a pain in your belly yeah and i guess you didn't really know what
that was when you were younger nope what did you come to learn about that pain in your belly and it was anxiety it
was a night in my stomach the problem was i was born with a problem in my digestive tract i had
um called i don't know if it was a procedure that was called pyloric stenosis or the condition but stenosis
is narrowing and my stomach basically your pile of muscle at the bottom of your
stomach should open and close to let food pass but mine was just closed so it's six weeks old i have an operation
which has left me with a scar that goes from there to there um so whenever i said now i've got a bellyache i've got a tummy ache man i
got tummy ache it was straight to the doctors um and that then
meant that i would go to the hospital and have cameras up me down me you know be put into machines to
be scanned to make sure there wasn't something physically wrong which there wasn't it was psychological um i was
diagnosed with ibs really early on and that's still quite misunderstood you know is it something psychological
that manifests physically or is it physical and causes mental problems um and i think that really
highlights the intrinsic link between the gut and the brain um and it
again i guess that's a bit of a chicken and egg situation never really considered that before
never really ever considered that there might there might be a link between the two um and with ibs especially it's
something that i've become increasingly curious about because as i said to you before you start recording i've definitely got a problem with my gut i just haven't
figured out quite yet what it is um going back to your sort of your formative years was there anything else
through that period that would shape the man you you became that you can really think of between the age of like i don't know
0 and 16 like school life and stuff like that and yeah um so i was i was quite a bright
kid um and you sound surprised most people i sit here don't seem to be
especially people that come from that kind of background don't don't tend to be that academic their smarts and
genius teams seems to come from other creative sources or they're like like yesterday we had to wrestle russell kane
and he's just like a you know comedic genius and then became a bit more academic when he left school
but you know i've kind of i i i guess there's i've kind of gone full
circle in that i have to use the academic part of my brain and what i do now more than i have done for the last 10 years during making music um
but that wasn't really harnessed it wasn't you know education wasn't big in my family no one had been to university
so me being as bright as i was i wasn't pushed as as hard as i as i should have been because my nan sympathized with
my situation my dad being in and out of my life me being a very sensitive child
my mum not bringing me up um and that all quite clearly affecting me um my only
problem at school was ever the only problem i ever had at school was was my attendance
um and i went from you know leaving primary school with the opportunity to sit the exam for
some pools to at the age of 11 to a pupil referral unit by the time i was 13.
um because of attendance yeah because of attendance and by that point you know at 13 i
didn't really draw uh i didn't really join the dots or draw a parallel between the two things happening but my great-grandmother
passed when i was 13. um and that was very very difficult for me
because she was the person who if she said to me that everything was going to be all right she was the one person i
believed up until that point when i realized that sometimes it isn't um and some of her last words to
me when we were in the ambulance on the way to the hospital where i can't fight forever and i knew at that
point that was her saying hey i've had my innings and she was 90. she had a good innings two world
wars one world cup um i can't fight forever yeah what was she what was she what was
the context of her saying that to you um i believe that was her saying that she had made her peace
you know she she had you know she lived with arthritis diabetes um
we made a good stock though you know to go through what she went through a metal plate in her legs she got run over when
she was 19. um i believe she she was um and this is only stuff i've started to
find out recently she was um placed on a doorstep when she was a baby and she was brought up in
foster care uh her sister wasn't i didn't even know she had a sister until recently
um and you know we talk about ancestral [ __ ] you can see where these things start to
you see these things start and come from and you know the issues that abandonment and detachment cause they're
they're more than just social issues they impact development i can just see
how it a lot of my family experienced a lot of trauma early on from my great
grandmother to my grandmother to my mother to my dad they all had
pretty difficult childhoods my dad ended up in care because he was the six of six
children and his mum walked out um so he was in care for the first few years of his life he was also born a
twin his twin died at birth my namesake my uncle who i never met steven died
when he was 19 went into a diabetic coma and passed away two years before my dad took his own life his brother
took his own life in the same way in the year in between that of them to taking their own lives he lost his
sister to cancer that he was the last possible donor for and he wasn't suitable there
was you know there's trauma's been a pretty the trauma's been pretty constant throughout
almost almost all of my elders quick one starting from the minute the
lockdown is lifted we're going to start bringing in some of our subscribers to watch how this podcast is produced behind the scenes
means you get to meet the guests meet myself and see how we put all of this together if you want that to be you all you've
got to do hit the subscribe button when you think about all that's happened in your sort of generational cycles and
with your elders and then this is me just thinking like
if had i been through that i would i think i'd i'd be overly conscious about how
i maybe unconsciously um can work to make sure that my you know
you've just had a boy right can make sure that it like stops with me right like you know what i mean as much because yeah i mean i see it in my own
family i see that i've there's parts of my parents that i've become that i don't love you know and i don't and i'm and i you
know what and my parents were actually really um un affectionate relatively
unaffectionate and quite vacant i still call them by their first names and i find it really awkward to call them mom and dad like i've
i've never in 27 years looked at my mum or dad and called the mum or dad ever
not once ever never crazy and even like i i i'm not close to them at all and i'm
terrified by the prospect that when i have my kid same thing will happen
um so that's what i want to ask is like i would be like what are you what's your thinking and your like concerns when you think about your child and making sure
those generational cycles end with you um my concerns are uh i mean my concern that
around that to be like 100 honest that there there aren't any um i had i've had
a child years before now i think there would have been many but i've done a hell of a lot of work on
on trying to understand myself trying to it's weird right you spend so much time learning and then you get to a point
where you're like now i've got to unlearn all of this [ __ ] because if you're if
you're fortunate enough to be smart enough to be able to take a long hard look at yourself and you're self-aware which is painful
at times but then you can put your hands up and you can own your behaviors um and you you know you
can take responsibility for your choices and your decisions and you know you go through relationships and i found that points i was finding
the same person in a different body oh yeah yeah and then you know the same problems occur in
the relationship but what's you know what's the common thread throughout that narrative i am the
common denominator so i can't keep projecting my problems onto other people and blaming them for just being
themselves i've got to do some work on myself here things need to change and that well
one thing needs to change me how do i do that i have to understand myself better i
have to understand my behaviors i have to understand my insecurities it's hard to do it is because it's the most this you
know it's that kind of i've never had this anxiety dream i've only ever had the one where i can't stop pulling teeth out of my
mouth like and even in a dream going okay i know i don't have that many teeth but they're still coming out
but it's that whole like kind of all of a sudden you're naked in front of your entire school if you're going to go and see a therapist it look you have to go in and
be honest you can't lie to a therapist um otherwise it won't work and so you
have to explore your deeper most darkest and and frightening insecurities
in order to understand why certain why you have certain behaviors why you
respond so defensively in situations what makes you insecure what did you how
did you go on so that process of unlearning all the [ __ ] you had to unlearn and like turning the lights on i guess
Becoming self-aware - getting older
yeah that started with therapy i think it started before therapy i don't think it i wasn't ready for
therapy until i started to do some of that work myself i think like you similarly i have grown
up uh with the mindset that i can do everything on my own which is uh is it is
it i mean it's definitely helped me achieve a hell of a lot but it it also has put distance between
me and people that it shouldn't have and it's also made it hard for me to develop lasting relationships
in at points in my life um some which you know i i look back on and think i
could have i could have done better i could have been better um all the key things you had to unlearn
through that process though about yourself mine was mainly defensiveness really defensiveness and i kind of want
to i guess the attendance thing is that that played out throughout my life i
found it very very difficult to finish things um and you know so i would always have
ideas i would always begin things i would get to a point where that sort of you know i didn't have my my nana as
she wasn't as present a figure is for me to be able to just go now i've got a tummy ache but i would still get that feeling which would make me want to
withdraw and would make things harder despite that i've managed to kind of use that same energy and this is why i think
you know stress is comes down to perspective because work can be stressed or work can just be work
right it depends on your perception of it and so my anxiety can be anxiety or it can be nervous energy
and energy is what you need to get [ __ ] done and i've done a lot of work around mental
health not least of all because of my encounters with my own problems but also what first made me aware of even the
phrase mental health was that my father took his own life and that work kind of
i think around the conversation of mental health um and encouraging
people to be more open and honest with their sensitivities you should be open to everyone be smart enough to be
open to the people that you can trust because if you're open to everyone that you're opening yourself up to be taken
advantage of um but the word the one thing that goes missing in that conversation or two of
all too often is resilience resilience is incredibly important and i think the only time that you can learn
or become resilient without going through trauma and surviving it is therapy when you're not at a point of
crisis so that's why i was saying i did i had to do some of the work on my own for me to be able to go to therapy
and then be able to grow through that because if you just go to therapy when you're at a point of crisis it's like
waiting until you get sick to go to a doctor you know i try now to take a more proactive you know pro
a proactive approach to my own health and that's not just my physical well-being that's my mental well-being
ultimately they should be one in the same it's just health um but i think we have a very reactive
nature to most things in in in western culture we're not encouraged to be proactive
and we also probably have a foolish sense of optimism about how life will unfold right we think
it'll all be okay our health will be fine we think we'll never really get old because it kind of creeps up on you so
it's crept up on me i'm saying hey andy i looked in the mirror the other day i saw gray hairs i was like what the [ __ ] is going on here
i love it though what makes me laugh right people always moan about getting older yeah and i'm
just i'm very like i i can be quite simple in a matter of fact about things and it's just like well okay
the alternative is you die right that's the only way you stop getting older is you die
so what's you know unless you're biohacking you're trying to lengthen your telomeres um but you know
it's i just think growing old is is great growing older is great if you can do it with with
i don't know with i guess we not just with good intention i've always had good intentions but i've made a lot of bad
decisions i think growing older once you get to a point where you feel happy and comfortable in your skin
is is it makes it easier yeah i'm not stressed about getting older because i'm really happy with who i'm becoming
that's exactly it that's exactly it when i uh this sounds like a [ __ ] weird thing to say i said okay but like when i looked in the mirror of
the day and i saw gray hairs it's funny because the most comforting thought that i had was like
but i'm happy and like you know it's the same thing it's like i'm getting older yeah but i'm happy and
i'm i'm doing myself justice what i mean by doing myself justice is like i'm living my life yeah i'm like being myself yeah and so
i'm happy to get you know the worst possible scenario would be i look in the mirror i see gray hairs and i've been working at [ __ ] kpmg
because my mom said that was a success and i'm like i'm on my way to a midlife crisis i'm not being myself i've not
pursued my dreams if so feel like the clock is ticking but when i look in the mirror because i feel like i'm
i'm living my true self i'm like cool every time i you know they add another number to my age i'm like cool ultimately i'm like
cool because it's because i'm living my you know and that's this sounds like a very
interesting thing to say but it's also one of the things that's made me not fear death like i used to yes i'm scared
of death yeah because i guess it's getting to the point of your life where you feel as though and i
do wonder if this played a part in what my dad did getting to a point in life where you think you can't start over
i'm too old to make the decisions i wish i made um and it makes me it's given me more
i guess more my comfort's a wrong word but like i've always been quite happy to fall on
a sword as long as it's my own yeah yeah and i'm always more
scared about having and look i worked 10 years back speculatively you know as far as music
you know from 18 to 28 it was 28 when i first sold the record i had people around me going come on bro man you've
got a fantastic announced to do um and i just i don't know if there was like a bit of
of self-belief buried beneath all of the insecurities that kept me going or if it was just blind stupidity or a
combination of the two but i kept going because i wanted it so badly and i loved it
i loved it i really really loved it there was nothing in my life at that point that made me shake my hands like
writing a good lyric you know that type of excitement when you nail something you know you're walking around the room
trying to get that last line of something and then you get it and you're like that feeling is not something that i get
from you know many aspects of my life um and so i i continued and
i think it's something that's it's quite it's not the easiest thing to do is it when you've got
especially if you're from a disadvantaged background because you don't have a fullback or a plan b or a grandparent that will die and leave
you inherit and so as you set you don't have that security but at the same time you know i know a lot of people with that security who
don't push for anything and every time i talk to them they've got a different idea and a different business venture but they execute and
achieve nothing because they don't have to yeah yeah yeah it does you know i think there's there's
two sides to that coin you know if you grow up entirely comfortable do you ever want to push
that hard to get to where you want to get to it's interesting because that hunger of not having it is is also an advantage as
is the the you know the privilege of having it i spend a lot of time talking about
huell on this podcast because they're the sponsor of the podcast and i'm also on the board at huell i'm also an investor in the company but
um i've made a transition recently not a transition i'd say an addition to my huel diet i've been drinking the rtd they're
ready to drink yours for a long time now but as summer approaches and as my goals my fitness and my health
goals have started to shift a little bit i've become obsessed with huel's black edition specifically the
vanilla flavor the difference with the black edition is there's 50 less carbs there's 33 more protein in it
zero artificial sweeteners and it's naturally gluten free so if you're
looking to lean up dare i say for summer then try the black edition vanilla
flavor it's really really helped me lean up and i always you know take my top off on this podcast to prove to you i'm not
going to do that today but i take my word for it it's had such a radical impact on um the amount of carbs and
visible fats that you can see on me highly highly recommend trying black edition vanilla flavor if you've
got goals to lean up for summer to consume less carbs and to get more protein
Your dads suicide - mental health
you mentioned your dad there and i watched the documentary you made where you um i watched it i think there
was two separate documentaries that i saw um about the topic and you went on the journey of understanding
him um the life he lived and why he made the choices he he ultimately did can you tell me what you you learned
through that process yeah um quite concisely as well at the point i'm at now and it's that i think the
difference between someone who will take their own life and someone who won't is the ability to tolerate how you
feel at any given time and i've had moments where i wanted to scratch my skin off but i've never
contemplated suicide you know i've never suffered suicidal ideation there's
there's there's a big difference between lows and also i think you know there's
something that's quite scary is the hyper awareness that people have now around everything everything has a tag
everything has a name everything is a condition and i think we're getting to a point now where you
need awareness before understanding and then you know awareness understanding action to me that's
the um the train of things whether it's you know let's keep the depression like i think
now there's a conversation around it but how much is being actioned not enough yet but i do think it comes
down to being able to tolerate how you feel because like i i've
at my very lowest lows i've come out by carrying on and my dad got to a point where where he
couldn't and there wasn't the support around him to to help him in those moments and sometimes i think even if the support is
there that choice is is that person's
it just seems so unthinkable but be lucky for that yeah yeah you're
right i've just spent the longest amount so when i start first started hearing about mental health
which is probably about 10 years ago yeah when i was about i don't know 16 18 maybe the term started to emerge yeah
it wasn't just he's meant or she's made yeah it was you're crazy or whatever yeah and then it thankfully it's the stigma slightly
because it's changed over time and i just have always struggled
to um to understand and this is why it's almost become the strange thing to say
but a bit of an obsession of mine to understand the position someone must be in
to believe that to feel that that is a better outcome for them it's just and this is why it was so
powerful watching the documentary because you know even when you were doing a role play with the the guy in the chair and
you you were being the um the the friend and the guy was sat in the chair he was the you went to the clinic where
they helped people who have having suicidal ideation yeah and and just even in the role-play session i was
like oh god this is unthinkable it's just
something that i think someone who has had the privilege of good mental health will always
struggle to understand and that's a problem because if you can't empathize with it properly we
can't i don't think address it properly you can i think you can empathize without understanding yeah that's true yeah you know and i
think we all too often we we want to fix things soon someone says they're sad you're like come on cheer up yeah that's not
helpful that's what i mean i'm like i'm like okay be upset what's you know let's go through this you have
to kind of go through the upset rather than trying to suppress it yeah as you push things down they coming sideways
yeah um it's i think you know when my dad took his own life
one of the first things i wanted to do was understand how he was capable of doing that and i quite quickly realized the only way i would ever understand how
he was able to do it is if i'm in that situation yeah which i'm never going to be yeah so i let that go quite quickly
um and i don't think it's a good idea to try and i mean unless you're studying psychology and
understanding the workings of the mind which would allow you to empathize i don't think it's good to try and understand you know if
something seems irrational or forgive me for using this word crazy to you you will drive yourself mad
trying to understand it because they are not the workings of your mind and that's not healthy either yeah but
you know just going back to the hyper awareness thing i think people will find themselves in situations where
they will call themselves depressed when actually they've had something traumatic happen or something sad happened you know
something sad happens and your cat dies and you don't want to get out of bed for two days that's not depression you're upset
you're dealing with grief and loss that's normal you know if nothing has happened in your life that's traumatic and
everything seems great but you feel horrendous you know or you can't feel anything then that's something to be
addressed um i think we need to be careful of of everyone diagnosed or not everyone
but people starting to diagnose themselves with conditions that they perhaps don't have i think that's a danger in everything
having to have a tag now and everything needed in the name and you know everyone needing to be put in
the box yeah and and then the way that we treat people in those scenarios when we've misdiagnosed them
or to quickly diagnose them is also unhelpful right i've spent the last six months working
pretty much full time at a mental health company in london called tai and they uh they're a psychedelics company they're probably the biggest in
europe then one of the things that came to learn from working there they're the biggest in the world sorry not in europe um one thing i came from working there
but also from reading one of my favorite books which is up there called lost connections by johanna hari was i used to think growing up that um
because this is what i was told depression was a chemical imbalance in the brain
because something was broken and no one ever told me that trauma or what happened to you can
cause depression so i just you know you'd think okay well and that makes you also almost blame
the victim more so than saying like if it's like what's wrong with you then it's like it's kind of you know
you're broken but if it's what's happened to you it's a much more empathetic approach and also appreciates you know and that
was the big shift that i've experienced in the last like three years was i used to think everything was just chemical imbalance
broken yeah you know and then what comes with that is often how do you fix the chemical imbalance with chemicals
yeah yeah exactly yeah the best prescription in the beginning listen there are some people that will always need medical intervention does help
some people it does but i also think that you know sayings you are what you eat you can eat
yourself into depression you know and all of those things they kind of become part of a self-perpetuating cycle if i feel like
[ __ ] i i don't move as much and then i'll make bad decisions with food and then i feel
about god that's so sad that's so true but it does because especially during this time when people aren't as active
as they were they're not engaging socially as they would have otherwise um you know
you the sales of alcohol went through the roof alcohols are depressing the more you drink the lower you are your
you you know all of these contributing factors that can contribute to negative mental health you know and can
negatively impact your mental well-being um and a great prescription sometimes
is is you know eating better going for a walk you know exercise doesn't have to be a
45 minute hit class that leaves you wanting to not get out of bed for two days because that's you putting your body through another
stress on top of all the stress you're already going through um but just you know movement eating
well good conversation um something i found quite difficult but has become more apparent is my need to
move away from certain people because they aren't moving in the same direction as me and they encourage certain things that
that hinder my growth that's not me moving forward my life has changed and i found that very hard and
you you know we when you talk about grief you instantly think someone's died but
you can grieve parts of your life you know parts of saying goodbye to certain things certain
people in my life has felt like the same loss as yeah you know when i've actually lost someone who's passed away but you
have to do those things in order to grow and to get where you want to to be
and it's it sounds selfish but selfish has so many negative connotations attached to it but
i think you know selfishness not at the detriment of others and selflessness not the detriment of yourself
is good because how else do you like you're no good to anyone if you're no good to yourself
and that was a huge huge learning curve for me and one that i found really really
difficult to execute to start making decisions based upon what was right for me
because i felt obliged to to be here for that person and then doing the same
things as those people um and it wasn't help you know what i mean and it wasn't helping me
it took me back to this time i met this monk world famous monk i said is it bad that i'm focusing on building
my business and making money um right now is that like a selfish thing for me to be doing
when i could be off in africa helping kids and his response to me who's on stage he goes he goes you have to fill up your
own bottle so you can pour it out for other people and i always remember him saying that because it you know what the crazy thing
is when i was 18 i i wanted to i was sat in my moth side in this room and i was sat there thinking steve
you're making a wrong life decision because you know you've got a brain and you know you can like affect change and the fact that you're trying
to build this business and not in africa saving even just one life means that you're being terribly selfish
and my the way that i rationalized myself out of that state of mind which was like stopping what i'm doing and flying to africa was
this belief that if i was to be successful i would be able to help more people one day yeah and it's kind of links to what you
said there about like selfishness in many cases is actually selflessness yeah yeah especially if you you find
yourself in a position later on where you can you know you can you can affect change for the better on a much
grander level you know you have a much bigger stage now i like guys i love a lot of
the stuff that you say most of the stuff that you say and i generally don't like motivational
speakers but i find when you speak it's motivational which is quite different
yeah yeah yeah and it's weird because i don't i i really don't endeavor to be motivation it's like most of the time
i am in the gym and i write something in the notes of my phone and it ends up on the internet so it's like yeah i'm not trying to be and also i'm
not like but that's why i'm works but that's why it works and it's like whenever i did my documentaries i i i
didn't try and tell anyone else's story i was just catalyst for them too it was your truth yeah and it's my
opinions which were formed during the process of the the filming i didn't go into it with and
if i went in sorry if i went into them with any idea it was often changed and my opinion was shaped throughout the course of
that documentary i think all too often people think that by instructing people or telling them how they should live
their lives they're gonna impact change and i don't think that's the best way to engage people i think
people switch off and i think the way in which you communicate is brilliant because you put stuff out there and people can
take to it if if they connect with it and i think because of that they do because it's natural and it's organic
and it's not forced and i think that's really really important and i think you know you talk about i don't think
you have to go to africa in order to impact change because people will be inspired by watching what you do and are
able to achieve and that in itself you almost don't have to you know you you can just do and you
will inspire yeah this is the crit this is a crazy thing and you know the thing we have in our society today with young people especially is they all
want to change the world and they think and genuinely i get this all the time i'll be on stage somewhere and a kid will come up to me that looks
like me a young black kid and he'll be like i want to be a motivational speaker how
do i do and i i know what the right answer is because i know i look at this kid or you know
whether it's one of my instagram dms that wants to change the world because they think i think the way i've
rationalized it is they want to change they don't want to change the world right they want to be seen as someone that
changed the world because of the admiration that they believe they'll get from that because of the admiration that they saw me getting
um so in fact they're they're not connected to the right thing if you're seeking validation exactly if they
wanted to change the world if that was their objective they'd actually just be in a lab somewhere working on cancer for example yeah they wouldn't be
trying to get on the stage right but like you ending up on stage is a product of the
work you've done you never work to get onto that i never wanted never thought about it it was a byproduct of
working on myself and that's exactly yeah so thank you actually because i had lost my train of thought there and you just picked it back up
that was what i'm saying i got on stage because i was focused on something else right and um the way that people go on to
change the world i think is because they work on themselves they fix themselves so that kid my advice probably to him probably would be like
go and like pursue your passions and in fact all of my um idols are on stage because they
didn't copy anybody else they thought they could make you know pocket computers and that black was
equal to white in terms of racial relations martin luther king you know they and they they pursued their own thoughts and their own feelings they they didn't
replicate um people but then that's the we live in an age where people
live almost comparatively you know it's such a shame we have this
incredible thing called the internet where we can communicate with people in any corner of the world give or take and
we use it to post facetune pictures we don't know but you know it's a
there's there's there's a brilliant tool there and and when harnessed and used correctly it it can
bring about good things um and it's like anything you know like i was eating mcdonald's in bed last night
i didn't see it on your instagram really it is on my instagram i'm actually complaining about the absence of fries
in my large fridge on my instagram story last night yep last night i was like let's avoid the
fact that i'm eating mcdonald's in bed and talk about where the rest of my fries are i was devastated
why would a large fries if you're going to get delivered
and then the next one's about gut health balance bro that's hilarious that's great balance is really i think balance is key and i
think all too often like especially with and and kind of moving into this sector now anything
that involves nutrition or or supplementing or i [ __ ] hate hashtag wellness world
man like this it just like that that kind of the softness of that and the the
the approach to life that just having a green juice is going to correct everything it's going to save the world
it's going to save you like [ __ ] do you know it's it's the wrong approach that everything and it i think
everything is too um it becomes quite divisive you know i i
i believe in wellness therefore i'm not gonna indulge in any of the things which i used to find
fun because now i'm going to take care of myself me taking care of myself involves me
having a blowout once in a while with my friends and suffering the hangover that comes with it to remind myself why i don't do
it all the time and the waste of time afterwards because i can't function as as as you know as highly as i would
normally you know um but i just think there's there has to be a balance struck it's it's all too often people write if
you want to you know you can't don't just cut back on me you have to be vegan you know there's there's so much instruction out there whereas
it's all contradictory as well so much fun so much it is man and it's like you know you've got vegans
who will you know i mean is is cocaine vegan how many vegans how many vegans that go out on a friday
or when we could go out on a friday night and we'll do cocaine and you know there's not a gram of cocaine if it actually has cocaine in it it doesn't
have a dead body attached to it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah where are your you know what where's your
where is your morn campus now virtue signaling to at its finest um you talked about your
The last conversation you had with your dad
documentary then i one of the things that when i watched your documentary really stuck out to me was you recounted
the last conversation you had with your dad and um it stuck out to me because
i reflect on my own relationships with my parents and i was it made me think about the last conversation i had with my parents
my parents are getting old especially my dad um can you talk a little bit about that and your feelings towards that conversation now
yeah so my i'd opened i said i would never ever make myself vulnerable as far as my
my dad again um and by that i mean i would never give him the opportunity to let me down
um and then i did uh and it was just before christmas so we
spoke and we agreed to meet up the day after boxing day um i was
sat at the food quarter the shopping center in walthamstow uh my then partner at the time tia i can
remember it so vividly um and i called him to make arrangements for the next day
i wasn't driving he had moved to brentwood um he was driving i said so are you going to come and
see me tomorrow and he was like oh mention the name of his uh wife
um now we don't and said oh you know her and the kids would really love to see you there are stepchildren there of
no relation to me um and i was like this ain't about and this is the first time that i
ever i was always too scared to speak up to him about how i felt because i at times blamed myself or worried that i
was the reason that he would disappear for a year and a half two years at a time and not seen me um so i would never speak up and tell
him how much it hurt every time he did that and this time i went this is not about me coming to play happy families this is
about when i was 18. like this is about you and i sitting down and having a conversation as adults and trying to see if there's a way in
which we can move forward and forge some sort of relationship with trust um and he was like oh
what actually you know what if you if i ever see you again i'm gonna knock you out um and i would
not have bought my eyes out and giving him a hug um but i was right to feel that anger because he had hurt me so
so so much so many times throughout my entire life um and that's what i meant about being
cumulative you know it was that constant it was him being in and out of my life him being the parent that i favored him being such a kind generous
gorgeous man but being such a [ __ ] father you know that was cumulative it wasn't
any one moment it was all of the moments that he wasn't there that he missed that he let me down all the days spent looking out in my
front room window which looked right at the bus stop that he should have got off of a bus at um to come and see me when he never
showed up you know it was all of that that added up to that moment and people are like wow do you wish you
could go back in time and change what your last words to him were no of course not because that
angle was just i know how could i not be that angry why should i feel guilt over
his actions or lack of actions you know i can own that and i'm fine with it and i don't feel like i should
feel any which way about saying that to him because i was me being that angry was justified
i mean like if i don't think a lot of people would have um even been trying to rectify the
situation at that point right and a lot of my friends who won't even entertain a conversation with their
with their biological fathers or mothers because they were absent mm-hmm i have the conversation though
get to a point where where where where you can let go of and don't but the the problem is right they have a
narrative that they have to justify themselves and this is something that i've i've learned so so they have a narrative that
and i still have this with members of my family now if we get into that conversation about
the past they have a narrative which justifies their every choice which makes it okay that they have to
have to live with because i haven't dealt with this [ __ ] yet they're not going to deal with their [ __ ] you know if they were going to deal
with their [ __ ] they would have done it the chances of me getting those people into you know through the door to see a therapist
nil not happening um me taking that step and sorting my [ __ ]
out doesn't mean that i can sort their [ __ ] out it doesn't mean that if i make the room and give them the forgiveness that
they're going to be able to accept that forgiveness and be honest with me because they still have to hold on to that narrative
to justify their decisions because they haven't made amends with their decisions and i can't expect them to yeah they
don't need that i can't and i can't but i can't need that because if i need that i'm always going to be
underwhelmed offended upset let down and bitter and i don't want to be any of those
things not least of all now i have a child that i want you know the great thing is my child is
born into a world where it's me and my partner and she's amazing she's incredible and
has done you know a lot of the same work that i have in order to get to the place where
she's at in her life and we have this peace because we're able to have open conversations we're
able to discuss things rationally we're able to be wrong there's room we make room for each other to be wrong
you know we make room for each other to be upset no matter how irrational we give each
other room and space and time and we're considerate and we're kind and
we don't you know we we try our best not to to revert to a child and be
defensive and offensive because of that um and you know it is why we have had a
child because we feel safe with each other on that point of like moving on so
people in our lives we all have to to move on from things whether it's a relationship whether it's trauma whether it's things that happen but you know
with our parents whatever um people tend to think that you know they use this phrase a lot of my friends
were saying at the other day i just need closure and i i just i remember thinking oh
for your [ __ ] then if you yeah in fact you are [ __ ] because what is closure closure is insecurity about what happened and a lot
of the time especially in romantic situations yeah basically someone has walked out the door with your self-esteem and what
you're saying is i can't move on until they come back and give it to me yeah until they justify why they cheated or they
explained to me you know because it's all and they say i was just i think i wrote on my instagram i was like closure
closure is a choice ultimately closure isn't you know if you need closure close the door yeah you do yeah find closures during
closing the door yeah it is because if you're constantly you're still giving over too much of yourself to someone else
yeah they got keys right yeah like why are you doing that why are you handing over that power to someone who doesn't
even want it anymore they've left yeah you know why are you but then it's also you can people also find themselves
in this situation where they try and take responsibility for other people's actions it's good to take responsibility for your actions
if you've provoked something then you know you can look at maybe being responsible for how someone's reacted because you've
prompted that you've provoked that but trying to take responsibility for someone else's actions you'll drive
yourself crazy because you can't take responsibility for everything that everyone does we all make our own
choices and that again is is not a good place to find yourself and always wanting to understand is like
why why do we have to understand everything people make choices we're complex there are so many variables in our lives the only thing
you can do is introduce less variables and that's been quite easy during the last year because
you know i don't have to walk into crowded rooms for the people that i don't know so when i have socialized when it's been
allowed it's been amongst people that i want to see therefore less variables the situation is more predictable you
know i'm kind of more aware of the outcome yeah and if you you apply that to life you know you
if you we all too often know we we we make excuses not just for
ourselves and i hate excuses um it's why i don't like being late to anything um even if there is a valid reason you
know it makes me anxious i hate excuses but we all too often make excuses for other people
that's just darren you know that's just how darren is but there's gonna come a point where darren just being darren is gonna
have you respond disproportionately because you've not made clear with darren that he's overstepping the line so he's got no idea
and then he oversteps the line the eighth time and you respond but you respond for all eight times at once and darren's
yeah whoa whoa you could have told me the first time yeah you know and we could have had a rational conversation but actually you've allowed it to
escalate to a point where you've you know held on to this thing that darren's done every time he's done it
and then exploded because you're not comfortable having awkward conversations because you find them awkward when
actually if someone can't handle a direct and honest conversation in a rational conversation is that someone that encourages you to
be your best self like i don't want to surround myself with yay sayers or people who deflect or who
hide from things i in my life now cannot i don't have the time for the [ __ ] i really don't it i like direct
conversations i like friendships where we are able to be honest where if my friend you know i don't have
a huge group of friends now i know a [ __ ] ton of people but the people that i do like if i if
someone online calls me a [ __ ] from i don't know greg from skegness i
don't give a [ __ ] he doesn't know me his opinion of me is made up of whatever he's read or seen and the dots
that he's joined he's built the resident [ __ ] he's yeah in his own [ __ ] that he's projecting right but
if my best friend felix says stephen you need to check yourself i'm going to
check myself you know and it's important to have those people around you you need to be able to if you don't have honest
relationships with people and open dialogue they're not real relationships it's hard though when you've had some success right
did you even find that in your own friendship circle i think i found that a little bit where because i i had success and some of my closest
Finding success and leaving people behind
friends actually ended up they worked at my company and that's how they became some of my best friends yeah so i didn't know them before the
company but like what you work with someone side by side for 10 years and they inevitably yeah yeah and
but i was always the boss so i've always i've always worried that because i had that like i was like
the pack leader in my little group of friends that they might not check me all the time when i needed to be checked
right so it's just because they feel like you know best they know i know best and because i've always been like the
boss i've always been yeah like i've always been all in charge i've always been on leading them as well so it's like so for for me stepping into business now
is really important for me to have um co-workers that will challenge me i don't want someone that just goes okay
that's not working we'll stop that i want someone to go yes that's not that is underperforming at the moment but given a chance
in two months you're going to see results from that because you're going to build and grow your audience i need educating on that because that's
not my that's not my forte you know that's not my skill set um and so you need co-workers and
friends that will challenge you you know and i believe in challenge healthy challenge because an opinion is
not an opinion it's an idea until it's challenged you know so if i say you know i believe
we should go this way and you say do you really and then i explain why i've stood on the table for it so now it's my opinion and
i know it's my opinion but up until that point it was just an idea it was a belief but not necessarily a correct one and when you started to see
success in your life were there people in your circle that were friends people you considered to be friends that were
clearly not happy for you one of the best bits of advice i was ever given was by um a
rapper but he was a friend of mine skinny man who said to me a real friend of yours will never be of hindrance to
you and there were definitely people who weren't as comfortable with me not being in the same situation that they were in
doing the same things a lot of people deal with this i got a call yesterday from one of my best friends and he said one of my friends is just complete just unfollowed me on
all the social platforms and i said why is that because well i think it's because like i've started to do really well and he
it's a reflection he thinks it's a reflection on him he thinks it means he's a piece of [ __ ] because i'm succeeding or an attack on yeah this
is just and i i this is a conversation i don't people don't have enough but at any point in your life when you when you divert from the like the path
especially the path that you share with your closest friends quite often there will be some kind of
force from them to try and pull you back to them yep and say who the [ __ ] do you think you are stephen yeah get back in line yeah and have you
did you experience that at any point where especially when your music career started to really take off and it's difficult because you can't take
everyone everywhere um and there's almost an expectation to and i i'm a firm believer in in
opportunity like giving people opportunities and then beyond that it's up to them what they do
with that like i i'm someone who's not i've had situations with people where i've seen
them have opportunities but they've been too insecure to take them because they felt like they're putting themselves beneath
someone else i don't have that problem i want to learn from you if you're further along in your career and i'm
trying to not mimic what you're doing but i want to be successful in the set so you're a musician that's
ahead of me and you're willing to take me on tour with you yeah i'm not going to say no to that because i'm
insecure and i don't want to appear to i don't want to be the support act i'm going to say yes because i want to come along on that ride
and i'm grateful for the opportunity that you're giving me some people don't have that mindset some people don't want to learn from
other people they think they know it all or they're they're ultimately scared and insecure they they feel like they look
smaller by putting themselves as a support or by having someone feature on a song or by accepting help
whereas for me it's always been a you know like when mike's gonna sign me and i had the opportunity to go on tour with him and battle at every stop of his
12 rounds tour when he was at the height of his success you know i didn't feel any which way
about doing that i i was you know i was really really grateful for the opportunity to go along and learn in the same way that when lily
said to me oh let me do the chorus on on just be good to green and we can perform it live at best of all
in front of 60 000 people bro i was still selling cocaine
and you know i'd graduated from weed to coat at that point because i had all of a sudden after i signed to my skin as
record label developed this circle of you know model bookers and musicians and you know who all took it
and weed is large and smells a lot coke is quite easy to move around and you know i would never have got
caught unless in transit so it became quite an obvious decision for me to make because those things were normalized where i grew up
anyway i never sold crack or smack because i don't believe in dealing with people in the most desperate situations they've
ever been in day in day out some good news my debut book happy sexy millionaires just become a sunday times
best seller um but that's not what i want to talk about um i just wanted to give credit where credit is due to fiverr
because all of the assets that i've used to promote the book like the graphics the cover photos assets on instagram some of my stories
have been designed using freelancers on fiverr.com that's f i v e r r.com
it's the most cost-effective way that i've ever found of flexibly expanding the capacity of my
team and the quality of freelancers on fiverr is staggering one of the things i don't think people appreciate enough
is you can actually also extend the time zone of your team by working with freelancers on different
time zones that work while you're asleep not only is your capacity being extended but the hours that you're productive as
a team in the day can be extended and if you've never heard of fiverr or you've never used it for a project there's a link in the description below
click on it check it out if you've got any projects coming up whether it's podcasting or content or websites or branding or a voiceover anything
fiverr is your answer when you think of shoreditch what do you think um people pissing at people's doorsteps
Getting stabbed in the neck
interesting that's my home i was i was i was i was wondering if the just the time
shortage alone would um would make you think about the sky you have ah
it's weird man there's there's like i got hit by a car in 2013 um yeah it was well i got
squashed between two cars i managed to get myself up on the bonnet so it was only my left leg that got caught the bloke didn't realize his car was in
eco because it was a new car so it had his foot on the brake which put the car in eco he took his foot off
the brake as i was walking between two cars and he felt the engine start so he panicked and slammed his foot down but
instead of hitting the brake he hit the accelerator um and that was a far more traumatic event for me
um than being stabbed because that was really unpredictable nothing came before
that that i contributed to um when i got stabbed look when i think i was eight
when chesty someone from my flats who he don't live in the country anymore um
he got bottled and stabbed and one of my powers jamal who's younger than me ran and i might have been nine because i
think james was like seven and he ran and called the ambulance for chesty like this stuff happened you know
um i didn't expect to get that by someone i didn't know
that i had no history with it it was it didn't really feel that retribution for what had just happened
there was a little bit of bickering he said i bashed his mate it was proper stupid young bravado
[ __ ] yeah in cargo um and i just did my ground really was all i
did that was what i did wrong in that situation if you even think that's me doing wrong um in hindsight i could have just gone i
did i didn't barge's mate i said excuse me and i moved past with an open hand in a crowded club i was as
polite and as passive as i could have been and always have been drunk but he was just on one you get me so um
but then i did i stood my ground and in hindsight like now at the age i am and especially with you know having a child and just
thinking about how i want him to grow up and what i want him to understand
being a man to be um you know i could have just gone you know what sorry brav i've been done
with it um but i felt like he was threatening me and i felt like i was right to stand my
ground i didn't expect that five minutes after that he'd walk up behind me and put a broken bottle in my neck
um but at least my my mum and my nan started talking again i heard you called your you called your
nan yeah in that moment yeah so we we were still fighting outside so he stabbed me i managed to
push him out of the way got a club holding my neck together obviously you've got all kinds of
adrenaline running through your body at that point so you're not really aware of the i mean i know i've been poked in the neck and it's not really
if you're going to get poked you don't want it to be in your neck it doesn't you know your chance of survival is not high
um and then we got the fight got broken up i think there was police outside the club i think it was broken up by a plea
the whole thing is a bit blurry to me and then i was sat on there because i ended up getting arrested as well um but
i'm sat on the curb my phone's come out my pocket um and i can see on everyone's faces
you know this is not this ain't going well for me so i asked to pass my phone got my phone
i called my nan and i just apologized for all the work she had put into me that this was how it was gonna end um
she just said you're going to be fine shut up i think she did actually tell me to shut up and she's cockney yeah and she just said
you're going to be fine you're going to be fine um and she came to the hospital as did my mom and they both started
talking over my table that i was on um and it's kind of weird because when i went to hospital i was
treated like i was some kind of notorious gang member that the hospital staff are not sympathetic to my situation whatsoever
bearing in mind i've been stabbed i never say i'm a victim because i don't believe in approaching life as one um but in that
situation i i wasn't there the what's the word perpetrator i wasn't the aggressor
um so it was a bit weird the whole thing you know to just be it be presumed that i was just part of
something that came out of nowhere had nothing to do with no gang nothing no dealing nothing no
no historic problems from anywhere it was just something that happened randomly but no that's not even what i
associate shortage with um as well as pissing up doorsteps i think of new balance trainers and
beards yeah yeah do you know when i listened to that story about what happened with uh that guy in the club it brought
me back to a time which i've never talked about before in my own life where i was in new york in a club and there was two tables in this
nightclub and i was on one of them with a couple of my friends one of the guys that runs mattress
boxing and there was this table of guys from jersey next to us and the guys on my table were talking to
the girls on their table oh yeah and they they became this location so i i know the bouncers in this club because
i get all the time so i said to the owner and the bouncer i was like there's going to be a problem here if you don't move this table and as i'm speaking to
the manager the guy from the table next to me picks up a three liter bottle of vodka and hits me
on the head with it i am surrounded by so i'm so good with
these bouncers like i've sent the man united shirts and i'm like these people know me i'm always in the club i'm always on the same table
that kind of thing big bouncer must be [ __ ] seven foot massive black guy they're my boys we talk about united every time i come in
there like i'm always he reaches over the crowd of bouncers that i'm chatting to just on my table and he hits me with this bottle of vodka
and i go see because i was telling them to i was like there's gonna be if you don't move these two tables let's get i go see and as i'm looking blood
because i'm wearing this cat blood just comes trickling down my face but again i did nothing to instigate
this this situation and i when i was reading about what happened to you and you ended up in hospital and you know it risked your life
i was thinking what's the lesson here how do you avoid these situations where it's variables yeah you know and that's
the thing you walk into a room like that and there there are many variables there's any anything can happen you know
you know and for me i was always like i was always someone that scanned the room i always wanted to know i don't like sitting with my back to doors
never have um i i still have sleep but when i open is why i've always suffered with sleep problems i think because of
and that's my own doing to an extent you know because of some of the stuff that i used to do and i was by no means like
heavy heavy heavy into things i just sold a bit of this in a bit of that because
it enabled me to finance life while i work towards what i wanted to do if there was another commodity that i was
aware of that i could have sold that wasn't illegal i would have done it um and that guy he got eight years right
yeah that was a whole bad situation though because
they moved the trial date when i was on tour so this was two years later that it went to court right
um i get a phone call on the friday when i'm in newcastle and they tell me when
from a police officer and they told me when the trial date is and i just said you know what i'm so far past that you know i really
don't care like i'm not coming to court and they said well we know where you are we know what your
next two tour dates are they were brighter than london i think um and we'll issue a summons
we'll arrest you if you don't come to court yeah um and i cried bro i was in a conundrum
because um see this is where
i've never spoken about this this is where like my moral compass struggled because you
don't snitch yeah they had four other witnesses their dna they had cctv the last thing they
needed in court was me but what did they get from me being there they get press um and then i get told by
my record label my tv plug on my radio plugger that i'll basically be looked at as an advocate for knife crime
if i don't show up at court but that goes against everything that i stand for
um in hindsight it's crazy because if i didn't grow up where i grew up why would i care about that i didn't do
anything wrong in that situation but i didn't want to be there i didn't want to be there
um the whole thing like it it still troubles me now you know
because it's like you can't have one foot in one for art it's like who are you and what do you stand for
bro i've been arrested before i was looking at time when i was just before i started to my skin as record label
and at that point there were other people involved if i was a snitch i would open my mouth then but i found myself in
an impossible situation i'm like i nearly lost my life and now i'm being told that i'm gonna lose everything that i've worked for
if i don't go to court when i got stabbed but then it's gonna and listen i've not
lost a friend over it you know there are people i don't know that have made comments
um never when i've seen them everyone's all cool bro um but it it's weird you know it's still
even to this day it doesn't sit well with me i haven't so for all the work that i
have done and all the distance between me and certain things that that i still wrestle with because i was leveraged and it's kind of
mad to think that you know in that situation they would
have and i mean you only had it was crazy they wouldn't even so even
to just move the trial date to or you know for the trial to just happen during my first headline tour so
i would have missed two gigs as well for which there was no insurance and at that point and you won't like to hear this as good a as good a business
as you are i was actually in two record deals and it was costing me about 10p to earn a pound um so it wasn't like i was you know i
wasn't in a situation where i could i could weather that storm and this these weren't times where where you know that sort of publicity
was good publicity it there were no rappers on the radio by like me tiny
chip and and tinchy it weren't you know it wasn't a given that you could be a
successful artist we were really just opening them doors so any negative attention was not not
just hurting me but about shutting doors for other people as well but here we are you know i had to go to
court and it's not you know i never imagined testifying to be something that i would ever do but in that situation you know i kind of
used to see that as a black and white thing but i guess there's some shades of gray in between
someone stabs me in the neck on that caught 10 minutes early
and that's how i should feel you know it just but then i also think about all the
other [ __ ] that i've had with the police and all the stuff that i've you know that friends have gone through and look some if you bring it on yourself and you
put yourself in a situation and you've got police who abide by the laws that they enforce all well and good that's what they believe
you know but there's a lot of police that that don't um and i've had you know further
troubles i got nicked in 2013 and was rebuild and rebuild lied to in part disclosure lost over a
million pound in endorsements because of one being a you know he had a being his bonnet um
and i was arrested for something i was never charged for but that never made the papers everything else did
um so i don't really understand i'm not saying all police are like that please have a purpose but when it's when they take it it's when you
know they start to act out personal grudges that you kind of question and the police
please the police right yeah that's the problem that we have um but i don't wanna i don't wanna i
don't know don't wanna be better yeah i remember listening to your music when i was in
How did you manage to make it over others?
when i was in secondary school a lot and i remember listening to a lot of your records more recently as well and even you know like as as when i know you
were coming in today i started like going back through my back catalogue of your music um at the time when you made it
as you said then in the uk in the uk hip-hop scene as a white male
that's a [ __ ] staggering accomplishment like do you know genuinely it is i'm like i know a lot because you might
not know this but you're from the jump off days yup and i'm all the don't flop boys they're all best friend friends of mine
like i don't think you know unanimous i don't know if you know who you know
they used to come to my house sometimes for five days in a row and like stay at my house and they'd rap and stuff i used to write music back in those days
as well but watching how talented a lot of these people are at what they do and still a lot of them haven't made it
like you did yeah makes me beg the question it's like what were the factors that came to play to make sure that you as a white rapper in the uk scene
got through um did you know what just persistence really persistence persistence i just
didn't stop you know there were so many full starts as well certainly to mike skinner's record label me and him me being lazy
not working as hard as i should have when um during the period when i signed to his label um and i can put my hands up and say
that but us also biting heads and not agreeing on music up until a point and then just as we did and he sent a really kind email and he
was like look i've been spending too long trying to make you into something that you're not rather than focusing on what you're good at
just go um and it was almost at that point when warner pulled a financing from his label they were
subsidizing his label they moved everything in-house apart from all of this the rest uh sorry i think it was six seven nine
uh was the label they kept and they moved that in-house and then they they pulled the finance in from the rest of their subsidiaries because of napster
and limewire you know that the money they were seeing had had fallen subsequently because of all the piracy
um so the album never came out for two reasons because the label lost their financing because i
never worked hard enough um and then after that i went back to what i knew
um and what facilitated me being able to continue my my quest to become a successful
musician which by the way i thought would absolve me of everything in my past yeah and just make me happy what did you
find out uh i was bullshitting it what stupid [ __ ] idea that was um so
you thought that becoming a successful musician would make your part would put your pass at ease basically yeah just you just you
and this is what's dangerous about pinning um your happiness or your your hopes of happiness on an ever
moving goal post that quite often you move yourself if i sell this many records i'm going to be happy and then you sell that many
records and then it's like okay if i get a number one single i'm going to be happy then you get the number one single
and then it's like well what's next you talked about this earlier you said about how you've got to enjoy the moment more yeah or else you'll never enjoy like
yeah yeah how do you do that though in the moment um in the moment i don't like so for me i'm just
it's just it's been a really really long journey towards not
you know going back to the corners you can't see around this it's just taking it for what it is it's like i'm here and i'm
i'm entirely present my head is not worrying about the meeting that i've got to go to afterwards i'm aware of it because i've seen my
schedule but i'm not thinking about it and i used to like i would lay in bed and my mind would be
spinning spinning spinning about everything that i had coming up there's no like it's good to plan like
and i find you worry more if you don't plan but i try and look at you know i don't look at my calendar too far ahead
anymore because it doesn't help me you know i i want to be present i want to be able to be here and have a
conversation with you to look you in the eye and talk to you without having another [ __ ] in my head you know an empty head and an open
heart man that's that's that's how you're present and they're not the easiest things to achieve when we all have so much going
on in our lives and when we're always so like ambitious because when like as you say the moving goal post analogy i really like because
i will achieve something today but before the day of even achieving it i've already set the new goal do you know what i mean and so
you never experienced the achievement and i've i've actually since leaving my business one of my mentors said to me is like you just need to
he's that old and he's done it all and he's way more successful than i'll probably ever be and he was like the one advice i'll give you steve is just like
try your very best to enjoy it in the moment yeah because you look back on it with you know rose tinted glasses and you
you know you wish you would just savoured it more yeah but you can enjoy it in hindsight and it is what i was saying earlier you look back on it and
you go wow i did that but actually it's the the accolades are not that important
the the rewards are are there they're part of it if you're lucky enough to achieve
but the process is the part of it that you have to enjoy and that's the i think that's the
struggle that's why a lot of people don't necessarily find themselves that happy because they're not in
situations where they're happy to be doing the work that they're doing to get
to where they want to be and that's perhaps because they're in the wrong place where they want to be and what they're doing to get there don't you know they
don't marry up and we're fortunate we do things we love we get to pick and choose that's that's uh you know i was going to
say that's lucky but it's it's not it's hard work and perseverance what do you worry about then these days
um i mean most recently in the last two weeks it's been like is that noise that my son's making in his sleep
normally so for context uh steven's just had a new kid yeah um a new baby boy yeah which is amazing
my first child um and really you know
just i mean yeah just the thing the things that i encounter day to day
i i'm not really too i don't know man like it's weird to be at this point in my life in my career
about to sign a new record deal to me putting music out again but to not have that like my energy is different i'm just
excited in being able to have a route to market i've had all this music that because of
some stupid problems i had with uh the label i was with that i couldn't put out i wasn't able to
to to exercise that part of you know what i did and that i missed
terribly because that's my output that's my creative output you know i enjoy working on all the other things i'm doing whether
it's a gulp or gizmo anything all the ideas that i have that i you know will hopefully come into
fruition later on that i'm chipping away at behind the scenes but music is my output that's my hobby
it always has been so when i get suppressed and i'm not able to to to work on music or or release music
and they kind of go hand in hand because it's kind of weird working on music that you know you can't release or that you know someone is standing in
the way of you that you don't feel as motivated to get in the studio and work whereas now i'm like i know but
i'm not worried about how it's received i'm just really happy to be able to put music out my worries are not not what they were all the
things i used to worry about i you know i mean i i don't have financial security yet
and i'm in a much better place than than i could have been growing up where i grew up it wasn't what was expected
um but you know i have to pay my mortgage i have things like that but there's you know they're not worries i have to work to pay you know that's again you
know work can be a stress or it can just be work you know my mortgage can be a stressor it can just be a mortgage
i just have to work there there's quite simple things that i have to do in order to pay my mortgage you know so i try and
not get bogged down by by the everyday [ __ ] my worries are uh just whatever pops up and and are
they worries you know am i getting to to know a child like am i holding my child correctly
things like that that they're they're my current sounds and your new record deal um i i'm
Your new phase of life
super intrigued to hear how different your music will be now that you've you're in a new phase of
life right yeah and surely that will be reflected in what you produce yeah i think there's uh you know we've
spoken about grief and loss and letting go of things throughout this whole conversation and i
think there's part of professor green that he's still there that still wants to be
a lippy little [ __ ] that still wants to poke and prod and
i don't know in the age of cancer culture i probably need to watch my mouth but it's not something i've ever been good at
but then there's also the more mature side then i think there there will be a point between now and perhaps an album
that i have in mind that i've started working on that there's a bit in between where i need to just get a little bit of that
angst out and i think there is a transition to take place that will happen throughout the music
because things are different and when can we expect to hear this music um i'm having something out this summer
whether i can tour it or not due to carving who knows but amazing how do you feel about that
must be must be all kinds of feelings bro just
happiness yeah yeah proper because i've been sitting on this music for ages and then having the conversations with the label
that i may sign to they hear the music and they pull out the songs which i would have hoped they do you know and they're not necessarily the
most obvious and it's kind of cool to have that or the beginnings of that working relationship um
and it it makes me excited about the music that i've been making and i've been sitting on which sometimes you know
these songs are not new to me but they will be to everyone else so to have someone kind of re-light that fire it's amazing yeah
and a gulp a gulp so i'm gonna try this now explain to me what it is while i try it okay so i have a whole lifetime
of gut issues um most recently in 2017 i had an operation to repair a hiatus
hernia oh sorry i should have done this a bit more
and when i came out of hospital after the the operation went well
there's the gulp yep yummy when i come out the opera i come
out of uh surgery and the surgery had went well but i had terrible complications i had distension alias um
collapsed lung pneumonia crp which is an information marker of 672 which is
i understand the looks on the surgeon's faces um and i nearly cropped it and then i
the the alternative the op sorry the options that i had were more surgery or leave hospital with a paralyzed stomach
and just hope it got better over time and so i didn't want to chance more surgery because i was more likely to
have the same complications again so i started looking at ways i could treat myself more holistically
um and this was an education for me i found myself down at every rabbit hole you know i've been down every rabbit hole you could ever imagine and then
and continuously still researching actually what i found out is the more consistent i was with looking after my
gut by the mcdonald's um is that the the better my mood was the more consistent my mood was
the better i slept the better i felt the more consistent my energy was and it's just it's unbelievable how
how much your gut health contributes to every other pillar of of your well-being and how much your
gut health is also impacted by them so your sleep impacts your gut your gut impacts your sleep it's it's all interconnected so what
exactly so i've just i've just had one of these um sachets that i've got here in front of me yeah i go up and
what is this going to do for me in like dumbass terms in dumbass terms so that's
feeding your gut um bacteria what it needs to thrive and it's also packed with vitamins that
support your healthy gut lining sure you know which help prevent or repair a permeable
gut and how often do i take one of these every day every day everyone a day yup okay a lot of people have got issues and
they don't understand why i'm one of them i've probably in the last increasingly over the last five six seven years i've got
this sort of clear intolerance to something it's definitely like i can't eat bread pasta without feeling it for
like two three days um and i and it's weird because i just kind of trundle through life
feeling like [ __ ] sometimes and not really doing anything about it or getting tested or
yeah that's the thing with like i think especially with gut health and there's there's just health problems in general
like a lot of people go through life just feeling run down because it's because we're not edgy yeah and it's
it's just accepted and i think that's that's a real problem and i think there's a lack of education and that's a
really important part of a gulp you know it's not just us trying to sell these sachets it's the educational piece which is
really important because people should understand what they what they can do in order to
thrive it you know you can live and be alive or or you know you can you can optimize parts of your health
and well-being so you don't have to have that trip to the doctors rather than i'm i'm all for proactivity whether it's
your mental health or your physical health you said to me before we started recording that you um
How have you found the business world
you spent your whole career like being the product yeah and now you're you're the guy in the boardroom yeah the
proverbial boardroom on the other end of zoom um what's that change been like now you're an entrepreneur running a business
um dealing with all of that [ __ ] i'm so happy you said it no i mean it is
[ __ ] right there's like copious amounts of [ __ ] when you're running a company um how have you found that process
business for me i think things are all too often over complicated um and i there will always be problems
but it's like solutions i like solutions for me it's it's been a pretty steep learning curve but i enjoy learning i'm happiest when
i'm learning and i'm learning an awful lot um and it's it's quite nice being in the engine room
um it's nice to have ownership you know that's something that i haven't really had as an eyes
what parts do you hate what parts do i hate i see i like problem solving but sometimes when problems present i don't
like being presented with problems when there's not even an idea of a solution sure and i think there's if you take half an hour
between making between finding out the problem and making me aware of the problem you can probably have thought of
something that can contribute to the solving of that problem um and the immediacy the panic
i don't like panic i don't want a power you know i don't want the culture in our firm to be one of panic you know i want people to take
ownership i think ownership's important i think accountability is important um and not to be punished
just so as you can own it put your hand up grab [ __ ] it but i fixed it and take some [ __ ] pride in that
and there's a certain type there's several types of people i'm sure you'll encounter in your business where you've got one type of person who i usually say
from a business partner they will like solve the problem and handle it before they even come to me and they'll
just come to me and say steve by the way this has happened but don't worry i'm on it fix it don't worry i love that type of person i'm like promotion
promotion promotion and then this other type of person who'll be like steve the office is on fire the office is on fire i'm all gonna
die and they're just screaming in my face like the office is on fire and you're gonna die and i'm gonna die and it's all
over we're finished we're [ __ ] we're [ __ ] yep and that person can never be a manager because if they can't manage themselves
they can't manage anyone else here and i and this is a hiring thing because i've seen both in my business
and i will always promote the people who caught they grab hold of problems
extinguish them before i even realized it was a problem amazing amazing individuals
but then you wanted to have i think there's a third person as well and and and that's where apathy comes into
it and it's like they're um the room's on fire and i'm watching it burn but i don't really feel any need to leave or
to tell you yeah we can just die here but you know we won't even worry about putting the fire out
yeah yeah yeah that's the problem even worse i prefer the panic over the absolutely
it's like he's like do be panicked yeah and please try and find the solution before you know not that i want to wash my hands of all
of it i want to work i want to understand that's one thing i've always been as meticulous with anything that i've done
outside of music as i am with every word that i write i think you know i i saw a post that you put up about the
details yeah and i i agree and you know this whole the devil's in the details and
people get really annoyed with me or can get annoyed with me throughout my
life in every aspect of it being really obsessive over the manuscript but that's that's
[ __ ] important those little things i agree wholeheartedly you know again cumulative all of those
little things add up to make that one big yeah and for me especially in brand comms
like i want it to be communicated in a certain way because and our communication has been my thing i talk
through my music and i want to talk through my product in the same way yeah i i was just very detail-orientated
my whole life but i think the problem i had is i never really explained to the people that i was talking to why i cared so much about details
so i'd say look that's not right well that little thing there is that symmetrical and i the amount of times that i've got a ruler out in social
chain my company and i'd measure something to check the millimeters on both sides of it and those little things i think people
think you're being anal or whatever but it's it's a philosophy yeah that if you have within yourself about
high standards being obsessant about detail as i said in my post yesterday it's those that those small details
culminate to great things right so i'm just like these days i don't give a [ __ ] like i i'm i want to be detail-oriented i want
people to feel that i'm so detail-oriented that they won't show me something until they've been equally detailed and
orientated yeah and that's kind of a culture and a philosophy of weakness is the right type of culture it's caring
yeah you know we're a very small team you know we've we've been hitting some pretty punchy targets month and months since we launched in october
yeah ahead of our first race oh wow um yeah yeah big balls either that or i'm a
[ __ ] idiot um i did wonder but it's that that's the culture that i want to promote and
it's like you have to i like what you said because i think it's important you can't just keep pointing out what's wrong you have to explain why it's
important that it's right you know not just saying that's wrong fix it i think it's important that if
you know how to fix it you explain how to fix it but also why it needs fixing you know people should be learning on
the job all the time so as they can grow into roles that they may never have been employed for um you know i've grown into
a position i don't think i was i was you know ever you know as a child probably looked at
being destined to be you know not from where i was from um and i'm continuously growing into
that role because i want to learn and i have to i have to keep learning otherwise i don't
see the point in continuing that to me is like you know people talk about about death
death to me is is is losing that that i don't know just just not being curious not wanting to learn
not wanting to understand yeah i see that's something i've come to learn as well you know you talked about
the goal post moving and that and the importance of curiosity it's one of the things i talk about in my book is like
i came to realize at some point that my life the purpose of my life was probably just to keep myself in like forward motion
of like chaos that's the way i describe it it's like i used to think stability was chaos and careful stability now i
know that my stability is actually being in chaos which is exactly what you said there like being curious being challenged
um until i die someday and like which happens to all of us yeah yeah some some sooner than others if
they they don't get to ever really live look after their gut health yeah there you go well listen steven
thank you so much for coming here today you know your story is remarkable because um you're someone that is like unashamed
unashamedly honest about everything and that transparency and honesty has helped [ __ ] i can't even imagine the amount
of people it's helped even the the rawness and the openness of you doing that documentary i mean you see it on the documentary you
see how being open and honest and expressing yourself can save people and i know you're i know
you're [ __ ] i think of all the guests i've sat here with i think if there was one guest who i think has probably saved more people from themselves from
their thoughts it's got to be you so it's a great tremendous uh service you've done to
get rid of when people say kind of no but it is like getting my belly button right now but i was watching it and i was thinking
you know this is exactly what the world needs especially at the time when it came out and uh
in terms of people that have the experience to to say these things you know you're a rapper you know i mean do you know
what i mean it's it's rapper documentary exactly at that point like the perception of you
when you made that documentary was like this is a tough guy rapper that comes from you know the ends or whatever and for you to be talking about those things in
the same way that rio ferdinand crying and crying right having the having the the i'd call it courage but you know
it's a strange word to use but having the courage to be that vulnerable i think is just such a tremendous service you've done so
thank you because you know i just think it's like the most important thing is you've been part of a change uh
you've been part of this change over the last couple of years in mental health and men specifically talking about how they feel
and that is [ __ ] how that is a moment i think we'll look back on in history and say
like thank god we realized that you know i hope so i think we need to really encourage
people to to stop applying behaviors to genders you know i shouldn't have to be called a girl for being sensitive why
should only women be afforded the right to be emotional or emotional beyond anger yeah
thank you brother i appreciate you thank you good pleasure thanks
[Music]
um [Music]
you

Intro
russell kane he's known as a multi-award-winning comedian presenter actor author and scriptwriter
but man this guy is so much more i started doing all this biohacking and to
survive on less sleep to not lose your hair or to slow down the aging process
it [ __ ] my life in the proper sense everything fell apart like a junkie how can i get more of that
my relationship with my girlfriend fell apart my bill started to not be paid i started to look thin
it's the closest thing to a drug addiction i've ever experienced
[Music] russell kane he's known as a multi-award-winning comedian
presenter actor author and scriptwriter but man this guy is so much more he's
genuinely deeply intellectually curious something that honestly surprised me and this sounds like it might be a
offensive or a weird thing to say but i'm going to say it anyway i didn't realize how smart this guy is
remarkably self-aware and on to top it all off brutally honest he says that how it is
he has an ability to point out things that i think most of us muggles miss and he's also genuinely just a really
nice and hilarious human being today you won't hear many jokes this is the more serious side of russell cain
Your Dad
and a side of him that i did not know and would not have guessed before speaking to him so without
further ado i'm stephen bartlett and this is the diary of a ceo i hope nobody's listening but if you are
then please keep this to yourself
[Music] russell hello one of the things i read when i was um reading about your story
was a quote um and i'm gonna read the quote to you you said i remained a boy while he was
alive even when i was 18 and i needed to be a man to tell these stories
what were you talking about when you said that um well i don't think that's true of just me i think any
boy or probably girl who has a reasonably overbearing and dominant father you sort of remain
a child now that i'm a father myself i can see that's true so when my daughter mina is 40 she's still gonna be my my baby so
that's the positive side of it the negative side of it is if it's quite an overbearing masculine
energy you saw i felt sometimes a bit like a bonsai like i kept nearly growing
and then the roots were trimmed so i was fully grown but small so if my dad was in the room you know i
was instantly a child like i would say inside so it's just a very dominating figure and i
think that would have been the same had my dad not dropped down dead from a heart attack years ago i think that would have been the same
when i'd been 40 50 60 if my dad had been 90 year old shouting in the corner probably still would have been like that
even if he wasn't in the room no no when as soon as what in his presence i think but so far as this
that i think that quote might be talking about stand up yeah i wouldn't have dared to tell the funny stories about him while he was alive i
don't think just on the risk he he was offended or you know there'd be consequences
what was he like for anybody that hasn't read you about your story um steroid taking shaven headed
silverback doorman right wing angry council estate working class barbell
curl semi-professional bodybuilder lifeguard sheet metal worker lager nutter by lager i don't mean someone who
gets on it i mean someone who puts the insulation on the outside of pipes the hardest job you can imagine crawling
in boilers ripping out asbestos fiberglass cut hands white transit van gaal it away
just massive shirts tail this is when he's taking steroids that was before i was born shirts tailored
trousers splitting hulk like at the thigh just a force of meat called dave that was my dad
actually call dave dave actually called dave from essex um so yeah he was just very old school
so even though he's like more like someone who was born in about 1920 he had sort of the
politics and the attitude very unreconstructed masculinity quite knuckle draggy but
just would just worked himself to death to provide barely raised his voice at me and
certainly never laid a finger on me but didn't didn't need to i find the truly terrifying cockney can
just give you summer you [ __ ] get in near now and you're you're done i i i i
actually pissed came out of my body once when he spoke to me like that really i literally pissed myself i was
i'd thrown my brother on the bed and he was crying and there's nothing scarier than hearing though on the stairs if you've done
something to your brother or sister and you know your dad's coming up the stairs and he's like what happened what
have you done your brother had to piss myself and that guy never laid a finger on me
that's power my mom definitely laid her finger i don't think i would have been scared
of her if she didn't but i was [ __ ] terrified of my mum like but she she would beat me like but
my but i couldn't imagine how she could have achieved that same objective without
hitting me with something it's it's it would be analogous of the nuclear deterrent threat if you know i've got nuclear weapons i
don't need to fire them for you not to attack me so i know i knew my dad had whereas i just sounds
incredibly sexist but the reality is once you're a 14 15 year old lad you're the same size as your mum there
are no you know wearing the nuclear weapon she's got to put her money where her mouth is but haven't you got to know how nuclear
weapons work to to know that they're i just
to be honest with you my dad's giving me so many positive things it's just that the negative things are funny so that's why i talk about them
disproportionately but to teach someone i'm five foot ten like a pepper army with hair on but when i stand on
stage i don't need to hit people or shout they they sit in their seats and some of them
in the front row [ __ ] themselves if i even look at them so who have i learned that from it's partly my craft
but it's partly also what a good teacher has uh what a good dad has like my dad and
what a good stand-up has male or female that authority to stand there and hold a room
with a reasonable tone in the voice pin drop is powerful it's harder for a mum to do
that particularly where i grabs a lot of single mums um when you've got teenage lads that are sort of thinking what you're going to do
it becomes like an arms race where the mum starts hitting the legs and hitting the face and it's needed because that's what the
mum's got to work with i suppose that's why that's why i do believe this is so sexist and old school but i do believe if not a man
two parental figures in in place one who can play the badass doesn't matter if it's two women two men whatever i think if you've got two
it's double the force raising a child takes a village you i remember you know
the way you've described your dad is um is quite different from who you are today and who you are over the last
10 years i mean yeah and almost the antithesis and i remember reading about the fact that you took a dna test at some point
i took a dna test just out of curiosity because i'm big into science i wanted to know what diseases i
was carrying i've always been fascinated about my ethnic makeup because my family history starts in living memory i'm obviously a
little bit darker than i should be to be a brit you know i thought i wanted i was interested to know what was
in there but part of me did go what if this is the moment i discover my dad's not my
my dad it did cross my mind which is totally absurd sorry mum if you're watching um because he was blonde hair
blond curly hair blue eyes very wide um it's just that which is not
nothing in common my brother is the spirit of my dad but i'm like i'm not my mum just energetic pepper army with hair on
running around bouncing out of bed stick first thing in the morning and like in terms of like generational cycles
where did your dad get it from so he always used to say to me i never had a dad
so why about okay so then my mum would my mum would say so you've got to understand your dad didn't get taught how to be at my mum's game
man your mom didn't get talked your mum did your dad didn't get taught how to be a dad so he just know what he
didn't know how to be around babies he's never learned that sort of thing he never he didn't have anyone to guide him so
quite a rough childhood his dad walked out on him when he was about i think he was about two
and my dad's mom's hard as nails he's eastenders well his essex back then
barking and it was just a tough childhood you know tough east london
essex childhood where you you just survived basically and uh he he had a lot of
dreams i think he would have liked to have gone the same way i did he was quite a good-looking bloke so he got scouted for modeling and things like
that he pursued that for a bit he'd pursued the professional bodybuilding even tried to stand up i think like a
pontins or a butlins he tried a little bit of acting only for a couple of years and then he went into the hardest
i think of all the manual labour you can do which is sheet metal and insulation so that like
i say crawling along pipes and all that so there's a lot of bitterness a lot of unrealized dreams a lot of abandoned by
your dad a lot of hardness and negativity there from the childhood and that plagued him his whole life
so if we were on a beautiful four-star holiday to minorco and the sun shining part of him would be thinking about the
five-star holiday he could have i'm not like that at all how did you know how did you know he was thinking
that well he would voice it half the time how what would he say uh yeah it's all right imagine if i get
the big job imagine if we would come back he'd be quite positive on holiday actually but he was like just imagine julie if we
if we had more math my mom of course julian dave if we had more money that house we could have and my mom would be like dave we
bought our own council house thanks thatcher it's a big house the biggest house in the street we've got pillars out the front yes it's
a former council house we've got pillars we've got a swimming pool in the garden three beautiful bedrooms lovely bathroom
massive house dining room front room two healthy sons at the point my brother was very unwell by the time he was 17
but at that point what was there to be negative about my it's hard job my dad did but good money but he couldn't see that he
could just see his mate who started a glass company and now his son drove a lambo and he lived in chickwell and
i don't and when my dad passed away we were going through the shed at the bottom of the garden and i found his
diary and it was lit it was honestly it was one of the few things that made me cry when he died because i sort of toughened
up to help with the funeral all that because my brother was ill by then and uh it's just rained today didn't get
the job [ __ ] day james being a can i swear yeah james being a [ __ ] and that's my brother
[ __ ] day [ __ ] curry it was like the diary of someone in prison that's what it was like it was
it's so weird that someone could be rich and not know it i love making money don't get me wrong
but i'm really good at enjoying what i've got so i've enjoyed every level of my comedy journey
and i've never been bothered about whether i go further or not because i feel like if you can have two banging holidays a year
and you love the house you're living in and your family is healthy done he was engaging in upward social
comparisons right the whole time and if you do that you're never going to be happy absolutely and you see that with people in in my profession that are earning a
million pounds a year two million a year when they're in debt because they're buying an ap watch every week and they're going to the maldives
four times a year and they've got they're in a 10 million pound house so they should be in a 5 million pound it's ridiculous
that's consumerism but it worked on a more micro level so we would if we're going to stanton
airport to fly to menorca traffic's probably going to be [ __ ] on the way to the airport i bet you the traffic will be [ __ ] so we're already
he's pre-imagining the traffic jam will be in if we hit a traffic jam [ __ ] knew it
holiday we'll probably miss the flight holidays [ __ ] julie i [ __ ] told you we should have gone for i [ __ ] told you he didn't shout maybe
he would shout to himself sort of thing did you ever figure out where he learnt that behavior where that came from no idea like i said it was just
all the bitterness and negativity and expecting things to go wrong that was his tape his script so if we
were in a restaurant and i'd be seven years old and i'd spill a glass of water not coke or anything so
he's not gonna get sticky legs he'd be like water everywhere a [ __ ] meal ruin i've got to sit here like i
pissed myself for the entire movie it'll be like the worst thing in the world has happened like someone at that moment's probably found
a lump on their body but to my dad the worst thing that can happen so he i felt sorry looking back now
you've got you've got to feel compassion and love because it was just a constant tide of
self-hate and negativity basically and imagining if we go and buy um something from ikea
that needs putting up you know a screw will be missing and it's because i'm me because i'm cursed the [ __ ] screw will be missing
Are you worried you'll turn into your Dad?
you can guarantee it [ __ ] that all the time so for a little boy growing up you've got to work
really hard not to absorb that i i see hints of that in my dad especially as he got older a
little bit more negative about everything moods you know seem to be irritable at a lot of things and one of the things that
crossed my mind was i hope this isn't genetic like how do i avoid
becoming this guy when i get to that age has that crossed your mind that the generational cycle might
continue to some degree without you noticing obviously yeah i mean see him so my
brother i don't i can't really go into my brother's illness because he's literally not well enough to consent for me to talk about it
otherwise i would happily discuss it because it's an important subject to talk about but he's got some severe mental health issues let's just leave it there so my brother's
really sort of unrefreshingly unaware of his mannerisms and gestures and postures if you like
and it's just like my he's like my old man so how can your like the way
your voice and the cadence of a sentence and the glances and the way you you say no i mean and stuff like that it
is my old man so i mean on some genetic level there are copies of how we express ourselves there must be
but apart from maybe your height
i can't think of anything you can't change with loads of loads of ways education
cognitive behavioral therapy if you need it i never have but you can um you can work on the way you eat your
diet your lifestyle all of those you know genetics is not destiny one of the most fascinating things you can look
up is identical twin studies over and over again you'll get one twin that's two inches taller than the other
where he's had a more successful not two inches but it might be an inch taller where he's had a more successful life
eating better food so you can literally grow taller they're they're genetically identi identical so you can't tell me i'm
destined to suddenly be negative about traffic jams if two identical twins can be different in height you must be able
to push against behavior you see that film through identical strangers yes fantastic yeah amazing
absolutely fantastic yeah yeah made me upset yeah it's inspired chris you know the
ending is obviously tragic but uh yeah really powerful film and i think that shines a light on how it does
it gives hope for all of us that you're not you're only 50 of your dad and 50 of your mum and uh
although you're actually slightly more of your your mom i've learned how anyway but um so you don't you're not if you're
only 50 if twins aren't destined to be the same you're not destined to be the same as a
parent it's it's it's bad it's a bad way to think particularly if it's a negative it's a good way to think if there's something you want to copy tell yourself it chant
it you want to be more like my mom she's such a cool cat or whatever we we have also grown up in a slightly
different culture especially in the last sort of 10 20 years where we're much more aware of our psychology right and our and our and how trauma and
childhood experiences have shaped us as adults whereas i think my dad probably didn't know so it was like
someone back there in the control room running the show without him and he was just a puppet to the [ __ ] he'd been through whereas we are kind of a bit
more open as a society now so yeah that that's my biggest learning men's mental
health comes on the spectrum it doesn't mean mentally if we have mental health everyone has men if we have physical health we have mental health
even if you have no issues that's good you are mental health so mental health runs on on a spectrum
to people that are cooking on for hobbs like me and you hopefully all the way down to people like my
brother who are severely severely ill with cognition issues and people who are severely ill or
people who are trapped in time like our dads before an awakening they don't have
insight into their current state if you do not have insight into your condition you are
screwed because if you're let's say for example schizophrenic without insight into the fact you have
schizophrenia you will not take the medicine you just won't take it you'll look at the pill and go well i don't
i'm not healed so you'll you'll be in assisted accommodation your entire life if you're schizophrenic but know you
have schizophrenia chances are you can have a relatively normal life because you know i'm i need to take my medicine and that
but you can translate that thinking to any aspect of business or commerce to
stand-ups to entrepreneurs because i've noticed i call it black box thinking from the matthew syed book
How do we become more self-aware?
the moment you can have insight into a stand-up routine or into a business proposition in a
proper way where you can look it and go that doesn't work you're going to be successful people that don't have insight into themselves
in their personal lives they end up single they end up in unhappy relationships because they can't see their own thoughts they can't insight into
themselves and go this quick one starting from the minute the lockdown is lifted we're going to start
bringing in some of our subscribers to watch how this podcast is produced behind the scenes means you get to meet the guests meet
myself and see how we put all of this together if you want that to be you all you've got to do hit the subscribe button
i mean this is just an impossibly tough question yeah because we're talking about self-awareness really right so like how does and people
people have asked me this question for the last five years and i really don't have a great answer still how does one become more self-aware well
i it was literally part of my degree i'm very lucky here we go i started
doing english literature because i wanted to do the most show-off on council estate posh subject possible way
i mean i was going to get a first or i was i don't know what was going to happen so i told myself i'm going to get a first amount what
that was pre-ordained so i did two years of showing off about
you know roland bartz and jane austen and all that and there was an opportunity in the last year to cross over into creative writing and
the reason i did that is again goes back to my dad it's not very practical to be absolutely badass
on jane austen unless you're going to want to be a lecturer or an academic whereas creative writing um is a
practical profession you can go into advertising you can go into journalism you can try and write
books you can as it turns out go into stand-up i didn't know that yet there's loads of places where you can go look i've not just got a first in
english i've got a first in in writing i can take body copy and make your brand pop so par
how do you do a dissertation in creative writing there's only one way you have to submit ten thousand words
normal academic pouncing about and you have to submit ten thousand word short story play
but you have to run through your own work and criticize it and say what you got right and what you got wrong
once you've been through that and done it loads of times it just becomes natural to bring it to
your life a copywriter in an advertising agency has to be able to
really hate his own work he just created and find the faults in it because that will lift it above
ogilvy's copywriter and you'll win the pitch it's as simple as that the person the
man who cannot realize he's domineering or jealous and work on that will not have a fruitful relationship
woman or a man indeed in order to do that with your life or with your copy or with your work or whatever in marketing
you have to have a certain level of self-esteem and personal security to be
to allow yourself to rise above your work and look back down on it in a critical way a lot of people's self-esteem are so fragile
yeah that the prospect of being critical is uh it's just unthinkable
like you know this is why people get to from my experience where people get so defensive and because they're because they're so if
you one shot to their self-esteem will take the whole house down so that they immediately go like this hat likes so you could look at it that
way so i would say that person needs to learn not self-esteem because self-esteem's a
totally different conversation they need to learn objectivity a piece of writing is a thing
a relationship is a thing that you've built with someone
a comedy routine is a thing a poem is a thing the things over there that's not you
you have to practice being able to take the piss out of the thing criticize the thing no someone's not
How does someone become successful?
coming up to you and going you're ugly um you're unlovable uh you've got a big nose you're not tall enough stuff like
that is gonna hurt and there's no way of getting objective but if you can't look at a poem you've written and someone
goes i really love the meter but the adjective there's a bit obvious then you should be able to thank that person they're giving you a gift
if they know their [ __ ] but you're the one that should be saying that first eminem style eight mile seize the bars
and turn them on yourself first hard to do because everything is better it makes better work it makes better
humans yeah i completely agree it's just really tough to do like practice it's practice i get a lot of um
i this is the message i get most often sent to me by my agent or an instagram and it drives me [ __ ] nuts i had one
the other week oh my god i love what you do i'm i'm a really funny person this is how it was
phrased the other week how how many gigs would i have to do before i could like open for you on tour can you
have a look at some stuff i filmed on my phone and i'm i'll give them an answer that norm i never get a reply to this answer
i say okay it's quite simple lucky for you there is a really simple model to follow you need to work unpaid for three years in the clubs
three times a week i wouldn't recommend a relationship and just warn your friends you're not gonna see them
i started to earn about two three hundred pounds a week after five years at that point you're ready to give up
your day job on about the eighth or ninth year you're going to be ready to do a support slot i never go
yeah people don't want to hear it but you if you went up to the guy in the gym who's 16 stone and five percent body fat
and can you tell me how i can get like that you'd say the machines are over there [ __ ] just get going yeah the machines are there you cannot
skip the machine you cannot skip the tricep station if you want triceps you can't
just go but it's going to hurt uh it's too much work to get attracted then just don't get triceps don't but don't moan if you don't have triceps
head to the dip station and see you in four years i completely yeah i now i've wrote about
this my book came out last week and i wrote about it in my book i remember someone turning to me was actually the ceo of my company now
company i've just left and he said to me steve you know this personal brand stuff and this like speaking you do on stage was like how long did it like how did
what he was like how do i how do i do it and your brain immediately scrambles around looking for like three tips
right three tips to describe like a deck i remember my first talk in school at 14 years old my hand's shaking absolutely the truth is like
someone's seen you with a sharp sword and they've said how do i get a short sword that sharp i said well start sharpening it now and then ten years time but
people don't work no one wants to hear the answer is boring repetitive practice for most most
people that are absolutely [ __ ] excellent at something have done a lot of boring repetitive practice that would be boring
to the person asking the question not to us i loved every [ __ ] gig i did and that's the difference that's what kept you
doing it for 10 years or two decades whatever is that you genuinely intrinsically loved it for its
and people want the rewards right but when they if they started and genuinely wanted they too would discover that love
if you if you say i want to be an identity i'd be a dentist you start dental training and you're finding it boring in a slog
news flash you don't actually want to be a dentist you'll be rich yeah so find something else find
something where you love the journey that is a secret so that's what my dad never found he did he didn't find a job
he took pleasure in he's got nothing to do with coin although i'm into it but if you love the outdoors you're
going to love landscaping whether you're on 17 grand a year or 17 million a year you're gonna love it because that's what
you were born to do it's such a counter narrative to the narrative that sells which is like short investment big
so it's like seven days six pack abs that's everyone [ __ ] signs up for that imagine imagine that the like
10 years maybe maybe that's true and that's and the problem is a lot of the t the tv
we make i make sells that x factor spot do one song live the pimp lifestyle and of course
that is what in the all of the x factor that's ever been on and all of pop star the rivals
how many of those people are now platinum selling artists living in mansions what harry styles try and name some
one direction that's it that's out of every single little mixed doomer that's out of
every single one in a show that's designed to push people to the front in an artificial way so if you think that's going to happen
if you're russell from essex you're deluded it's but any business if you're passionate
mixed with a little bit of luck people this is the other thing people like us don't like putting out there but i'm afraid
there is a bit of luck involved and it sort of causes like we always sat here again i've worked so hard oh look
at me with my work hard badge but at some point we had some luck as well which is we're in the right place right time
mixed with the hard work so some people are more lucky than others luck is a thing and what lucky
not luck as in lottery number luck but luck is in oh my god you've met that you've met the perfect partner you
you've been the business oh you you were looking for a friend a french bulldog breeder and you found exactly the right one at the right time when you were
looking for a puppy why are you so lucky where's my life so [ __ ] so they tested this they got a bunch of
people together half people who say my life [ __ ] i'm so unlucky and half people like me who like i've gotta admit i'm a bit
hashtag blessed i do have a lot of luck and they run tests on them and the test they run was very simple
the the psychologist i come here is the british jewish guy really funny brings loads of books out richard something or other he's written a book about it about
luck look it up they gave them newspaper each and they went in there go into your separate rooms and on a
page is a picture you're looking for whoever finds that picture comes in first gets a hundred pounds
Personal responsibility
cash that was the game so everyone went in like that on page two your massive headlines was it's a
trick stop turning if you've read this headline go and collect the money that was on page two
all the unlucky people missed that all the lucky people found it you know why because lucky people
eyes are open the hustlers so it turns out you can make luck you
can practice that you can hone it that's something you can hone next time you walk into a meeting
just think right what's that guy do for it for a living who's that is that a contact that's not luck if i sit down next to
someone and he happens to be doing a comedy streaming service start up and he signs me up that's me being a bit bold and striking
up a conversation and looking at what he's wearing and having to think you can learn these skills people don't
like that because that sharp puts the mirror on me and creates personal responsibility where i yeah you know what i mean and i feel
like in our society at the moment this is just an observation i've had personal responsibility is people
[ __ ] hate that yeah i did i remember doing a tweet about um because okay this was me playing a bit
of [ __ ] but i don't care right so the left of society which i probably consider myself to be on
are really in support of the nhs so i did a tweet saying the biggest cost to the nhs is like
smoking eating bad etc so if you really care about the nhs take care of yourself people like no
steve this is literally the replies like this is not it because i'm basically saying if you genuinely care about the
health service here is all the data the biggest burden on the nhs is people that are overweight and
people that are smoking or whatever um well the obesity one's particularly controversial because there's two
movements at the same time there's personal responsibility in the science we're learning about obesity particularly during covid
i mean if you if you want to do one thing other than social distancing obviously get a vaccine
most of us are too young to have a vaccine so if you have another vaccine and you don't and you don't want to live life like a prisoner the best thing you
can do is get in shape quick you're better off you're literally better off being i think a thin smoker literally yeah
but it's a controversial conversation because quite rightly we're re-evaluating beauty
standards and a lot of people end up with eating disorders and fat shaming and all that needs to go away
and as as soon as we associate personal responsibility longevity in
health with a body type we're in a difficult area where we create
shame for people based on how they look which is something you want to get rid of so for someone like me who's on on the left
my head just goes pop yeah smoking is is a slam dunk don't smoke your rebellion yeah
yeah end off [ __ ] don't smoke stop costing me money on the nhs but someone that might be overweight
it's very very complex to understand why someone's overweight it's something i studied a lot not
because i've been overweight but because i'm fascinated with biohacking and body and all of that
and i think the most most illuminating thing i can tell
anyone about being overweight is that eating too much
does not make you overweight this is no one understands this i'm
going to blow your mind here being overweight causes you to eat
too much once you have the metabolic condition of being overweight that [ __ ] your
circuitry which drives you to eat more obesity causes
calorie surplus so shaming people for eating too much is a waste of time
because most people with busy lives and kids and no money are in a condition that's compelling
them to eat more might be emotionally compounded might be psychologically compounded they might be recovering from abuse they might be
recovering from a bad relationship they might just be skin and can only afford [ __ ] nuggets and they're just tired and not getting enough sleep
and unfortunately until you get into um a low-fat state like us where it's easy
to regulate your calorie your every part of your body is telling you to feed this obesity
no one understands that i've gone deep into the sign i'm not a scientist so look up for yourself before everyone starts trolling me saying literature
degree boy but as far as i understand the science layman's cards and table
obesity causes overeating now that is just boom but it helps us to be more as much
as i agree with what you're saying it just it levens more compassion into people's weight loss journey although
you're absolutely correct if you don't want to die of covid and you don't want to cost the nhs money getting in shape's one of the best ways
to do it but of course it's not easy and i've i've had moments in my life where i've been most stressed and it's a downward cycle yeah like you
know what i mean so you eat and then you require sugar more and sugar becomes this addictive thing in your life and it only happens to me when i'm
stressed so i'll have my little moments of downward cycle in my health when there's a lot on my
mind and so yeah i mean compassion is certainly incredibly important in that regard what about more broadly so
outside of health the topic of personal responsibility i like it because it's controversial mm-hmm
um and i discuss the new trying to get us in the daily mail here
in fact people should pay for themselves no i know just generally in your life and success in like
um what you can accomplish the fortunate position i'm in which is what i talked about in my last podcast was because i came from like a very broke
family where my mum can't read or write and i i was born in africa and i we didn't have anything no christmas birthdays or holidays my
journey in life people don't discredit it they don't point at me and say oh you know silver spoon you can't [ __ ]
talk yep so i feel like i can have the conversation a little bit more about personal responsibility of course i'm [ __ ]
incredibly lucky like i didn't choose to be me you know what i mean i didn't choose my parents
or the good and bad things that shaped me yeah but i but i wanna i wanna have a conversation about
personal responsibility as it relates to career success and let's let's start with hard work because in our society right now there's
two counter narratives one is that don't work like incredibly hard you're gonna burn out and you're gonna have mental health problems and the other is
i've never met someone that sat here in front of me that doesn't work really [ __ ] hard and i i did
i don't know how i would have sat here without hard work and tremendous sacrifice well first of all we sort of
already made the point a lot of people are working hard at things they hate yeah so working hard at things you dislike
hate or find stressful will bring success and money but at a cost
working hard at things you love i'm i finished filming at midnight last night in madison i got in at half one i had my
dinner at two and i fell asleep at three and i bounced out of bed this morning to come here to
do a podcast for the price of a car why because i love what i do now if i was
had got in at three from working as a hospital porter and had to get up to do another job
which was quite well paid this morning but i hated it i wouldn't be buzzing and that's what releases the cortisol and the stress
hormone into your body so you can't compare you're not comparing like and like even though both
people are working hard you've even got people that might be barristers or doctors
really well paid professions but find it stressful when they're burnt out and stuff it's unlikely you and i will burn out
because i'm like what's next and you're intrinsically motivated by you've got a sense of control exactly so that's that's what i think
that i think we can we can differentiate there on hard work straight away so if i i'm more
interested in the first thing you said about the the join between people's origin story
and how much stick they get for the success they've got because i'm i have to phrase mine a lot more than
you because i get put in with the silver spoon guys because i'm a
just a white man yeah so i'm not going to use real names here and i'm not going to use real jobs because i respect
my profession is so hard i don't give a [ __ ] whether you're prince charles doing stand up anyone who does stand up
i just it's so hard to stand up and i don't think an elite background helps you in stand up might help you in
telly and production won't help you on stage with a bucket of piss coming through
but i've been told on more than one occasion uh we'd love we'd love to we'll book you for the x show but we've
already got ollie um and so we got ollie we can't have two and i'm like how how is how me do me and
ollie represent the same thing i sometimes think well i've got more in common with
i could phone up i don't know if you know who judy love is i could phone up judy now and we could speak for an
hour about we both grew up same similar part of london similar age similar family yes she's got
jamaican stories but i've got six stories and that's the only difference in our conversation we come from the same
place economically we come with fighting the same fight we're punching up from when we never no one would ever say that
i'll probably be in trouble for even saying that that's the controversial thing for me to say and it shouldn't be
because if corbyn and people like that have got it right everyone who starts with what i call
lower entitlement points i've got a lot more entitlement points than a woman of color
undoubtedly i've got less less entitlement points probably than a ghanaian prince right so
all the people that have got [ __ ] all uh i'll start should link arms don't matter what gender you are
what color you are that would be powerful i'm a bit nervous when we get carved up and we're people who started
life in a tower block should that tower block should be united you know what i mean so that's the first point but i do i do
think you we get off we do get off lightly if we've got money
if we had a more council estate background it's like a license to be okay with having money like i can
wear my rolly by the pool when i'm in ibiza because i sound common yeah if i sounded
posh i probably would keep the breitling on yeah it's so true i one of one of my guests
that i had on the podcast um went to a very good school and um is white and blonde and very pretty
and she basically can't give advice to anybody without the papers smashing
her or social media in fact there was a meme before before she came on the podcast there was a meme that went viral i think
it did 250 000 retweets when she the day she released her book and it was this someone
pinned someone up against the wall with a big trumpet and it was like white privilege telling you how to how to become rich like she is not
allowed to give advice to anybody because she's white and went to a good oxford and with how much good insight
and business knowledge and whatever like so many people went to oxford and didn't build multi multi-million
pound two multi-million pound companies i still want to hear this from this person if someone's offering you knowledge
she's not it's not like she's telling you about her struggles earlier there was a queue in waitress and i just couldn't keep that that would be the
trumpet right she's trying to tell you how to build a business it doesn't matter if you come from space
if you can make me money tell me how if you can tell me how to start the next comedy streaming platform service where
i own 40 of the shares yeah i don't give a [ __ ] if you've got a double first from cambridge or whether you're one of the mandem i
don't care show me where to show me how to do it you've got you've got to have an open
knowledge is is once it's out there is democratic the path to acquiring it is not
um but there's no doubt about trying to stay on topic what you're saying about personal responsibility
is i'm really split on this because i don't believe it's true that anyone with enough will and luck
can make it i think we're probably outliers and freaks and just wired a bit different and i've got
what it takes to push through i think if enough blocks are in place you're a single child of a drug using
mum in a towel block and i am built of stronger stuff so i've bounced through my childhood
and i've come out the other side but a lot of people aren't if we were all born the same then why aren't i playing basketball why
am i not sprinting why am i not a math scholar you know some of us are
born genetically more equipped in other departments i'm clearly a highly energetic person
who's good at motivating themselves some part of that is inborn i was like i would like it as a baby before i could
speak you know the other toddlers are like dribbling on their blocks and i'm like where the blood set
so it's unfair for us to go if only uh neil at the top of the tower could
have been like us he too could have been an entrepreneur because maybe he just being a single mom
being of color or being transgender or being not everyone has the strength to push
through those things not everyone does and it's unfair to go up to a wheelchair and go just
stand mate i'm using willpower with my legs why can't you because some people that that is a
wheelchair their social background and they don't have the strength and then they start using drugs and they just sink too low not everyone can pull themselves out so
that's why we do need more equality yeah i agree i'm definitely pro-quality
i i there's a sense of helplessness i get if i like if i go all the way and say
you know successful people well they were born with something yeah it creates a sense of like well then you're we're all just stuck in our lanes forever and
if i believe that when i was shoplifting pizzas in manchester but then again what i do understand i
actually when i re the harder i reflect i basically give myself credit for nothing because i was born into a
situation in a country i actually think my bad experiences are why i'm here like the fact that my parents
weren't around at 10 years old created this big gap of independence et cetera et cetera i've told this story a million times
but it's the bad [ __ ] that is the reason that i became an outlier i think i became very obsessive obsessed with
money my book that's why it's called happy sexy millionaire because it's the first page of my diary when i was like a kid i want to be a happy why did i want to
be happy sexy because we were [ __ ] broke have you got siblings though yeah i've got so are they happy 60 millionaires not one of them none of them are like me
and they don't understand me either they look at me and like scratch their heads but what does that tell you it's almost like you've run a controlled experiment
exactly so tuning out um genetics versus willpower i the the difference between
my childhood experience and theirs was they were raised by parents and i basically wasn't so by i was the youngest so by the age i
was 10 my parents were like oh we've done parenting now we will work all the time and we will be
out of the house when steve comes home and will be at the house when he wakes up so i was the only one where the the
experiment was total independence so thought experiment for you if you'd have been born a fraternal twin
another boy yeah so as much your brother brothers your other brothers but happy boy at the same time
same conditions same school everything happens so do you believe you would have another happy sexy millionaire living in
the flat opposite or do you think depends what that brother's personality was like
because we both know that that brother's personality is what would have decided whether he sat at this table with us
today or not and personality does come into it we are born with different personalities to an extent so i'm not
saying we're all stuck in our lanes but i'm saying we need more social mechanisms because
some einsteins don't have energy some einsteins might might be a bit
emotionally weaker so we're saying my example of neil at the tower block he might be really [ __ ] amazing we will never harvest
that talent because our society is set up with too many blocks in place to scoop it out we had one thing in
place for about 40 years called grammar schools very controversial
very unfair dumping a load of 11 year olds in the thick bin my mum went to a secondary modern my dad
went to a secondary modern my wife my brother-in-law my mother-in-law and father-in-law
all went secondary moderns so i know people who were told you're no good at 11. so i don't say this lightly and i
know how horrific that is but the data does suggest that there was a short period where we
scooped off some bright poorer children not necessarily neil in the tower block but at least the poorer children whose
parents meant well but were too poor we got them we got more einsteins
when you watch question time switch it on and you know i went to a state school and they're giving it all that will
Is there no hope for some people?
always be a grammar school always is very rarely i went to the local comprehensive and now i'm an mp
it's always i went to state which state school it's gramsci you went to an elite education then state but elite selective
so we need some more stuff like that what can we do in our communities what can our youth workers do what
what can we set up in in in council estates headhunters that look for talent
particularly boys i'm going to say that because i was a boy once but there's a real problem with teenage boys all this testosterone kicks
in and it goes the wrong way for most of us you when i came in your podcast you ask very controversial questions i think you
like those questions those are the ones that are most interesting to you aren't they yeah well as long as it gets in trouble well it's
hard to tell hindsight's a wonderful thing um so i guess my i was just thinking then this
is a controversial question but he asked me controversial questions so i can answer it is there no hope for some people well
give me con so zoom out context got a friend tried really hard to help them change their life or do something for
themselves 10 years of effort made all the offers in the world to this person
still job seekers allowance you know somewhat depressed can't seem to have
any impact we grew up in the same street we were best friends my whole childhood i went off he stayed there
i've got tons of examples like that so i have to speak very euphemistically now i'll be cancelled not by the internet
but by my friends and family stroke associate stroke i don't even want to say which group these people are
uh i've all of this i've had female friends who i'm like stop dating bastards and the next guy
he's nice he's a coke dealer and he's like he's gonna [ __ ] he's clear he's gonna shaggy mate and some of these women are getting to
35 you know like with the final egg in the goblet like in indiana jones waiting to be fertilized
and um this the next guy he's called we've got three kids by three different women he has he's got an electronic tag but it's
great because we can spend some time just bang a boring guy or a guy that likes dungeons and dragons or an
accountant what they call there's a sexual attraction there to bastard men that some women
particularly from high school background working class women find hard to get over would be one example but you can
get over it it is possible to do it the mistake people like you and i make is we try to help
and say you've got a friend who's unmotivated depressed leaves every job after three months it's always someone else's fault
it's always the system it's always if only corbyn was in power it's uh my dad did this my mum did that
always putting it on someone else and then you're making it worse by putting it on you let me help
you're just a positive version of that the solution is with them they have to switch the light bulb on in
themselves they may not get there but the moment they wake up and go today's the day i'm
gonna try and change my life they should that the first step it might be
speaking to a therapist it might be changing your career it might be enrolling in a levels that you do at
night time like i did that was what lucky enough my revelation came up when i was you're on job seekers allowance at one
point i was yeah i did my a-levels late because i had this spark moment but it's got to come from within them it's not something
as yet although science might get there one day but we can give to you in a pill or an injection you've got to suddenly
have in right back to the beginning of the chat insight and baby like boom chest out i'm
going to see a therapist i'm not going to use negative language i'm going to get this self-help book which which gives me some cb cognitive
behavioral therapy tools i always hung up with cannabis um so yeah it's it's gonna come from
them but for you and i fixes how can we solve it how can i redraft the copy what's the solution
unfortunately the solution is trying to get them to have some insight so if you have got
a friend like that maybe have that sort of conversation with them that spurs self-reflection because giving them a million pound a
year job is just going to make them worse because that muscle that's atrophied will stay atrophied that sort of
standing up making your own strength muscle i've been on my heel journey for a couple of
years now but in the case of some of my best friends who i've talked about on this podcast before one particular friend called ashley
jones who knows that i talk about him in his transformation story he did have a problem eating certain
Why did you become a comedian?
foods and so he transitioned to making huel a greater part of his diet and the guy
went from being and i'm sorry ash if you're listening the guy went from being like slightly overweight constantly
um having health issues that are unrelated to like you know being slightly overweight
to being to literally having a six-pack posting his six-pack on instagram but more importantly
being high-energy and feeling amazing so when i'm like you know talking to you guys about huel i do so with such a level of passion
because i believe that it can really help change your lives in a significant way i believe it can make you mentally
better i know it can make you physically better and so yeah what a joy it is to have a sponsor that you believe in that much
um yeah and they're also just really good people one of the most um probably
scary things from my perspective that you ever did was walking out on stage for the first time for your first gig ever
like what the [ __ ] were you thinking hmm going out and walking in front of people and telling [ __ ] jokes are you sure
like with me it's even more complex because i don't know if you've had any stand-ups on here before
never but the majority of them and quite rightly so will be like from a young age i used to
watch blah blah on tv i used to watch all these american comics so i used to watch chris rock bill burr
bill hicks i knew that's what i wanted to do man i was like you know i was like the young boxer in the alleyway i knew i was to
box none of that nothing there is zero in my cv that shows an affinity for the
craft of stand up always been the joker i'm not being funny today i don't know why you got me on one but normally i'm always asking around
not this is not a thing i do on stage i'm just i'm not like the clown person why just just my again
i've just always been i just love making people laugh i've always been a joker there's some data that suggests um
youngest children have it and i'm not the youngest child the oldest or people born in august and july purely
because if you're smaller than everyone else you've got to develop your personality quick
so you if you look at the premiership you won't find many footballers born in august i'll explain why i never
made it august august 26th so you won't find me sixth as well you won't find many sportsmen or anyone that requires
size or physical prowess those professions so even if you turn out to be a very
tall teenager you're less likely to become a basketball player than a
a teenager one inch shorter than you who was born in october the reason being you'd have been pushed
by the coach and taught and everything early doors at six seven eight years old so and there is some data to suggest
that people who work with their personalities for a living people that have to solve entrepreneurs and find
little rat runs in alleyways develop that based on being smaller or more vulnerable but i could take lots of forms i've got an
overbearing dad as well so i'm an august baby overvaling dad and some of you will be genetic
my mum's very funny you talked a little bit about i was reading some some of
your um previous interviews you talked a little bit about how it was a bit of a defense mechanism maybe in school if that's
you found your name yes by being a yeah i wasn't but but i don't know how i wasn't bullied but i wasn't the smallest no girlfriend
um wasn't him with the in crowd at all i was sort of like an ex in a sort of external group that had
diplomatic immunity definitely a virgin definitely no cool friends definitely one of the idiots but we
don't punch him because he's sort of all right obviously i did get as a working class school i did get punched a lot but not
as much as i was in that league you probably won't even remember them just above the bullet the boring grey league no point
yeah which is the place to be at school because if you're popular at school we all know you're gonna have a [ __ ] life
so anyway so because of where i grew up it's not people like well how can you
have no contact with stand up so you gotta remember my age i know i look young young for my age i'm 45. so
what was my dad watching on tv jim davison bernard manning jimmy jones it's like bruce forsyth and
jimmy tarbuck like you know live at the palladium and all that it's not obviously they're all talented comedians and i do i do mean
that but it just didn't resonate with what it's not it's not about my life so i'd like i'd laugh because my dad was
laughing but i was like what's this crazy art form i've got to learn more me and my friends mostly either smoking
it's all about getting high or we'd watch old young ones or whatever the funny sitcom of the day was maybe
even badly whatever it was that's what i thought comedy was no we didn't go to the theater of the weekend
we didn't know which cultural pursuit should we do this weekend family it was like dad works all week he's tired we have a curry
nan looks after you and then when you get to 15 16 you get stoned over the park get someone pregnant work in a shop die
that's it that's the finish line so i managed to like i say have this weird entrepreneur turn my life around
get my first class degree moment but just by sheer bad luck i ended up at a university that did not
have a stand-up night most of them do so again i went those three years without any exposure to
in the student bar stand up it was all music there was some theater no one talked about stand up we didn't
have this sort of slightly fashionable thing now being obsessed with american stand-ups i like to say to my british colleagues just remember
if you start having this sort of slick quality to your stand up it can look a bit mannered
um that's just a side point so i went all the way to the office to my dream job as an advertising copywriter with no
content we stand up just being funny as [ __ ] the clown you know legend on a night out first one
up dancing but i didn't know that something you could do for a living and i ended up doing a job i loved branding copywriting headlines i still
love it you can tell by the way i'm describing it then the creative planner was like you're always the one up at the pitch issue
i would do like if we're pitching to a big client i would do like the funny bit with interaction to get them on the side
when i'm presenting the creative he said why don't you try stand up stephen workman if you're watching thank you uh why do you use chase stand up
with your mind's glass region and i thought you know what do it once like doing a bungee jump or a skydive
or karaoke it's just that's as far as my thinking went something to tell the kids so i wrote a
few ideas down in a book booked an open spot in and i went and did it it was very scary i think i did a
pack of imodium before i went on and my hand was shaking and i got that
it wasn't obviously wasn't great but i did wear ish well-ish first laugh was like someone stuck
cocaine heroin ketamine everything in my but not that i've done those drugs but everything in my veins and i was
hooked you know in the proper sense of that it [ __ ] my life everything fell apart
like a junkie how can i get more of that i want a gig three night i want to give five nights a week for no money
i've got a creative director we're talking about multi multi-million pound accounts advertising is you work till 8 pm you
have pizza on your birthday under your table you sleep at the office i'm running off to do unpaid gigs in manchester my relationship with my
girlfriend fell apart my bill started to not be paid i started to look thin because i
suffered with my nerves in the beginning i'm throwing up [ __ ] like both ends it's the closest thing to a drug
addiction that i've ever experienced i would have not seen my mum for a year
to chase this dream it was i was hooked with on that laugh i'm like this is what i'm born to do i
just [ __ ] know it how can i monetize it basically how why were you
hooked on the laugh why did the laugh matter so much to you it's a rush it's a rush anyone is i've not taken any
serious drugs but anyone that's taken any recreational drugs which is a bad analogy because they're not actually
addictive but coffee for example i can't live my life without without it why are you addicted this is
as absurd as asking me why i'm addicted to coffee because i go i wake up i feel alive and
i have an amazing day the same laugh goes in buzz uh serotonin pupils dilated afterwards i
want to tell everyone about the gig i was taking [ __ ] footage into work and showing it to people and playing it in the office look
at me that's me look look come and look at me in this grainy footage i mean that's so
embarrassing that i did that i just i couldn't i just couldn't believe it i couldn't believe
i was getting laughs from strangers it was straight to the ego straight to the cortex everyone has that
but do you have you ever considered that you might have that might have mattered more to you maybe because of your childhood or
whatever than other people that that sense of like that validation and that yeah i mean
maybe i mean i'd had plenty of validation at work i'd had the whole office cheer i've rung the bell when we've won big
pitches i've got the rush in the meeting but it nothing it it's the difference
i'm trying not to talk about drugs all the time it's the difference between going from a beer to mdma right i don't
recommend any hard drugs obviously particularly people that work with their brains you're a fool if you mess with
the equipment but you can't compare them when you say everyone has that
not everyone stood on stage to a thousand people and seen people standing and clapping
that is different it's of a different category of ego rush very dangerous what problems does
it give you well initially all has come with it initially that my life felt my life fell apart like a junkies i was
down to 10 stone at one point um so it come to the point where i had to
say this needs to not be a drug this needs to be a food and i left the agency and then i was you
know off still today though right so all all things come with their their costs what is the cost today of
that that career and that rush and that i suppose the worst thing is the travel
that is a genuine negative one since min has been born my daughter um i actually quite
like traveling i like being in the back of a car i love watching movies i love reading and i love eating on the move so all the
things that most people hate i just happen to quite enjoy just pure i don't know why because i'm
always on the go i like being forced to sit still and watch a movie so i love flights for example the longer the better
um you still [ __ ] yourself now when you get when you're about yes big time but so far as so far as missing part of your
child growing massive negative doing a is there's a there's a guilt thing in your gut and you know you do
cry a bit after facetiming that particularly when it's a baby so that's the biggest negative i can think of but once you're with a woman or
a man that gets it there's no negative in your relationship i was with a couple of girls before who would make me feel bad
about being away whereas lindsay's kicking me out the door she's focused on the business we're a team that's well paid [ __ ] off see you
later don't call home if you're stressed i'm cool with it that's what you need man you need someone who gets it
i do [ __ ] myself though still yes do you know when you know the the um a modium scale goes up depending
on how much of my show it is so if you booked a show for me today where you're going to introduce me and i'm going to do 20 minutes stand up
How do you overcome nerves?
and you've got 2 000 people in the room there would be nerves there a fair bit of nerves but mostly i'm
ready to knock the gig the [ __ ] out with my first punch if you've put an event on
and michael mcintyre is closing and you're hosting it and you to me at the last minute i said russ i've decided to do two halves can
you do 20 minutes at the top i chip myself because they're not there for me they're there for you and him and i've got a
conversion job to do right and the risk is massive and then michael's fans are your fans
and that's when the nerves kick in when i'm doing royal variety show or live at the apollo where people have responded to a tv ticket not me that's when the
nerves go back to old school style nerves how how do you uh what's the battle you have with those nerves and in terms of
your cognition and before you go on stage what are the tips you can give people a lot of people there's two there's two ways to to
to work on that um the first thing is the actual practical thing on the night
i would say um just work with breathing and mindfulness and all the stuff you've probably read a thousand times
the other thing to do is if you can find a way to do it it depends which stage your career you're at if you're at
the stage of the career like me and you a lot i'm not trying to be offensive a lot of people are sucking addicts a lot of the time
so we're constantly walking into the rooms where people think we're legends it's never going to be a difficult gig now and again something comes up well
you're the tadpole and you you don't have the hardware in place and
[ __ ] bill gates is speaking before you oprah's hosting it and all of a sudden you're who's this guy
you're having a day of who's this guy we're all we can all have a who's this guy dave and the only way to practice that is to
put yourself in more who's this guy moments regularly so how i do that as soon as my tour
finishes i book the smallest hardest weirdest
they might have bad lighting they might have no microphone they might be half sold and i'm unlisted unlisted unannounced
unexpected and i walk on to tiny clubs full of drunk men 50 year old ukip dads
all of those places i put myself in those all the time because the risk is high the nerves are the same
but the consequence is zero so i'm constantly training the muscle of
convert the people who don't know who i am keeping it sharp the whole time so whatever business you're in you'll be
able to think of an equivalent way of doing that so set up smaller situations where
you're having to keep that muscle because the danger is the more successful you get you lose the muscle of walking into a
room full of skeptics and if you lose that muscle that's the money making muscle so practice it i keep mine tight at all
times i constantly put myself in unbilled unlisted unideal situations
when you walk onto a stage when you're at my level which i would call myself
quite recognizable you can't say i'm like michael mcintyre or chris rock or someone
but i'm sort of known as a stand-up so what that means is when i walk on stage at the comedy store
late show 400 people drunk off their tits work dues hindus
i'm unbilled unexpected unlisted the room splits into three straight away it splits into oh my god
it's him [ __ ] what a treat we've got him for 20 quid to the middle who's that am i supposed to know that is is he good i don't know
i think i've seen him and the final group can't stand this [ __ ] that's the only
group i'm playing to win a little bit in the middle group they're the only people i'm interested
in because that's where the muscle building exercises and then when you go on stage
to your audience they get you like that yeah yeah but if you come with that conversion energy to your own audience
you must be you don't need it that's the problem all you got to do is put your foot out and they're like it's his foot he's amazing
that's the problem yeah that's the problem you get flabby easy in all businesses
so you talked about your relationships there in your current partner i um i heard you got married for nine months
Relationships, evolution of one & cheating
yes yeah sorry i realized what you mean yeah no i did i was i was married bef i
was married but i'm currently i'm trying to enjoy my middle marriage that's what i say today
okay no i was uh so we were just we realized we were just mates there was a romance there we had a
lot in common we were both into this same world and we were sort of living together and we got married and we were like that was
a mistake and then we just weren't married and it was totally amicable no no fighting no problems at all
but you talked about the understanding that your current partner has current wife yeah so my
former partner the one who was married for nine months had that as well which is why so we thought we should probably get married but we realize
marriage needs more than that um so yeah so lindsay is more lindsay doesn't get jealous unless i do
something [ __ ] like follow a glamour model in the instant and like a bikini pic in which i get my ass kicked
but still do because i'm neanderthal and uh
um so unless i do something stupid like that which i rightly get in trouble for or like change my flight in ibiza and go
to a boat party which i also tried to do and got my ass kicked for um so but if i'm on the road
and doing autographs afterwards and there's all girls in the picture or something i've never ever like lindsay's
just not even a flicker she gets it that's the job is you're everyone's friend if the girls
fancier in the audience even better that means another maldives holiday type thing that's the way she's in business mode
she isn't on a bit of an entrepreneur lindsay she's got two businesses and she sees my business as a business and
she never ever guilt me i've been i might be away for four nights i won't some days i've gone [ __ ] i
didn't phone home i didn't text i didn't even now and again all i have
to do is do a good night and she knows that my head might be full there's never any fallout
never and that just makes the trust and the bonds it's just of course i then do call home
it just works because of that you're someone that will get a lot of attention because it's i mean it's your job right
it's like holding you literally to seek attention as much yeah and women they love funny guys right so
god you know probably i don't know if it's gonna get in trouble but you know that you could
have a lot of different partners if you wanted to i could be harvesting 24 7. that's what i mean i probably would
have fractured pelvis by now if i hadn't got married people are going to hate this question because they think i'm encouraging it but i'm here to play devil's advocate
okay why aren't you well um i fell deeply in love and got married
and i'm just again you get back to the childhood undivorced parents it's just
what i modeled on this i've never had a problem with saying to a girl um the relationship's done my head's
starting to be turned let's move on and as much as it breaks my heart if i ever felt that way i would
obviously with a marriage in a child i would sit down to li to lindsay and say this an issue here
i've started to have these thoughts how can we work on it and we'd work something out so that's just my way i operate
hardly any men do sorry girls for my sex if only men did i mean
but they don't so i'm trying to a man should go i haven't done anything but i'm having
these thoughts what does it mean does it mean we're not in love does it mean sexually our relationship's not exciting is there something we can do that
some games we can play to mimic that i don't know whatever couples need to just have that conversation
because if you pretend men and women aren't having those thoughts you're naive so you need to keep the relationship alive that's the way to do
to do it why why am i married well a 45 remember and b
i i'd been i'm more serial monogamist so i've gone from age 16
to 30 odd baby the girl for three years break up get straight with another girl literally the next week
break up on anywhere between nine months to three year relationships never had a one night stand i'd never
been single i'd never been on a lad's holiday so when i split up a bit weird but my mum
was like you are not gonna find a sustainable relationship because of all these reasons you said you're gonna get a lot of female attention
you're always gonna wonder what it's like she went i was you i'd have a year on your own so i set the clock and i was like panani
master in action and we're not cynically not cynically shagging that's going to be the promo
clip but not cynically shagging but being sing it's more to more to it than just
shagging it was like just being enough living in a flat on your own i bought that's banging flat in london
i've still got i use it as my london residence and i just thought you still got it yeah it's your wife now
well we stayed there all the time and uh she's a and i'm like i can i can come on live i've never lived on my
own before i'd always live with a woman always live with a girl and uh it was just nice i'd just be in my pajamas and
have a career and then i could i could or i would i would just think i'm gonna go out on the pool after the gig and that gets boring
quick unless you've got some sort of um issue like sex edition issue and you're addicted to
lots of different women i'm not that type of like dominant guy that needs to [ __ ] a thousand women to prove i've
walked the earth um i moy without getting too personal i do enjoy i'm a highly sexed individual
very unfortunately for lindy incredibly high sex drive like a 19 year old lad but it's sex i enjoy not conquering
women so i can quench that first with one woman over and over again but i did
want to know what it was like to you know to be single to be free and part of that
i'm sure it's the same for a woman for a man is to go what's it like to have a one night stand or to be to be a have
this rock star lifestyle and sleep with loads of women the difference i did it was if i was going out after a gig or if a girl would
dm'd me and we were going out or whatever just missed tinder um i would say this
is where i'm at this is what i do for a living i'm single i i do love making love and i love going
out but there is no relationship here i would never went to bed with a woman dangling any
fake carrots ever i think it's a form of i don't want to use language too strongly there's a sort of
con a consent tweak in there if you're lying if you're in a power position like me and saying go let's see
where it goes but you just want to [ __ ] i think that's wrong i think it's morally wrong i think you should say
this is what it is i want to party with you can you handle it and news flash most women are looking for that too so i
had a wicked time for for a year and then one of those girls was lindsay and
that's just something different happened and we saw we saw each other again and again and again and then boom married i i asked
this question because i was i was having a conversation with a friend of mine last night who's an entrepreneur and he's continually failed in marriage
and we were going back and forward about whether about the importance of meaningful relationships and i was
making the case that they're incredibly important i sent him a ted talk about which shows that they did a study on men over i think about 100 years and
showed that the men that were in committed relationships lived longer had way better health were way happier they studied men for 100
years i think it's the only 100 year study they've done of this type and he was basically saying well you
know women that you know they just don't understand that i'm ambitious and stuff well is he wrong is he right
how is he true he's statistically true and also people that believe in god live longer i'm not a god i'm total atheist for you i mean that
would be the curve but you won't expect to know right tell me about jesus stephen there are it's people that believe in god
live longer and so i think it's not the case that um faith keeps you alive or that
a relationship keeps you alive as far as i understand the science there's a neuro-protective and
cardiovascular benefit of literally doing what we're doing today just hanging out basically and the most reliable way to hang out
and check in with someone on a really regular basis is to have someone you're married to are you okay take your stress levels down or even
better get together every sunday with a bunch of people who actually give a [ __ ] about whether your skin whether you've got cancer with your wife's left you
who are going to look out for you and sadly in our society religion is the only thing that forces people on a
friday saturday or sunday to get together if you're going mosque every friday is
it if you're a mosque if you're going mosque once a week and you're you're praying next to that man next year he's probably going to
notice if you're down it's as simple as that there's nothing magic about marriage but the homo sapiens i believe that our
cortisol levels drop and our dopamine levels rise when someone gives a [ __ ] about us it
would make sense on an evolutionary level if you look at the way chimps are that when one of them gets excluded from the
group because they have a fight and they're going you know you see them on the documentary yeah yeah they never live long because
why would you where is the evolutionary drive of your genes to past seeds and eggs on if you're the type of
person who can't bring the pack forward so there would be a strong evolutionary argument
for single people to die before attached to people for non-religious people to die before atheists so atheists like
us have to make sure we really have strong friendship groups and i wish wish wish we could get
humanism off the ground every sunday there's readings
there's your local richard dawkins is doing a science reading we all have a bit of tea and cake our kids all play together
and then we all go home wouldn't that be amazing and why doesn't it exist it's solved a lot of problems because if
you were depressed i would pick up on it if i'm seeing you every week everything you've said is backed by everything i've studied and i've read a
chapter in my book called the journey back to human which describes this it was inspired a lot by johanna hari you wrote lost connections yes
and um about getting back to our tribes and when you look at the way we're living our lives today it's it's just
the antithesis of human and religion and relationship is the only way you can keep those human
elements in so far as your your friends who keep having failed marriages
marriages fail for lots of different reasons so you so for for men who keep getting
three-year relationships and splitting up if if it's the same reason every time if
the eye is roving and he just wants to [ __ ] other women i mean we need to speak about this in real language that men use
sorry if you find it offensive switch off but a lot of the time a man gets two three years in the novel he wears off
and he's like i just what's it going to be like a different woman
so the cost as well the resistance or the uncomfortable parts of the relationship remain yeah but the upside decreases if it's
sex a lot for a lot of men like so i feel so sorry for girls that but why did why did my man she what was it i
wasn't doing it's hard to face the fact that some men maybe 60 70
of men who split up with you just want to shag someone else it's let's just put on so i'm sure many
women but i don't speak for women so i'm not being sexist i'm just not speaking for women let get a woman on here ask her why she splits
up with someone every three year so you need to if you're a man that has those urges you need to find a woman that you can
work with that can keep you sexually excited and do whatever you need to do just you've got to do it and and you've
you need a woman you can talk about those things with and a lot of it can be role playing verb dirty talk verbal
fantasies whatever these are practical tips a lot of couples never cross these boundaries because they're too shy so you split up with someone because you
wanted to get dressed up as a policeman and potentially with someone else and you were too cringe to tell her but that could have been the thing that
converted it it could be as simple as as going to a club separately dancing with
uh with other people then going home together in the night have you tried until you have that conversation as a couple and admit you're having those
thoughts you will split up or worse cheat and ruin that woman's life and ruin her faith in men
or if you're any what i'm sure it's exactly the same if you're a gay gay man as well you'll ruin that boy you've spelled if
you're in his life so far as what why women are with men who knows and that's not
for me to say but i do think a lot of the times we're reluctant to admit it's such a basic sexual reason
i bet i i suspect it is the case and we'll make any i just felt bored we've grown apart you know i just wasn't
it would say any old [ __ ] just to not admit i like looking at
girls on instagram i want to go on holiday on my own tough conversation to have right because it feels like an attack on
but you build it in as fun yeah you'd be like three years in i'm gonna be straight with you i really really love you as long as you
love if you don't love a girl just tell her you you definitely need to split up but if you love her but i have sexual urges
that is resolvable guys i think quite often hoochie and this is a presumption i don't know the truth
they will take the path of least resistance so they look over at their partner and they think if i have this conversation this is
going to blow up and she's going to scream in my face i think i can just go and grab that apple without exactly without resistance
so they just reach out for the apple because that conversation feels like more psychological discomfort then yeah i don't i just don't don't go shagging
other people to end your your relationship we all do that they literally cheat to end the relationship we've all had moments i have in past
relationships where i've found myself in a bar contemplating it talking to a
girl and as soon as that happens i know either i don't love this girl
Biohacking
or something's going wrong in the bedroom it's normally one of those things can you love someone and she
is the type of question you'd ask me probably yes yeah you think so probably in the same
in the same way i would i can adore my daughter and would die for her but would
i go and work on a project for a month with no phone contact at a pivotal d vet point of her life yes i could
because i can compartmentalize i imagine women are exactly the same i in fact i suspect a woman can be profoundly in
love with a man who's not giving her attention or making her feel special or sexually exciting her
and she can have sex with someone else feel awful and still profoundly love her husband
one of the things you said is you said you uh you're 45 46 when in august yeah yeah of course
maybe almost baby not long you look about 31. like if you told me you were 31 32 i'd probably
believe you yeah um how have you done that so first of all it's got me into trouble um because what
happened was when i started doing all this biohacking and stuff like that what's biohacking it's where your work you're using the
current science available to try and hack your own biology to
survive on less sleep in a way that doesn't damage your health for example i've not cracked that one to not lose your hair working on that
one or to slow down the aging process
so not so that you can live to 120 not that it's a common misconception but that so
you can have the bit of your life between 30 and 70 in a more sustained
younger state that's what you're trying to do you're trying to have better middle-aged
years not be 120 year old what you'd like to be is 120 year old that's like an 80 year old now
what you're trying to do is stretch particularly i did my first gig at 28 so i quickly realized i need to find
some solutions here because i'm high energy lee evans act i talk about my mum my dad i'm a late
bloomer i've got what i'm gonna i would end up having a wife much younger than me i need to have the body of a 30 year old man quick so i
started studying i mean i was 30 at the time you know what i mean i need to keep it here
um so the trouble it got me into is when stuff started to work dramatically work
i would sit down in interviews like this with journalists and people will go how old are you russell when i was they were
guests trying to get a compliment and they would they started to guess four years younger five years younger than 10 years younger
than 15 years younger like you have today and i thought this is showbiz [ __ ] that i'm gonna knock a few years off
because the one prejudice people are still allowed to have not book you cause you're old can't wait till old life matters starts because i'm
going to be [ __ ] behind no but seriously why can we why is it okay to make redundant and underpay and exclude
people based on their chronological age but that prejudice alive and well um so
i i thought i lied i lied my ass off and of course i was really unsophisticated
about it i was like celebrating my real birthday with comedians and friends and then lying to the observer or the
mirror how much did you lie by five years oh not bad i forgive you um but so that was a story
that was a tabloid story in two newspapers and i and a lot of
jokes were made on tv a comedy awards ceremony so i was quite
mocked for it so as a comedian eminem style i took that wrote a show
about it called right man wrong age took it on tour owned it no one said a word since and now i talk about it all
the time i think it's quite funny really it's quite human i mean what the [ __ ] if so if i don't know what whatever the
thing is in your profession maybe it's age as well it's been aged for me when i was 18 everyone wrote about me
because i would like i'd made a hundred pounds when i was 18 and i realized that in my industry
your age and the achievement are the most important things so when if i was 18 i've made a hundred quid
they had me on bbc this 18 year old's made a hundred quid right and i realized that by when i get to 25 i actually need to have
made about 100 million for them to consider me the same way yeah so i'm like super slowly changing my birthday every year i'm like oh 27. i'm
like i need to be a billionaire right so but from a business sense it might be exaggerating turnover to seek
investment then revealing real turnover afterwards but say okay we were winning this anyway that type thing so i was exaggerating
turnover to attract investment um but i didn't realize it was a massive
issue because people come to stand up comedians for authenticity and realness
particularly my type of stand-up so anyway i owned that chucked it back that's all
good how i've done it is just there's loads of places you can go to i started with dave asprey and
bulletproof and all of those things although i do think drinking butter is way over the top
but it's moving towards a lower carb not keto nothing extreme i don't
believe in anything extreme that's hard to stick to but certainly i don't believe we're supposed to eat white bread and cereal and [ __ ] like
that working with what we build to do would be the most basic way without spending money anyone that's watching
this can start we woke up on the savannah this morning you and i it's time to go hunting
there ain't going to be food there we probably would have eaten at 2 p.m no doubt about it human beings are built
to have anywhere between 16 hour to 2 day fasting gaps no doubt about it
and sure enough now we look at this on a cellular level we can see what happens so i ate at um last night i went very
late so i didn't eat till nearly 11 p.m by now as i'm speaking to you not only do i have an intense [ __ ] focused
high from only having had coffee and water which has got to be a good thing there's um autophagy going on in my
cells so the cells are eating up their own bits of dead protein and [ __ ] just out of sheer
desperation for something to eat that's the first thing that happens apoptosis is the proper name for it
the cells that the [ __ ] ones just die and burn off like the crust at the edge if you pour
food on the edge of that situation as far as i understand the science i'm sure people will refine what i'm saying i'm trying to distill what i've learned for the layman
you you keep all that crap in so unfortunately we're pro fasting is brilliant i don't buy into
many fads but the science here you can see under a microscope so intermittent fasting and eating lower
carb is something anyone can do someone on 10 grand a year can do that tomorrow so eat more like leafy green vegetables
i think if you're on 10 grand you are probably into yeah exactly but eat more leafy green vegetables breakfast is
i think the easiest one to skip because you produce a hormone in the night that suppresses appetite anyway otherwise you'd wake up hungry all night
if you are waking up hungry or diets [ __ ] change it so you don't i won't wake up hungry so we're brought up
to wake up not hungry and eat a bowl of cocoa pops and then boom the insulin goes up insulins you don't want your insulin
high and the only way to do that is sugar and carbohydrate so lower your carbohydrate 120 gram net
a day anyone can do that still rice if you like bread eat bread but eat wholemeal bread that's the two most basic things you can
do now so far as the more intense chemicals i can tell you what i'm on i
would take phytation in the morning which is a synalytic activator something that's that stops cell
um decrease and senescence like aging in cells once a week i will probably also take
another synalytic activator a chloroquine is called i take pqq every morning that's the little pink one
i do take nmn which is really expensive but the the life force in the cells that
keep us going is called nats nad and that's what causes aging aging is
not inevitable it's your cells we're a combination of digital and analog information so every
time you rewrite a cell it gets rewritten a little bit less well and then you get wrinkles and gray hair and you start forgetting and you die
so if you can help the cells be more accurate in writing you can stay younger not just in how you
look but generally so i do take nmn every day that's the big one
and that that is a precursor to creating nad in the body and i've i mean i have no
botox i have no filler in my face i do use stuff from boots and
moisturizer and i do go for like a posh facial now and again but there's nothing artificial in my skin um
this is a great point moment to cut to my podcast sponsor nmn
loads of people make it okay um if you're looking for a good one in the uk go on amazon i think it's
double wood he's good it's expensive though man you're looking at six pounds a day
for a substantive yeah five six pounds a day but if you think if you're spending if you're lucky enough to be spending
that on on a coffee take a flask buy an mn instead i bought my own coffee today
so what i will do is my pet hate is watching a video like this listen to podcasters and people not listing
grams and brands afterwards and all the top guys david sinclair's the guy you want to read by the way if you read one book it
will change your life it's why we age and why we don't have to david sinclair he does all the science but he always refuses
to give like geeky levels of endorsement what i take because his inbox always crashes so what i will do
is i will i will send you exactly what i take on a daily basis you need to check with your physician
and you need to make sure everything's right for you obviously but nmn is definitely the one
that encourages nad production and helps the cells copy themselves and slow down aging
resveratrol very very very important so i take a um 750 milligrams of nmm and i take a
gram of resveratrol every morning don't go on amazon and buy resveratrol the brown stuff you need
trans resveratrol the ultra refined stuff you need a gram of it a day vita fair is
is a good brand what about hair hair they've still not starting to get grazed yeah they're still not solved why we go
gray or because baldness is a genetic program that's running like your height it's harder to hack
it's to do with the testosterone hormone dhd that kicks in dht that kicks in um so your body
after a while and the way it synthesizes testosterone in the scalp causes the follicles to die and fall off
the only way to do that is to block dht but if you're a man it's a too it's a double-edged sword because if you
start messing with your testosterone you can lower your sex drive lower your aggression i need lots of
aggression in what i do when i go on stage and for exercise and things so i don't take things like um
finisteride which we know works because i'd rather be jason statham
like bald and horny than have loads of hair in a eunuch that said um i am losing my hair at the
crown i have been for about two years the reason you can't see it today as much as you could two years ago i am
using a derma roller um you can buy these cheaply on amazon
make sure you buy one with individual titanium spikes if it's boasting hundreds of titanium spikes it's a shite
one it means they've got a rolled out bit of titanium you want one if it's plastic it'll be
about 190 200 spikes titanium and you'll be able to see each individual spike 0.5 millimeter
once a day roll roll roll it's a little bit painful roll roll and roll at the temples here and then you would
put on minoxidil 15 ideally duoden's a good one
again very expensive you're looking at 340 quid a month um but it works what does it do you
start to get first of all little pubi gray hairs and it just holds the wolf
so you're not bald you don't have like 17 year old hair but as you can see i am no i am not bald
and that's all i do the roller is the roll is about oh no the roll is about a tenner
the minoxidil is expensive but you can get like a get it down to about 30 pounds a month but don't go below 15
and if you really want to do belt on braces how you shampoo is important get a really good caffeine shampoo like alpacin and you
want um a brush like it's like a round really cheap round plastic brush with
the plastic bristles like boys would have gelled their hair with back in the day one of those and when the shower really
scrubbed that shampoo in and leave it for five minutes so if you shave or you brush your teeth don't have your toothbrush and shave while the
foam's there and then shower it out how did you get into all of this was it that book
no no that's i've just researched myself the optimal methods for hair regrowth but for biohacking
i've used david perlmutter the doctor a cardiovascular doctor about heart health
and cholesterol and make trying to learn the safety of going higher fat i use dave asprey for a lot of the
supplements your pqq and things like that and all the knowledge about high fat and biohacking
and sleep and all that and i use david sinclair for the real real hardcore science on life extension
it's a brilliant book it's just about accessible for the main reader but if you get into it you love it there's loads of stuff in there i don't do like
the cold showers and things like that cold showers tell me about that i've uh i've heard about this but i just don't
have the guts every day it just feels like it will ruin my day the most controversial thing about what i've said
is i'm not recommending people go low carb i'm just saying it's what i do
you might come from australasia and you might have different genetics
that mean you if you eat a high fat diet it's incredibly dangerous check what your doctor recommends go and
do your own research go to atlas biomed where you can get your own biome sequence by sending a bit
of poo through the post it's fascinating and they send back your whole internal microbiome
get your cholesterol tested three months in six months in see what it's doing my cholesterol of
course is off the [ __ ] charts but so is my hdl cholesterol meaning my cholesterol ratio is good
do i have plaques in my arteries yes i do i've run a ct scan
so you need to take your own call on that i mean if you're a student and you get
hit by a car and you're 18 years old and we do an autopsy you will have plaque in your arteries
Cancel culture
babies have plaque in their arteries we all have blackener arteries i remain to be convinced that the fact i
have cholesterol running around my blood actually is the thing that makes the
plaque cholesterol that i'm in a minority i'm not medically trained i could be talking [ __ ] and i could be
in the coffin when i'm 60. but i'm fascinated by it i'm a layman i'm on a journey
you do your own reading the nhs recommendation certainly isn't eat high fat but i just don't buy the
science it stinks to me so and plus i just i'm going on how i feel sure yeah
probably the most important way um your podcast you have a podcast which um
talks a lot about cancer culture yes what's um what's going on our society at the moment in terms of cancer culture it
seems to be getting much more uh maybe because of algorithms and we're we're separate you know we're creating
these echo chambers and we're defining you know this side is you know left and this is right and there's nothing in the middle but what's going on within
society and uh i guess the question i'm going to come to eventually is how how do we fix it and can we fix it mm-hmm where are we
[ __ ] i think we're probably a little bit [ __ ] for the time being because after loads of historic injustice and
inequality and i hate the word woke i don't i almost don't want to be woke because it's such
a [ __ ] word um i just think waking up to things you've not seen before
the word wokes become politicized so i reject it as a term but we we need to swing the barometer a
little bit this way until everyone's being represented properly then it will settle probably in our children's generation it will settle
to stop panicking gary davely and everyone with a union jack profile it will it will settle um
what i find frustrating and toxic is we're living in a culture where you
can be canceled overnight at middleton cancelled overnight sharon i was born cancelled overnight
it doesn't matter who you are what your background is what color or gender you are you are at risk no one is safe trust me especially white
men well anyone really i remember um i don't even know if i want to put it back out there but
no reggie eights of it and he said something about jewish music producers yeah i remember just about survived that so i i i don't
think anyone i think any in fact i think it's probably worse if you're of color because the right will be ready they'll be [ __ ] receive
[ __ ] c so i would actually say no i would say i think everyone's at risk from this
it's a rabid oh we got one of them particularly a lefty and cancelled him
how can we live in a culture of instant black tradition say black and white
after what is there but instant black and white cancelling where you can wake up in the morning and be gone that at the same time
exists alongside how dare you use a label nothing has meaning we're in a post-modern world of
amorphous fog where we don't even have pronouns nothing's real history is not real the
things you've learned aren't real literature isn't literature nothing has a label no you're cancelled and i'm sure what
yeah well which is it oh are we in a post-modern nothing means anything
everything's up for grabs shifting meaning diverse culture which sounds quite exciting to me as a comedian
or are we in a nazi germany executed the next morning both of those two together head [ __ ]
i have this tweet saved in my drafts on twitter and it says and i didn't tweet it because i didn't have the nuts right because i was being i was like loki
being canceled for something i said at the time so i thought i'll just stagger this one out but it says the left will allow you to be non-binary in
everything but your opinion right and it's kind of what you're saying there it's like we've got to the point where we understand things aren't
binary right in sexuality and other points but my opinion has to be like if the stance i take on black lives
matter doesn't perfectly i don't look like i'm wearing like as i said in the last podcast with anne the football kit shoes socks shirt
then i am definitely of the right and i should be treated as such yeah and i i had it quite recently with the
um dia sarah everett every tragedy because i made the point
that the narrative and this is this key sentence that i just social media just didn't allow me to
express then which narrative is most helpful and productive in creating the shift we
need to see in male behavior which narrative is it the narrative
that um which i saw a lot of which is it's it all men all men are the are the the
problem is that the narrative which is most helpful and productive and so the the conversation i was trying
to have is real politic what works in the real world yeah i'm not saying there's not a [ __ ] problem with men or they're not pigs or there's not like
the patriarchy or there's not misogyny the stats say that i'm not the stats the stats say 97
of young women have experienced some form of sexual abuse or harassment my my point is about that which
narrative is most productive and helpful you're a businessman you're like which model can we employ to get the best profit yeah because i i reflect
i said well when tommy when tommy robertson ran around saying okay it's not all muslims but it's always muslims that are blowing
up buildings whatever we would run them out of town because that's a deeply toxic way to think right and it's the same
with black people like we get you know locked up more so asserting that you know it's not all black people but
it's some black people therefore the fear is all black people the way that i got to my logic i was like i have two nieces who are gonna go into
the world who i love dearly what would i say to them they're four years old and three years old
what advice would i say to them to help them a guard against predatory male behavior
but also to help them in their life be productive and to work with 50 percent of the population it definitely wouldn't
be lse right sit down you're gonna have to fear all men
some of them the threat alessi is my niece is all men that's not for me wouldn't be a
imagine the damage i would do to my niece i mean i don't know what to say you
put it brilliantly i i i got finished off i got finished so badly on instagram i was [ __ ] are they
finished me it's because part of the problem is having a discussion like this when a girl has
just died if you and i to have this at university in two years time it's quite an interesting it's a very
interesting conversation that needs to be had so i did do a stand-up response to it i did a one-minute thing but i waited 10
days smart i waited 10 days and then i did a rant about
um why do we teach sex education so late why do we teach consent so late and i just made fun of the british education
system not speaking to teenagers about sex enough because i think that's what the issue is um we don't teach our but at all boys
whether they're whether they're predatory boys or not men aren't all about sex early enough
from angels to sex offenders they should be taught in primary school not from porn no exactly that's where the problem is
um but yeah so i think sometimes having trying to have a con i i do actually just disagree
slightly with one thing she said right at the top which was when you said oh um
i need to have a binary opinion but but not have a binary sexuality because i i do think
no you can have a non-binary opinion i we could be talking about jane austen and literature and we can say
yeah but i can't think of a subject you and i can can have a conversation on where fashionable post-modernism nothing
means anything doesn't apply on a major issue black lives matter yeah we could we could we could talk
we could talk about now we're not we're not going to say whether black lives matter or not but we could have a discussion about
rape does race exist on a genetic level we prove that it doesn't so what is race does we could we could chat and everyone
could leave the electoral going i don't know what to think in a lecture or face to face or we could broadcast it now
talk talk about race 100 talk about does race exist and this is why i love podcasts because you get context and nuance
180 characters in the middle of the black lives matter russell why haven't you posted the black
tile you can't go well does racing exist people go racist silence is violence but you can still but what i mean is we can be post-modern
fluffy and not say anything almost about anything but we still be canceled at the same
time now those two things are both quite extreme yeah i mean they're opposites and that's making class cloak can close down debate
and hamstrung people i like my um offensive people
where i can hear them i don't like them on whatsapp groups hidden i was never against um nick griffin of
the bnp going on question time i don't mind putting that out there a lot of people say you put him on there you legitimize his views what actually
happened he looked like a total [ __ ] and now he's disappeared have the courage to know like i do think
there is good and bad i don't think right-wing people are bad left-wing people are good in fact i think it's just as many [ __ ] across the
spectrum i do think violence and hatred is bad full stop sorry i do it's a moral absolute moral category i
would rather see the people who think it have their arguments exposed the biggest experiment we've ever seen of that is
donald trump yeah where his [ __ ] just fell apart because most people saw he was a [ __ ]
regardless of what he'll tell you and then you probably won't see someone like him for a long while now
he was right and that sort of right-wing sentiment rose around the world at the same time like bolsonaro yeah even here in europe all at the same
time and it almost feels like now it's falling a little bit away i don't like chastity belts and and gagging and things and
that the when they were like donald trump's coming we won't give him a state visit nonsense i want red carpet i want streets lined and let
him hear what we think let him see the way british people show they're unhappy
don't sort of all mutter into your tea poses and send memes like in shoreditch [ __ ] let's go out
there let's let's let's let's where's our pranksters where's simon brodkin doing a stunt on him
that you know have the courage of your of your arguments the goodies always winning films and
they will win on the earth i believe that i'm an optimist should anybody be cancelled d platformed
chucked off immediately thrown out not in haste that's why i make evil
genius it's a slow weighing up over the hour we take the good and the bad we have an
intellectual discussion and it's very tongue-in-cheek and funny but it's a long discussion about the
people's merits it's interesting as well the elitism of it as well why are picasso's paintings
still hanging why the guy was a grade a nonce and misogynist
why are his painting still up because it's so lofty and important we can't quite bring ourselves to cancel it
i mean i don't know if do we go here i mean i don't know what i think of that michael jackson documentary anyway
but it's almost like michael jackson's so powerful and musically important that we dare not go there so there comes
to a stage where we're not willing you know someone sort of cancel proof
i mean if you're really really controversial look at the old testament he did some vile [ __ ] things stoning
people like flooding people with fire burning gaze how has he not been
cancelled old school god too powerful that's interesting i've
never actually considered that some people are too michael jackson's a very good example because i don't want to give it my spotify is
going to be empty i might just go over bump and grind being deleted
all right do you know it's funny because i was actually thinking about michael jackson this week because i just absolutely adore the art yeah and have it the thought of having
to separate mike the the artist from the art and that the artist could have been such a horrible predator it re
something that helped you know the useful rule of thumb i've found is the closer the art is to the predation
and the nature of the predation the more problematic it is so i find picasso very problematic because everything i'm looking at in the studio is
in a gallery it's possibly a teenage girl's body i find michael jackson problematic because when he's talking about love and
i want to be close to you and i want to touch this and that what's he singing about what am i dancing to yeah if someone
writes beautiful romantic novels but they like harming animals in private less problematic
because when i'm reading the novel i'm not absorbing animal harm sure am i absorbing pedophilia if the song is
who's r kelly singing about bumble grind with whom an underage do you see what i mean yeah so what's what's next for you what are
you working on what's um what's the next chapter of your life all about and as far as you're concerned well uh as well as just doing
tv all the time whoring it up on any show that will have me which i've been doing since i started
it's about the theater's reopening um for now outdoor social distance performance so
i'll be finding as many spaces where i can put a marquee over vented at the side just to get back out there and stay
sharp i am working on a novel i always um i'm working on a sitcom i always am and i'm developing formats i always am i'm
always hustling always trying i'm yet to get that format away where i own it and it's my ip
i have with evil genius i have i have made a tv pilot of that with bbc studios
i would love to sell that because i think that would work globally as a format very timely as well i have got my eye on
things like that as well but mostly it's how can i get in front of people and make them laugh because that's what i want to do
well uh you certainly are very good at that um it's it's a talent that you have that
i'm like positively jealous of like just your natural ability to make people feel comfortable and to laugh it's a
real i feel the same with you multi-million pound businesses i wish i had that i feel like i would
have been more successful if i had that i told you for one year we both keep revenue no no no
thank you for coming today no thank you so much it's been a real pleasure and i don't think people realize how much of a
[ __ ] intellectual you are my first clue was all those books you had behind you in your zoom background when i did your podcast but i dug my way out the ghetto
with books like that you're so [ __ ] smart and i don't think people realize that i think they think you're a comedian you're much more than a comedian you're
[ __ ] genius at the same time it doesn't pay to look too smart when you're a comic true i'm ready to i love radio 4 but i
want to be on itv one as well i disrespect us listen thank you so much for your time today and um people people know where
they can find you but your podcast evil genius is immense and it's very timely and needed in our society so thank you for doing that and
i am trying to squeeze out stand up on channel four during the day so if you're ever
at home or you've got a day off steph's packed lunch twice a week i'm on there doing that i never thought i'd do dates i'm telling you i [ __ ] i love it and
i do stand up at 1pm world needs that too right now yeah thank you so much russell appreciate it thank you

Intro
there's a lot of rumors surrounding jim and today he addresses some of them for good my dad he was out of my life from
fairly young he was arrested he was in prison for a while he was definitely sociopathic i wonder what man i would be
if he had stuck around oh i've lost count the amount of times i've been called a cheetah me and tony broke up just over two years ago me and
sarah got together as far as the world is concerned a few months later but obviously that wasn't it because the
world only found out me and tony broke up when we decided to tell them because i lost my [ __ ] the other day on
on social media so i can take hate i've got a thick skin it doesn't it bounces straight off i don't care this is my job
it's not a personal reflection on me but when it comes to somebody calling my pregnant fiance the names
they called her and saying that my baby should be miscarried that's where i draw the line
some people come on this podcast and they're cagey sometimes they even try and bend the
truth protect their ego dare i say it sometimes they even lie
not my next guest completely utterly brutally honest raw unfiltered and vulnerable he's a
british celebrity with six or seven or eight million followers but you don't know jim you don't know
jim chapman almost nobody does today we're talking about success the chronic curse of overthinking we're
talking about love breakups rumors both of the similarities in our mindsets we're talking about how you need to be a
contradiction in various parts of your life if you're going to be happy something i didn't realize until today
until this conversation and we're talking about child abuse child abuse to an extent that most of us could and
should hopefully never be able to imagine we're talking about paralyzing anxiety social media it's upsides and
downsides and what all of this life stuff is fundamentally about unavoidably there's
a lot of rumors surrounding jim and today he addresses some of them for good
without further ado i'm stephen bartlett and this is the director ceo i hope nobody's listening but if you are then
please keep this yourself
Experiences from your childhood that shaped who you are today
jim i always think the most important place to start when i have these conversations is getting to know
the experiences that made you who you are today because for me that creates the context for
everything we're about to discuss and a lot of the time people don't really know those things um so tell me about some of
the experiences when you're younger when you're in school um that you think have contributed to the man you are today
okay um i guess and god is instantly gonna sound like a sob story and it absolutely is not this is a positive
thing i guess the first thing that brings to me is my dad so uh my dad was he did bad things like he he abused my
mum um from even before i was born i got two older sisters who um
you know dealt with it as well i don't think he ever turned a hand to them but he
verbally was very i mean even i remember that and i was super young i remember him being very very hurtful and very
unkind and just bullying to my sisters i think he always wanted boys so my
brother and i were kind of like i've got a twin so we were like the prodigal children i suppose
um i didn't know this because obviously i was born into it but it's not it wasn't
until i got a little older and i'd have like sleepovers at friends houses or i would just be in the presence of other
people on their parents and i'd be like wait your house isn't terrifying that's that's uh this is great you know and i
think i got as i got slightly older i realized that things weren't quite right and it was
one day uh my brother and i were in the room next door where we slept my parents
and we walked in and my dad was like on top of her just beating the [ __ ] out but basically and my brother and i we're only tiny we must
have been like five or six tried to pull him off but obviously he was huge so just pinging us away and it was a
wild night you know the police came took him away um etc etc just kind of
he i didn't know at the time but he had been beating my mom and abusing her for
years but of course she was trapped now my mom is a saint but also she doesn't tolerate fools she's not
i think the thing about domestic abuse is a lot of people go oh just get out of there just get out of there it's not it's not as simple as that she had her
kids to think of i remember being in the car with my dad and he would threaten to just crash the car and kill us all he drove like a maniac he was drunk quite a
lot my mom couldn't just leave with four children because he found us we tried to
leave he found us you know so i think um that he's very much a cautionary tale
for me um he was out of my life from fairly young but never
fully out because he you know was taken away by the police he was arrested he was in prison for a
while but despite the fact that we had like a court order that he couldn't come near he still came near all the time at
one point he kidnapped us a very strong word at one point he took me um it just kind of came
to the window and i was his son you know he was my dad so i worshipped him and i still didn't fully understand so i
remember going to the window and saying mom's calling the police you have to go and he just went okay and just took me with him and drove
we're in a bloody police chase drove like super fast and the police had to kind of you know stop and pull him over um
it was you know it was a very unsettling time for a child but
because of that he was removed and i spent most of my childhood being brought up by my mum and my big sisters so
i wanted for nothing um i was very well loved very well protected super well
looked after and i think actually i often wonder and i was having this chat with sarah the other day because obviously we've got a child on the way
and i was thinking i wonder what man i would be if he had stuck around or or if we couldn't get away from him or
whatever it would have been um and you know whether he wanted to or not he taught me
a lot of lessons but i think mostly cautionary lessons because my family are
bloody great you know there's uh i've got two big sisters i've got a mum i've got a twin brother and i would choose no
one else on the planet to take those roles if i had the choice they would be the people i choose 100 um
and he missed out on that because he was unwell i would say um he had ms and i
always remember him you being a victim of it in a way that my sister inherited from it from him and
she's so positive with it like she's not a victim she doesn't let it beat her she has
times when she's tired it gets on top of her she has a little sob she goes to bed she recognizes the signs though and she
goes right okay it's getting on top of me i need to rest for a while i remember my dad just being like a
victim of it and being like ruined my life he did this he used to play football from what i understand a fairly high-ish
level like kind of he played for west ham not in the a team but something and he was like oh
the ms ruined it for me which i'm sure it did you know there's no question with that but life deals you cards and you
react you behave in a way that you that you see fit um and
he let the card's life doubt him
ruin everything i think and i think because of that he was angry um i also i mean i don't say this
lightly but i think he was definitely sociopathic he manipulated everybody and a lot a lot my mom didn't even know
about until we were clear from him and then people start asking her for money because you know he owed it to them i
mean he he went to prison for like armed robbery or something like he was just you know really bad things um so i think
for me that's kind of the first thing my mind goes to when someone asked me about
kind of um childhood um formulation of me but i don't
necessarily think of it as a negative thing because actually i think that because he was removed from my life by my protectors my mum my big sisters i
had a wonderful childhood you know we didn't have any when he was around there was more money because i think he stole a lot of money and because he he took it
you know there was two parents earning but also he he earned it by nefarious means suddenly we had no money um
and my nan had to like buy the house that we lived in and we stayed at my mum's best friends for like a year or so
because she took us in because we couldn't afford anywhere else but i was safe and i was happy and i was
like my mum had more capacity to be a better mum because she wasn't
constantly running for the hills you know so actually i think that it's a really
positive thing um that happened because imagine if he was still around imagine if he was still my father
figure now at 33 i'd be a mess for one thing i think but i'd also be
i wonder if i'd be a not a nice man and actually i pride myself on being decent and kind
um and he missed out on that i read a little bit about the story as i was doing some research on your
book and things like that and one of the most startling parts of all of this is how much empathy
dare i say you appear to have for this man which i think people would find surprising i
think you said i don't blame him for how things happened yeah i don't i i actually
i i think of myself as quite an empathetic person um i rarely have arguments with people um i
do with sarah obviously because we live under the same roof um and like we have disagreements but your fiancee yes my
fiance yeah um although not at the moment because she's pregnant so you can do no wrong um but i do have uh i tend
not to have like extra personal drama because i i do consider how it would be from someone
else's perspective and i appreciate that yes okay i could have my say because i feel slighted about a thing and i could
say well you did this and it made me feel that but that's my feelings on an action that they
um and they will have equal and opposite feelings on the way i behaved because of
their actions nobody i don't i believe nobody will go out of their way just to be a prick you know they've always got
their thoughts and feelings and their motivations and i don't think anyone's doing it like oh that'll pissed him off
i'll show you you know what i mean they're living their life we all live in our bubble my uh my therapist calls it the lifeboat
we all live in our lifeboat right um but we're all in the same ocean
so depending on how good your lifeboat is you will weather the storm or not right
there's a storm on the ocean we're all in it especially at the moment it's pandemic right we're all in the pandemic together but it depends on the boat
you're sailing on um and there are times when boats kind of bump into each other or someone's in a dinghy and you need to
sort of tie them to yours for a while and help them get through things whatever but i really don't feel like anybody is
purposely um an ass it might be manipulative they might see
a way that they can behave that will um better them
in a situation where okay i'll come off better with that and it might it might do him no favors but you know they're
not doing it for that reason they're doing it for that reason they're doing it because they want to um
have a better situation for them not just to piss me off so i tend not to have arguments i will say to someone
that's not cool can you see that from my perspective um and you and and do you think so when you
think about your the situation with your dad it seems like from that you you avoid attributing blame to him
and then so i i'm questioning myself i'm saying is that because you understand the reasons why he was the
way he is or um you have empathy for i have yeah i just i think i just have empathy for
people i don't i think there's definitely blame i think we all we all have to own our own actions um
but i think there are also there are reasons behind actions i don't think
it's ever as simple as he hit my mum just because he's aggressive i think you have to dig
deeper like my my granddad was so his dad not okay i remember being i remember
going to his house and he'd be like watching not porn but like softcore in front of
us you know as just he was just i don't know i don't know if he was just a bit like um
senile at that point or or what but you know it's not all right to do that with
young kids around um and you see these generational cycles right 100 yeah and i'm very proud and
very happy to have broken that cycle because you know my i don't i don't know what his dad was like but my granddad taught my
dad his behavior not all of it because i actually i actually do think there was um i actually do believe my dad had
sociopathic tendencies which isn't necessarily a taut thing it's more like a brain function thing you know um but i
unpleasant traits from parents
think there was definitely something there and it didn't help having his dad
uh teach instill in him certain beliefs and patterns or whatever
quick one starting from the minute the lockdown is lifted we're going to start bringing in some of our subscribers to watch how this podcast is produced
behind the scenes means you get to meet the guests meet myself and see how we put all of this together if you want that to be you all you've got to do hit
the subscribe button my mum is a very allowed person and that's a huge understatement like loves
to scream in people's faces very short temper my dad is a certain way and as i've got older and older i've got more
conscious that at times i feel like myself becoming a little bit like them in
certain moments and it scares me sometimes i think and i think well genetically of course
i'm half of each of them so um have you ever has it ever concerned you in the same way that you might have picked up
some of the unpleasant traits of either of your parents um is that across your mind i'm turning into my mom
my mom my mom has unpleasant traits only in as far as she for example when i moved house wouldn't
stop going on about parking like that sort of thing oh you better get a pokemon i live in london you don't get off street parking i've got a
parking permit apart around the corner that's my life but she's like oh you need to get a driveway i'm like no i
don't like that's the sort of thing she won't let it drop she's got a fact in her mind about um trump for example and
she goes oh trump's bad he did this thing yeah but what about all the other things yeah you know so she's um
that's her kind of annoying trait and if that's the worst i get then i'm fine with that um as far as my dad i don't
think i mean yeah like i say he's half me or i'm half him i suppose um
but i think that the thing is about my degree is in psychology right so i know a little bit about it and i'm always
quite conscious like i know for example there are certain genes that will only get triggered under
certain environments so yes all right i might well have his gene for something but if i don't if i'm not in an
environment where it's had to uh where it would have expressed itself then i might
never and i also think that there is an element of um
i guess consciousness that can override that self-awareness yeah self-awareness and education therapy psychology totally
yeah yeah i'm very um i work on and i said i hate this i hate saying this as it sounds like really
wanky but i work on bettering myself you know i i i know my flaws i work too much like i
forget to bring my head up and i neglect sarah sometimes because i'm too busy typing away or i'm too busy
in my own little world stressing about whatever i'm stressing about which doesn't need to happen but it does and i
i'm aware of that and that's the sort of thing i work on but i've never been aggressive never been violent um
i really do boxing quite a lot um but it's not about the violence of it it's about the chess of it like i really like the
it's an intellectual sport you know you have to be smart you have to think about where you're positioning all the time um and i've
never this is not i don't know if it's not in my nature but it's something that i won't
entertain there are times where i get driven bonkers by sarah or by people and i just think oh
my god i could just like nut you right now obviously i'm never going to yeah because it's just
every fiber in my being is would not allow me because i've seen the impact i've seen
i'm six foot three i could do some real damage um but i just never would so i i
do get loud sometimes if i'm you know if we're having an argument i would kind of just
talk louder and i think with me it's there in particular it's tricky because we're both quite
smart and so when it comes to an argument we're just trying to outsmart each other the whole time which makes it really
frustrating because we're both going no you're wrong because of this yeah and both of you are right yeah and actually
yeah with truth in both um for sure um but it's really hard to see that when you've got your blood up you know what i
mean but i totally think that there's no there's i've got i like to think i've got the
best bits of my mum um and if there is any kindness in my dad and i remember moments i don't i
don't have loads of memories of him and 90 of them are negative and scary but there are moments i remember him sitting
down with me and reading there was a magazine i forget what it was called but you used to get like um
What kind of dad do you want to be?
a little bit of a figure every time and you'd make the figure and it was like something to do with bugs and we made a big spider 12 quid per magazine
basically yeah really really overpriced i remember him um he would read it with me from cover
to cover and we'd put the bug together now there would end up being six issues um that we didn't get done and we'd have
to in one go because he wasn't around because he was gone doing whatever he was doing and um he would let me down a lot but
i remember doing them and i remember loving that time with him um what kind of dad do you want to become
because you've got a kid on the way now yes again yeah thanks um it's really hard to say this because i
know that every first time prospective parent goes oh i'm going to be the best dad and
actually you know invariably will all [ __ ] up at some point right it's gonna happen um i just
i think for me if i can have a child and if i can instill in them
the waste of time in anxiety like that just the the just the sheer
nonsense of it like i i really want them to understand that
worrying does nothing you know yes all right we can be stressed about things there are times when life is hard and
things there's challenges to overcome but you overcome those challenges when they present themselves there's no my
therapist one said to me when you worry you rob yourself twice right because the first time around you're
overwhelmingly thinking about nothing but a potential problem which may never ear his head if it doesn't ruin his head
then you've wasted time worrying about it if it does ruin his head then you're forced into action because you can't stay in that situation so why stress
about something that's never gonna happen or you know something that you will solve if it does happen so i really
want my child to understand just be content i think um
and to know that both me and sarah and all of our families so my my siblings my
mum sarah siblings and her parents will always be there to help you know i think
that if i can do that then i'll have done a good job um i want to be patient it's in my nature
i'm a very patient person but i also know that i'll be tested so when i do snap i snap quite quite loudly
so i want to be calm i want to be patient i want to be soft and considerate
and again empathetic because the thing about kids is i i really appreciate is they get frustrated
because they're obviously told what to do by their parents they can't necessarily verbalize or actually don't have the communication ability to say
no that's not what i want you know they have to appreciate that obviously what i want overalls it for the most part
because safety or whatever sure but i think they i also need to appreciate that they'll be frustrated because they
can't communicate effectively why they feel pissed off
Failure anxiety
because i said no um and that will often come out in like tantrums or whatever so
and they won't understand daddy's world and why right when they're trying to get your attention they don't know you're on a zoom core pitching something for
example just like daddy won't play with me you know so totally it's interesting i also want to
make sure i'm around enough my job totally allows that like i have time i can work as little or as
much as i want that's that's the beauty of my job obviously i'll work less i earn less but you know i can make those sacrifices i don't at the moment that's
my problem i work constantly because i like what i do and because of the constant it's anxiety i'm constantly
worried about if i take my foot off the gas what happens next i find that fascinating but i picked up
on that before we started recording right because every time we talked about your screenplays or other things you're working on
you would then end the sentence with but i might lose it all right and i
i don't resonate like that i found that interesting because it's not how i end my sentences right but it was it was
like you would tell me something and then you would also then almost caveat it at the end with there is a chance i might
not i might not get it or i might lose it yeah and i i i find it particularly because i don't think in that way right
so where does that come from in you this my mum right uh 100 again she's
wonderful she has like a like an ethos it's not a saying it's an ethos which is like a day doing
nothing's a day wasted um she can't relax i can't relax as a consequence um
if i'm sitting there just chilling even if i'm watching a film which for me i consider as research because i write
films right if i'm watching something i'm like oh okay i see what they're doing there and it's like i don't watch them passively i'm constantly thinking
about them um but even if i'm sitting there watching a film i'm like oh i shouldn't be doing it
it's nine p.m right it's the evening and i'm supposed to be relaxing and i'm sitting there and i shouldn't be doing
this i shouldn't be doing this that's my biggest what's your brain saying in that moment it's telling me off it's it's going dude
you need to be you can't just be sitting here watching you need to be doing you need working and making what if this all
goes wrong how are you going to earn the money how are you going to afford to look after your child and pay the mortgage and
you know all that stuff a lot of people will resonate with that for sure um and you've addressed it in
therapy yeah what have you learned i learned that i do it yeah which a lot of people don't even know
right that self-awareness of knowing that it's a problem you have
and it's taken me i've been seeing my therapist for christ six seven years something like that how often uh it's
various if i'm going through a moment then more often at the moment like once every six weeks because i'm pretty chill
um but it's taken her most of our time together
just to crack that and she sort of said you know with me it's my biggest
um strength and also my biggest flaw it just depends on where it is on the dial like if i've got that at seven it's
great because i'm motivated and i'm enjoying my work and i'm loving it and i'm sitting there god i'm
really good at this you know and i'm typing away or doing whatever i'm doing if it's an eight or a nine it's torture
paralyzed or yeah often paralyzed often paralyzed ironically into doing nothing because
i'm so busy stressing about getting it done i don't get it
done because i've got no brain space because it's too busy whizzing around in my head going get it done get it done get it done um so there's a point where
it's sort of really um ironically kind of just it's the antithesis of what it's
designed for yeah and i think i i think i get a lot of that from my dad because i remember being young
knowing that it was easier to be busy and keep myself separate so i used to draw i'd be like
this be really arty um yeah out of harm's way and i so you would just draw in the corner because
you felt safe if he if you were busy and he wasn't if i wasn't in his in his eyeline i couldn't be
chastised or it was safer i think my dad he was very unpredictable so which is terrifying for a kid right
because you don't know if you're going to get love or you're going to get punishment for the same action
um so i always spend most of my time just kind of getting on with stuff and because of that i've developed a real
independence um a real creativity but if it's turned up too high it's
crippling whereas if it's a good number um then it's what's got me to where i am i 100
would not be here without that because i just wouldn't work as hard as i do um but i don't need to work as hard as i do
you know human beings have a couple of things they need to do they need to sleep they need to eat they have the
option of procreating that's kind of it right what else is there the rest of it is just made up
Therapy
right the rest of it is just made up [ __ ] that we've given ourselves to do society has told us that in order to be a complete
person we need to and it's climb right totally and it's bloody stressful it's it's it's debilitating sometimes so when
i have that turned up too high i end up doing nothing but i worry myself and sarah's like where have you gone like i
just disappear and i don't talk i don't like i haven't been like this for a while because i'm pretty good at recognizing
the signs and i know to take my foot off the gas a bit because of you know all the therapy i've had but yeah it's it's
the bloody worst what has helped you um therapy yeah
absolutely that being aware of it there's a point i always say this because i've actually a couple of my best mates
have i don't know a guy that's my age that doesn't need it by the way um so a couple of my best mates i've put them in
touch with therapists or sort of said something you know i think you should see someone and actually we're really open and honest with each other we're
constantly looking out if one of us is quiet on the group chat we'll go dude you all right you've been a bit quiet um
i said to him at the time i was like there's a really tough point with therapy where you start seeing someone
at first you're really resistant and you're like no i'm fine what are you talking about but when they point things out to you like [ __ ] i'm not fine but
you're aware of doing it but you have no tools in place of how to stop doing it
or how to at least challenge it so you're just punishing yourself doing it like i remember going through that stage for a long time going i hate that i'm
failing i hate that i'm still stressing out about being like working constantly or not working
constantly or whatever it is i hate that i'm doing it to myself but i can't stop and you feel a bit like a junkie you know in a way that you're like
you know it's wrong you know you shouldn't be doing it but you can't you can't not um and actually it takes a while to learn
the techniques you know mine is as simple as it's it's painful that i have to go right stop just don't do it take a
step away from your laptop step away from your camera do whatever it is you're doing have five minutes if you feel better after five minutes go back
to it if not then take the rest of the day off um and that's what i have to do i need to be
sarah needs to keep me in check quite a lot because if i sometimes it thinks up on me and i'm kind of like at stage four before i even
realized it i'm like [ __ ] i'm in too deep um so she's often like dude come back um
and that's really helpful it's hard though because you don't want to be told by someone that you're not performing
the way you should you know what i mean actually something that matters right right it's totally especially when it's your already your weakness
um but you need to be like i actually really like criticism so
it's good for me like if you know if i send someone some work or something and they go oh okay as long as it's constructive you know they go okay i see
what you're doing here don't like that that that's not great i thrive on that because i'm back in there and i'm you know so
i think having other third parties be like you're not doing right right now um and
that's something that i really want to be totally aware of when it comes to my
child because i don't want to be an absent father i don't want to be a dad that's always going no no no i'm just not my laptop come back to me five
minutes i want to be able to obviously i have to work you know we will have a living but i want to be able to
have my kid with me and be present you know and not them think that they're sort of
auxiliary or like an afterthought or just an addition i want them to know that they are the center of my universe
you know i say this every week but i'm going to say it again um it is a tremendous
pleasure to have a podcast sponsor that a you've used for maybe three years
people ask me as well they say how many heals do you drink a day the answer is probably about two sometimes two and a half um but a podcast sponsor that you
genuinely believe can help people change their life for the better um watching the team at huel
argue with each other and be so uncompromising about the ingredients
that go into this bottle or the bags or the bars all the hot and savory
Being an influencer/YouTuber
has only strengthened my evangelism for this brand watching the
founder julian and the ceo james insist that only the best ingredients go in
here and be so scientifically precise about what goes in this bottle and in the bars and in the bags
has only made me love this more because i know they've got my back and i wish all of you could be in those boardrooms
that i've been in and watch them fight for your and my health um via this
product so professionally we talked a little bit about your work there one of the things that uh that
you've said is you don't like being called like an influencer like a youtuber
uh i think it's really reductive yeah um and i think that actually if you look you know if you just weigh up the
quantity of work i do it's only about less than 50 i'd say um
unfortunately i don't get paid for the other stuff yeah so yeah
but i do lots of other stuff i appreciate that i communicate that other stuff online via my social media i just
think that influencer is for one thing's an ugly word because it implies that you are
um utilizing influence over someone whereas
actually i just share the stuff i like even if it's an ad even if it's um i'm working with a brand i'm not going to work with a brand that i don't want to
talk about right so it's i'm talking about things that i'm actually enjoying or passionate about or
whatever it may be and i don't see that as exerting influence i see that as
sharing joy or even if it's just sharing good tips or whatever it may be i see that as
a very different thing and i i also have a thing and i've mentioned this a few times as there was a void in um social media
where myself and my contemporaries all started around the same time did it for fun did it for love did it for adventure
we had no idea it was going to go anywhere and when it started to we were like oh my god and genuinely i looked back at it and i was such
nostalgia i don't miss it but i love that i was part of it you know because it was such a cool journey to moment in
history as well yeah totally absolutely was you know and we sold out these venues and we were you know we had screaming fans it felt like being in a
small version of one direction you know um it was wild and just so much fun do you miss that no
i loved it at the time when i was in my early twenties every young person
and i saw some of those clips of your meetups in like parks and stuff right and i've never seen a line that long in my lifetime yeah it's wild but like like
a thousand meters i don't even know how many meters that is of people right four like four deep in like this massive line
just screaming and crying at times it's really hard to put it into words i tried explaining it to sarah when we first met
because obviously videos yeah it's really hard and we get if i get stopped on the street now by someone she's like what yeah but she's also like
oh they didn't scream or cry like yeah you don't get it it's never used to be yeah um but my what my point was is that
like everyone thinks especially young people especially young men well all young people would love to be
that guy and you're telling me you don't miss it no i loved it at the time don't get me wrong it was great but the novelty soon wears off because
it got to the point where you couldn't i couldn't take public transport like i couldn't walk to the
shops um you know and it sounds like i'm really exaggerating but actually at the time it really was that just i would even now
if i'm walking along the street and i see a group of teenagers i'm like oh [ __ ] here we go it's not teenagers anymore they're all in their 20s but i'm
so conditioned to being aware of teenagers now that i'm like oh my god oh my god they're going to come for me and they're going to like scream and cry and
it's i don't how is this played with your anxiety though that's not that's not what sets me off so that's fine um
i've always got time for it if people stop and want to have a conversation as long as i physically have time for it i'm not rushing i'll always stop and
have a chat you know i've got i'm i'm i'm really gracious in that i appreciate that without those
people i wouldn't be in the position i'm in i don't feel like i owe them anything because at the same time i provided the content they wanted to watch but it's
definitely like almost like a transaction right i wouldn't be there without them they wouldn't a lot of them have said like when i had amounts that i
was pregnant sarah was pregnant a lot of them sort of said oh my god i can't believe you you like bought me up because a lot of these teenagers watched
my content and my contemporaries content um but shay carl as well right totally because
because they they loved like watching us and we were role models for them i suppose you know
and that's a really wonderful thing to be part of and do i say you were idyllic in a way that it often with
with the shape the shaytards and sheik shaykhal and his family right i didn't have a perfect family like that
so it was it gave you felt like you were part of that yeah i think that and also the friendships with
the others it was very identical but it genuinely was that was our life at the time it was just pure fun and like there
was no stress we were young so we had no like um no responsibility no mortgages
no no no like other things to worry about other than just like going out there and having a blast um and we just
got to document that and share it no i accept nostalgic i'm really happy i
had was part of it i don't miss it because i'm 33 i don't want 14 year old girls
pawning over me i don't know what i mean or just kind of like desperately trying i remember one time being on the tube and this young girl just burst into
tears and her dad looked at me and thought i was like would you blame him you know you're crazy i was like i'm all right i'm on
the internet which didn't help because he's like doing what um so yeah i don't
i don't miss it uh because it's actually really invasive and like i say i don't care about the notoriety it was really
lovely to be that person for some people um and to have even then a lot of those
big numbers it was still fairly underground it hadn't really reached mainstream it was just online right so
although it was lots of people it was of certain sort of sector of society it wasn't
like older men it wasn't you know it was just teenagers basically um
and it was yeah i'd say it was a real blast but i don't miss it i feel like actually i grew out of it fairly rapidly
the thing about it being teenagers is that no one can obsess like teenagers so they
would be desperate for the photo the selfie the um they'd scream and cry and go ballistic and actually but i'm really
anti-climactic i'm just i'm some dude i'm really i'll often just go i'm really sorry that it's
me so yeah i'm very like i say i'm very grateful for it and i love that i've got
those memories and i love that i've made those friends um but yeah i don't miss it who's jim now
then that's if that's old jim and that's your say your first chapter what is that what is your second chapter i feel like i've
had so many chapters actually i feel like i've i've evolved the beauty of my job is i'm allowed to do that i'm allowed to evolve when it's forced it
can be really ugly and i think that's how a lot of people lose their following um partly it's it's
entropy you know people grow up and they move on they do other things but algorithms algorithms all that but i think mostly it's just
people force it to try to get traffic and views and actually my life has just as it's changed i've
grown up with it and i've been i've accepted that change okay like for example i'm really i'm really hoping i turn into a silver fox
i'm looking forward to aging gracefully you know what i mean um and i think that that's kind of my my my role on social
media i'm not pretending to talk to young people anymore i'm not pretending to be the cool guy and like
you know i'm i appreciate that i'm i'm getting older my life's changed my interests have changed my career has
changed and i share that with people as opposed to desperately trying to still impress
a young an audience that aren't right for me i speak to a lot of youtubers and we used to sign a couple and there was this really interesting moment where
that first wave of youtuber because of algorithm changes i think predominantly algorithm changes what
they were doing then just stopped working right the views went down and i swear to god i witnessed a form of
depression and existential crisis right from these youtubers who suddenly were
like what the [ __ ] has happened what do i do with my life now because their whole identity from whether it was like 16 years old to 22 was doing this one
thing they never really understood work right and it's funny because i've never really talked about this before but one of the youtubers we signed
you'll know his name maybe 18 at the time and we remember calling him and offering him 20 grand just to show up to
a place and he's like nah right i'm not just shocked he's like no i just can't be bothered like and he had developed
that sense of like complacency about his career and how you make money and how easy it is and then when [ __ ] changes
i'm saying he can't make any money anymore and and he's spiraled down because i think life taught him
that money and life was super easy the algorithm changes and now he's like [ __ ] and he has to go work at tesco
that's something that i really can't tolerate in this industry it's when people have that attitude like i'm
where i am um because i'm good to work with as much as the numbers and as much as everything else
i've stayed the test of time because i am honest and decent with my audience and i respect my audience and i don't take the
piece and don't take them for granted but also if i am offered a job i turn up on time i say my places and thank yous
um i get a lot of repeat work because i'm good to work with and i pride myself on that and i have no
i have so little tolerance for ego like all of us if we're on set shooting a thing whether it's
whether you're the runner or the director or you're me doing the bit to camera or you're the guy going to get
coffee we're all just want to do our job and enjoy what we're doing and then go home at the end of the day and say oh that was nice you know we don't there's
no space for any of that and i think it's particularly bad in this industry
right more so than the other because when it comes to musicians or actors or whatever
they are there's some people around them right who are um looking after them and who are saying no
and who are advising them and also they're not their own content brad pitt doesn't play brad
pitt he plays someone else right someone like me my job is to edit myself take my own photo make my own caption reply to
my own comments and it's all like jim jim jim jim it's very easy to then think you're the center of the universe but
actually for every person who's commenting going gym gym gym they're also commenting on everybody else's content because they just consume the
content i might be their favorite i might not it doesn't matter i'm not
um my i am not my job and i think that's really important for a lot of influencers to work out like they
believe themselves to be important and actually i say this quite a lot if i
were to die tomorrow there'd be my friends and family would be gutted obviously and they'd be really really sad and there'd be a few people in my
audience who were like who um have a real connection with him but for the most part people go oh that's a shame i liked him and then move on and
find someone else i'm not that important to them that they can't continue without me so funny because that it sounds really
depressive to some degree to say oh i don't matter whatever but i actually think it's the opposite really freeing yeah it's the most liberating thing ever
i remember i remember having the same sort of existential conversation with myself and it really happened when i learned about
the universe and space right and i got really into the cosmos and i was like wait a minute i'm [ __ ] not important at all totally
when it like there's a scene in cosmos where it zooms out from and it just keeps going and you're like wait stop and it's like nope that's just the moon
and then it goes out and it's like that's just the galaxy and then the galaxy becomes a piece of sand and you're like what the right but the
freeing part is that means that all this [ __ ] doesn't matter and that's liberation like ego can be
and this is the the powerful thing about psychedelics from the last person that's out there who's the biggest psychedelic investor in the world right is it
dissolves your ego and says to you nothing you don't [ __ ] matter right and yeah so i just thought that was
fascinating it's really it's something that's really important to learn i think probably one of my biggest
uh learnings from my career because i went through it you know at the beginning when everyone was like obsessing over
the the youtubers i was like wow i'm like a really big deal yeah yeah um i think it's really important to know your
worth and to know your value and to um appreciate your position i know that
i am worth a certain amount of money if i work with a brand or i know that i'm worth a certain amount of time if i'm
doing a thing but i also know that i don't matter in the grand scheme of things and that this is a phase i might
i might [ __ ] this up tomorrow do you know what i mean it might last another 10 years it might last for another 30
years and i might never want to quit equally i might get bored of it and go you know what i feel like it's too invasive now whatever it doesn't matter
it's my decision and i don't owe anybody else but equally they don't owe me they don't have to watch me if they don't
choose to and i think that's really important and a lot of people especially when they're young and they're just
developing their sense of identity as a lot of influences are and suddenly they're put in a position
where they are reaching lots and lots of people um it's very very easy to think of yourself
as the center of the galaxy and we're not and actually what really matters what truly matters is the people
that matter to you you know and as much as i appreciate my audience i don't know
them you know i wouldn't know i mean statistically there'll be a certain number of them that die every year just
because of whatever right i've got no idea it's happening you're not sending cards you know what i mean like i've got
no idea what's happening so it just so happens that i'm on the other side of the camera and these people connect to me
and i connect to them but it doesn't go any further than that you know something really almost something your perspective is
fascinating because on one end you're very you're very freed right on the other end you talk about your anxiety of
of of worry and i'm trying to weigh those two things up this idea that you're like you know what
i don't have a plan i've heard you say that i don't have a you know 10 year plan the future is the future whatever but then maybe when we zoom in and we
look at the micro scale which is like right now today right it seems to be very yeah you know
you're not wrong i think on the on the wider scale um i um it's very freeing to know this
on the more individual scale like when you when you zoom right in it's the stress of survival i suppose of like
um being enough to maintain
do you know what that comes down to money i think which is unfortunate because like money is not my main motivator but i realize it's necessary
where did you learn that i feel like is there anything in your past where money or the lack thereof beca you know became
um compromised your safety no i don't think compromise my safety like i say we didn't have any um and i
appreciate that life is um it's i like i said earlier there's a point
where you have enough and that after that point it doesn't matter anymore you know you can go from having a little bit
of surplus so that you can enjoy holidays etc you know buy yourself some luxury things whatever you want after
that point it's all numbers it doesn't really make any difference but when you go the other side of the scale
and you haven't got enough it's a major stress you know because what blows my mind about it is it's all fake like it doesn't it's just it's
literally going hey here's a piece of paper for loads of your stuff and you go okay cool i put value on that piece of
paper it's bollocks but it's unfortunately the way our world works and that stresses me out just in
terms of providing like i couldn't go back i mean i could i'd have
to but i would really struggle if i had to go back to a conventional job just doesn't suit me
like i was bloody miserable my mum thought i was going to kill myself when i was working those jobs you know i i
was very very sad um i i think it's a
it's a need for me to create and i know that sounds really ridiculous and really wank but like i
i can't turn up to a job that is the same thing every day it it
it for me feels like a prison um and i actually i i think the people that can do that
are like special because how wonderful to know that you are um
you can switch on do your job um you can know that you are earning your money you're looking after your people you
know you raise your kids whatever whatever it is whatever your life is and also provide to the society and give back your taxes and all that stuff and
just be you know a good egg and then go home and switch off again i just think that's the most wonderful sensation something i've never experienced and
probably never will because my mind doesn't work that way so for me my anxiety comes from
the fear of going back to that or not being able to
provide and the only way i know how to provide is in a very risky industry where i
have to constantly churn out content have to constantly create whatever i'm creating
in order to earn the money um and that's that's a scary thought yeah um but i also appreciate that it's it's
the anxiety comes in the job of it i think the freedom comes in the um
sort of the more i guess better of it you know like i don't matter it does whatever the the
jim chapman's not really of any relevance um but for my life it's really important that i
put food on the table for sarah and my child and that's funny because you know we always live in now
right right it's only ever going to be now yeah and uh what you're saying is in the now there is urgency there is stress
yeah so we never we're never going to live in the future it's never going to be matter that's not the experience we're ever going to have maybe if we meditate we can spend some time there
but day to day we live in the we live in the present moment um it's it's yeah it's really really interesting to me and
as you say you're in an industry where a lot of people aren't making a lot of money right the creative industry so
it's particularly challenging um yeah very much so and i think people are following their passion i think the
thing with influencing in particular is that the passion is so easily monetized
but it's also so easy taken away and it's so competitive that it
often i think some people are just passionate about the business of it um
now i don't pretend to have a business mind at all i haven't got a bloody clue like i've got a production company that i've just started with one of my pals
and he is in charge of the business when it comes to my my social media stuff my management are in charge of the business
i just make the stuff i want to make and stuff that i think will be good um and i fully believe in letting
people do play to their strengths my strength is not that so i often get called like an entrepreneur or something
Does hard work matter?
i'm like you know all right i just i it just been it's been luck and timing and really
bloody hard work um and the hard work i can i'm in control of the luck and the timing i'm not um and
the other people around me are in charge of sort of i guess bringing looking after like the
financial side of it and stuff you know it's the admin stuff that i don't you hate i hate
the fiery passion yeah i hate it you said just a couple of moments ago the the proponents that have made you
successful you said like you know luck hard work etc etc
do you think you could have achieved what you've achieved over the last 10 years without hard work no
absolutely not how would you square that with the culture we live in today that
is almost viewing hard work as a bit of a toxic thing i've almost got to the point i'll never get there because i
don't care that much but i've almost got to the point just to say again i will never get there right because i'm not going gonna lie to
people where i sometimes feel bad being honest that i wouldn't be here without hard
work i'm not telling you to burn out right but i don't know how if i hadn't
have sacrifice in the way that i did i would of course that's my experience i've not lived another life right i can
only tell you what i've done yeah i think it's really important it's like work hard play hard right it's really
important i i i posted this on on my instagram stories of the days everybody there's like you're right
there is a lot of people who are sort of um [Music] uh poo pooing working hard don't work too hard and there's also people who
like on my instagram it comes up all the time hey i run three businesses and i do this and i'm only 12 years old and like
yeah but that guy's trying to sell you a course for sure it's his business yes for sure that's that's what i mean he's broke there's there's
there's there's definitely something to be said and this is where i like again this is where i struggle when you work work hard like i r and
work with passion like you know again sarah's dad says um work is a dirty four-letter word right
if you find the other thing if you find something you love doing you'll never work a day in your life so work
really hard and work with passion but also stop when you need to stop take your time off enjoy your evenings or you know
Being in the moment
again i've got a job which allows me to work as much as little as i please i wish i did like a four day week i would
very much like to do that so i have a three day weekend or i take a day off in the middle of the week i've got the means to do so just i've got the brain
to do so you know um and i think that that's
a really important distinction otherwise you work all your bloody life and suddenly you're 60 and you've gone oh my
god i haven't i actually enjoyed my experiences um i haven't actually you know i've got to do some really bloody
incredible experiences and sometimes i'm too busy stressing about what's next in my diary or finishing a thing meeting a
deadline or even stressing about the key messages i've got to get across when i'm on that adventure that i forget to enjoy
the adventure and it's the biggest sort of um waste of time that my job
has within it you know like i remember being in a on a helicopter and this wasn't me actually this was
somebody else who i recognized in i was taken away um to new york i was going on a helicopter
around manhattan and it was like you know what a cool experience and people don't get to do that very often um and
this guy was sat next to me in the middle and he couldn't take his picture because he had to lean over me and i said i'll swap seats with you the pilot
came over the um you know the whatever it said and said um oh don't swap seats because you'll
unbalance the helicopter the guy was so pissed off he said no i want to swap i'm like well no because you'll kill us now so
it's a bit different i offered you my seat when i didn't think we were going to die for doing it and he sold so much because
he couldn't get the photo he wanted and i'm like that for me really really kind of is the epitome of not enjoying the moment like
just enjoy the bloody helicopter ride around manhattan you idiot um but that's prob by products of social media or
something because yeah you know the part of the value of that was for him clearly was being able to tell the world he did
it versus being in the moment for sure for sure and that and unfortunately that is job we have to tell well we've done
something otherwise you know it hasn't happened right and then there's no point taking me on that
really cool experience because i haven't told anyone about it you know so that there's definitely a
a dichotomy there in that you need to prove that you've done it and you need to show your enjoyment um
but you need to also not let that take you out of the moment and that's a fine line one of the things i've been thinking a lot about lately which links
to that completely is because i sit here with people all the time and i and one of the things i keep noticing is that in
order for them to actually be happy they have to try and be a contradiction or two completely different people in
separate areas of their life and right a lot of the the lack of success they have either in their work or relationships or whatever or in their personal lives
comes from them not being able to switch off from being from going like
being super successful entrepreneur and then when they get home being loving patient right you know and then in the
example we've just been talking about there i would assume happiness would come from being able to do your job and take the photo
but then have experiences where you just don't give a [ __ ] if the world is watching that's entirely it like how that's not easy no it's not easy i
um and dare i say the thing that put you on the helicopter
might have been the inability to switch off in some degree because absolutely hard work yeah you're interested
i haven't i haven't got to where i am by switching off whenever i choose to you know what i mean i've got here because i
work harder than i should um that's that's a massive sacrifice because i've missed out on moments i've
missed out on um you know like there are times where i should just be more present with sarah
but i'm too busy working you know i miss out on things but i get to go on a helicopter but you know
more than that i get to live a really cool existence like i love my job so it's really difficult but my the way i
kind of cross that tee dot that i i suppose is that i
will very often much rather pay for a holiday and have a actual holiday yeah rather
than just call in a trip yeah it's very easy i mean i you know without sounding like a real [ __ ] it's very easy for me
to call tripping if i want to yeah i just email a pr say oh i want to go to dubai and they'll go all right when do
you want to go right but i tend not to because
i listen if it is oftentimes a thing will come to me and it's a place i've never been or experienced i've never had
and i'll jump on it but i will tend not to request a free trip because honestly
my time is more valuable than the money i can potentially earn so i would rather
pay my money to go somewhere and switch off and read a
book do the crossword puzzle hang out you know because i value that much more than the
money i think that that's the thing i think some people put their value in money in my view too
high um and i i don't value it like that i think my what's most important what i value more
is people and time okay quick one quick story from one of my podcast sponsors fiverr fiverr.com is
a lot of you will know if you've listened to this podcast before um one of the challenges we've had with this podcast over the last i'd say a couple
of months since we've really cranked up the production is we usually promote the podcast just on mondays so you've
probably seen on my channels monday morning about 9 a.m i put the podcast out there and one of the things we've
wanted to do is to keep that sort of momentum and height moving throughout the week from monday till sunday when the next podcast comes out but we've had
Why are you good at writing about love?
a bit of a resource capacity because jack who produces all of this and edits all of this only has so much time and
these podcasts are coming in thick and fast so we turn to fiverr to help us extend our
capacity and we hired a video editor on fiverr who's now producing all of our video clips for this podcast so now in a
very very very cost effective way we've been able to promote the podcast every single day from monday till sunday
that is what five is all about extending your team giving you capabilities you might not have had and doing it in a
very cost effective way one of the other really interesting things you said as we were talking maybe
before we started filming was you were talking about the things that you're good at writing about with your screenplays and one of the things you
said was love yeah i thought to myself i wonder why he's good at writing about love um i don't know actually i i
i know my strengths when it comes to writing and it's one of those things where to begin with vulgar imposter syndrome right constantly i still got it
10 years on but i know i'm good at that um i know i can send a script somewhere they might not like it it might not be
the thing for them and i get told no quite a lot but invariably they say you know what great script you've done a really good job there um so i am
confident in my ability there and i know my strengths are dialogue um because i
write how people talk but also get the point across like i can't i'm the worst person to watch a film with because if
i'm watching something i'm like people don't talk like what is going you know um but also love
i i just think i've got i i don't know i think i'm a bit of an old romantic and it comes down i think
it really for me comes down to how you feel love you know if you can feel love and you can put pen to paper you can
write love um and i i i pride myself on
My Old public relationship - allegations
trusting and loving like to i'm not a jealous person i'm not um
i'm never gonna micromanage a relationship or anything like that if i love someone i trust them implicitly
they can do as they wish they can go out with the boys or whatever i'm never gonna go oh who did you meet and what
happened i'm never gonna like check their phone sure you know i'm never gonna do any of that because if i love someone i'm all in um and
that for me is really important if you get your fingers burnt then all right then you then that's they get one chance you know um that's that's my life you
had a very public relationship one that was shared on youtube for many many years you ended up marrying said
person and um and then that relationship ended yeah um difficult i imagine to to have that
experience in public right it's too impossible yeah like it's uh you know we were together for 12 years and most of that time was wonderful you know it was
really great like i said we conquered the world together we were both part of that first breed of
influences like social media people we had a wicked time and then we grew up together
it was as simple as growing up in slightly different directions you know um and at some point you know are you
gonna do the further you go on yeah like that why did the gap get i literally just did this for the first time last
week on this podcast i was like i'm almost starting to see relationships like two parallel lines yeah and and if
you imagine the parallel lines have just a one percent angle either way sure right they're either going to stay
parallel they're going to go away from each other or closer together over time totally i look back at it now and i realized that actually
it probably was a small a small incline or decline whichever you want to put it but it at some point becomes insurmountable
becomes a chasm you can't leap anymore right so i look back at it and realize that perhaps it was uh it started much earlier than either
of us anticipated even either of us realized and we just kind of kept getting more and more distant until eventually we were just roommates
basically um was it hard to break it off when you get to that point because you've got the world watching yeah it wasn't hard as a
couple because we were both we both knew we deserved better right we both knew we're like this isn't working and we
took a it took a long time to have the conversation because i think we both tried for a while we're like oh come
back around we'll come back around but we're not stupid we both knew we deserved better so the com when we actually had the conversation it was for
both of us quite freeing emotional because of all the time we had together but quite freeing of course you've then
got the audience to think of who make assumptions right and i've lost county
amount of times i've been called a cheater um just and poor old sarah gets called my mistress constantly
i just i didn't even know sarah existed like she was not a person to me until well after we broke up you know like i
met her on an app and like i'm really i'm really tempted at some point sometimes to get the app right i haven't
got it anymore but i want to re-download it and find our conversation go look we started talking on this date um just just to prove the point because
it's not sarah didn't sign up for this [ __ ] you know she fell in love with me um
and it just so happens that i come with a bit of an audience who have opinions on things
and you know we all gossip right you we've all got opinions on things that i watch people go through breaks up breakups on tv or i watch like the drama
with say megan and harry or whatever and i have my thoughts and my feelings on it um but of course i'm not gonna
dm them about it you know um and i think that is the issue that on the internet there's a
sort of anonymity an anonymity and people can
say things thinking there's no repercussions i lost my [ __ ] the other day on on social media because and i'd
never address it i very much of the like i said earlier i i'm inconsequential on
the ground scheme of things so i can take hate i've got a thick skin it doesn't it bounces straight off i don't care like this this is my job it's not a
personal reflection on me so whatever but somebody had dm'd sarah a bunch of pictures of my old relationship my
previous life and said you'll never match up to her and then has sent another one saying and your child deserves to be miscarried and i lost my
[ __ ] and i've never i've never behaved this way online but i went straight to my instagram stories and i
told the person i said [ __ ] you to the person um and also
i was very mad and perhaps i should have let cooler heads prevail but actually the amount of um support i had off the back of it
people saying you know what bloody too right stand up for you stand up for sarah stand up for yourself stand up for your child um
and i've we've had two years of it right because me and tony broke up just over two years ago me and sarah got together
Horrible comments
i don't know like as far as the world is concerned a few months later but obviously that wasn't it because the world only found out me and tony broke
up when we decided to tell them we decided to tell them what we did because the press found out so actually it was
much earlier than anyone realizes because we were trying to get our heads around it and work out
how to do it with minimal um
sort of like minimal backlash minimum negative energy negative energy right because we didn't have any towards each other at all
um but when it comes to when it comes to me being called a cheater or whatever whatever it's fine
it bounces back off i i hold my head high everybody who i know and care about and
respect and love knows what really happened and that's what really matters to me i don't care but
when it comes to somebody calling my pregnant fiance the names they called her and saying
that my baby should be miscarried that's where i draw the line the person that sent that message
you know that they they probably wanted that reaction
yeah i do um i one of the best pieces of advice that i was ever given was
don't play around in the mud with the picks because you both get dirty but the pigs will love it right so i
live by a motto i've never explained never complain i don't i own my decisions like i own my life
i'm an adult i don't have to explain myself to anyone should i not wish to
right simple um i am confident
in my ability and my decisions that i'm like this is the path i'm choosing and you can like
it or lump it basically um but i felt like making an example i
didn't out anyone i didn't say any names i didn't you know share any usernames but i felt like making an example of
that person especially with it being so out of character for me to do so would have had overall a positive consequence for the
people who were thinking it but weren't writing it or the people that were thinking of writing it and actually do you know what sarah is getting much less
of it now i'm getting more specific now um so i think in a way it was almost like cost-benefit analysis yeah in a way
you know i i weigh these things up and i think there's always going to i've been thinking a lot lately because of um
there was a couple of my friend is the global head of social media at manchester united right and there's a lot of black players right and so when
the team loses what you see on the black players instagram there's lots of monkey emojis and um it's actually awfully
my friend called me and said what do we do about this right he said we're gonna take this dance um as a club and you know they we
talked a little bit about it on like a whatsapp group or whatever and the club stood up changed the cover photos and
said like manchester united against races and the players got more racism because shining a light on it yeah
it's like it's almost like it's not a real thing how do i explain this it's it could be some 14 year old kid who who's
leaving these monkey emojis who is actually quite an okay person but they
just have this thing in them where they want a bit of attention right they see you or marcus rashford is not really a
real human right and an idol and so they think just leaving they're not like an inherently bad person but when you get
anonymity and you get and we all have this you know envy in us that comes from somewhere you know the lifeboat analogy
right and so like i i'm what i'm i don't know what i'm basically saying is like i don't think
we're ever going to be able to cure that problem with the only way i've actually seen is
i think you'd kill 99 of it if social networks weren't anonymous and you had to upload your passport because i think
if you connect real world consequences to behavior i fully agree it's why you don't get your dick out in public it's like well well that's not why but it's
like that's the only reason it's why you don't go up to someone and say those things in public because there's real world consequences totally agree i think
i think people should have there should be some sort of like identification process when you set up an account i
totally agree with it because the amount i get the amount sarah gets um is it's a
real bloody shame as well because especially because these people are like supposed to be and i use this in
inverted commas fans they're supposed to care about my life my existence are supposed to you know they followed me
for a reason yeah um and i refuse to believe especially because i'm i like to think i'm a force of positivity i tend i
talk real talk and i share real things but even when i'm talking about mental health or
a bigger issue i do so from a stance of positivity right at least i try to so i refuse to believe that somebody is
that negative or hates me that much but in six mil you've got i know six how many followers you got uh uh across
everything kind of don't think i've got two on youtube two on insta
just over two on twitter i don't i don't know about facebook yeah six seven eight whatever but then you're reaching more
people you know the people that follow you aren't the ones that you're reached yeah of course if you took that many people and thought
probabilistically how many of them would just not be like okay people but have the capability of
sending out awful messages yeah there's gonna be [ __ ] thousands yeah you also guarantee that
when i do like for example when i announced that sarah and i were pregnant um i went on to twitter and i was i was
trending and like i haven't tried it for years i was like oh this is fun i haven't tried it for so long so i was going through it and
99 it was really positive but there was a lot of it that was just like um you know a little bit of hate and i had
a really good time responding to some of it not like i wasn't saying anything like for example someone was like jim
chapman still exists and he's not with tanya and he's having a baby who knew um and i just retweeted and responded god i
know right what's happening for the books i am i'm still alive who are you um so nothing like i didn't respond to
real negativity just people going wow that's like that's a funny old story oh it's not tanya um
and like i really enjoyed like i i actually found that good fun because
by drawing attention to it these people were then like oh my god i love you you're the best because obviously i've
let them know that i've seen it and that i'm not tolerating [ __ ] but also i don't care enough
that i'm going to write something really negative back i'm just like yeah i see that i acknowledge it i am here i'm also a human and it's yeah it's a really
interesting sort of phenomenon that people can write what they want without any sort of consequences but when you give
them consequences they'll suddenly be like oh wow you've noticed me i'm a really funny funny thing that
happened this week this weekend it's yesterday um there's a story that came out in the press
something that i had done this kid had like dm to me if he'd made me a wikipedia page and was like i thought you deserve one so i made one and i
offered him a job in 10 minutes i said what great show of initiative you've shown your writing skills like come work with us it was in the papers there's
this like facebook page where one of the articles in the papers was posted there's 60 comments 59 of them are like
amazing right and then there's this one comment which is like really [ __ ] it's like steve bartlett
is like an evil guy he they said that i made a pr story out of the manchester bombings because we
raised a huge amount we let our team have the day off right and we and we raised this huge amount of money for the
families of the victims right and so he wrote all this awful stuff about me and
i screenshotted it and i i messaged the guy and i said could you like i sent him the screenshot i mean could you explain this i've never seen someone
just completely changed and i said and one of the things i said to him was would you would you be okay with me sharing this on my channels guess what
he said well obviously not absolutely not right and i was never going to share my channels right but why wouldn't why
can't i share in public well because he's written on a public forum right he's written on a public forum why can't i share on my channel why wouldn't you
Cheating allegations
like three million people seeing that right and and he was like he literally i went do i have your permission to share this
and he went absolutely not yeah i was like do i have your permission to respond to it publicly absolutely not
and it was just fascinating to see the behavior because he obviously ate was in some facebook group didn't expect me to see it you know and this is i'm trying
to over the last couple of i guess months trying to understand how to deal
with this social media centric often group think driven because i'm sure all the
cheating stuff was one oh yeah yeah there's a group of people and then they're like yeah yeah i would say
tanya's never said anything um she's never come out and called me a cheater she hasn't done the opposite um like i
have if i'm being totally frank about it like you know i've sort of said there was nothing
you've addressed it i've addressed it i'm trying to i moved on first sure as far as the
world is concerned you know what i mean like it's really hard to say this without
sort of making accusations whatever as far as the world knows
i moved on first it's not necessarily i should stop there but
it's it's tricky to be accused of something when
they've only got limited information to to use right so
because people see that i moved on first they think that perhaps i cheated so for me saying
i didn't cheat and for sarah's saying i didn't cheat with jim um it doesn't necessarily prove anything
right because of course we're going to say that because we want to deny our infidelity right
um and it's tricky to keep going back to it and keep saying the same thing especially when it's so
unfounded um but there's a point where you just have to let it go right you can't you can't change everyone's opinion about it
like i said like there's there's like a a load of people watching you they all
have opinions on you good or bad and the perks of this job is that we get paid well for it and that we get to live a
bloody adventure like it's so cool i never expected this in my life i never expected to be able to do the stuff i
get to do and live the life i get to live it was never planned out for me i never had like
um the tools in place for it i found myself here and i've grabbed on with both hands
and i've worked really hard to to maintain it so that's the perk of being a position i'm in unfortunately it comes
with a few drawbacks which is that people make opinions on you and you just have to not care so much not
easy though it's not easy at all especially when they message your fiance it's not easy at all especially also when it's so
untrue um and yeah and and also there's no way to rectify it
there's no way there's no way i can rectify it or sarah basically yeah um that's difficult
that's really difficult it is very difficult yeah yeah and and you must have this you see these falsehoods in the comment sections you
must instinctively be like oh that's not true and that's harmful to my relationship to whatever i need to fix that
i still really value tanya we're still we're still mates so i'm not
you know i'm never gonna i'm not gonna uh make a big thing i i try to just when it
comes up in conversation i'll just say yeah it's this we grew apart right because i respect her and i value her and
i i don't want to keep bringing it up all the time because
also it doesn't define either of us people break up all the time unfortunately they don't always break up in public but it doesn't define us we
My current relationship
both still have our careers we both still have our lives we both still have our people um and that's very important it's just a
shame that it comes up so frequently and it's so um untrue
i had a sex therapist a relationship therapist on this podcast um two weeks
ago and she had a really lovely sentence which i haven't been able to forget and she said just because a relationship ends doesn't mean it wasn't successful i
still look at us as very successful yeah like i said we ticked all our boxes the next thing for us was what i'm now doing with sarah and
um i i see now that tanya would not have been the person to do that with you know and sarah a hundred percent is and
there are things that i have with her that i've never experienced before um and i'm very lucky and like i said earlier i
feel like when when tanya and i started going sep directions separate ways um it was earlier than i
i think either of us kind of gave credence to um and so if we had i've done if you know if i have done the things i'm now
doing with sarah with tony i don't think i'll it would have been for the best you know
whereas now i'm i know that sarah is my person i've learned a lot i
know what i'm worth i know what i can expect from a partner um and
it's it's really i've never experienced it this way it's really lovely it's really fruitful it's really rewarding it's
really dynamic and it's really reciprocal did you have a list of um attributes i was
talking to a couple of friends the other day um mixed gender group and one of them posed the question like what's on your
list for an ideal partner um so you're with the partner so i'm saying i guess my question to you is what does
what did you look for but and also i want you to answer the second question which is what does a partner need to offer jim in
order to be a good partner uh okay what partners offer me i think
um i i need to like i said earlier if i if
i love someone i trust them 100 right i expect the same in return i can't deal
with jealousy i can't deal with someone checking up on me if i'm out or
if i'm doing something i'm not gonna humor it because it's not me and i don't want anyone to consider that it
might be me and if if as my partner you're thinking oh he's out somewhere he's with someone doing something he
shouldn't be then i haven't got time for it so i expect that um but also i i i expect to be
appreciated and reciprocated um you know i know it's complicated it doesn't happen all the time there are
times when you're in a bad mood or whatever but as i was walking here sarah texts me saying i know i haven't said it at
lowe's because um i'm just feeling really sick you know with the pregnancy and everything but she went my my baby is hit jackpot with a dad you
know and like i just want you to know i really do appreciate you um and i haven't said it much lately and
that's that's that's all i need why does that matter to you so much because i i want to know that i'm valued um and
that's that's that's the thing for me i don't care why um
because if i'm going to give someone my all and like i said earlier if i'm in love with someone they get everything
they get all my stuff if it's stuff i care about i get all my time they get everything right um and i need to know that there's value
in me giving myself does that link to your childhood at all perhaps yeah perhaps i i just fully believe and maybe
this is why i write love well i fully believe that if i'm with someone
they've got it all right i don't believe in i don't mean that in like a really um codependent way because that's like the
worst you know if you're kind of encouraging each other into something i feel like you both need to live your life independently but make a good team
and like you when you team up together i think good stuff happens basically um
and yeah perhaps but but i i think that i
for me if i'm not if i don't feel like i'm valued enough i
don't feel like my um it's not i say sacrifice not sacrifice
but if i don't feel like what i'm giving isn't appreciated or but my worst nightmare is being
tolerated like i'm with someone and they just go yeah all right and they just they just tolerate me i'm out the door
um because i'm too good for that like i i have value and everybody does i'm not
saying me is an individual each and every single person has their value right they deserve to be
appreciated for that value and if they're with someone who doesn't appreciate it takes it for granted
um whatever then you're not with the right person you know i think the you you need
Love languages
someone who respects you and appreciates you um and who sees your worth uh perhaps more than
you do i mean i i don't see myself that clearly sometimes um and sarah will often often say like you know
the text she sent me saying you know my my babies jackpot with the dad that they've got coming up is
you know this that means a lot to me i have no chance to reply yet but i will after this and that is it's a really big
thing it doesn't it's so such little effort for her to send but it means a [ __ ] lot to me have you heard about love
languages yeah have you ever done the old love language test no have you ever do you know what i tend not to
no i don't believe in that stuff i just tend not to um i think ignorance is bliss sometimes
because if i'm super aware of it then i don't know if it's like i said earlier with the therapy right when
you're aware of your your thing your stuff yeah and then you do it more like ah and
until you learn the tools of how to overcome it or how to at least challenge it it's frustrating and i feel like if i
learned that i was this way inclined every time i did i'd go [ __ ] call me apparently i'm apparently i'm like the
archetypal capricorn you want to do your love languages now go on shall we yeah i did mine and it's actually really
you know i'm not that guy i'm not like a i'm not i don't look at this the sun and decide what's going to happen tomorrow
because of where the planets are i'm not that guy but the the love language thing is based
on asking you a bunch of questions about like what you value more so ultimately comes up with an answer and it says jim
chapman values when someone does this and yours would be words of affirmation or recognition mine is slightly
different so we'll talk about my motherboard interesting um we're going to do your love language now this is going to drive me mental for the rest of my life
like i said like apparently i am the most archetypal capricorn and every time i do anything that's sort of capricorny now and i never really believed in this
sort of stuff every time i do anything now i'm like damn it my bloody stars told me or something okay here we go
okay so me and jim have just completed the full love language survey which took um about 10 minutes and his results why
am i nervous i know everything about you and i'm looking at all of your results here um
so it says and this is not surprising this is what i expected from our conversation up until that point right
jim's primary love language is words of affirmation right actions don't always speak louder than words if this is your
love language unsolicited compliments mean the world to you hearing the words i love you are important hearing the
reasons behind that loves um sends your spirits skyward insults
can leave you shattered and are not easily forgotten kind encouraging and supportive words are
truly life-giving to you and you rank as a 33 on words of affirmation which is high
you rank as three percent on receiving gifts 17 on acts of service and then physical
and physical touch and quality time you rank the same okay i would say gifts i i
think it might be more to somebody else i think that my job comes with a lot of stuff yeah so i don't really care about it so much um i'd agree with that um
like i said earlier we get lots of hate and it bounces off but if the hate comes from someone i love yeah that's an issue yeah
if it's an insult as well insult yeah yeah that's that's a problem if it comes from someone um that i care about um yeah you know
i'm really lucky because sarah does all of that she actually does most of everything um which is great um
Whats next
and genuinely i'm very fortunate to have her um she is
everything that i want and i use the word want and not need because i think that's the
difference between codependency and like a healthy relationship i don't need
her i would be fine my life would continue but she brings a little uh a little spice a little
something extra you know what i mean and and it's much more enjoyable to have her by my side for everything for sure so
what's next for you then you're working on a lot we were talking about this software yeah i am um i'm always working
on on stuff like i said just i just love creating um so i have just started a
production company with my friend we started in january or february last year so just as the world might explode but
actually you know what has given us the chance to really knuckle down um and we've got some really good headway so far um we're having lots of
big conversations with important people and people seem to like our stuff um i we do scripted and unscripted so i head
up the unscripted sorry i have the scripted stuff so my writing so far i've got a couple of films on the
go writing a book um i'm also working on a like a a show
like a series and we've got a bunch of unscripted stuff that i also chip in on um but that's very much james my my
business partner is very much his sort of um wheelhouse um and the difference in time
it will take so he's constantly having meetings and constantly like churning stuff out whereas my stuff takes a lot longer so i often feel like i'm not
pulling my weight but then i'll send him like i just sent him a document yesterday which is 20 000 words long which took me two weeks to write and
it's like a an entire breakdown beat by beat of how i see this new thing working and he's like oh so you're doing stuff
so it's it's weird but i think um we both we both are really invested we're both really good
at what we do we're successful in our own rights um but i think there's something special
about working on something that's just for passion we don't need this to work we just really really wanted to and
that's really exciting you know if they say oh you know jim chapman was a success 10 years from now what would they mean
um what would that mean to you i mean for me if i were saying about myself it would it would mean that i
in terms of work it would mean that i was respected in my field um it would mean people who
my contemporaries appreciated my input but more than that if it were just in general success it would mean i got out
okay you know what i mean i came out the other side of this and um i
have i'm content for me contentment is sort of like a a goal you know and i don't think it is
for many people um i don't want to stress about stuff unnecessarily i don't
want to constantly strive for more um i don't feel like it's necessary i want to
be really happy with what i've got and i have that very in spades with my people
my family my friends um sarah my baby on the way i've got more contentment than i
can throw a stick at i don't have it in terms of my career because i'm constantly worried
about where it goes so have you ever i hope i do i hope i i think what it would take is um
a project that is very successful so with my writing and then people come to me rather than me constantly knocking on
flies you know what i mean it'd be really nice to be in a position where go hey you wrote that thing and it did really well i want to give you
opportunities now rather than me chasing it and i have that in terms of social media like i'm very lucky to be
in the position i'm in which is sort of i've been doing it for a very long time and have a good name for myself so people often come to me
i don't have it in my the other part of my job and i'd love that but i'm still new in it i've only been doing it you know like i say i've been right in the
first screenplay for three and a half years but that only got to a point where it was worth talking about
a year ago you know so it's still very much in its infancy so i just hope that i get to a point where people
um like my stuff and go you know what you're really good at this let's let's work with you on this project if it
doesn't happen it won't be through lack of trying um and i won't hold it against myself i'm not gonna be i won't feel
like a failure um because i don't i don't really believe in that i i believe you can be a
failure if you if you quit and you never try you never try it's all right but
if you don't make it and you and you've given it a good bloody shot then you know you've done better than most
yeah i said that tweet the other day and i was in the gym and i thought about it i thought you know the concept of worry and fear
are so illogical because you know no human has ever done more than their best right and even on my [ __ ] days where i'm
like really unproductive and whatever bad mood or whatever that was actually still my best that day yeah by
definition so this you know um but it's fascinating and i um i
looking over your story in your career one of the the key things i saw was this temptation from you to like resist your
labels and to and to not be sucked into the world telling you who you are yeah i i i think
it doesn't really you know what it's one of those things where you meet people and the second question they ask you is what you do for
a living the first being hi what's your name right and there's more to all of us than what we
do like i said earlier my job isn't what what my job is what i do not who i am right so i don't like being
jim chapman youtuber you know um stifling it's like a box it's totally a box and in the same way
the same way that you know an accountant might not want to just be called an accountant you know there's more to him
he's got his own life and whatever um i just feel like it's it's pigeonholing and it's tricky in
this industry because people don't like you being good at more than one thing if you're written about
um in the press or whatever it's probably for you entrepreneur i'd imagine right for me it's youtuber still
um and actually like i say that's a small part of i upload one video a week and i've only been doing that since we found out we were pregnant because now
it's exciting to talk about stuff yeah other than that i haven't uploaded for six months you know what i mean so there's more to us we're allowed to
explore new avenues do new things but i think for the sake of um society understanding
who which box you fit in right because in articles they have to use a word right so that the reader knows
and they can't say jim chapman and then list your skills yeah yeah so they're like box which box
right and i understand it because it's it's how we even down to like you know the
a simple individual level we all stereotype yeah because yeah i mean that's just that's just
psychologically it makes sense because totally and it gives us sort of like categories to work from
if you're walking down the street and you see every single person as an individual it's sensory overload so you see someone in say a certain clothing
and a suit you know okay you're a banker he might not be you might just like wearing a suit but in your head that's what he's done because it's easier just
to sort of carry on with your day compartmentalise imagine if we didn't imagine if you know lion running towards
us we thought i wonder if this is a good lion generally i said this to sarah just the other day we were having a conversation quite a
heated conversation about something and um she's i call her worst case
scenario sarah quite a lot because she often will catastrophize right and i said you're the kind of person that sees
someone running and you assume they're running from i don't know a crime or
a gun or something i'm the kind of person that assumes they're running towards a bus because i i
i see the world as neutral right i don't think the world has an opinion on me um
but i see my people as positive and i know there's lots of negativity out there but um i don't see the world as that kind of
place in general whereas some people i think are geared up to think the worst it's like um
you know the whole fight and flight thing um some people are geared i think i think i'd probably die right because i'd
be geared up to see a stick as a stick whereas actually it makes much more sense to see a stick as a snake because
on the one time it is a snake you don't die yeah whereas like oh it's a stick and i get bitten and die um so i think
uh if it were 200 000 years ago i would be no good but actually in today's society i do all right because i just
like to see i think inherently i just see the world as a
neutral or or at best positive um i don't want to think that everybody running is running from an explosion you
know it's just not the way i choose to see the world i think that's a much healthier way to see the world like to think so i think
it'll take you much further but anyway listen thank you so much for your time today i think you're an
incredibly inspiring guy not least because of what you've achieved but because of your willingness to be honest thank you i
think you know a lot of the stuff you've shared about your childhood and being open as a man about you you know the impact therapy has had on you i think is
such an admirable thing and even your call to you know to men to go to therapy i think is something that i can
completely get behind right um there's been so much stigma around it for you know
you know a bunch of historical reasons right as a society we're overcoming but i but i really applaud you for that and i'm
super excited to see what you do next you know you're clearly someone that's a brilliantly talented
be it's incredibly hard working and um yeah and that that mixed with
your your um so that your huge amount of self-awareness i think is going to make for some unbelievable i i hope so i also
think that it could go totally the opposite way but either way you know i i
will i know whatever i do i'll do to the best of my ability you know so if it doesn't go the way i
intend i'll find the next thing you know i'm smart enough to do that thank you

Transcription:

intro
elizabeth day is a world-renowned podcast host she's a best-selling author she's a successful journalist
i felt like a failure but i probably wasn't it was what i've been told to feel i've had countless failed relationships
and then it sucks like heartbreak there is no pain like heartbreak i now realize that i learned something very instructive from each one of those
relationships and from the fact that they ended it taught me something that i needed to know
about myself infertility and miscarriage is not a mishap like for people who experience it it's a
tragedy over which they have no control and the idea that i was exploiting it to make a full-time career out of it
was so insulting because i know how [ __ ] painful and traumatic it is to go through
[Music]
being vulnerable something i think we all find it incredibly hard to do and after hearing my guest's story today
i had tears in my eyes maybe three or four times and that's because she is willing
to be vulnerable and honest and open about her truth her trauma and the things she's learned from her
most testing times elizabeth day is a world-renowned podcast host she is a best-selling author
she's a successful journalist honestly she's quite frankly one of the most wonderful smart lovely people i've ever
had the privilege of doing this podcast with in fact today one of the issues i had with this podcast was we agree on
so much that it's hard to play devil's advocate with her it was hard to challenge her
views because so many of them represented mine it felt like she was reading out of my book
i think that's powerful because she helped me build on my ideas and some of these ideas are controversial for some people may be too
controversial it is remarkable how much societal expectations can [ __ ] your chance of happiness and i
genuinely believe that if we had more people in the world like elizabeth who were willing to say what she says
today then maybe that wouldn't be the case without further ado i'm stephen bartlett
How have social expectations made you feel like a failure?
and this is the divers ceo i hope nobody's listening but if you are then please keep this yourself
[Music] one of the things that i wrote recently
which um after doing a little bit of reading about your story and your journey really really resonated with me
um was this idea that the society's expectations of how your life
is supposed to be going will [ __ ] you up and when i think about you know you've written this amazing book about called
philosophy about failure i was thinking what is objectively like what is failure and
um my conclusion was that failure is like a byproduct of social expectations
um that's and as is success so could you talk to me a little bit about
how social expectations have made you feel like a failure
of course yeah i realized i had to define failure after i had launched a
podcast called how to fail and after i had written a book called how to fail and then i kept getting asked this very
reasonable question and i realized i'd never come up with a satisfying definition for me so the definition i came up with
in philosophy is that failure is what happens when life doesn't go according to plan which totally taps into what you've just
asked me about because then you need to start to think well where does the plan come from is it
genuinely my plan is it genuinely will make me happy or is it what i've been told
i should expect my life to be because when i looked at some of my metrics for how my life
should be and i put that in quotation marks it kind of came from like 1980s rom-coms
and and patriarchal society and conditioning and the idea that i've been raised in the 80s to be a nice
pleasant pliable girl whereas boys were enabled to be mischievous and that was seen as kind of cute and charming
and that led to me being an investor at people pleaser which i know is something that a lot of people
have in this kind of industry and it also led to me imagining that i wanted to be married
and have children and that's what i tried to do and in my 30s i did get married to the wrong
person i ended up getting divorced and i tried but failed to have babies and went through various fertility treatments
that were emotionally devastating in various ways and it got to a point when i was 36
divorced didn't have children where i really did feel like a failure and the reason i felt like a failure is
because that's what society had conditioned me to believe of myself because actually
after i'd got over the pain and the grief caused by that seminal relationship ending and by all
of the ivf and coming to terms with my first miscarriage and all of that i actually felt strong for having
withstood it and i actually felt kind of liberated too because i had no plan for the future and having
no plan for the future can be terrifying and it can also be this enormous opportunity
to change your life and to redefine it according to who you really are once you've stripped back
that pretense so that's one way in which i felt like a failure but i probably
wasn't it was what i've been told to feel so i wanna i wanna like pick around this
a little bit because i can resonate with this tremendously in fact that's why my book is has the name it does is because
i was conditioned as a black kid who was broke to believe that the thing that would make me a success was becoming this
happy sexy millionaire with a range rover and i mean so i wrote the front page of my diary that you know that's a kid from africa
who in africa had nothing but was you know my family were happy bring that kid into a context or a con
yeah a context where the context is telling me that unless you're this you should feel like [ __ ] um that's why
as a kid i was like well i need to happy sexy minute to be fair if i'd wrote something else it would have been white straight hair right i was relaxing my
hair chemically from the age of about 12 till about 16 so my hair was straight
but i want to i want to go back to this this point about society telling you um what you should want did you ever
figure out what you actually wanted such a good question also thank you for sharing what you just did
yeah because i know that yeah you believe like i do that vulnerability is the source of connection true connection
and that was really beautiful um i think i have figured out who i am now
but i sit here as a 42 year old having only just figured that out and the reason i figured it out is
because of all of those things that went wrong those relationships that ended that imploded the jobs that weren't right for
me like that was what prompted me to do the soul searching and i'm a big believer in things
happening for a reason the universe unfolding as is intended even if you can't
make something meaningful as and when it's happening because it's traumatic and it's devastating
i tend to believe that there will be some meaning in there in the fullness of time there'll be something that i needed
to learn i wish sometimes i'd learnt the lessons more quickly because i believe i kept being sent the same lessons until i
really really learned the the thing that i needed to learn but i do think now that i'm aware of who
i am because i've redefined my notion of success so in the past
my success was not necessarily being a happy sexy millionaire although i wouldn't say no in the past
i had a very different contextual upbringing from yours
and i'm immensely privileged in many ways and one of the ways in which i am privileged is that there was a lot of
kind of creativity and um cultural discussion in my home like
i was surrounded by books i was never taught to feel that that was odd that i read all the time or that i wanted to be
an author even though there was no one in my family who did that so i had those kind of conversations and
that's and that's an enormously wealthy way to be brought up and i even though we didn't have that much money
that was very wealthy and so for me then success was about doing well at school
it was doing well academically and i realized that when i did well on an exam i got approval
and that for me became a substitute for self-worth so for a long time i was on this
feedback loop where i was like if only i could just do better and do better at more things
eventually i'll feel i'm worthwhile and i was on a hiding to nothing because
actually i was outsourcing my sense of self to everyone else's opinions of me
and to kind of external validation and i've now realized and it's taken me a
long time to realize this that my only validation that means anything can come from within and from my cornerstone
relationships so like the four or five people i love most in the world whose opinion actually means something to me that's what it is
now having worked that out how can i bring my authentic self into every area
of my life and that's why the podcast has felt and the books about failure
have genuinely been such a gift to me because they've enabled me to connect with a really big audience
whilst being my true self whilst taking the risk to be vulnerable and that for me is
success being my authentic self in integrated selves so
like professionally personally and when i'm asleep like i'm or in my friendship group or
when i'm stroking my cat it's always the same me i talk in so i hate [ __ ] plugging my
own book but it's the reason i'm doing it is because we very much think the same and one of the chapters in my book is
about making your um your context smaller and healthier in an age of social media where i can compare myself
to a billion people who are all filtering themselves and fake i implore like people to make their
Criticism
context which is what you've described there's like four or five people much smaller like unfollowing me all the
toxic people in your like comparison bubble or whatever and make it tight and healthy that's so hard these days
if you're on social media platforms and following like the kardashians or whatever
how does how does one do that and also stay on social media like well i need to ask you this so i'm going
to ask you this after i've tried to answer it because i'm i'm you have to deal with it on such a massive scale and i'm just like
a micro tiny thing in comparison no i don't think that's fine but the way to answer that truly
honestly i'm still a huge work in progress in that respect because
i have the capacity to be undone by criticism like i fi i take it really really personally tell
me how personally give me an example so personally give me an example okay um two recent examples one is that
i went um a few weeks ago i went on a lockdown walk with a friend of mine who i haven't seen
for over a year socially distanced it was my daily exercise i was allowed to do with one person from another
household and i posted a picture of us socially distanced in a park on instagram being like you know this
was really good for my mental health such an enjoyable walk and someone commented saying i can't this is
so irresponsible of you to post this because hospitals are overwhelmed with covered patients
and you're encouraging people just like go out and about and i was like hang on a second
i was like that's where i go with it oh my god i've done something wrong i've done something wrong and these poor
nhs doctors who are working and i've just kicked them in the face metaphorically and i was and i had this process of like
i've done something wrong i'm a terrible person i feel really bad about it what can i do should i reply i go
through that that's the first place i go and then i tell myself no leave it 24 hours leave it 24 hours before you say
anything and then i just feel i have this like harness that settles
around me for a day of feeling unsettled and a bit worried and anxious
and are other people thinking that is there a whole group of people out there that they're like meeting up behind
closed doors to discuss how awful i am launching your council campaign like oh yes and it's ridiculous
yeah it's awful and i saw other people had liked that comment i was like oh my god they hate me too
i'm and basically i just have to sit with it for a bit and it helps me to talk about it even though
i sound completely doolally but i do i'm lucky enough to have an incredible resource
in my husband who is just not on social media at all and so it's a very kind of sane mind to bring to it
and my best friend who's a psychotherapist and i spoke to her about it and she was like okay where i would
go with it is what pain is that person in that they've lashed out in this way
and that's very helpful because it encourages you to feel compassion instead of got at and anger i mean
that's one tiny example another example was philosophy got reviewed in a couple of
places and i you know i i'm really proud of that book but it's a physically small book i mean
it's got a lot of good content in it don't get me wrong and as you know it's hard to make big ideas accessible
but i did not expect it to get reviewed in the national press but it did and it got reviewed by people
who wanted to find fault with it who did not like the fact that
i seemed to be exploiting failure for my own success which is
absolutely not the case like i want to share the stuff that i've learned that's all i wanted
exploiting failure for your own success [ __ ] house anyway so that was that was just
like i went down a rabbit hole of looking at the reviewers instagram and all of that sort of stuff which is terrible anyway i know i shouldn't go
down these rabbit holes of self-loathing and most the time i'm able not to but just occasionally if i'm feeling low
or particularly sensitive that day it will affect me
and my tactic for protecting myself is absolutely of you said as you said to
unfollow and mute to curate my feed to keep my phone on airplane mode in the
morning so my phone is not the first thing i look at when i'm writing i put my phone on airplane mode as well and i find it a
real relief and also to try and practice the art of generosity and to believe in abundance
because i think a lot of my mindset around competitiveness or envy
is because i believe in a scarcity of resources and i believe success is scarce
and i believe money is scarce and love is scarce and we all have to compete for it yeah like is there some game
exactly and actually just flipping the switch and being like no the world is abundant
and everyone's success can mirror your own like and if you give and if you come at
life from a generous place then hopefully that will feed back to you so those are my
tactics interesting how do you deal with it um so i think it's important to be
honest as well i'm i've read a lot about this this topic i've spoken to psychologists i've sat
here with guests and you know ask them about this and this is probably maybe a liberating but also a terrifying
answer eve and i have exactly what you've described it feels so much better do you know what's funny the reason when
i was laughing you when you said to me you went oh i know it sounds cucky i was laughing because it's you telling me my life oh you know what i
mean like i will i will get one comment on one thing and i'll be like
let's look at this jonathan davis and find out all about you know what i mean
his family are it'll be just it's just like flipping comment surrounded by a thousand positive ones but i'm like i'm gonna find this
guy's birth records and we're gonna find out you know what i mean like private investigator and the way you describe that feeling of
like it bothers you you're like shall i respond sometimes i respond i'm like then i delete it super fast because i'm like you know you rise above and then i've
also felt in the bigger moments where something more controversial has happened i've also felt that like thing
around me for about like 48 hours yeah that feeling of like anxiousness yeah like you described like wait does
is this does everyone you think all your all my friends that are quiet they all think that i've i'm finished you know what i mean
they're not saying anything am i adopted yeah he's like yeah so here's my he's my productive conclusion though is
one of the things we're not taught to do is to use social media in a conscious way so we like sign up and then we just go
with the algorithm and the algorithm will be like be pretty or and then they'll clap for you good good and it'll be like you do
this and we cut and then it will tell us to follow lots of people who we compare ourselves to and create this really unhealthy context
in which we our self-worth is clearly our you know achievements success and beauty is clearly less than all of these people
and because it's so unconscious we become a victim to the algorithms and to this this like awful toxic experiment so
the the answer for me is just to use social media in a much more conscious way you've described it there which is like unfollow people that are bad for
you turn off your notifications um when i on twitter when i do a tweet
and it goes like semi-viral i know that for the next 48 hours i'm gonna get all kinds of twitter eggs and
all so i just mute it straight away i did it last night i did a tweet start getting all these responses hit me and it's disappeared yeah i don't
see any response and this is the like conscious you know effort that i have to make to keep my
context healthy and to protect myself yeah do you know i had a really interesting experience
on twitter recently and it's it's it's fascinating because i think i care less about twitter
because i don't feel as myself on twitter i suppose because i'm super conscious of how you can send out an ill
tweet one day and like lose everything the next instagram rightly or wrongly just feels safer it
feels more like a warm bath whereas twitter's like a kind of shower of hail a lot of the time and
but on recently on twitter someone messaged me saying oh that thing that
was in the times magazine about you was so unfair and i hadn't read it and i then went and looked at the article
and it was an interview with another author and the journalist had said had compared
this person to me and a couple of other people and said you know now there's this trend
i'm paraphrasing for people to use their mishaps and exploit them and turn them into
full-time careers with non-stop webinars and instagram lives and she said like like elizabeth day with infertility and i was
like that sits so badly with me because infertility and miscarriage is not a
mishap like for people who experience it it's a tragedy over which they have no control and the idea that i was
exploiting it to make a full-time career out of it with non-stop webinars and i've done a webinar in my life by the way
was so insulting to me because i had a career apart from that and before that and it's
that i choose to use my platform to talk about something that a great deal of people feel a great deal of misplaced shame over and
that was one example in fact the only one i can think of where i did respond because it was so deeply
deeply personal to who i was and i felt an attack on my integrity and a complete
misreading of what i was trying to do and i tweeted something that was really calm
and that was like you know i refute this for these reasons and it was an excellent lesson in how
sometimes it is important to stand up for something i had an outpouring of incredible
support from other people who i'd never met which meant a great deal to me
the journalists in question had the grace afterwards to apologize but they changed the wording and the
online piece and if i hadn't sent out that tweet there would be no record of it having happened
and these things are really important to call out sometimes so i think when it's an attack on the integrity of who you are and what
you do then sometimes it is worth drawing breath and saying something calmly and
just stating your position and in that case as well you're the courage shall i say to speak about to
have that vulnerability creates a culture where more people will speak out and it's that and that is so
powerful and helpful for so many other people who are going through that and can't and can't find um a voice that they can
relate to and you could you know create that sense of um understanding by by hearing your story same with the mental health
People pleasing
um conversation over the last 10 years if people weren't speaking about it the place would be and is quite terrifying to think of and you wouldn't
say those people have exploited it right so it's just i mean it's such a nonsense thing for someone to write that i
actually don't want to spend too much time talking about it quick one starting from the minute the lockdown is lifted we're going to start
bringing in some of our subscribers to watch how this podcast is produced behind the scenes means you get to meet the guests meet
myself and see how we put all of this together if you want that to be you all you've got to do hit the subscribe button
so let's talk about people pleasing yeah you said you're a people pleaser yes well i'm a reformed people please i
guess you used to now don't give a [ __ ] what you thought okay i really do um yes
so i like many women of my age was raised in the 80s and early 90s in a
culture where it was still very very gender stereotyped i mean we've come so far in the last decade
i think in understanding that but as a result i always thought that my
worth as a person was predicated on keeping other people happy so i
got into a series of long-term monogamous relationships from the age of 19 to 36 like that
the biggest gap between those relationships was like a month no because i was like who am i unless
i'm making someone else happy unless i'm being someone else's perfect partner
unless i'm i'm trying to second-guess what they might want for dinner and when they ask me like where do i want to
go for lunch i don't know where would you like to go like that was my life it was ridiculous and it manifested itself at work as well
i was always the person who said yes to overtime yes to the commissions that no one else wanted
because i thought eventually i'd be rewarded and i got a staff feature writer job at
the observer a sunday newspaper in the uk when i was 29 and i was the youngest feature writer there and so i felt
really intimidated and so part of my constantly saying yes and showing willing was to try and fit
in and be accepted and actually you just become an easily exploitable asset
and i realized after eight years of that job that i was never going to be moved anywhere i did ask i asked for
like different roles different challenges and the answer was always no and it was because
i was i was doing too much where i was like why would they want to move me i was providing them with an excellent
service where i was i was making myself too indispensable and i was absolutely
refusing to complain that's what's going to say you ain't going to complain never and never ask for a pay rise stephen i
mean which is actually makes me feel slightly sick now looking back because i am a feminist and i do believe women
should ask for the pay that they deserve but i didn't i was too intimidated and um ultimately i think people
pleasing can start from a desire to be nice and to think of
others and that's a really beautiful thing but taken to its extreme which is where i would put myself
it actually becomes very selfish because you never take the time to know who you
truly are and that leads you into situations and relationships
that you shouldn't be in because you're not fully giving yourself you're giving a version of perfection to
someone that is never fully real yeah so i never felt able to show who i really was and and that's the
state of mind i got married in and little wonder that it ended is that why you think it ended
part of the um part of the reason like i definitely found it very difficult to
find my voice for a long time what does that mean in a relationship
um it meant that i was extremely conflict avoidant so instead of saying how i felt about
something i would turn it inwards and be silent and then get mildly depressed
so that's a difficult person to be with they don't seem difficult at all because
they're like look i've cooked you dinner and i've got all your favorite things and i've come up with this perfectly thoughtful
gift for christmas but that's all like distraction it's all like just don't look at the
mess i actually am inside um so i had to do a lot of work on myself it was part of
the reason it wasn't the whole reason um there was a whole pile of other stuff that i can't go into because it involves
someone else but that was definitely like i do think that when a relationship ends you have to look at yourself and be
really honest about how you played into that dysfunctional dynamic to avoid making the same mistakes
i'm not in a relationship i've actually really struggled with relationships and i was thinking about this last night when i was working out i was
thinking much the reason why i've struggled is because i think i'm probably too selfish right
i think that i'm uncompromising as well and it's something that i've tried over the last couple of years to really look
Business communication vs relationship communication
like defeat in myself which is in in work i'm required to be a certain type of person to succeed which is like quite
certain about the right approach focused hard working um a lot of things in the professional
environment aren't actually democratic they're like the big decisions they they lack you the buck stops with you
um in relationships um communication and compromise and being more democratic
in things and really trying to meet um someone else's needs are the i guess the attributes for
success yeah communication let's talk talk about that how important is it to um from your experiences in
relationships that have you know gone done well by your definition and ended by your definition
um to communicate how you're feeling and what your needs are it's so important it's everything i'm
very interested in what you just said there so i'm going to come back to that question you asked me
the the fact that you have that you believe you might need different modes of communication in business and in personal
relationships slightly different and this is like super controversial because because people will
think that so communication is incredibly important in my professional life yeah it's actually the things things
like so in my in my professional life if i don't want to do something or if i think it's a bad use of my time i say
no don't don't do it cancel it whereas in my romantic life you can't do that if
i don't want to do so i don't want to go down and walk walk in the park but i've got to be like fine yeah you know what i mean and and i
can be i'm supe in my in my professional life i'm a radical about how i spend my time because i because you get so many things
calling for your time you have to be like nope nope nope cancel it move it nope no no in my professional life it's like what
do you want to do do you want to cook for two hours um fine you know and and i got my brains like wasted is that an efficient use of
time you know so interesting because in your professional life as well you're in a position where you need to know the answers someone will come to you for a
decision you need to know you need to be like a benign dictator and just be like right this that and and therefore do you think that in
your personal life you don't think it's okay to say i don't know i don't know if i want to
okay it's like a compromise of like not doing things i don't want to do so don't do things you don't want to do this is so interesting so my my now
partner husband is amazing and he's a ceo and he
said to me in the early days of my relationship i never do anything i don't want to do and i was like selfish i was like i'm a people pleaser
so this is never going to work um but he's the knock-on effect of that
basically what he was saying is i'm honest and i will tell you if i don't want to do something so if i say
yes that yes is really meaningful and that's such a weight like it's such a weight
off my mind because i'm not having to second guess whether he really means it when he says he'll come for lunch with
my family or whatever yeah i know that he's invested in that so actually i'm your husband for a
second okay i go you say to me i'd love to go and walk in the park and i go
nah i want to sit on my laptop and send these emails and then five minutes and ten minutes late you go oh i would love to cook with
you and he goes nope i want to watch youtube videos about spacex okay so i'm your wife and i say
i completely understand that because you're having a really heavy week at work i'd really like to go to the park
because i really want to spend quality time with you and it would make me feel sad if we didn't do that
then what would you say yes yeah there you go and do you think you'd want to say yes of course i would yeah there you go of
course i don't know why i always fail on this thing i just think the amount of time and attention um my
previous partners have um have asked of me i've not been able to deliver and i'm like i will go i'll text
maybe once a day when i'm in my when i'm in like the tornado of the business yeah you'll say like justice is that really yeah and like
it doesn't mean i don't love you it means that i'm in a mild crisis which i can't tell you about because i
haven't got time to like divulge all of my [ __ ] so sorry how you're really young aren't you
how old are you 20 28 now yeah and you're dating your age group i'm assuming
typically a little bit younger like yeah you see that that it's that's very difficult it's so
difficult dating in your 20s anyway full stop but when you're you and you're basically living the life and
you have the wisdom of a 45 year old that's very difficult because the other person hasn't had that
life experience yet to know oh you're so right yes you're right
honestly you're sorry i'll set you up for 85 years
is the be or end all for me and when i met justin who is now my husband
it was a really difficult learning process for me because he had a very different mode of communication but he
because he is a founder and a ceo and he didn't have time to text me and i [ __ ] love text i'm a writer that's
what i don't i hate a phone call i've had to get used to it now in the global pandemic but i would hate a phone call i always
think i've done something wrong whereas justin was always like why would i take time to text you when i can just call you and convey the
necessary information necessary information honestly and he said this thing well and i kept bringing
it up and i was like if he if i don't hear from you for like three days that's really upsetting to me and it's
not gonna work if that continues he's like okay i hear that he's like for me text is a very cheap
form of communication and it's something you do when you don't really care and i do it a lot for work so for me it's much more important to
spend time together anyway we've sorted it out and i think that's about having different
love languages and i made him take the quiz and it was really helpful
he was acts of service oh no way but he was awesome yeah there you go it's what you do oh
that's so but he was also he wasn't interested in words of affirmation at all which is mine
i might just compliment me all the time was he touch yes i thought sorry so am i oh my god you're
literally like the same person yeah that's yeah and i was when he took that i was really surprised it was quite
early days of our relationship and he hadn't given me the impression of needing touch and then once i knew that i was like oh
that's lovely because i like that too are you quality time and there's quality times one of them yes
and words of affirmation yes i'm totally so i was totally words of affirmation when we took
the test but i think that's because i'd come off a a really bad patch of relationships
where i didn't feel safe in those relationships so i was constantly looking for something to paper over the cracks
and for me that papering came in the form of compliments that was like the easiest thing to ask
for and so that's what i thought i needed but now actually in my relationship i feel really safe
so for me it is quality time it's still worth affirmation but quality time is super important and and i now realize
that justin is very good at taking feedback that's because that's the business brain isn't it
yeah yeah you have so i don't need to sugarcoat something i can say listen i need this or i feel this and
sometimes he'll need time i hope he doesn't like me he's so private but sometimes he'll need
times like uh think it through and sort of strategize it and like digest it and i always know it's never
that he's forgotten he'll come back and he'll be like right i agree and this is the action that we're going to take and it's amazing and i love that
i really love that i used to think it was unromantic it's not at all it's the most romantic thing because i'm
being taken really seriously and i'm guessing this is a guess but i do say it to him without
too much like emotion because he sounds like a very pragmatic guy
so the way that i like to receive feedback like that from my ex was just very like without blame or like
um too much emotion and just like here are the facts yeah that's the best way i like to receive you back you know yes completely but do
separate to you getting feedback if your partner is emotional and is crying at a film or is sad about
something so moved to tears or feeling anxious so therefore yes that's fine exactly the same it's just the feed you
know because you know what i mean you do you want it with judgment yeah and you in his business i'm sure he'll deal with people all day
who give him feedback in a very practical pragmatic way and that's the way you could come used to it and
he'll have the same problem as me whereas sometimes in business you'll get feedback in a very
quite unhealthy and a helpfully emotional way yes and now you're trying to deal with us you're not sure which issue you're actually
dealing with right so when you present it without the emotion i understand what i'm aiming at here it's the same as me yeah
i feel like a bit of a scumbag for having uh acts of service as my no that's a really lovely thing but
doesn't it sound cheap it's like i would like you to serve me with you know what i mean yes i was going
through that love language thing and i was thinking why is it that someone getting me
something that they knew would help me doing something that they knew would help me means so much to me because for me that
because because my life is tough and challenging i see it as them showing
I was scared of being lonely
an action which is action speak louder than words how much they cared about helping me yeah and for me that's like i'm like oh god
you know and also probably because you've had to be incredibly self-sufficient yeah yeah you were like
the definition of a self-starter you've had to rely on yourself so much that for someone else to step in
and be like i've got this for you it means a lot it's so meaningful and you're carrying so much so if someone
comes and says oh yeah i carry one of these bags for you it's like oh thank you yeah you know what i mean i totally get it
interesting one of the things you said was that you're you were i guess um scared of being lonely at the end of
your life oh my gosh yes that's my existential fear that and pigeons still
interestingly the global pandemic has been so tough and so much tougher
for so many people than it has been for me in myriad ways one of the unexpected
side benefits is that i've really got comfortable with my fear of loneliness
because overnight my diary was totally empty so i had no social
engagements i couldn't see friends and it made me
realize that i didn't really want to see the majority of people that i was going
to see like i'd said yes to social situations that i didn't really want to go to but i
felt like i should and i didn't want to offend someone by not letting them down that's still the people pleaser in me um
and having the freedom to choose who i wanted invest time in
was hugely beneficial for me because i realized actually that
my core my nucleus of people is very very small and actually if i've got justin
and my best friend i'm good i'm good and beyond that you know my closest
friends like i actively want to see them and but i realized that i was just spending a lot of time
not nurturing those friendships because i knew that i would be able to step back into them and i knew that i'd be
accepted because that's the level of great friendship isn't it like you're just always welcome back and i was spending a lot of time trying
to nurture these other ones that were less meaningful to me that required more of it because they weren't as generous in their
acceptance of me so actually my fear of loneliness has slightly lessened now
it's good news yes isn't it and although you probably can't tell i am actually an introvert but i've
successfully learned how to be extrovert and how to um pretend i'm confident when i don't
Confidence & self-worth
feel it and all of that sort of stuff and i've realized that
i'm also pretty resilient when my world shrinks so i think i'm going to be okay
silver lining yeah on that point of confidence it's something that people ask me about all the time which is
confidence seems to be one of the great barriers of people pursuing themselves as you describe pursuing their dreams pursuing who they
are some people will know who they think they are but they don't have the confidence to take the leap per se are you confident
um yes in certain things so i'm confident that i can write
i'm now confident that i can podcast i can do a good podcast um you're a
great talker i was thinking this as you're speaking i'm thinking i was thinking yeah because i understand why she has a really good podcast oh thank you
very you know you're very like articulate self-aware but you're really good at you know talking yeah it's like a strange thing to say
yeah you know you are well i think i'm good at connecting with people and that's something that i
really cherish because that's where all the good stuff lies for me like i love having a conversation like this on such
a real level with someone and connecting that's heaven to me like this is introversion heaven
it's like i don't want to be a big party like trying to have this conversation with you like that would
be stressful um so i'm confident there and you'll notice that those are all things that i do
i'm not hugely confident about myself
in the sense that i still struggle with self-worth and i realized
that that probably sounds really nauseating for me to sit here in this lovely place being interviewed for this fabulous podcast
drinking my cup of middle-class green tea like it sounds absurd for me to say that and also self-indulgent
but that's me being really honest like i've just got that that's something that uh
i really struggle with like just feeling that i'm enough
interesting so the conclusive chapter in my book chapter 20 is all about this topic okay yeah yeah
and and i and i because i think i you know i spoke to some psychologists and stuff and i batted around with this idea of um
this contradiction of how i could possibly be enough but ambitious yeah yes do you know what i mean like i
know it feels like a contradiction yeah and that's that thing that i always fear if i
if i tackle my self-worth and i cure myself will i just have no drive okay so this is chapter 20.
okay and it's crazy because you would have you'll resonate with this yeah i actually started the chapters
set out to answer the question and i answered as i was typing and and so usually as you'll discover
like in the book is um a lot of the time it's just a shitty use of words that are holding us back so
one of the things like is you know is he your soul mate that there's so many presumptions within that like that
you're that a soulmate exists you have one of them you'll be able to find them um and in fact if you ask yourself maybe
the concept of a soulmate doesn't actually exist same thing with are you enough right so the term enough
this was my conclusion first assumes that we can become less and more yeah
how can we become less and more that's a good point in in innately and intrinsically how can we ever
how can elizabeth ever be intrinsically innate like inside less or more you're always going
to be you same hair same arms same legs same talent same skills you
inherently like intrinsically never change yeah you never become less more enough
you just are the the reason why we have these metrics again is because it's an external extrinsic comparison so i am
not enough my nokia is not enough alongside an iphone so i thought in fact
and then when you have that feeling of like being less and more of enough what you then pursue is the pursuit of
becoming more but because it was driven by external factors your ambition becomes externally driven
so for me i didn't think i was enough so i was trying to get a lamborghini and in fact it's the belief it's the knowing
that you never become less moral enough that intrinsic feeling that makes you pursue ambition the right things for the
right reasons so once i knew i was enough i then went after things i actually gave a [ __ ] about intrinsically
i stopped going after lamborghinis and i started going after like i would love to do a book i would love
to learn piano and so my conclusive point is that in fact it's the it's the knowing that you're enough and that in fact you never
become less or more regardless of what you achieve or accomplish that is the foundation of real ambition
yeah real ambition is for you it's chasing what you want for your reasons that was my conclusion
so the enough thing is actually [ __ ] which is just social which then causes [ __ ] ambitions like
lamborghinis yeah and uh realizing that you never you know you never become less more or enough intrinsically allows you to
have intrinsic ambitions and that is real ambition that's my conclusive point which is so so mind-blowingly good and
also connects to that whole thing that [ __ ] about soul mates yeah because there's that belief that a
soulmate will complete you now what are you saying there you're saying that you're incomplete in and of yourself yeah and that there's
only one true way to like all of that i hate that yeah the question comes in a very innocent way
it's like is he your soul mate and yes the moment you accept it but you also accept seven other pieces of
unintended [ __ ] which is like that you're incomplete now that you you've done you're a failure at not finding this
person and all of these other pieces of [ __ ] it's the same with like i for me it's the same as like are you in love or have you found your passion
have you found your passion is it like a i posted about this other day it's like another just really difficult piece of [ __ ] um to
to comprehend because found i've got to search for it my passion there's one of them and it's out
there somewhere and once i find it it's going to feel great passion what's that how does that feel
you've said the word are we thinking of the same thing the same so many pieces of [ __ ] which i now
have to accept so if there was one thing that i've learned in the last couple years it's just like
question the question yeah as much as you possibly can because the question will [ __ ] you when you accept it oh my gosh i could not agree more
like also passion [Music] is such an unhelpful word it's that
thing of like oh did you feel did you feel passionate did you feel this sexual insane sexual
chemistry did you fall in love at first sight and i'm like hang on a second what you're saying there is did you feel
deeply unsettled and chaotic yeah because that's what passion it's like a disruptive force
Interrogating our thoughts
i'm like i don't want to feel i don't want to feel unstable and chaotic i want to feel safe and known that for me
is like true romance yeah and a relationship or a business is not a failure because
it ends again like you could have learned so much you could have learned what you needed to know and therefore you can evolve and grow
yeah and as you say the act of finding something what if it's like inside you don't need to be yes
something you love to do should be something you'd love to do without having to go on this quest yeah exactly yeah yeah but that's what you were saying earlier
about ambition being an external driver really feeds into one of the most profound things
i've ever learned from doing all this stuff about failure i met this man called mo gowda he used
to be the chief business officer of google x but he wasn't happy and he has a lot to say about expectation
versus reality so if we can manage our expectations of life so if they're equal to or less than our perception of events
and how they turn out then we can be happy or contented and he was the one who really brought it
home to me that we are not our worst thoughts that our thoughts are produced by our brain as organic matter
in the same way that blood is pumped around our body by our heart like we wouldn't think
we were defined by our blood so why would we think that we are our thoughts actually as you know the premise of all
meditation is that you can observe your thoughts who's doing the observing that's you that's you
why would you need thoughts like you don't need to communicate yourself so your thoughts are just being produced by
your brain constantly and i found that really helpful the idea that
once you realize that you can train your brain to think differently and to replace
negative thoughts with positive ones as much as you're able so he gave this incredibly moving
example his son ali died at the age of 21 during a routine operation and in the aftermath of ali's death moe
would wake up every morning with tears streaming down his cheeks and his first thought would be how he died and it was an unbelievably
oppressive grief-stricken thought and after a few more weeks of it he was like i just can't live like this i can't live
like this and so he challenged his brain to come up with a different thought
and each morning he would wake up and he would still think and he died and he died he'd still be crying but he added something to that sentence
and he added yes but he also lived and in that differently expressed sentiment
was 21 years of memories of a father and son who were best friends and that was what enabled him to carry
on living and if he can do that in that situation i sure as hell can do it when someone criticizes me on instagram
it was a really helpful lesson we never really thought sort of taught to challenge our
thinking right as you say yeah i think it's just we think it's reality we think it's true
and we're taught to think we need to use it to be good at exams to get ahead to get a good job like
that's all thought isn't it that's like the exercise of your brain and don't get me wrong i like love my
brain and i'm happy that i have thoughts but it's that thing of understanding when they're running away
with themselves when they're in control of you it is the exercise of a life yeah it
like it really is trying to rise above your own thoughts is like yeah or at least analyze them hold them
out in front of you and examine them for validity i mean you mentioned working out earlier i definitely find exercise is a helpful
way of doing that yes like and that's something again i never i never thought i was good at sport and i translated that
wrongly as being like someone who doesn't like exercise until my 30s really until i went through all
this stuff divorce all that sort of stuff and i needed to feel strong in myself but that started with feeling strong in my body
and i realized that it was just an incredibly helpful way of being in my body and being out of my
head and it was just such a relief to find that isn't it that's the the way that your brain thinks while you're
exercising versus when you're just yeah you know in your normal life it's just it's
bizarre it's like a different different person shows up and can suddenly see clearly totally and also for me it feels like
i'm not really thinking when i'm outside but i am i will have like processed something that has been bothering me for days
so fascinating i wonder why that is i bet somebody knows just the like monotony of doing a task or the
you know whether it's a running machine or just lifting weights for some reason i don't know the brain just seems to go
to a different place most of my good ideas if i have any come from uh come from the gym or the
walking or the shower sometimes yeah well that's why people sometimes are kind enough to ask
me for writing tips like how to write and one of the things that i say is like don't feel guilty for not actually doing
the writing sometimes like sometimes you literally need to take a walk and um be around people
or be on the top deck of a double-decker bus and look out the window because your brain needs rest but it
also needs like a creative fallow period where the field is left fallow and then it becomes more fertile in the future
and all of that feeds into your inspiration it's so true i you know people don't appreciate that
it's one of the real upsides of of exercise they think it's to make themselves look pretty but i think the
benefit i've had to my mind through exercise is hard to put into words maybe the only
thing that i love more in the world than huel is salted caramel and i've got
some great news he'll have just released their salted caramel pure flavor
and i am over the moon because i actually got to try this before it came out and genuinely no word of the lie there's
my favorite flavor of everything i've got two favorite flavors toffee unsalted caramel and to hear that he'll now do salted caramel um
has made my dreams come true i've been a heel fanatic for the last four years as a lot of you
Failure
know it's the reason i'm in the ship best shape of my life it's the reason why i have the energy i have to do this
podcast and to manage the schedule that i have and as we come into the summer months
and my training schedule in the gym has started to change it's become more important than ever that i don't miss some of the sort of basic
nutritional components of my diet like proteins and like amino acids and that is where heel fits so yeah
thank you so much and [ __ ] me salted caramel dream come true i want to talk about
failure yes now which seems like a good thing to talk about and in your book philosophy
you you list uh seven failure principles so i'm sure you've done this a million
times but i think it's a good good place to start so the seven failure principles
yes number one failure just is yes so that actually just feeds in with
what we were talking about which is the idea that failure is a fact it's inevitable it's going to happen to all of us
no matter how much we try to avoid it i guarantee that it will happen and that can feel scary but it can also
feel liberating because once you've accepted it as a fact there's no point in trying to avoid it so you might as well take the risk
so acceptance of failure starts with the observation of it failure is a fact but how you respond to
it is within your control whether you decide to feel like a failure for
many years after the thing that's happened or whether you think to yourself okay well that's taught me something and
i'll do it differently next time i guess the risk there is one bad failure
people stop trying exactly and then i i was thinking this is very similar to confidence in the way that like if you have one bad failure
your performance next time you get an opportunity if you actually don't manage to just avoid it completely will probably be worse because of nerves
and that you know the memory if i'm terrible and yeah and then that's going to increase your chances of failing again and then the kind of like self negative
reinforcing cycle kind of continues and your your confidence and your sort of yeah your guts kind of
cascade downwards and can for some people work in the other direction where you have a success
your confidence builds you walk on stage to do that you know public speech next time around with a bit more confidence you do a better job which
increases your chance of success and it cascades upwards is that how failure works from your experience it can
work like that i mean to take the example you've just given one of the ways of looking at that if you're then stuck in a downward cycle and you're
failing and you're trying the thing is that you're therefore in the wrong situation so you're in the wrong workplace for
instance that that isn't generous enough to like make you feel okay after your failures or
doesn't make you feel like you can be your true self in which case i would argue you need to remove yourself from that situation and find the place that
does suit you or it can be a question of mindset
and a question of applying that mindset that we've just talked about which is okay i failed i'm feeling in a downward
spiral how much of that is fact that's a very difficult thing to do on your own when you're a very low ebb and that's why i'm a huge advocate of
therapy and again i know that i come from a privileged place where i can afford therapy but even if it
starts with reaching out to your friend and talking about it or reaching out to
your work helpline and talking about it or texting shout the mental health charity
or calling the samaritans that's a really valuable step and the other thing that i would say
there is that i'm very aware that my definition of failure which is what
happens when life doesn't go according to plan has a fatal flaw which is that sometimes
there are failures that are totally cataclysmic that we couldn't possibly have predicted that go against any plan
whatsoever like a global pandemic like a terrible illness that you contract like
the death of a loved one it would be monstrous for me to sit here and say those failures
are as easily assimilated or learned from or dealt with as fading or driving tests and so i'm not saying that at all
those kind of failures will require a process of mourning and coming to terms with the
thing that you've lost and that's absolutely right and as it should be
my only thing is the way that i choose to live my life is i mourn but i don't have to constantly
relive the pain i can still feel sadness about something but i don't need to live in that place
of reliving it constantly becoming a victim yeah and becoming defined by that
i can choose to be defined by something else i can choose to be defined by my response to it i can choose to
find some kind of meaning in something that was meaningless at the time and that's how i
choose to live my life because that makes it less sad and i and i think that that choice is
available for most of us topic of conversation that i liked having on this podcast whereas you're
alluding to there is about like personal responsibility and um you know we all have different starts in life and different
you know quote-unquote advantages and disadvantages but um how important do you think personal
responsibility is even in times where something happened and it's really not your quote-unquote fault
yeah i think it's tremendously important i want to caveat what i'm about to say by saying i'm very
aware that certain people are given more opportunities to fail because of the elitist society in which we live
because of the racist society in which we live because of a society which marginalizes entire groups of people
Having to be careful about what you say online
through no fault of their own i'm aware that i as a white middle-class woman have been given shitloads of opportunities to fail so so
i'm totally aware of that that there's a sliding scale you have to say that right yeah of
course i have to say that because because i don't want people to think that i haven't thought about it
yeah and i also think that it's important to have the discussion it's crazy how many caveats we've got to do before we say anything these days
like i don't care that much so you're gonna get me into trouble i find it i when i sit here and i i
speak to guests and i watch them have to caveat something they're gonna say i just want it so funny because i'm like i
personally do that to some degree but i also i'm like are you gonna i don't know it's
interesting it's interesting because this is a growing thing because you're right if you hadn't have done that someone would have yeah and someone
would think oh well it's all very well for her to say that and like it's just it's just a kind of
acknowledgement that it's been easier for me in certain respects which is fair and it's been hard in other ways like everyone has
their own lived experience you know like i'm talking from a place of you know i wrote a book called how to fail which
was part memoir part manifesto like a memoir by its nature cannot be intersectional like i'm speaking
from my own life and i'm bringing in voices of other people who can speak to those experiences because it would be
delusional and offensive for me to try has anyone ever taken that shot or you've been like well it's easy for you
to say oh yeah does it feel um be honest how does it feel well okay
it did feel before i'd done the thinking like an attack it did feel like
well hang on a second i have worked hard to be where i am and actually if you
only knew like there are things that i never talk about or write about that will never be in the public domain because they
involve other people okay so i just can't i choose not to go there
and then and then i read more about it and talk more about it and it's absolutely true that
i have had massive advantages in my life and that's a fact as is the fact that
i've worked hard as well but i did have those advantages so for me to deny that feels
really wrong and actually irresponsible and um now i feel like
there's a certain dialogue that is had around women where i feel women are more often
challenged for talking about their personal experiences than men are and maybe you can tell me that no i think you're telling the truth
i think i would agree okay and i don't like that that's crazy that's so true yeah it's so true like i don't like the
fact that i feel as though i constantly have to say i constantly have to show my battle
scars and my wounds and my sadness in order to earn the right to a platform from which
i can speak and write as a woman now there are certain white middle class privately educated
men out there who never have to do that apologizing they never have to do that caveat
people just like oh they're quirky but they all say it with that they will like the quote is like say with your chest they will say it with
their chest they'll talk about their success they'll give advice they don't caveat anything it's like this is how you do it
and it's funny because i sat here with um maybe shouldn't say their name but i sat
here with a young lady who's very successful yeah and she was educated at maybe the best university in the last race perfectly yes
i heard it i listened to it yeah and i thought she dealt with it very elegantly and why she got to deal with elegantly
and uh i sit here i think like this the point i was trying to make to her is like
why is it that you and grace have to have to like do this like assault course of words and
caveats because you will someone will say in the comments section oh it's very easy for but with
my male guests no they don't do that and they don't have to and they don't get attacked can i ask you an off-topic personal
question about race on the record on the record totally on the record so i felt really conflicted
on social media around black lives matter and the horrendous
tragic to my mind a legal death of george floyd and i was like but i don't i felt like i don't need to
post on instagram that i think killing black people is bad
like surely that's a given no no no elizabeth silence is violence
i'm taking them first i know but i do so i would love to hear from you like what's my
responsibility because i did post a black square because i was like if i don't post a black square then that
i don't that feels wrong to me as well i mean but this is just like this is a huge issue with society because
um we're thinking in such binary [ __ ] ways about these really complex
sensitive systemic issues it's in that moment and the reason i did this post on instagram it went viral and like everyone's seen it and i've talked about
this podcast multiple times mainly because i just had adults on so i've talked about it there but obviously when uh we watch a
a a black man get killed for nine minutes asking for his mum any sound sort of morally sound
human being on planet earth will feel a bunch of emotions i watched it and i didn't say anything for three days
because i just i just didn't want to see that [ __ ] clip again no i didn't want to talk about it i watched that clip and just thought oh i
felt sick to my stomach and i was angry and i was sad and i just didn't want to and then my dms in my dms i've got all
these dms from people black people going you've not stood with us you [ __ ] but i'm just thinking oh [ __ ] off like
yeah i mean this isn't and in those moments what social media in the world will try and do is it will try and make you um fit
exactly into a a camp that that think in one way that act in one way that use
one hashtag that post one thing and i will not and i will not and so in
that moment what i posted was defending white people i guess or everyone and said listen people process things in
their own ways and that's normal obviously do you agree with that statement people process especially traumatic things in their own
everyone agrees with that sentence and some people might be thinking they might be reading they might just be
listening and that's okay and also my last point here is i'm gonna be black forever for my entire
life my kids will also be have a little bit of black in them too maybe a quarter black depending on who i marry um
and uh so if you actually give a [ __ ] about changing things your response
isn't a black tile your response would be something much more systemic your response might be educating yourself and your friends
get virtue signaling on social media that for me that's a sign that you probably don't really care yeah if anything and like you can't say
that unless you're black i'm the only person that can say that like i'm not the only one there's more of us but i mean like i'm
in my friendship group i'm the only one because you'd be all of you be finished off every single one of you would get
finished if you said anything like that so and and then it's a saddle while we live because i
know everyone in this room agrees not one of you can say it and that's a sad place to be where this isn't a war of ideas this is a war
of like virtue signaling like we're not it's not competition of the best ideas it's a it's a competition of like
who is correct and who is incorrect cancel accept cancel accept and man oh what a sad
place can't even have a conversation without someone's [ __ ] gonna lose your job i'm fortunately unemployed so no one can find me and i don't really
need the money either so like you know what i mean like the podcast sponsors if they thought i was immoral or whatever they could pull out
but now i think thank you because that's i think you're right and i think
compassion and nuance can't be fitted into the binary world of social
media a lot of the time never i'm really sorry because i've completely like
really taken the thing that annoys me more is i don't think it can be fixed
i don't know i don't know how it can be fixed i know the way that algorithms work and i know that they create echo chambers where everyone thinks like you
so the minute anyone in your echo chamber is not thinking like you uh you the way that they reinforce
and reward your thought using these algorithms you're not gonna get rewarded you're
gonna get attacked and so it's it's fighting against it's fighting a losing battle at some point i'll probably be cancelled for something
i'm like pretty aware of this because i refuse to i like to think in nuance i like to
think i don't think left or right i think usually the truth is somewhere in the middle often yeah more so than it is
on the far left or the far right and that is a dangerous way to think is it's a crime and for me that's a form
of imprisonment which is the the inability to think and speak for yourself that's a form of imprisonment in the same way
putting someone in a cage it's and for me also not allowing people to express themselves we've seen the harm that does
we've seen when people can't express their sexuality they kill themselves more so i will i was thinking i was like i
will not allow myself to be imprisoned my thought to be imprisoned and my expression to be put in impressive because i actually think
the net impact of that is much worse than just someone who's someone writing some [ __ ] in the comments section about me i'd
like to be a free thinker what do you think of piers morgan sometimes he hits sometimes he misses
he's got he's a bit of a narcissist in some ways sometimes he's like right sometimes he's wrong sometimes i agree sometimes i don't yeah
shouldn't be de-platformed we can all scream at him but um he's not he's not like he's not a racist
he's not um doing it he's not like encouraging people to like hurt each other he's not encouraging
harm or violence he has an opinion which some people disagree with sometimes talking about sharon osborne she's been
chucked off her show for defending pierce morgan and i watched the clip last night of um
what she said and all she goes is you know what has he said that's racist and the host responds to him it's not
what he said he hasn't said anything racist it's just his you know basically his attitude towards the situation
oh come on [ __ ] hell but do you think so but do you think that because we've
had millennia of things one way the transitional phase is always going to have to be extreme as the
pendulum swings to one to one end and so that it can then stabilize in the center and we're just
living through an age of transition i like to think that sometimes but then i know how algorithms work and i think
that the algorithms are reinforcing our echo chambers every single day my algorithm is telling
me if i'm right or if i'm wrong and it's based on group think it's like these pockets of group think
and the other thing is like just what i think about it logically i think you know i read this quote one day and it was like if
your opinions and beliefs almost identically resemble the people around you then they're not
your opinions and beliefs i thought about that a lot and i was like that's really interesting yeah if we want to get like really deep
about this yeah most of our beliefs and opinions come from the society we live in and
you've only got to go back five thousand ten thousand years and see the barbaric things we did that we thought were morally sound and
okay to realize that in fact our opinions and beliefs are mainly given to us by society in fact good and bad if you look at what
âAlmost everyone feels they've failed in their 20s
we did a hundred years ago if you look at what happened in certain parts of the world in you know history those people thought
they were good and that was the right thing to do and so what are my opinions today the majority what social media and the world
has told me is the correct thing to do how moral are we if we felt completely moral
when we used to like behead people and kill black people a topic from anyway
what was that i'm so sorry number two of fail philosophy
i like lost my way in this quickly yeah got the list here as well so point number two in your book is you
are not your anxious brain i think you've talked about that almost everything phil feels they almost
everyone feels they have failed in their twenties i mean not you okay so it's stephen i'm pretty sure
do you think you failed in your 20s probably personally sorry multiple no no no it's a good
question actually multiple times yeah yeah started my first business at 18 it was clearly a failure left that when i was 20 years old failed
in order relationships fail every day in business not the big like momentous failures
other than my business that one would assert but probably more than anybody to be fair i think
that's so great to hear yeah and also i think that a lot of people struggle in
their 20s particularly in this day and age because of the curse of comparison and because we live in a culture of
curated perfection where you're constantly comparing yourself to your peers filtered appearance on instagram and the
life that they seem to be living so we're comparing our insides with everyone else's projection of their outside
exactly yeah and for many people although i know not you but for many people it's the first time that they've
come out of full-time education and come out of a system of exam and reward exam and reward
and there is no exam that you can sit to show that you're being a good grown-up so you feel quite lost plus piling on
top of that the pressure to find your passion to like make a career for yourself but
also to earn enough to pay your rent living in house shares like just trying
to make your way and trying to forge your identity in this day and age it's just so hard to do
all that at once and then you're like oh and i should be having like a thriving personal life and i should either be in a long-term
relationship or having one night sounds and making footloose and fancy-free and drinking modes and then at the weekend making vegan brownies
because i got to watch what i eat and all of that sort of stuff and it's exhausting and so really
what i wanted to say in that failure principle was that so many people come on podcast and say that they feel they failed at their 20s
and i think a lot of us fall into the trap and i did too of believing that we had to have our life sorted out by then
Heartbreak
and actually your twenties are a decade of transition of discovering who you are of grinding up the spices of life in
your pestle and water and the older you get my experience has been the more you know yourself and the
more you know what you want to do and that's where success lies i've had so many more opportunities
after leaving my 20s behind in the rear view mirror wow everything else i've had you've
really thought about that you wrote a book on it so yeah um number four breakups are not a tragedy
your ex-partner has taught you something yeah one of the things you said which i which i thought was really really
powerful is that um a relationship ending doesn't mean that it failed that's it in a nutshell like i've had
countless failed relationships and and they and they and it sucks like heartbreak there is no
pain like heartbreak i hate it it's the worst isn't it it's the worst it really i yeah i totally relate and
i now realize that i learned something very instructive from each one of those relationships and from the fact that they ended it
taught me something that i needed to know about myself and i realized that
love that was ready for me i didn't need to fight to convince it like it would meet me where i was and it
might not come in the package that i expected and it didn't i i met justin on a hinge date that i
almost didn't go on and it doesn't and it doesn't immediately feel like the thing that you thought you
wanted because actually that hasn't worked out for you so it's always better to make a different choice i think so yeah it's
just about how although relationships feel that they might be life-ending at the time they never never
when they end they never never are and often someone has been sent to you whether it be a friendship a work
colleague or a lover to teach you a lesson that you needed to know and when a relationship ends it's because you've been taught that
lesson god it's a shitty lesson to learn and also like when you when you go through a breakup
as you've described there um not letting it end is part in my
experience of the reason why something new doesn't start yes oh that's so yes that's what oprah
would call a teachable moment yeah you need to you need to create the space
for the new thing to come in which means leaving something behind what i talk about a little bit
before about quitting being just as much of a skill in an art form as starting we glamorize starting but there's a real talent not
yet there's a real skill to knowing how to quit how to move forward because
you know starting is great but the thing you do before you start something is to quit something else and yeah that is i i mean just from reading your
books and stuff and listening to the the interviews you've done not appreciated enough
because it involves uncertainty you're throwing yourself off a cliff sometimes and building the paraglider as you fly yes and we're also taught
to avoid feelings of sadness like good vibes only and you're like no actually sometimes you need to
be in that sadness you need to feel that discomfort to understand what life really is life is texture life is all sorts of emotions
and when we feel grief because a relationship has ended or because we've lost someone
that as that famous quote says is the price you pay for love and in a way it's a beautiful thing to feel
because it's a signifier of how much you loved just sucks though i know it just doesn't
it just suck like i just giving people advice from heartbreak i feel like it's such a for me when i'm like in my dms and someone sent
me something about i've just broken up with this person and whatever yeah it's such an intoxicating
force like heartbreak yeah that i'm like my words aren't going to help you you just basically have to tough it out
and to and to try as much as you can in believing that your future will be better yeah you'll get past this
and believing that rejection is protection if you're rejected yes that person is not for you
either because they've been stupid enough to [ __ ] reject you or because action is character and if
they've dumped you it's like well do you really want to trust that person for the rest of your life no i'm gonna
is is that is that true and i'm playing devil's advocate here intentionally because i'd actually know the answer
it if you get rejected is that person not right for you it i mean yes i think but
i suppose it depends on the nature of the rejection like it has to be a serious one
um it can't just be an unread what's whatsapp message like that you're interpreting as a rejection
they like full-on rejected yeah i think that's listen i don't know if it's true or not
but it's what i choose to believe because it makes me feel better about life to believe i think that you're
the definition you gave of like well they didn't appreciate you yeah what about like how if we
think about taking responsibility in those situations and we say okay my relationship with this guy that i loved ended because i have problems because not when
i say problems like i have jealousy or i have things that i haven't dealt with
is that also you know that so it's hard for people to do that yeah lame is super easy in heartbreak you're so right and that's where
personal responsibility comes in yeah and so in the immediate aftermath of a breakup
you're going to probably feel heartbroken and really sad once you've processed
that then it's then your responsibility
is to understand what part you played in the dynamic but for those first few weeks do
whatever you need to do to get through and if you need to blame someone and just keep saying rejection is protection like what a loser
do it because you just need to get through that initial phase of awfulness i actually
my last serious breakup i was in such a dark place i googled how long
does it take to get over heartbreak it's like actually that was a really good
six weeks i did feel better it was a good it was like a manageable length of time and i was like okay i'm gonna feel
Vulnerabilities
miserable for six weeks and once you commit to the acceptance of that it becomes a lot easier to deal with
because you're not struggling against feeling it you're like well i'm on track because i'm now week four so yeah i'm
still feeling miserable that's okay and it somehow makes you feel better no i get that yeah are you post-breakup
right now um not post-breakup no uh i'm i'm post um something ending
okay um i'm sorry no no it wasn't it was it was um i consider it to be a choice
that i made okay yeah so that's not necessarily the best example for me the the real significant heartbreak
moments i had were all when i was when i was younger really and uh yeah and it just always sucked um
but obviously i've got a lot of friends that are going through breakups and stuff and it's always difficult to give them advice because you're they're
so their head is gone like there's no way i can describe it there's no sense there when in matters
of love it's just all so yeah just asking them to tough it out i think is is all i've ever got in terms
of it well now you can give them a copy there you go point number seven
when we choose to share our vulnerabilities is when we feel most satisfaction most connection i think
is what i said well i don't why does it say satisfaction on momentum i like that too because you probably do feel personal
satisfaction it's like but when we choose to be open about our vulnerabilities
that's paradoxically when we find the most strength and the source of the most real connections with other people
amen yeah and that's something that i have genuinely learned through the podcast the first season of the podcast
i did i was very much i came from a very traditional newspaper journalist background
so for me it was like i'm interviewing my guest i will ask the questions and i will
listen and then i will ask another question and it was only as time went on that i felt more comfortable
sharing my own experiences and whenever i did that i had such an incredible
like feedback loop of like just amazing people sharing their stories and
their vulnerabilities and also saying that they felt less alone because i shared mine
and really that's what my entire life is about ultimately is connection and so
i really want to encourage people not to be scared of opening up about the things that they perceive as their weaknesses
because so often what you think of as your most personal shame turns out to have most universal
resonance and that was certainly my experience talking about fertility and miscarriage
and divorce like actually that's where i've had the greatest impact i think and i'm so
grateful for that why do you think that is why do you think vulnerable in terms of like why it has such wide resonance
why do you think that is because i think that when we're vulnerable we're being real and we're letting our masks slip and
you'll see a glimpse of who the authentic person is and there's something
just absolutely quintessentially human about that so it's a human recognizing another
human it's a human recognizing another human beneath the pretense and i think
it also reassures people because as we've been talking about in this culture
that we live in which is so defined by social media and how you appear and the
currency of perfection again it's such a relief it makes you feel like you can breathe and someone's like oh god
i'll tell you about today i sat in bed in my pajamas eating hummus direct from the top because i felt really down
that's an act of singular generosity to someone else who can then have the space to talk about how they're feeling is
there any such thing as too vulnerable or over sharing there's uh there's
i don't think there's any such thing as too vulnerable i do think there is such a thing as oversharing
and i only say i i say i make that distinction because over sharing is about telling your story
to others and obviously there are right and appropriate times and places to do that
i'm not advocating that someone goes into work and just starts sobbing at their desk there's there's definitely a time and
place for that but i wouldn't suggest doing that every single day like to protect yourself you need to
find a safe space that you can share those vulnerabilities with and then build up your strength and your
confidence and realize what it is that you do want to speak more publicly about because i don't think that you can
share with everyone immediately after you've experienced pain like
that's too soon and also you can't trust everyone to honor what you're sharing
so i don't think you can be too vulnerable but it's a question of choosing the things that you then take
your vulnerability and share from and who you share them with that was such an ineloqua
no it was good no no it's a reason basically about that no yeah i completely i completely i was thinking when you were saying it because i remember having a conversation
with one of my team members in new york one day where um i was trying to you know the the
issue you have when you're a ceo um is someone might have some struggles some mental health issues or they might
have some problems going on at home how do you tell them without being a dick
to to not broadcast that every day to their team yeah below them but also knowing the
importance of speaking an expression is part of the cure so i remember having a conversation with one particular person and just
saying to them like the key thing is like knowing the right outlet for that yes and you've described it as like the safe space exactly and that can
be a different safe space for different people it can be your therapist it can be your sibling it can be um the in-house
therapy that your workplace hopefully provides but i also think that it goes back to what we were saying earlier
if a team leader is in that position i think it's about being able to bring your authentic whole
self to work but being able to show that you're not defined by the things that have gone wrong or if you are defined by it or defined
in a good way in that you're choosing to lean into this particular feeling because it's going to teach you something that you
need to know that's the sort of responsibility of a leader i think it's not to pretend that everything's fine
and to wear this mask of the perfect boss it's to be someone who acknowledges that
life can be touched tough and who shares what they're going to do about
that i think we need to have confidence in our leaders that they have an idea about what to do with it
when they're sharing it in the workplace and this is the problem with matt hancock being such a robot isn't it oh my gosh
didn't even get me started on that i don't know if he experiences emotion i should probably shouldn't say that because that's unfair but i just i look
at this guy and i think do you understand what people are feeling i don't think you do it's the problem with so many
politicians i was so inspired by angela merkel recently because she apologized for having overturned a
lockdown ruling over easter she's like i'm really sorry i got that wrong i was like oh my gosh thank you thank
you just quickly just go back to over sharing and jacinda oh my gosh jacinda is i mean
we both need to get her on our perspective podcasts we really do um over sharing as it pertains to women
Infertility and miscarriage
just very quickly i think women are often shamed into silence and i've definitely experienced that so
i'm being like why do you talk about all this stuff why don't you keep it private and i'm like precisely so that i attack
that kind of narrative because i feel that so many people feel shame and stigma over things they
don't need to feel it for and it's because people stay silent so i think it's also a bit of a stick
with which to beat women i completely agree is there anything
you wouldn't share that doesn't involve someone else oh that's a great
question because every time i every time you hit a wall in terms of what you're willing to share it's because you say well that involves
someone else so i won't share but is there anything about yourself that you wouldn't share that doesn't involve anybody else
i am still determined to be a mother um when i get pregnant
i will have i don't think i would share that publicly because i would feel
fearful and anxious and also because i have such respect for women who
are going through fertility issues that i would just never do that but that involves another person
the one that i'm carrying so i'm not sure whether the parameters your question really fit right but that is one thing
that i've thought about yeah so that's quite a heavy answer
that's a really interesting point there about the you wouldn't want to share it because you've probably um resonated
well of course you are [ __ ] probably you've resonated with a lot of women who are going through that same experience and you've probably got a lot of those
people in your audience so for some of those people it might i mean you know humans are humans
the news that you know when you have your your own child might feel like [ __ ] to them definitely and i
respect that because i've been there and i felt it and i feel it still and and i totally understand that i feel it
as in it's like a jealousy of it's like an envy yes yes of women that have a child or that yeah
i mean it's not it's never personally directed it's just a sort of
envy or yearning would be a better word for an experience that thus far has been denied me
and i think lockdown and the pandemic has been so hard for all women
and it's been incredibly hard for people homeschooling their children but for people who don't have children
and desperately long for that for people who are going through fertility treatment that's been delayed by the pandemic for people who've
experienced miscarriages during lockdown as i have it's incredibly painful to see
parents complaining about homeschooling and how difficult that is to have these children that they have to homeschool that's a
very difficult thing now no one is to blame for that i take personal responsibility for my reaction
and that's where i need to curate my social media feed that is absolutely not the thought of the parent
question they should totally do that and lean into it and that is completely right and appropriate
that's up to me to take that responsibility on it's just that i know i wouldn't feel comfortable shouting it
from the rooftops because i know how [ __ ] painful and traumatic it is to go through i really do
listen so your um your vulnerability and your honesty is is really moving and it's very very rare and you know i
can't i can't even begin to imagine how many um people women you've helped because of your
vulnerability you probably don't even get to see it so i want to thank you on behalf of all those people as i was reading about your
story and your journey i was like really taken aback by how open and honest you're willing to be
because you don't need to be right um i'm sure that you know as you've described in some of the things you've written you've you've discovered that it's
actually really almost paradoxically quite a selfish thing to be so selfless in that way but um
yeah i think you're just remarkable and i think um what you've written and the work you've produced is phenomenal and i just wanted
to thank you so much for coming here today and being as vulnerable with me as you have been across all of your other work it's um it's truly uh
you know we're it's it's fortunate we're fortunate as a society to have people like you in it
so thank you thank you for giving me a safe space and for making me feel like i can be
vulnerable with you i have loved this conversation so much i really truly have and i love that i've been able to swear
but i also love what you do and what you stand for and honestly your instagram page
i don't know how you have so much wisdom at such a young age but we will find your perfect match all
right please please do your book philosophy it's um everywhere i actually went down to the
same pancreas yesterday just to get it got it off the shelf i think uh excellent yeah um
where else can people find you and what else are you working on that they should check out the podcast as well how to fail yes that's a smash hit book sunday times
bestseller yes uh i wrote another book before that called how to fail originally everything i've ever learned
from things going wrong which is my memoir part memoir part manifesto the podcast available on all podcast platforms um
i'm on social media at elizabeth day and i've got a novel out my new novel is out in september and
it's called magpie and um it is okay i have to be a bit vague because there's
a massive twist in it okay and it's a sort of psychological twisty
novel but it's about a lot of what we've been talking about today it's about dysfunctional motherhood and what
happens when you think you know what you want and then your dreams come true and then it just
turns out to be a total illusion have i sold it
is it a thriller yeah it is it's basically a thriller driven by kind of warped characters okay interesting
and i'm obsessed with magpies that's why it's called magpie okay sorry do you salute magpie i don't know
i don't think i know no one ever told me that tell but um thank you so much again and it means well to me that you can make the time
for this today and i'm sure that you've imparted a ton of important inspiration on our listeners so thank you
thank you for having me

Transcription:

Intro
i don't see barriers hard work every day is a lifestyle it should be like a standard dedication
attention to detail i just wanted to be the best i was that obsessed with it my kids lost they lost
their their mum i got to understand mental health for making a documentary it's allowed me to kind of speak and
show vulnerability that people probably were never used to the great part of it is that you walk down the street an old
age lady or a man come up to you you know what throat's all croaky and i watched your program
i've never spoken before really you helped me like my next phase of my life when
someone sees me in 10 20 years say that's where i paid for my united i haven't really done what i'm
here to do to set and setting out to do
do i even need to introduce my next guest rio ferdinand former football player one of
the most decorated english footballers of all time and as a man united fan probably one of my favorite players
of all time ever and he's played alongside some of the greatest players ever but he's also been managed by the best
manager ever i grew up as a manchester united fan watching him idolizing him
and now he's my mate so this is going to be a fairly interesting conversation after retiring
he's become a sports commentator for bt sport he's become an author he's become an entrepreneur he's the founder of a charity a
foundation he's a non-executive director which we'll talk about today as well and as you'll hear he's also so much
more some things that you probably wouldn't expect he's also a husband and a dad one that's
experienced tremendous unthinkable tragedy tragedy i pray that most of us will never know
rio is a special guy not least for what he's achieved on the field but for who he is and today you're going to find out
who he actually is the philosophy to life that he swears by and the culture required to win in an
ambitious career but also the culture required to win in your personal life without further ado i'm stephen bartlett
What made you chose football?
and this is the director ceo i hope nobody's listening but if you are then please keep this to yourself
i'm trying to find the right words to ask this question because it's one that i've i haven't seen been asked in previous interviews with you but what
are the what are the key things that happened when you were very very young that made you
choose football as your future or enabled you to to take that path because
a lot of kids grow up in london a lot of kids do a lot of things they have a lot of passions but for some reason as i read through your story football
was this ballet as well but football was the the path that you chose to take above all other things yeah it's a good
question because when i was younger i was into everything i was running around on the estate i was
doing gymnastics a couple of times a week i was doing ballet i was obviously playing football i was doing athletics
i was doing a drama class why were you doing all those things there because i just was interested in it all i liked it i enjoyed it and my
mum and dad were really my mom especially were really like if you like something go and do it try it they were always like that go and
do it what's the worst it can do is you you don't enjoy it i used to do karate sometimes as well
and i got to a point i think i was like 13 or 14 years old and obviously my dad
was having to come from east like obviously we lived in south london he'd drive to east northeast london
drive home pick me up from school take me to west london to play football back to dropping friends off on the way
is hard graft and in the end i got to 13 14 years old and my dad said listen
you're doing a lot at the moment you're going to burn yourself out so let's just pick something that you
really enjoy and you want to do and just go for it and i was like it was that an easy
conversation it was difficult you know i had to let down our fault and disappoint central school of ballet
where i was doing it which is a real like a top score in london in farringdon and i made good friends there and
the other stuff i wasn't too that concerned about it but four years i was three or four years i
was at the central school of ballet so i've got good relationships there told them i couldn't do it and then
went full throttle and full steam ahead of with football and it was just it was the best decision i obviously
made in my life in that sense but i was i knew that that was my passion i liked the other stuff i enjoyed doing
the other stuff there were good distractions from what was probably going on my estate as well probably my parents fault like that as well
but football was the something that i got up every day from when i knocked on my friend's ass borrow ship or let's go and play
football et cetera so ballet hmm interesting one a lot of
people don't know that you did ballet and i but it sounds like you did at a pretty good level yeah i've done gymnastic gymnastics at
the london olympic games and they obviously i didn't notice there were scouts there from from ballet schools or someone was
watching our family and friend was there and they said ah he looks like he i don't know how what i
had or what i was my posture or something like that looks good to be a ballet dancer so i went there and i wasn't really one
for saying no to stuff i was like i'll try it i'll try anything and they said and one of the reasons i was going
to be able to get off my estate meet new people new girls maybe as a young kid
and then it was in a different part of london traveling so i've done it it's funny i read i read
a tweet the other day which was kind of linked to something you said there and it said on the way up say yes to everything
when you get to the top start saying no to everything yeah yeah and it sounds like yeah and it's like and i'm almost saying that as well when we the
conversation we're having now about like the stuff you're up to now now yeah like what is what's that i
always think this what's the worst way that can happen as long as it's not a health issue i might fail i might i might not be good
at it i might have foul who cares like with a boxing i wanted to go trying to be from a professional footballer just trying to
be a professional boxer crazy yeah but what's the worst that can really happen
i lose the fight my life goes on that's it so but some people they can't allow their
ego to be squashed maybe at a certain point or their pride and they're sitting there as this macho
person that they can't feel vulnerable at any point and when you try things there is an element of vulnerability
that comes with that because you're opening yourself up you're leaving yourself a bit wide open for criticism for failure but i'm not
scared of failure i never have been i'm not i'm not fearful and that's what i try and put in my kids if you fail what get up and go again
people like they they trap themselves in their career in their sense their sort of self-identity because we were talking before we started
chatting about like me trying to resist my labels now i've left social chain they think they are an x but from a very
very young age and i'm kind of connecting the dots now through the rest of your life and even now you worse you were a kid on the estate
in peckham and that is an identity that's not one that's also conducive with ballet no is that it's just such a different
end of the spectrum yeah like you just wouldn't associate one with the other and again i i wasn't we were speaking
just as you mentioned before before he came on here one of the things that i my mom used to
say to me is that don't let anyone tell you what you are don't be pigeon holed i mean you go and
find out and explore and find out what you are and you gotta have experiences to get to that point it's not gonna happen overnight it's not gonna happen in your
childhood not in your teens when you get to become an adult you'll start working your way and finding out who you are and what you
are and i've always thought that so going to a ballet school i could have been ridiculed my mates i was one of the boys on the
estate but at the same time i was confident enough that i really again ballet laughing i don't
care what and i know i'm good at football i know i'm good i'm the fastest runner on the estate in my age group
i can keep up with the older boys what because i go badly what there's nothing wrong who are you to answer that question you
know your mum's telling you to go out and find out who you are did you ever answer that question not really i think that question you don't
really answer it in the end i think you're always evolving it's like for instance it's something you said earlier it
pricked my ears about you said moles the same thing just in a different way probably a more elegant way about not
wanting to be pigeonholed and like my aim in my life now like people
think you've played football and you've done all these amazing things as a footballer i i've done really well i acknowledge
that but it's like understatement but i don't that's not enough for me like my next phase of my life i don't
want to be remember when someone sees me my success in my next phase of life is when someone sees me and says that's rio
do you know rio and they mentioned something that i'm doing or i've done around that time not that's rio's a footballer if people
were in 10 20 years say that's where i paid for my united i ain't really kicked on i haven't
really done what i'm i'm here to do to setting out to do which is to evolve and become something
different and make something of myself somewhere else and i think my my family were a lot like that whether my mum and dad was
successful or not they were always to us make something of yourself be something
nothing there's no there's no barriers to that so that's the way i've always kind of thought about things what if it what if
i said to you now how would you feel if i said you couldn't ever do anything else and that like the football thing was it and now
just i just laugh i'd laugh it would make me laugh because i i don't see no i don't see barriers yeah and
unfortunate as well by the way i understand that i've got to a position where there are a lot of boundaries that have been kind of put down
yeah yeah for me to skip over because of my career as a footballer yeah and you you're getting that now as
someone who's been really successful in your field so you see that color and age et cetera get
put to the side because i always we acknowledge what you've done yeah yeah yeah and so we do sometimes have a easy there's not as big a barrier
to entry for certain things for us but then you've still got to go in and produce you've still got to go and prove yourself and so even things that i've
i've gone on the board now for a company the gym group as a ned oh really yeah
which is it's out of my comfort zone because i like
fitness but i don't understand the business behind that and what goes into having actual having 125 180 sites
and managing that and there's a property arm and there's a commercial run and there's a market and that all coming together under one
umbrella and having to manage all that and to be a part of those conversations like that stuff is what excite i i'm super
interested in that type of stuff in the workings behind the mechanics of all these type of businesses different
different industries so that's what i like do you feel like you're depth
yeah but i always find something what i can clear on to that i just try and find something within a conversation that would
allow me to to to to gain confidence through talking in that conversation
i might not understand everything and when the conversation's finished and the laptop's closed i'll
i'll be somewhere looking and finding out i didn't understand that i'll call that person back or call someone on that on that call
just to clear up a few things i haven't quite grasped but there'll be something within that
conversation where i feel that i can add some sort of value i think all of that is a com is a very again very synonymous as to why you're
like even sat here today because a lot of people in that situation would a just [ __ ] avoid it from the jump
and then b if they encounter something they don't understand on the call they'll probably bounce then or
they definitely wouldn't inquire because by inquiring you're actually making yourself vulnerable yeah yeah a lot of people don't want to
avoid vulnerability right being exposed and it's so funny that the people that
from what i'm hearing from you like the people that achieve the most success are the ones that are at some point willing to look [ __ ] stupid yeah you
gotta do that like no one gets to where they're gonna get on the cleanest without a bump on the road yeah you
don't get like that you have to have bumps in the road to be able to get there to experience them vulnerable moments so that when you are
there you know what it's like and then you can drag people up with you yeah yeah and you become stronger with
more people that's how i always think there's a lot of people when i get to the top and stay on the top of the mountain on their own and don't want to bring no one
up i don't agree with that i'm always like i want to share and help and because that is the foundations of me being stronger
for a longer period of time and can sustain success but it is it is
i don't know it's another an important thing for me as well which i'm again i'm never scared to do is to ask
questions like it's the same thing with football you don't understand something my manager's telling you our coach is
telling you don't go away and and have a bit of a blurred
idea of what it is because then you're going to be judged on that not understanding and not executing it's
going to repeat exactly so you want good habits but you've got to understand what it is before you can create a habit
so that's why i'll try and always ask questions if i'm if i'm wrong if i feel i'm not sure and i'll definitely
ask questions not crazy you've achieved all the success you're a football legend and yet you're still
voluntarily throwing yourself into really uncomfortable situations which you don't need to be in yeah in terms of finance anyway like you
don't need to be at all in terms of like a status you don't need to be there and it's funny because
there's loads of people that aren't haven't achieved that that are that will never throw themselves into
uncertainty but it's it's but again this is probably why they're the ones that stay where they are yeah exactly that's probably
why you sat here yes they don't grow they don't yeah and like and all those people who will stay there some of them are like oh i just
want to stay here but a lot of them they're scared to open up because of that vulnerability and them feeling silly
if they're told that you got it wrong but it's not i i'm not like that everyone's on this
Culture of avoid discomfort
earth for different reasons and then some people happy just to be like stay in a situation they're in and
be very happy just going along that that road and no spikes or drops
i i'd rather have a drop at some point but to get i know that spike's gonna come somewhere through being able to do the things
we're talking about quick one starting from the minute the lockdown is lifted we're going to start bringing in some of our subscribers to
watch how this podcast is produced behind the scenes means you get to meet the guests meet myself and see how we put all of this
together if you want that to be you all you've got to do hit the subscribe button
in your in your group front group chat with your friends from uh from your estate i heard there's a group chat um you've been doing the research
i didn't need to research your career because i was there watching but just you know it was i was intrigued by when you said
you got this group chat with your your friends from back home and stuff and one of the topics of conversation is something that
i talk about a lot in this podcast which is there's a growing culture of like
softness there i say it and like avoiding discomfort and also there's this crazy thing on
instagram at the moment which is like demonizing hard work as if it's like because of the mental health
revolution we've had and everyone's which is a great thing and everyone's aware of the impact you know of this thing called mental
health there's now this other thing which is like well you can overwork and you can burn
yourself out and hard work if i advise as an entrepreneur even though i've never met someone or had anyone sit in the seat who didn't
work hard then i'm somewhat toxic because i'm telling people that's success and hard work yeah yeah and it's
like you're you're you're looking down on people yeah almost like and i listen i don't agree with none of that
i've got to be honest work hard man that should be just an absolute normal ask of any person and
that and that i always keep talking about my kids because they're a big part of my life but that's all i talk about my kids when they talk
to me about school football washing up you chill that's what's been one of the great things that
we've had a lot of negativity about the covid uh situation in this country staying at home etc at home schooling
and one of the great things to come out of it for us as a family these kids know their chores and they're
doing them properly and that's why i say do your choice right because them habits there will lead on to
other things in your life going forward your football stuff you won't take short short cuts you're taking shortcuts over your work shortcuts for your football
shortcuts make in your bed shortcuts with your school work homework et cetera it will all be the same you need high
standards everywhere but are you scared that because they've grown up within a different circumstance to what you had
well i always have you true this conversation what you're not going to say yeah like i'm trying to instill that in
in them how do you do that when they live that's like a really nice house and they've got that is
that is the guy who comes up with this the the the answers for that is the main man right because it's so
difficult i was doing a podcast yesterday with um eddie hearn oh yeah and he's like the
generation my children are so his father was well off successful and he was where my
children are now and he was saying like one of the things that he was he was scared of being that rich kid
yeah which i mean and so he done everything not to go out and work and to go and have a hard hard
hard-working mentality and to be a success himself our friend tomorrow is the same um
exactly so um all three of them by the way i like that all three of them come on your kids which i mean they are
exactly the same in terms of they've gone out to they never had to work their parents
would spoil them and they've all knuckled down and said yeah we've been given an opportunity
now you've got to go and execute and they've gone executed beyond belief yeah and i see mahmoud who's of boohoo
who's the father of omar and the guys and that's what i say to a man you must be so happy man
what do you mean your kids man what they're doing how hard they work created these wicked
How did they create high standards at Old Trafford?
businesses but you gave them opportunity but what they've done with that you can't you can't be disappointed
he said no man he said that for me to sit here and just see them what they're doing what they're doing that's where i want to be man
and it doesn't matter how much money you make or how big of a business business my success as a parent is that my kids
get up every day they got a work ethic and they do stuff to the best of their ability if they can
if they do that whether whatever job they're in they do that and i think you've done
you've laid the foundations for good a good life for your kids whether it's in
you know you talk there about having high standards been one of the really important things for your kids this is something that clearly you know
was demonstrated when you got to old trafford and you joined manchester united um with for that record transfer
but how did how did they create high standards at old trafford versus the other clubs you'd played at
what you know west ham and leeds etc what was it they were doing that kept those standards so high you
then also talk about going to qpr and seeing low standards and a certain type of negativity in the
changing room but what was it that they were doing or not doing because i want to create high standards in my team and within my
life so [Music] good habits right every day good habits
whether it's punctuality again work ethic attention to detail intensity
when you're training on a training pitch respecting each other but all those things just they come
together and it creates a culture at the club and i've been at west town
i've been at leeds two very good clubs great clubs um
but they they didn't have that that culture which meant there was ability to win but
it starts from somewhere so alex alex ferguson already won aberdeen so he he knew how to create that culture
he went to maine united didn't have that winning mentality at the time when he went there he created that and it all stems i
always think great leadership is definitely what gives you an opportunity to be successful and i i noticed that throughout my career and
when you've you've set the foundations and you've created that culture you don't as a as a leader have to be there every day
in that sense he was at a training ground every day how many times do you think he came into our change room no idea
you wouldn't fill one hand really no never came in a change room in the training ground we're there every
day because he he knew that the culture was set and then he had lieutenants like me giggsy gary neville etc who were
then filtering that down to any of the younger players on the new signs
who didn't know the culture yet and then then those players became the the culture leaders and so it was it was
crazy man and even for instance if he wasn't at the training ground watching training the training intensity might drop that
little one percent two percent but you'd notice it because the manager's not there because he wasn't in the building
because he wasn't he didn't you didn't feed him that aura that he could be on his phone making bets which he normally would be not
interested in training but his presence alone was enough and it just made when you look back and you think this leadership is just key
and we're talking about investing earlier yeah you know investing in the the leader the people yeah the people
like it's so important i think and i think every industry it's like that football's where i'm from and that's
what it's like there but i see what since i've retired that's replicated in other industries hundred percent isn't it funny as well
with culture because you're right what you said there is basically like what i've something i used to think of social change which is if a culture is strong
enough new people become like the culture if this culture is weak the culture becomes like the new people 100
yeah i mean you couldn't have put it any better and i'll give you an example like
and again i didn't i didn't say it as eloquently as that one husband football but
berbatov came to maine united oh yeah casual babs he was wicked player beautiful touch
sexy looking footballer wicked and before big champions league again my fingers barcelona
he just weren't working hard enough for the team and i need i had the ball on this side of the pitch and i needed him to come over
and help he's just walking that and i ended up just kicking the ball off and going crazy
will you do get over wait when i get over then we'll do it and that's again that's
not our culture at barcelona they play they wait that's their culture that's not our culture
you want to play barcelona away go barcelona here it's not the same and if you don't buy into our culture
you won't be here long and that's the way it was at united if you came and you weren't in the co you didn't buy into the culture
and immerse yourself in it and become part of the fabric of the place you weren't there more than a year or
two or you definitely wasn't an integral member of that squad and so it was definitely like you say
the culture is just you have to become part of that culture that you go into if it's strong enough
you see this in business it's crazy you should do i feel like the perspective you've got from being in that changing room and understand because this it's
the same principles in business it was the same at social chain and when we grew the company and i realized that
i had to be like did you drive that a hundred percent and my like it got to the point where
what you've described is people would understand who we were without us having to say and you'd have your disciples basically
introducing new people to the company and going that's not a social chain thing to do and we'd get that all the time you'd say your people in office
okay and for example and the crazy the other point i was going to say is when the culture's that strong you it's
so easy to see when someone doesn't fit well they don't stand out we had you know someone start on their first day at
social chain and they're doing their initiation and then they at the end of the initiation they did two middle fingers and then
walked back to their desk i said go get him we fired him he's gone first day at social chain and then the second the second instance where and it
sends a message to the team because they i never knew it was instinctive to me i said that's not the same person get them out there was
another instance where we had a girl join who someone had hired and they told me that she used to like bully people at
her last place and she had like a really bad attitude and stuff and actually one of the guys two of the guys in our team said oh yeah we used to work with her
and she was a bit of a bully so uh i i remember having the conversation and i said you can't
like in a very very nice way i said she she can't be here tomorrow because that's not who we are here and that my team were like but we need her
for this client we need her for this project i was uncompromising i said no we're not having her here i don't care if we lose the job you know
i can't i say to my team i can't have my name attached to a culture like where we have people in it
who are like that so she's gone today we'll figure it out if we lose the client whatever and and it wasn't until
years later that you hear the team come back to you and they say that moment where you you weren't willing to let that person be needed in the team because they
weren't right for the culture the team said that to me and that's exactly what i hear from you i'm not blowing to make up my own ass because i
didn't realize that you've recognised that it was it was it wasn't intentional it was i just
wanted to enjoy my life in the company to be a really really clear certain way and i felt that that's what we needed to
do to succeed and in hindsight and as you say it to me i'm like oh yeah it was being unnegotiable right yeah and
that's what cerex ferguson was great at if he saw something that was going to be detrimental to the culture of the club
it was out that was non-negotiable even if you needed them so you look at roy keane yeah he's the
captain was the leader the rule's been broken you're gone david beckham
peak of his powers going out of a spice girl bringing all sorts of eyeballs to the
football club making an international play see you later yap stam the best center
half in the world at the time said something about some of the players in a book or something goodbye
rude van isteroy the best number nine in the world at the time goodbye like if you don't
fit the culture and you don't adhere to the rules that are there good night and we'll move on and we'll
build around other people it's great it's like and where at the time you sit there and you think bex you
can't sell beck's man jesus who's going to come in like it's like number seven sells all the shirts like
everyone loves him everywhere we go bex is like beatles like crazy
same with rudra and history you're thinking how are we going to score goals now man who's gonna squash the goals rooney and and ronaldo are really young
still inexperienced but he had that belief and that vision just to like it was the culture over
everything that's a big club no one's bigger than the club it's so true man and again like you say that reverberates
around a dressing room right you better stay in line you better just like live by the rules that are
here already and stay part of that culture the hard work the intensity the respect and so that you
he would dig out the most experienced player who hasn't even done anything and you'd sit there and go what like
what are you shouting me for but he was doing that to you because he knew you could take it but the effect that i have
on the young ones or the other ones which i mean so playing the mind games man i love it it's good but you only
it's the mad thing is anyone you're in it like you're saying you're talking about social change you probably didn't realize at the time
but when you sit back and you're outside and you look back in that bubble you think
[ __ ] man yeah that's why i didn't think about it but that's why i've done it
yeah he's right yeah and i'm right now or i'm wrong whatever it is i mean that's how we think about like
certain things that fergie done you think actually he weren't just lucky man he actually obviously was
plotting and planning that type of stuff i am i wonder how much of that stuff was
intentional with him though in terms of like he i'm sure he wasn't going in the back room and planning it it's just like
surely it's just like who he was and i sometimes think you know you get managers that will come into clubs and they'll try and be like fergie
but you can't because you can't act for that long and that consistently because from what you're saying about fergie it's like it's not like four
things he's doing it's a thousand things he's doing consistently which show his values right and you can't act for 27 years
whatever it is across a thousand touch points so it makes me feel like how do you teach that like it was it
wasn't phil almost was like it wasn't just instinctive to fergie yeah i think it was instinctive he was he's that's just him and don't forget
his experience as well would have played a big part in that he was at the club for like 26 or so years 27 years so that's there's a
valuable amount of experience gained in that time but i always look at it like when i went into the main united change room i sat
there and just looked around and thought who's good at what and let me just take elements of
these people and add it to my my game and my preparation and my recovery and that's
what i've done ryan giggs was great at recovery and preparation done yoga and stuff like that took that out of these
of his book roy keane leadership the way he demanded standards on a daily basis skulls these
best levels in training every day like all them think i was just trying to try to be like little peop parts of
different people and then that allows hopefully for you to grow into a better person a better player etc
Sir Alex Ferguson
and i think that's the same with with other industries and business since i've retired it's like
you go in and try and be like someone else you're gonna fail because you can't be like the original but if you're
taking bits from elsewhere you might be able to get beyond that what you see as the best because you're getting more you're taking more good
things from that person but then from various other people to build maybe past that and that's the way i try and
work with stuff now in my life there's no one person i'm going to make that's going to make me the best at what i want to be but a
group and taken from everywhere i've got a better chance people never talk about the things that fergie was bad at well roy keane does
but other than that i never hear people saying and i've got his book somewhere knocking around as well but you never hear players talking about
some of the things where you think you know i actually think he would have gone been more successful if he didn't do that thing
do you know if it's weird when people die or when people retire yeah you only remember the good stuff
really interesting you only think about what they their their existence before becomes
magnified and you they're built up even bigger sometimes and fergie i think that's with him as
well because you just don't you don't think i can think of instances or or tactics you've got wrong
that's easy to find but but he'd always make stuff right it was weird like um
even for instance the anti-racism stuff and the situation was only sort of documenting my brother yeah yeah yeah so
he went to a couple awards actually yesterday as well yeah so he um
the situation happened with him and john terry and i decided not to wear the next or
one of during that period once a year all the teams are given t-shirts show races and the red card or
kick racism out one of the campaigns i wasn't willing to wear it because i didn't believe that they
supported enough in the durian that's that time so i said i'm not wearing it he went crazy find me i was like
we end up winning the game which was okay was lucky but the next day i went into his office to just try and
explain to him why i hadn't won the t-shirt and to be fair he said you
know what i understand and i'm sorry for the way i reacted but like stuff like that he might make a
mistake or he'd done that wrong but he'd always rectify it always come back around you get you back around somehow
and because he was just like a i don't know he just he knew how to deal with people he knew
how to treat people to get the best out of him for what he's main goal was
how'd you teach that i don't know man that's just i think that's something that's inside being able to deal with people read
people treat your team do i mean so that they're running through brick walls for you because you
come in a room and he'd say to you you're not playing and i'd be you'd want to scream and you'd be like blood would be boiling
but you'd leave the room and you're going to change room and you're sitting in there gene
everyone up come on boys not sulking because he's told you tuesday you're playing because i need you for that game
you missed this one this is a big game but you're going to play on tuesday like normally you miss a game you you
want to go home and cry about it i mean but he's managed to build you back up and that's my management
and in any industry that's that's like a massive part of again the culture but maintaining
sustaining a successful company of a successful football club you need to be able to build people pick
them up knock them down sometimes but be able to keep them on that track with you the contradiction i hear with within
like the story you recount of sir alex versus the one i see in the newspapers is you hear about the you know kicking the football boot at beckham and this
guy who on this who on the sidelines looks like he's out of control but what you're describing
is like super self-aware yeah calculated and he's actually pretending to be out of control when he needs to be we used to talk about all
the time sashimi and emmanuel vidic and veda is a deep guy loves talking
about deep style gets deep into stuff yeah he loves it like it's just a matter he just loves like to
be on behind well how is he thinking about that etc just always talk about the manager and
like you look back and say anything everything he done was like calculated like
the way he spoke on the tv blaming the ref so very rarely did he come on he didn't
come on tv and ever hammer none of the players individually we could lose a game and the referee
would be the [ __ ] the back page the next day but he's taking the heat of us he's
making us think about it's not us we're not down in the doldrums it's because of the referee that's dangerous
sometimes you've got ideas about yourself accountability but he makes there's enough self accountability in the
building but also the focus is over there now not on us as a team so we go again
without that pressure oh they've lost they're not as good anymore but the referee was a reason so i mean
just like that's just like calculated this is what i'm doing for the goodness of my team and the betterment of my team
is good man but people think anger and like you were a player that wasn't wasn't afraid to shout someone i heard you talking about
some of the players you gave a hard time like anderson et cetera what what is still yeah in the what's
that group yeah really yeah what role does anger play in leadership then because you see it in football
but if if i were to start screaming at people in the same way that you did to i don't know berber
or whatever imagine if i just [ __ ] kicked this table and said what the [ __ ] the camera is not working i would be i'd
be cancelled everyone would walk out yeah i talk about this with my missus quite a lot now we like
some of the stuff that we are when we're talking about memories and whatnot and how we spoke to someone so or what's happening in the change room
would never happen in the office because it's like you say it's like that that relationship's over it's gone too far whereas you could have
a fight at football and then you're shaking hands and having a laugh in the shower after it's so different it's just a different
way of of working but i think it's understanding people i don't think you treat any two people the
same in that sense like the blanket treatment i don't think is the best way to treat a
team because everyone's different everyone takes advice differently everyone takes criticism differently so you've got to be able to
pick the right people to be able to shout out to pick the right people you've got to get an arm around and and that's about as again a manager
a captain knowing that team knowing that play that the players individually all this coming into work and ghosting
everybody is mad i don't get it i don't think you can create that environment for success if you're going to come in
and not know nobody and that's another one of these so alex's great traits is that he knew
everything about everyone like if you're you're my granddad i was in hospital once met my granddad
probably twice in the uh players lounge after a game knew my granddad's favorite drink brandy
the flower was turned up on my mom's house which i mean it's like that stuff there then people are coming
to work for you every day after stuff like that it's little things little details not any time out of your
diary really his pa probably done it all yeah but his name's at the bottom it's like big it's little
little percentages like that are just a key it's funny because those little gestures help help you know
that he does care about you regardless of what happens on the training ground or in the match fundamentally he cares about you and wants you to do well and he's
you know what i mean you're not enemies you are in so i think by him saying that's the foundation it's
clear that having that as a foundation allows him to put pressure on in the right places it seems
yeah and he and you're not his mate yeah ever well really no you're not you're not he's mate i speak to him more now than i did when i played
really because there was that line and that he felt was always needed to be there that we can have a little laugh
here and there but in the end of the day i'm the manager you guys do your thing there and have a
laugh etc but then there's that line you don't go past so but you just got it right and i think
that's down to experience as well he would have learned that and a lot of the guys so you say he was he was even
crazier before you guys came when he was younger so he's obviously work and he worked out as well did the new
generation of player couldn't take that
anger and that craziness like the old generation like probably my
generation probably the last generation that he could do that with the next ones the younger ones the andersons the nannies the ronaldo's etc
that's not the way that they would they would they don't respond as well to that type of
criticism and anger and aggressiveness what was that anguish you ever saw him
too many times not too many times the times when he kicked the boot at bex's head was it was a and you're in that crazy one yeah that
was crazy what happened wouldn't it be great if we could make looking after yourself your nutrition
and your health cool again and i think this is ultimately what hule has done in my life and as i reflect on the last couple of
years that huel has been the easiest way for me to become a better human and for
me being a better human meant having better health it meant better having mental health more energy being more focused in my
work and that's exactly what you've done for me i hope we can make being healthier cool especially as we emerge from this
lockdown where we've all realized how important and foundational health is and i think here's a great way to do
that try it out give it a go everyone that has you know get lots of photos on instagram and twitter of people that have tried your
and started their huel journey brings a little bit of joy to my heart because not only have you um are you a listener of the
podcast but also because i know that you're on a journey to make your your life and your health a lot better and that if you know think about all the
sponsors i could have had to have a sponsor that i genuinely believe can help you change your life is a privilege um that i'm glad to know
what was that angriest you ever saw him too many times not too many times the
times when he kicked the boot at bex's head was a and you're in that crazy one yeah that was crazy what happened
it was uh it was mad it was it was funny man it was actually funny i gotta be honest i can't lie
but the manager was he kicked the boot in anger because he asked bex to do something tactically that he didn't carry out
and he booted and listen anybody i don't care what ronaldo's playing today on messi wouldn't have hit the target the way hit
the target it was it was so clean and the ball went in slow-mo like bang
and it hit him in the head and then obviously beck scott was upset got up and i remember the gaffer was devastated you
could tell he could see when he looked at him he sat down he was just slumped almost like he that's not what he'd done he
kicked the boot for he kicked it in anger and it accidentally hit backs in the head so he looked devastated of it but
that was one that was i had a few scrapes of him in terms of i didn't agree with things that he'd
Manchester United now
done a couple of times and i was screaming and he didn't he didn't take too well to it and he lost it and he just would go purple
over the top of you and just spray you screaming in front of you like that like
crazy so but he was uh what it was it was never personal which is that why you
respected it and you kind of it kind of it kind of always was washed away because
he you knew that deep down he wanted just want you to do well i mean it wasn't vindictive it wasn't
personal just do what i'm telling you to do you will win i heard you say that that
culture isn't there now it's it's all friendly now on it everyone's mates everyone's like for
instance everyone's mates and commenting on each other's posts on social media
so you're more attached to someone you're more involved with someone
whereas before i would only see certain players twice a year home and away so i've got no attachment
to you so for to me have a bit of venom or to go at you a little bit was normal and i've got
no qualms about doing that because i ain't going to see you again don't care i might see you at england camp or
something like that but i don't i slack three or four times a year so we're colleagues exactly
we're not really matey whereas now in the tunnel they're all shaking cuddling yeah man comment on your post you have a
day it's very different i'm not saying it's bad but it's just different is it bad so i don't know it's just like it's it's
different so going into into battle into a game i've got no emotional ties or no social
media ties to anybody so i can there seemed to be that bit
more it i don't know if there's more passion before to now but it seemed to be like
there was yeah because i think all of this stuff is social media makes it a bit more fluffy
and people are hugging and shaking hands and whatnot now because they've spoken or had a
message or liked a post very different me my my friends at my manchester united chat when uh
one of the observations that we have all the time is like why is why is everyone been so nice to each other and you i remember last week there was a
tweet went out from one of the united um press people and it was just a quote something harry mcguire had said
on the field and he basically screamed i don't know someone else yeah i need to like get [ __ ] back in line or whatever
it's like trending on twitter yeah yeah because i don't see it because you don't see it anymore and then and then also i you know love
him love him or whatever but watching uh ollie fist bump the managers with a smile on his face
we've been grown up as united fans with us we would fergie would look [ __ ] furious to
even have to look at the opposing manager and and it just feels different now and then we look at where
we are and how we're performing in the big games and we're not winning like we used to and we're all saying oh that you know we're coming like arsenal or something
but we everyone always like clings on to the history in it and that's that's the problem as a football
fan i'm the same like you just want it to be like it was before please right but it's never going to be
the same it may be a successful or even more successful one day but it will never be the same
so our expectation then we'll sometimes just have to change a little bit but
yeah i mean again like it was coming in anyway because like for instance i remember joe rpk hugging
and fist pumping et cetera in the tunnel with fabregas and we were mad rivals we've asked on
that point like pizzagate and all that stuff and he got hammered after that pk in our change room are you doing
before a game you're sitting in a chat a lot or or without make fun of him a little bit there's two different ways you
ridicule and get someone in line either humor or being firm and you probably got both but it was it
was that was a you could sense a change coming it was coming and obviously social media i think has accelerated that definitely
ed woodward as well there's a lot of controversy surrounding him at the moment again because for better for work
no not yet no yeah when the when uh when we can travel a little bit more
we'll uh i think he'll he'll come on but um i remember hearing the story about the exit treatment that you had with him
and i wondered if you were still somewhat bitter about that i heard you know one of your last games at the club and he comes into the training room and
tells you that you're you're not going to be playing for the club anymore you didn't get your send off yeah of course i think there's no
there's nothing that anyone could tell me that wouldn't make me feel that was the wrong way
would fergie have done that no thank you zero no you'd have told me before the end of the season because you know what it mean but
the difference is that fergie was a footballer and he knows what it means he knows what it is
to be able to say thank you for your support etc just have that little runway to ascend
off now listen i understand not everybody can have it that way but if you've got if you know and you've got the opportunity to give someone the best
possible route out of a situation you give it to them and my situation i think it was you could see down the line
from month a month two months before that that you knew what was gonna happen with me so give me the opportunity to have the
best possible send off given the time given the relationship that i built with the club so that was my my only discrepancy of
the whole way it worked out because it wasn't like oh actually a knee-jerk situation knee-jerk decision so but i
think listen ed knows how i feel about it but we've moved on past that i'll speak to him on
the phone about various different things anywhere we meet up sometimes so it's cool but those small moments that's an
isolated incident but that's that isolated incident is attached to a wider philosophy
in the same way that fergie had this like wider philosophy of like you know sending your your granddad the the flowers and that's
a tattoo wider philosophy so although that's just one instance i think the risk that i would see and when i hear things like that i think
well that same philosophy of like not really caring being that empathetic
has got to be popping up in other places right like oh 100 and that again we've said culture about
10 times already in this conversation yeah but that's that's
Manchester United then
part of a culture yeah like there has to be like you say compassion
empathy respect as a family right like that's what the club was and that was the way i used to explain
man united i left leeds which was like a family a small i say this is a smaller version
without obviously the success but a smaller version in terms of the people here been here for 30 years 40 years 20 years
my dad used to work here my mom used to work here that's a family club man united was that when i was there
my fear is that it becomes something else some of the waiting stuff i had a box at my united mm-hmm
and it's funny this is a staggering thing but for me because you don't think of you know the waiting staff in the box are gonna
notice a cultural shift at the club right but they would tell me they they said to me you know when fergie and
david gill were here it was different how did it touch the waiting staff that served me because
they know all their names yes that's what they said to me they know all their names they had a relationship david gilman had
a relationship with the the person giving me a steak and it and i just thought that was staggering that this you know
anything like how strong the culture must be and how important it must be for the waiter giving me you know some chips to be like
it's different now the dinner lady at the training ground i actually spoke to her on the way here funny that's just me a voice note but it didn't lady carroll
she could have been with director manager or david gill like first name terms
banter that had been spread over a number of years so they could go back and have a proper back and forth he knew the name of the
groundsman but it was like and and if if if i'm at man united now that is part
where i'm going that that has to be recreated bring that back
because that's a strength like i said before about strength in numbers that's the foundation of the football club people come in that place and think
oh my god they're all made united here they're all feel part of it that that creates does that start with
fergie and david at the top yeah i think it has to and that's why i look back on things like that and like
you you speak to any of the people that work there that was a big part of it because everyone thinks
it's the is the first eleven the the team the squad the first team that play
that's the main united it's not it's the fans and it's all the people that work behind
the scenes to enable that first level and that team that squad to go out there and perform if there's people out around that aren't
working that's what the manager used to say all these people the kit man the physio nutritionist the dinner lady etc these
lot help you enable you to be successful so don't forget that i mean and all
those people have an expectation of the performance and like the they all become winners like as a united fan growing up
i was like we win yeah 100 and and you know as a fan i was like you know we come and we win and then at some point when
fergie left i'm like i'm not sure really what happens sometimes yeah yeah and you know that crazy thing fergie had in the last
couple of minutes of every game where you thought we're gonna [ __ ] win this there's only two minutes left but somehow but you know like the things
i just mentioned there about the club as well that does that is a byproduct of success as well it that becomes easier
it's like a self-fulfilling yeah right exactly when you're winning it's like everything when you're successful and you're winning everything's kind of run smoothly
doesn't it yeah and then obviously when things start to go a little bit wrong you see so many more bumps in a row so many more
splinter groups come out and start pointing the finger etc so i just think that it's keeping it
getting that culture right and getting the people who feel part of the club and then you win with that as well there's no better
kind of then you've got to defend it right you've got to defend the culture again because the culture is the thing that made you win yeah and so you might get some big
people getting too big for their boots or whatever or distracted and then fergie's just got this great reputation of bit defending that culture
as the most important thing and are you that's people say why did he win how did he win for 20 odd years no one else has
managed to do that in the modern era and it's just that but it's it's i
always put it down to as well things like dedication desire but he was always the first in a training ground
i tried to try and beat him to get a training ground sometimes take my kids to school and get there like we used to start like half nine you have
to be in a half nine i used to get in sometimes at eight o'clock and these cars there already
last to leave most of the time uh yes that's again that goes back to the point of saying about
showing your kids rather than telling them be early be it just be there you're there then they
know he's always there you can't be late why are you late the manager says he's been 26 years
and he's early every day and you're not he's obviously prepping like you don't
do your prep work in the gym why i remember i keem pulled a meeting called a meeting because he thought the young players weren't
doing the extras and why are you going home before an ex that experienced player there that
we said to them yeah when you're you're in the start of the ladder what's we called an actual meeting yeah so that he just said to the lads
listen guys like after training all coming in or before training all come in a change room and everyone sat down and he's like
listen i've got to say it because i'm seeing it every day and it ain't good for the club some of you young boys i'm seeing you
and some even the older the players are a little bit older than that but how can you be going home before him
he's doing extras working outside or he goes in the gym or before training i see sansa doing that and you're just messing about in
in the uh canteen or something like that it's valuable time don't miss it short career things like that but that's
again the manager allowing people to manage a change room and that's how it was there you had people that managed to change
room and you had the manager that oversaw it all what was the difference between some players that arrive at manchester united
and ultimately end up reaching their potential and then some that don't and there's been a lot of you know well written about players that
never reached their potential is was there a commonality that you saw that made it because i'm like gary
neville i'm like he wasn't the most i like the guy he's actually managed me once in this charity game
like the guy but he didn't strike me as the most naturally talented player at work but he
felt yeah and then work dedication attention to detail application on a daily basis like this
is the thing a lot of people think i've worked hard for two weeks and i've got i haven't i haven't got any rewards out of it the manager's still not playing me i'll
give up no that's got to be we're talking before a lifestyle hard work every day is a
lifestyle that should be like the standard that's the standard that is here
and you've got to be at that every day there's none of this taking your foot off the pedal because it's difficult carlos carroll
What were your faults?
said to me you can't just switch it on and off like that mentality that intensity the
dedication the hard work on a daily but you can't just go i work hard on monday to wednesday thursday friday i'll just chill and then
saturday switch it on again habits lifestyle all the time like that so when
it comes to match time it's not a big shift because your body can't do it that your mind can't deal with that if it's
normalized this is normal on a saturday three o'clock sixty thousand people screaming 100 million people around the world
that's not pressure do this every day one of the like alienating things when people might hear you talk and they think oh well
almost intimidating it's like well rio's mentality is just so [ __ ] like disciplined and you know
he's got it now and i did listen i weren't perfect this is what i was gonna ask tell me about tell me how you weren't perfect yeah i went
perfect it took me a long time to start understanding like your body understanding your mindset and my state of mind had to be
a tip-top condition both mentally and physically on a game day and west ham i didn't have it
leads i didn't have it because i was inconsistent i was really i trained hard but then i'd
be going out every every other night i'd go out four or five times a week parties pissed like west ham i don't remember a
lot of results or certain things when people say what about that game when you i actually can't remember i was that i
used to be out and get pissed so often and then i got to maintain and i just was surrounded by people that had won
and i was desperate to win so what do you do to win i'm gonna copy of him him him like we spoke about
before and then you become part of that and then you realize that none of these
lot are going out all the time so if i'm gonna go out and continue that lifestyle i had before
my levels are obviously always going to be a bit below these guys because you can't sustain that you're always working from
a less from a lower standpoint so i changed that and listen i still made mistakes but my
intentions and my desire was to always be as good as i could be i wanted to be better than
veda vidic john terry sol campbell i need to be the best when people talk about the
best center back i need to be the first name on their lips so what what can i do i was not obsessed with it
you know i mean and why the lads wouldn't have probably known how
obsessed i was with it because i would never show that really but inside
the thought that someone thought that someone else is a better center back than me used to like it would eat away at me why
You and Vidic
because i just pride ego we all got egos you want to be the best
and i was never ashamed myself to be to feel like that i'll say that that i didn't say it at the time because it
etiquette it's not the thing to do in american sports they do it they talk like that because i wish we was more because naturally i'm that type of
person i would say it i think i'm the best on it so i don't care that i would say now i thought i was the best centerback
but i was always i just wanted to be the best whether i was or not it's for other people to decide but i
was that was my always my intention you and vidic partnership a lot of my
friends at the moment that's where i've been i'm a big fan of harry maguire and uh what he does mainly because i from what i hear he's
one of the only leaders in the back line like you know always shouting what was it that made you and vidic so successful
as a partnership because my friends they'll do anything to have you guys back what was it about you two because you're
known as in my opinion the best centre-back partnership we've ever had that's why i'm here because i knew you'd say that i
appreciate that man don't know man
he had attributes that just complimented mine and vice versa
he was a he wanted to go and attack every ball okay when the ball got kicked in the skies
he just saw one thing and that was the ball and he was better at that than me okay
but i read stuff and would clean up around all of that and was more of i don't know i read the game
probably a little bit different to him and but at the same time i was capable of going up and winning the ball and then
he'd do that with me whether he was as good at me at cleaning up on that for other people to decide but like
i i don't know it was just we just compliment each other and what it was there was a pride about our defendant us too so you see a lot of
people it's like me i'm the best i want to be the best which is true but the overriding factor of me
wanting to be the best is that we don't concede and we're a partnership i'm going to be i've got your back and
that's what you just say before a game video you go up i'm behind you don't worry when i got you're behind me yeah
that's all it was all the time you challenge i'm behind you don't worry just go for the ball go for the man take the man and the ball
i'm here if it goes wrong and is that having that sense of security for each other there was a chant of vidiq's chat about
him being a bit of a murderer yeah yeah crazy how did he how did he feel about that and like yeah he's quite an
unassuming guy he's really like he's not really taken or by anything right did they say that
about me oh cool it's good not bad not bad and then carries on with laughs like he's really just
Mental health - your documentary
chilled man he's so different to what he's like if he's just a chill guy he's intense guy to be fair intense
and some players may have found him at times quite moody at times and just really like in with what he's doing
because he's so intense and he would really like to think about a lot of stuff and probably overthink
certain situations but i got on really well with him he's one of my my closest guys at maine united when i
was there from now yeah i talked to him now on the texts and stuff he's living in milan at the moment yeah one of the things that um has
happened since your playing days is there's been a huge rise in the conversation around mental health wasn't a conversation back then really
um even even for me growing up that didn't know what it meant i'll be completely honest i thought mental health was
um someone goes crazy psychiatrist yeah yeah just a stray jacket or something that's what i we always thought it was
that's all the depiction of someone that's lost their mind and um we've come to learn about it in a
much different way now we view it as a sort of intrinsic part of health but everyone has mental health and it it can sit on some
kind of spectrum right based on what happens um i was wondering back then like the players in that
dressing room they had mental health and they had mental health issues and stuff then but i'm guessing it was never addressed it
was never talked about or i i've done a documentary on bbc about
like grief and bereavement and stuff and obviously mental health is a huge part of that
and i got to understand mental health through that journey of making a documentary
and understanding that when i played again mental health was not a thing at
all and it was never considered there was no compassion and if you acknowledged your
mental health and started to talk about it as i have problems or an issue he was then seen as a weak link
whether it was spoke about or not he was there that would be the case that would be how you see that whole situation and so no one then talks about it
through fear of being called the weak link um and i look back now and think yeah
definitely if we had been more open enough we had today's thought process about mental health
would have got more out of certain players definitely really um yeah because louis sahar for instance
what a player yeah unbelievable footballer had injuries but along with the injuries that brought
a mental health problem for him and like a bit depressed and down and
whatnot because he felt was letting everyone down that's what you feel when you're injured you feel you're letting your teammates down and it's hard to
deal with sometimes especially if you just keep getting little injuries and you come back you go again you come back and people start always always injured
mentally is not strong is he don't fancy it and you as a player you know them conversations are going on so you start
thinking about that and when people see you think he's always he's doubts me anyway and so that mental warfare that goes on
it could be sorted out through conversation not acknowledging certain things but you're
taught in a macho dressing room that talking is seen as a weakness back then i think there's big changes now like you
say the narrative now is very different so you'd like to think it's changing and clubs are more aware of that
i am i remember watching that documentary remember i think i remember where i was when i watched it because
it really really hit me um and like there's i don't watch a lot of tv but also i am
uh it's quite hard to make something impact me but because you were so vulnerable as someone that i you know grew up
watching as a kid and you were able to to be emotional it it yeah it really it hits it hits you
in a completely different way tell me about your thought process why you wanted to do that because i'm betting it wasn't easy right
no it was it was it was crazy it was hard man but it was it was mainly for my kids if i'm honest
and for everyone else because i wanted my obviously my kids lost they lost their
mum so again it's like most about the same point you can't just keep telling them
sometimes it'd be nice to have something you can just show them and that speaks for itself and it's visual as well and so they get
a clear idea of where we're all at where we was at and how we've got to this point of hopefully
a little bit of healing and on that journey we realized actually we're going to help
a lot of people here so many more than just selfishly our own family
so it became like a real real i'm a positive journey for us in
that sense of of working out what it means to talk to communicate your feelings how much
benefit that is to you as an individual but also other people um working on relationships and how
it can change your relationship when you are talking and and so again it was a difficult
journey because you've got to open up like you say show that vulnerable side to you and and again that's probably again what
that's how we started the conversation i wasn't scared to do that it was a difficult situation but i
weren't scared of doing that because i knew at the end of the day my kids are going to benefit from this and whatever that
however this journey goes i'm willing to to be a part of it for that for that one reason
and then when it was when it when it was um finished and we when i bathed her in
the environment great part of it is that you walk down the street or you go down
the island sainsbury's or where tesco wherever it is and an old age lady or a man come up to you
you know what the tear in the eye or something like that and the throat's all croaky and i watched your program i've
never spoken before really you helped me that stuff that's the the reward that you get from something like
that that i didn't anticipate and you one of the things you you said
when i was you know hearing you talk about mental health and really the i guess the crux of the documentary is that the healing comes
from opening up and communicating um and in fact you might never get over
what happened and you don't necessarily need to but it's like when you take it out from the the closet in the back you know back
part of your mind because you were talking about compartmentalizing it yeah a lot and that was how you you were handling it at first and you
know i think a lot of the data shows that when you try and compartmentalize grief or never
but it comes at you in other ways right and it jumps in yeah you get bad habits you you fall into
holes that you never knew were ever possible to go down and then to get back out of them is it
becomes it like almost an impossible journey so it was it was and that's how i probably
would have been with a lot of stuff in my life before you just compartmentalize it you put it over there you don't think about it but you've never dealt with it
you've never got that situation out and unpacked it and then used it to bring some sort of
positivity to your life people don't want to open it though no because it's scary yeah vulnerable and today i'd rather just get through
today then unpack that stuff yeah and have to go through that stuff i have to go through them feelings their
emotions have to have that hurt a little bit again but i've we've said it to the kids all the time
like like sometimes crying is such a a relief sometimes and the weight of it
that goes off your shoulder sometimes when you you do release that emotion is like it's crazy
Techniques to help with mental health
you can't really put it into words what it feels like at times that you've had that then moments where
you felt really down or you're missing someone and then you have a little bit of emotional time on your own or with
friends or with family or whatever it is and then you there's a smile immediately comes sometimes out of the back of it
because you feel actually i actually feel better now i knew that you move on you carry on with your day but
it is it's a that type of situation that we've kind of been through it's never gone but you learn how to
deal with things that bit better all the time what are some of the sort of techniques you use to try when you do
feel down or you feel like you know there's something bugging playing on your mind and stuff and you might be getting anxious about something is there
anything that you've learned from your experiences that helps you um in those moments
like outside of talking or strategies or is there one of the things that i was um i've
started doing this that might sound really strange is when i so what will happen with me is something will be playing on my mind and
i try and tell myself how you can deal with that you're fine whatever and then three hours later in the shower and you're still thinking
about it and i know that it's gonna harm me if i don't like address it so i will literally that sounds like [ __ ]
bunkers first time i've ever said this i literally say it out loud and i have this like weird conversation with myself where i say steve like
you're feeling us go literally you're feeling like this because of this and this and yeah it's making you feel a bit like
you know it's making you feel a bit bad at the moment or whatever um but but then i try and reason with
myself as if i'm talking to someone else and it has really helped me um it's but it makes me feel like a nutter
yeah i understand what you're saying but you know unfortunately i've got an unbelievable
wife who i can talk to like communication is a massive part and where i've improved in my life hundred percent so i
that conversation you're having there i'll have with my wife and i'm lucky how she helped you with
that oh massively i don't probably tell her enough but like what she's brought to my life
in terms of being able to open up to communicate not only with her but with my kids now i speak to my kids
in a different way now in terms of because i know communicating and letting them show their feelings
trying to just always if there's a situation that's prince's mother's day just come obviously my house is quite i said my
mum passed away and the babies their mum passed away as well so mother's day is and then kate's a new
mum so there's so many dynamics in the house and that one day the emotional
kind of energy in the house on that day is like through the roof and so to manage that and to
make it a a day where everybody's enjoying it and happy and celebrating mother's day is that's a
task in itself but talking to the kids we had a conversation on mother's day at the
table was eating food and stuff and it was like um my little boy was like oh like
i said to him like you don't post anything on on mother's day do you and he's not an emotional poster anyway
he just posts about what he likes like football and stuff and and whatever so he's like yeah i was
actually thinking of doing it this this um this mother's day but like obviously because like
i wasn't sure what to what to do like with kate and mum so i didn't know what to do and it was like hate almost like off you started crying
really because like i don't want you to feel like that post what you feel don't worry about no one else just post what you feel because no one
can tell you what you feel and you're not going to disappoint anybody do what you feel
which i mean and it's like those conversations i would never have had with my kids before because i just wasn't i wasn't in
that in that in that zone i was always very like again compartmentalized very closed closed but
emotionally zero coming out really like but that was condition because my dad was like that
all right so and we talk about that in the dark as well like my dad was very very he wasn't open with his feelings really
and old school very old school west indian man so that follows through generations so
see talking is and communicating with with the kids and kate and she's the one who's really brought that
since i've met her in that sense and i i'd never be able to thank her enough for that just that one element let alone the
other stuff that she's brought to the table you just you don't you don't talk to her and you think you might not talk to her enough though
i don't tell her enough maybe how would you how um i'll tell everyone else like all my mates know that she's been unbelievable
for us she's like oh you don't tell her i probably don't tell her enough sometimes right and that would sometimes have
conversations and she and i'll go yeah but i told someone so like you was like you done this oh
Relationship advice
you told them before me right which is crazy really isn't it you should really just tell that person
why don't you i don't know it's the old me still about really probably yeah yeah
probably the old me still about i don't know and sometimes a bit like shy not shall i be embarrassed maybe i don't
know to say that yeah but it's yeah i should i will
i will i'll send you the clip you can just let the clip get it she'll see this on it she's going
why didn't you just tell me like yeah that's true that's incredible um as a guy that's single me mm-hmm and has
struggled for very thinking [Music] yeah no not you so yeah as a guy that's single and struggled
over the years to to get into a relationship because i've been busy well this is what the [ __ ] i tell myself is commitment issues is it well well my
parents so there's there's a slight issue from my childhood where like my mum and dad used to scream each other all the time so i just learned that relationships were like prison because
my dad would sit there passively my mum's screaming in his face and i would i just learned that as a man
when you get a relationship you're in prison and your freedom's gone and i'm so i'm someone that alec really doesn't want to give up my
freedom and whenever i get close to that commitment i feel the fear which comes clearly comes from my
childhood but what are the things that you you know as a guy that is super successful over the last you know a couple of decades
and now he's running businesses and chasing a bunch of other ambitions that you have what are some of the things
you've learned about how to have a successful relationship as a busy guy one of them's communication i
guess but yeah communication but i think time management is massive as well really and yeah yeah time management like and
kate's helped with that as well like managing your diary like i'm busy i've got a lot of stuff running out that i enjoy and i'm one of them passionate
about which is key but i'm as passionate if not more about my family as well
so managing that diary to make sure you've got quality time and you've got enough time with your family but also you know you're going to work is so
key but also the time when you're there be there okay i mean i speak to a lot of guys who
are managers a lot my friends are managers now and that's why i'll never go into management i don't think because
as a football manager you have to be you have to live it breathe it every minute like
that's the same in business but is it i don't know if with football i just find there's a different it's quite different that we're talking
about the way that people talk to each other at football it's different to an office there's elements that are probably different as manager i feel but
as a football manager you're at home you're having sunday dinner with your family but you're not there
yeah you're thinking about logistics you're thinking about the nutritionist does he sort things out
with the players that players are gonna be fit this week or not and he didn't fit that player just got injured at a week
and i can't believe it's thinking about how am i going to replace him for what formation am i going to play the other team have got a formation they
What do you want to be remembered for
played different at the weekend i need to watch that video i need to watch that for that 90 minutes they played two games last week different i
gotta watch them games as well that's without thinking about like doing your team talk and doing
your tactics on a training pitch and setting up your training sessions for the week without thinking about any and so when
you're at home you're not home you're not there really you're physically there but mentally you're not there you might as well not
be there so i never i never wanted to get in that position especially given what we've been through so
um i definitely i just kind of wrote that off as being something i'll do because of that reason
and we were talking again before we start recording about your real deep uh desire to make sure that
football isn't the thing that you're you become known for right and i uh i i find that that fascinating but like
um it's a big mountain to climb right like to get known for some of the things you're doing now you're heavily involved
in business you're investing you've got five uh what are these what we talked about focus as well at the start of your
journey deciding that it wasn't going to be gymnastics it wasn't going to be bad you know ballet it was going to be football yeah what is it now so that's what i mean that situation
that scenario is almost replicating itself now i'm in that space right now so when my dad said to me what do you want to do
make a choice i've retired and the last four or five years i've been working out what i'm going to do
i'm trying this i'm trying that i'm not scared to try this i'm not going to try that if it doesn't work it doesn't work but then i know i'm not i'm not that's not
for me and i'm kind of getting to a place now where i'm starting to drill down and focus on a
couple of different spheres what are they saying to go down so the the the five youtube channel yeah
and creating that football hub that football place to be
my foundation which goes into communities and gets kids that from disadvantaged backgrounds gives them
the opportunity to get an education and then the opportunity to get into work through the
relationships with a few of the commercial companies that i've built relationships with over the years
um what else there's the management company football management company so we've got
managers and players past and present that we managed for about 85 95 players
um which is that's one of my passions and i get to mentor players within that which is the best bit for me where so for
instance england player michael keane ben godfrey mason holgate the murphy twins
uh even chris wilder i'll speak to as well but i get to mentor these players nice who i can have some sort of effect
given the experience that i've gained over the years so to have played that little role in a lot of these guys and i do that with the
premier league players and nationals two players that are from lower leagues or just starting on the journey who haven't made it yet
um we were 17 18 years old so they i get great kicks out of stuff like that as well
do you know which path you're gonna take i don't know i'd love to be able to do all yeah but i know it's not possible to be
super successful spreading yourself in like that so i
will eventually go this is me it's funny because when i when i speak to you and i've spoken to you and obviously all my
punditry stuff of course yeah yeah which is actually given yeah when i speak to you when i spoke to you last time when we met a
couple out then a year or two again we were standing in the sea for about 35 about an hour i think i think we're talking remember you remember that in
dubai standing oh yeah i was talking about the other time yeah where like i came i came to like
roughly where you live you came to social chain one time yeah yeah yeah i came to where you lived and then i forgot the dubai time yeah yeah but
every single time when when i speak you look at me in a certain way and i can see it you're like
listening very and then you start asking questions around certain things and you're very very very very curious
and i've noticed this i feel it when i start talking you go you look at me like this um does the same thing yeah yeah
so you're you're a novel you do a lot of stuff you're you're doing this you've got a book coming out you're investing you
know you've sold it you've been a part of a company that was valued at 200 plus million pounds like you're doing so much stuff there's
a theater show you're doing or whatever you mentioned before so there's so much stuff that you're doing you're spinning
plates i find that exciting how the [ __ ] are you doing that
i want to know i don't want to know like sometimes it's not even about what you're doing for me it's how you're doing it mm-hmm i mean
like even a podcast i'm just like all little things like
that i love it so i don't know i'm i'll just i've got a curious mind in that sense definitely
when i was young i was curious to find out what nightclubs look like inside i mean that's all i wanted to do was
What matters?
find out i want to get in nightclubs that's what i don't know west ham yeah so i mean you just a young player
just coming up in primary get invited to everything i was curious i mean but that's for the wrong reasons
you've not you've lived this crazy life right that you've lived a life that me as a young kid growing up in devon and plymouth i was you know watching my
little tiny little one foot tv with my brothers my three brothers sat there you know that was the life that i wanted
to lead and you've gone through that journey you've you've now come out the other end and you're doing all this other crazy stuff as you look back on the cut span of your
career you must now know that there's certain fundamental things that matter
and a lot of [ __ ] that doesn't what are the things that matter i used fiverr once a month before they
became a sponsor on this podcast and since they've become a sponsor on this podcast and i've delved into what
the site does and how all the services work and the vast array of things that you can achieve on fiverr using
freelancers around the world i swear on this dog's life pablo my dog here who sat on my lap if you can't see
i swear in his life that i've used fiverr at least once a week for the last three
months we've built so many websites we've designed so many decks we've had
video clips edited we've had subtitles produced if you haven't checked out fiverr before
hit the link in the bio fiverr.com ceo go to the website check

for that service to be done for you so find a service on fiverr that you want done send me a message and one person every
week will have that service paid for by me you must now know that there's certain fundamental things that matter
and a lot of [ __ ] that doesn't what are the things that matter because i'm a little bit earlier on so
i'm still figuring out some of these things i'm like oh look money this is interesting you know like
health man really health is the it's the biggest the biggest it's the
biggest thing because when you're healthy you're so happy we spoke about before
like confidence it breeds how happy you are and it energizes you but if you're not
healthy it can be devastating so health is a massive thing which i probably i didn't
consider for many years probably till we hit that bad patch in our lives
um i took it for granted pandemic now has been another pandemic is an absolute like if you wasn't awake
then you are woken now to health and what does that mean for you in terms of staying healthy now
well we spoke about it before in terms of of like what does health mean to it is
passing it on to the next generation of kids my own kids first and foremost but then like to to kids to understand that
going to the gym and just like in and out little fads here and there health kicks
here and there isn't at me yeah you're talking about me it's not a lifestyle yeah
yeah like and we've got friends that we both know who are like that as well and you've been like that before it's
just it's not yeah it's not the way it's not healthy for starters
but up here it just leaves you you're always chasing something whereas when you get
consistency with your lifestyle and health and your healthy lifestyle there's like almost like a an excel like
oh actually i get it now and it becomes it's not it's not a drain on your life it becomes something that adds value to
your life in the end and i think that's something to try and transfer that over to this next generation of kids is i think a key way and this
pandemic isn't something i think can accelerate that and it will accelerate that because like i said i'm on the board at the gym
group now and trying to get people to understand and get back into coming into gyms is a
massive push it's a massive it's a key part and how do you do that because it's not only the importance of a spreadsheet
it's actually you're doing something that's going to help people now and prevent illnesses from being healthy
a lot of the time and help their mental health which people yeah yeah that's what i'm saying people think it's just physical yeah it's not like i'll go in a gym in
that hour is unbelievable three four times a week because you're on your own or with a a partner or a pt whatever it
is and some of your best ideas or best flushing of things is there all my ideas right because
you're having that time alone and you're getting to sit and not think about anything else but your reps or whatever it is and then actually bang something hits you
[ __ ] that's kind of for later last one i'll go back to that it's good it's unbelievable it unlocks so much it
does yeah it's my i said i'm sorry every day at 9pm every single day without fail
um i go to the gym and regardless of how busy i am here which is always too busy every day the team say they know that at
certain time i get up and i go to the gym every single day without fail and it's and it's you see it as okay what i'm trying to get muscles it's like
no that's where i think of ideas so health and i'm really i'm really happy that you said that because
um i've had that revelation in the last year and i think making so cool thank you making health cool again would
um help more parts of society than we realize especially guys that are looking for a sense of purpose in their life you know
yeah definitely i think that and it's again this that's the pandemic as well maybe created a lot more health
conscious people and it's just the ways in which they're going to work out now is is going to be
key and even my kids are the same like i was i say to him i don't want to have to come home and tell you to work out
you should want to work out just do it and then sometimes i might be driving somewhere and all of a sudden one of the boys or
my little girl they're running somewhere that's like for me that's a success like
something that's that's that's what i want to see do you mean because i'm not forcing them to do it if they're doing it off their own back
now this could be like their lifestyle for the rest of their life that they're healthy living healthy understand what it means so
and my two boys want to be footballers as well so it's important for them to be physically active as a dad that was a
football legend what do you do to help a son that wants to be a football player get there
pray i'll pray every night and just say please man let my kids be players like
every other parent um i'd give everything for them to play football and be like top players
seriously man but if they don't this is what i always say to them but there ain't pressure if you don't make it i don't care it's
life i would love it to be if you don't make it it's fine you do something else one unfortunately is a centre-back like
me okay at the moment why unfortunately because then he'll be judged against me more if he played a different position like my other goalkeeper my other one's
a goalkeeper okay so no one's gonna say oh he's not not as good as rio because he's a goalkeeper you know what i mean so
um but yeah but they're both they're both playing now they're both clubs so they're happy that when the
biggest thing they're enjoying it which is great so that's a basic answer but it's so true i mean they're doing something that
they enjoy that they want to get up out of bed every day for and that's all you want and it goes back to the same thing when you're there
you better be working don't want this like if the manager comes to me and they're doing the appraisal of your performances the last
two months i do every quarter they come back and tell me that you don't work hard enough you ain't going because you're just
embarrassing for yourself to hear that but do you is there anything that you can do can you like call someone to be like give my kid a chance and
because that's how always i thought it was like every every footballers kids would have been players then that's true i mean it's like it's like saying that
your child is going to be able to build a 200 million pound company because you have yes i mean it's just not it doesn't
happen because there's so many variables that can affect that i guess all you can do is just try and give them some lessons yeah it's
definitely some advice and it's like but it's like when you become a parent it'll be the same your kids don't want
to hear it from you yeah yeah yeah they don't want to hear all of this from you yeah
they'd rather hear it from the sunday league coach you've got no qualifications and listen to him and i'm sitting there looking at my son
like do you realize what i have done what i did why you're here
uh and you're not listening to me you're not taking my advice that you used to kill me right but i don't really know but and then i realized it's more about
just giving them the tools from a mental perspective to how to think and live like a
professional do they know who you are they do it's weird my son said this to me the other day he said dad until i got fifa i
didn't really know how good you was you know i said what do you mean he says like you're legend on fifa the game
so now i know obviously i see your stats they're sick that they're sick how old is he he's he's 14. he took him he probably
said only like about until two years ago when he started playing fifa that he realized that you like yeah
before that it was looking me like i was just any man like any guy like and i say to them like yeah
and one of my sons used to go yeah but dad you you really know that though
seriously let's go what's this guy saying like what are you talking about i meet you brother he was like but that's how they
were because they were just oblivious to it and a lot of players i spoke to and i asked them did you know that you were like the top player
not really they don't really yeah you just want to sit them down and show them some tapes yeah but then but you don't sit there
and do that it's like almost like they've got to go and find it and that's what they've they've done now since obviously they go on youtube and
look at stuff as we go down you actually they're not bad are people saying like you are the virgil van dyke so who's
better and like virgil van dyke is here right
who is the best defender in the world in your view right now yeah yeah you think it's ramos yeah ramos says
these ages obviously it works against him but ramos in terms of influence yeah yeah
um in the last seven or eight years has been the standout because he's that he's just
he's been a monster scores goals scored over 100 goals you know sent it back really career yeah crazy but van dyke the last
two years has been the best yeah liverpool aren't having a good time at the moment i'm not guided i'm not good
the best that we've got some liverpool fans in here and i tell you what i've i've made the most of this oh it's
beautiful every day i'm like watching the games i didn't care before i'm like watching sat there watching the game like i'm watching united yeah just like
that oh and then i'll text them all you've just conceded what's the excuse today on no fans all that nonsense
no players got an injury yeah heard it all um you know you lastly you know you said
you said that you're happy now happiest you've um you've felt in a long time yeah
yeah definitely like i'm just i'm facing that she said i did it so my face didn't say no you're faced
with no i'm i'm the happiest i've i've been man it's just because i don't know i've got three healthy
children four healthy children now got a newborn baby
family friends um yeah man it's just
and and business is going well as well and i can see st i can see stuff happening and
evolving like you can almost you can feel stuff happening you know i mean you must have felt that with some of the stuff that you do you feel
you you you get onto something and you feel momentum a little bit the momentum starts coming you can see it building so
i'm in a good place man i'm i'm really happy what do you want what do you mean what i want i purposely
ambiguous like what do you what do you want when you think about what you want now what is it i just i just want to
be part of something that people go well that was that's the [ __ ] like that's how
they've done that fair play well well played that's what i want why
because that's how i've always been you play football first and foremost i wanted because i wanted to be a success before
that obviously but that recognition i think we all have a little bit in us that you want that
recognition whether it's from your friends your host network of people family or outside that but
why why is a football player did you buy the paper or do you go online
what number's beside your name if you've got a four out of ten that papers are getting thrown away you get a nine attack ten eight ten well
you're looking for that recognition and i think we've all got a little bit in that now why'd you say well done to your team
members of your team because you know that person will feed off that recognition so i'm not ashamed to say that i i'm definitely
like that as well well thank you so much for for coming today means a lot and um you're an
incredibly inspiring guy like and i have no doubt that you're gonna you're gonna find that thing and it's
gonna become um just as successful as everything else you've done in your life because you've got all the you've got the
philosophical attributes that are conducive with success like you're you're not someone that got lucky you've clearly got a
mindset that is conducive with success and especially when you you talk about how curious you are with things
i like when i say it i mean it like the way you look at me when i talk about something that like if i talk about something that's maybe a little bit
outside of your realm of experience you might as well have pen and paper in the hand because that's the facial expression right yeah
i've got notepads at home it's going in really so um who i reference in the podcast is the seo
pretty little thing and he was always the same and he said to me he was like i'd get 16 year olds in this office
and i'd be like tell me about tik tok and he just sits there and studies them he doesn't know about it he knows about
him but he will know through them and he'll learn and he said you should say to me i'm a sponge he said so mahmoud and
umar would invite me to the office sometimes four days a week and i'll just sit in the office and they'll just ask me questions and then
you'd see them sort of changing their strategy a little bit on social media et cetera and you know their record speaks for itself
but yeah you've been a huge inspiration for me for many many years as a leader um as a guy you know i didn't know you
before you know a couple of years ago and when we met and the guy you are and the leader you are is um is
tremendously inspiring you're a good guy and you're incredibly inspiring as well so thank you for making the time today
you inspire me now as well so this is uh kind of it works both ways so i appreciate you appreciating
thank you cool man thanks
[Music]

Link: [# Ant Middleton Opens Up About His Personal Demons, Being "Cancelled" & His Spirituality | E74](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8voKz-2vBU)
Transcription:


Intro
one of the things that i say um is the most courageous thing you can do
above all bravery is this is the personal life that i really keep to myself you know i've spoke a lot
about it today which i've never spoken about before
[Music] ant middleton and is an adventurer
a military vet a television host an author an entrepreneur and one that's become highly highly
respected as an authority when it comes to things like survival and endurance and leadership techniques
and due to his experiences as an elite special force member he can talk about these
things in a way that nobody nobody else can and has very very recently been at the center of a huge
media storm where he was quote unquote cancelled with his biggest show today sas judea's wins being axed by channel 4
after five years and the broadcaster came out and said that anne's views and values
weren't aligned to theirs this is his first in-depth conversation that he's recorded
since he was quote unquote cancelled i've watched countless amounts of interviews that ant middleton has done
but the side of ant that you're going to hear today is one that even he admits himself that he has never fully shared before
i'm going to say it this podcast lifted a ton of weight off my shoulders and answered maybe the most
important question about life that we all must ask ourselves if we are going to be happy and if we're
going to be successful and if we're going to be free and thank you for your honesty without
further ado i'm stephen bartlett and this is the dire of a ceo i hope nobody's listening but if you are
then please keep this to yourself
and um when i was reading your book first man in there was um there's this quote at the end of one of
Exorcising my demons
the chapters and i thought it was a good place to start this conversation today because i tend to think that it's probably one
of the more foundational pieces of information well it might lead to one of the most foundational piece of
information to describe who you became in your life and what you've got on to achieve and this is what you you wrote at the end of the chapter it says it's called
making friends with your demons having dark forces living within us is part of being human they're the result
of inevitable damage of life each one of us has a choice make these demons work for us
or turn them loose against us and slightly linked to that in the same on the same page you wrote
most of most of us have horror stories we can tell you about from our childhoods it's not the horror that defines you
it's how well you fought it what did that mean i think that's just a generic message to everyone to say that
it's okay to have you know bad thoughts it's okay to have these demons inside you they
exist in all of us you know but the important message is to exercise them
because the moment you lock them away the moment you lock these thoughts away the moment you lock these demons away the moment you lock any negativity away
all it's going to do is take over like a mold and it's going to completely engulf you and it's going to going to control you
as an individual and it's only because i've been there and i've done it whether that's what i've done in combat
losing my father at a young age um losing my mother um seeing bodies blown up around me
seeing dead people around me seeing the effect it has on families seeing what my decision pulling that
trigger or not has on a certain person or has on a
certain family or has on a certain situation and it's ultimately being okay with who
you are that's the whole thing about it it's being acknowledging that listen
we're not perfect we're human okay we have weaknesses we have insecurities we have these horrendous thoughts sometimes
now you'd be a liar to say you don't sit there sometimes and you know the things that go through your head if you actually voice them
then that becomes a problem that's you not exercising your demons that's them exercising you and it's just about
acknowledging that and i acknowledge that from such a young age
i acknowledged that from a young age when my father passed away and i couldn't really understand what was going on can you tell me about that um yeah my
father passed away when i was five years old and um within a few months
a new man came into our life um my stepfather um and then within two years we up
moved to france so we lived in portsmouth we often moved completely to france a new situation a new environment a new
man in our life and i can just remember thinking i remember going into
a bush in the fields where we lived in france after a couple of months we were there
and i sat in this bush and the magnitude of the situation was
so overwhelming i can just remember looking at the road and thinking to myself
what am i doing here why why am i here what's the purpose i i couldn't grasp anything at that young
age and it was during that moment when i let everything go
and i can just remember thinking to myself don't try and understand what's going on don't i'm just trying to understand who
this man is and where he's come from don't try and understand why you're in a different school speaking a different language
because you can't don't try and understand all of a sudden you're living in
caravans we moved we were living in a couple of caravans we were a big big family um from houses
um and i can just remember dropping everything and thinking to myself understand what you can understand and
that at that young age what i could understand was what i was feeling you know i could
understand myself so when i look back on the death of my father and as i flip everything into a
positive even though years and years and years down the line i'd done this you know the death of my father actually
made me self-reflect from the age of six or seven so i've been self-reflecting you know
understanding my emotions understanding how i feel understanding my demons understanding you know the good parts of me the bad
parts to me the weak parts of me the strong parts of me the positive side of me the negative side of me
and i've been really breaking it down from such a young age and
that's given me an advantage in life i generally believe that that's given me
my sort of bulletproof mindset on how to tackle anyone or any situation today
so even though it's a traumatic part of my life and it affected me all
the way up to my mid-20s in in a bad way where i'd go out and try and understand who my father was trying
to understand you know i never went to his funeral i never went to
to to his grave now my parents my say my parents my stepdad because he
came in my life so young i called him my dad um they never told me where he was buried he was just completely cut out of
our life um because of the situation beforehand you know for him to come into our lives
a couple of months after it was pretty obvious that my mum was obviously having an affair or there's something going on
and again i'm not judging anyone or the situation but you know so when he came into our life
it was like right you call him dad my name changed from aaron to middleton
not a lot of people know that really yeah um and this whole new life was just
forced upon me forced upon me so i was either forced to act or force not to act
you know sitting in that bush me forcing not to act was probably jumping in the road
you know thinking like listen enough is enough did that cross your mind
it was a big road it was a big road and
it never got to that stage where i thought right i'm going to take my life but it was like you know this there's an easy option out
of here which i mean it's like there is an easy option out of here but it never crossed my mind to
to do it but i can just remember thinking of that road thinking the cars move fast there i mean if you wanted to it's more like
if you wanted to yeah so it crosses your mind yeah it crosses your mind but it doesn't register yeah if that makes sense yeah
and it's only you know throughout these few years when you start to reflect back on on who you are and what you've been
through you start to go bloody hell and actually maybe i was thinking like that at a young age
so um but then again you know who i am i you know i'm honest with myself i'm honest
with my demons i'm honest with with who i am and ultimately i'm i'm honest with um
with knowing that we're not perfect you know a lot of people and you've described it there they never
make they never admit their demons to themself and what ends up happening is those demons
run the show but from the back room absolutely and you know i guess you see that a lot with people that have come back from war
as well because they don't get the uh the support they need but
i see it during war yeah i see people level-headed intelligent soldiers lose their head on
the battlefield come running past you doing things that you think
wow where the hell did that come from you look into their eyes and there's [ __ ] nothing there nothing there
and then boom they flip out and you're like do you realize what you just done like
like you know it's you know those demons are [ __ ] strong
they're there how do you address them you have to exercise them and you know the way i exercise my
demons is by getting like-minded similar people in
the same room in a safe environment and i might drink myself into oblivion
till three four in the morning you know chatting about what we've done chatting about old times chatting about who we are and
then boom i'm done for six months you know i've i've released those demons
when you you know intoxicate yourself with alcohol it you know it allows you to talk and i'm not saying
go out there and do that but that's just my way of coming from a drinking culture i.e the military a drinking and a fighting
culture that's the way that we deal with things and for now now it might be a blowout where you know i go out and you know i'll have a nice
meal and you know we'll have a few glasses of wine you know we'll be in a private room and we we shoot the [ __ ]
and you know just talk about whatever we need to talk about whatever's on your mind but also physically
i exercise my demons physically you know i put myself in horrendous situations in
order to fight against myself um everest is a prime example of what's gonna say um
you know i didn't have to go up during the storms i you know if i was the normal sensible person i
would have went up after that storm went so just for context you you decided to climb mount everest with
a buddy of yours at probably the worst possible time and you got into a little bit of a predicament up there yeah exactly that yeah um to say the
least yeah but it's one of those where i didn't just want to walk up
on a nice sunny day you know and and gain nothing from that experience
what what why though like why are you voluntarily putting yourself through chaos and what anyone else would
perceive to be agony why are you choosing that that's me exercising my demons really that's me
you know pushing myself to that limit that's me having tasted that drug of
living on that line of life and death and a lot of people think that drugs adrenaline but it's not
i don't feel pumped i don't feel i feel ultimate peace so people find this bizarre but when
i walk that line of life and death which i've done multiple times it's a pure feeling of euphoria it's not
what you think where you feel pumped in your your eyes are red and you've got this aggression going through
you and you have to get through this moment it's like life is so uncomplicated steve so
uncomplicated you're either going to live or you're going to die all the [ __ ] all the complications
of life that is implemented on you whether that's through government whether that's through work
whether that's true family all of that goes and you are left with the most purest
form of life and it's so uncomplicated that it's so euphoric
it's so peaceful and when you hear of world war one and world war ii poets that are
writing poems in trenches people are like how the hell are they writing poems in trenches
i understand that feeling because life is so uncomplicated it's so pure it's so peaceful
that they're writing with no stresses no complications no [ __ ] it's just it's
coming from the purest form of life of i'm either going to live or i'm going to die
and it's that feeling that i chase i chase that feeling well to want that moment of peace pure and
utter peace for 10 15 minutes
that drug i chase and that's crossing those boundaries crossing those
lines crossing any limitations to the edge of life you take that step you're gone
you go over that edge you know you're gonna feel it you're gonna feel alive you're
gonna feel everything that you need that you need out of life um but for me that's exercising my demons
so whether i do it psychologically where i'm putting myself in situations that i'm saying stuff that
i believe in that i value that as a message and it's being contradicted or whether i'm pushing myself
to a physical limit or putting myself in a in a physical situation which is
uncomprehendable to to the to the everyday man or woman but it's because i've tasted it i've had
the misfortune i've had the burden of tasting that drug
and will it be the end of me i can't say that for sure i can't say that it won't
i can't say that you know i've never put myself in these situations again because i find myself constantly doing it
but for me that is exercising my demons and everyone's demons are different
everyone's situation is different everyone's emotions are different everyone's dna is different but that's
me exercising my demons quick one starting from the minute the lockdown is lifted we're gonna start

What shaped you to who you are today?
what what are the other if any moments from your early years that went into shaping the man you became was there anything
else because i i hear you in your books and in your writing and your interviews continue to cite that that that sort of trauma with your father and
your stepfather then coming in and and being the way that he was but there was was there anything up leading until
you know your twenties that you cite as being pivotal and who you became yeah when i joined
the british military i joined the army at the age of 16. i'm just going on to 17. and i came from
a background of french culture you know i'd go out and drink coffee when i was 14 play bowling when i was 15.
you know and all of a sudden i get thrown into a male dominant organization um the culture drinking fighting you fit
in or you [ __ ] off it's as simple as that so what do you do you try and fit in
but when you try and put a a round peg into a square hole you know you're going to get stuck and
you either stay stuck okay you and you go around pleasing everyone else or you pull yourself out
of that situation and that's ultimately what i've done with the army i spent four years in the army then left because of that situation it wasn't me i
wasn't this aggressive young lad that loved drinking i'd never used to drink
i was always polite always respectful i'd walk past someone i'd tip my hat you know in france you said bonjour and
you know you just have a little chat you do that in england when when i was 16 17 walking past someone nodding and they're like what
the [ __ ] are you looking at no it used to shock me and i used to think i'm only saying hi mate what you
know and that was a pivotal four years in my life where i thought to myself
can i fit in to this uk culture um or i can
pull myself out of it and for the first four years i found myself fitting in and i found myself being good at
drinking i found myself being good at fighting i found myself being good at being a
[ __ ] [ __ ] you know because that's what i needed to be to fit in so again those were demons
that i discovered along the way that i found that i was good at so would i let anyone take the piss out of me anymore you bet
no because you're going to get you're going to get good hiding you know would i would i go out and and drink and fit in yeah of course of
course i would you know hey one of the lads i want to fit in i mean i'm so i'm so far detached from all of that but
if i'm this young polite respectful sort of multiculturaled individual then
that's gonna be a more of a hindrance moving forward in in what i need to do
especially in the military then it is uh a benefit so you find yourself
turning into this person i can just remember i was about 21 and
i went to macedonia and i worked with the french foreign legion out there because i speak fluent french
and i worked with the french friend legion a bit and i saw how they were they're very very mature very sort of you know
going back to that french culture you know they're all family orientated very i thought to myself wow this is this is
who i am and when i got back off that tour i can just remember going to the squadron bar
i was in nine parachute squadron wall engineers going to the squadron bar we've just done a six-month tour i'm
going to the squadron bar and i remember walking in there and i remember seeing someone um a staff sergeant probably about 35
36 you know i'm a young 20 21 year old drinking from a a boot for an old desert
boot right and he's drinking piss being drinking piss from my boot and i can
just remember looking at him thinking if i continue the way that i'm going that's going to be me
in 15 years time and it scared the hell out of me i can remember just thinking i've got to
get the hell out of here i walked out of that bar and the next day i put my notice in i was like that this is not who i
am this is not you know i've gained more demons from this four years than i have
any friends any benefits from it and that was a pivotal point that was a
pivotal point in my life where i thought to myself wow you know i can either go i can have a
change in such a way and just be stuck in this square hole
or i can pull myself out rebuild on the foundations that i have of knowing that i'm a good person
and you and from there you handed in your notice and what happened next from there i handed him my notice and
and i left and um i found that in civvie street i was acting
the person that i never wanted to be in the military right but i'd found that that had followed me that that had taken
charge of me give me be specific those demons that um those demons that had sort of identified
themselves within that four years were running the show so when i got out i joined the metropolitan police
and i was acting like a proper squaddie right now going out drinking every night you know cheating on my exams um drink driving
you know i got all the way through training a couple of weeks ago a couple of weeks to go passed all the
tests i got caught drink driving boom kicked out the um kicked out the met
um out the training um in hendon and but it didn't bother me i was like yeah you know once a soldier always a
soldier and i was living in the past and being someone who
completely wasn't me but who had control of me and then getting into into the street
life you know i got into the street life where you know
fighting not gangs not games but that that social circle where you know you
have to uphold a reputation where you and the one thing that you know well i'll say the one thing but the thing i
was good at that fitted me is that was a good scrapper i knew i know how to scrap i know how to drink and how to fight but you find yourself
reverting back to the person who you never wanted to be and i suppose that was the defense mechanism
i knew that that worked in the uk i'd never tried and tested anything else as soon as i came over to the uk
straight into the military again now i spent 10 12 years in france before that then
boom straight over into into the british culture and i thought that that's how you acted i never knew what silly street was about
because um i never i was never in it so um it took me a a good couple of years again
to realize what saved you what pulled you out of the job there's one moment that saved me um
i refused to sign on i refuse to take any any help from the government same um
and i can remember my auntie i was living with my auntie at the time and you've got you know you've got no money what are
you going to do i said well i'm going to go down to the job center why won't you just sign on you know until you find a job i'm like
no that was proud i was like no i've never taken a penny off the government
i thought now i'm going to go to the job center i remember walking into the job center walking up the stairs walking into the job center
and i had my red book and the red book when you leave the military it's got all your all your qualifications military
qualifications all your credentials and i walked into the job center and the guy obviously recognized the books
they'd probably have hundreds of people going there you know a year and he said oh mate you're x military on yourself yeah he said come
to the desk he sat down with me and he opened up my book and he started reading my book
and he looked up at me and he said why did you leave the military and before i could answer i was going to say something back and he said
i have hundreds of these come across my desk and they said this is one of the best reports i've ever read he said so my advice to you as he
slammed the book shot he went went go back into that space and i remember just sitting there
um i was 22 sitting down and thinking mike okay he's gonna offer me a job now and he just
handed me the book and called over the next person and i was just like i'm picking up a bit to myself guys
you know but obviously there's there's all military qualifications there's nothing for me out there apart from to
empty bins or whatever it may be and i remember taking the book and as i
walked down the steps of the job center i sat down halfway down on the steps
and i had a train ticket in my pocket and probably about a couple of quid loose change that's
that was my life um this was at the age of 22 23 maybe
and um and i can just remember thinking to myself right why the hell are you sat
skin nothing in your life apart from what you the clothes that
you're wearing and what's in your pockets jobless and then
a moment of clarity just hit me it's almost as if i had an out of body experience and i was looking back at the
boys sitting on the step and i just remember thinking to myself right
i'll tell you why it's because you're pretending to be someone else
you're lying to yourself therefore you're living a lie you're you know you think you're better than everyone else
you know you've got this reputation that you want to uphold that's not you um you're just you're just a shadow of
who you really are you're not you know who the hell do you think you are because the person that i'm looking at
you know almost looking in the mirror the person that i'm looking at is exactly where you should be sat on a
[ __ ] step jobless with nothing because this isn't you and if you want to live
in the shadow if you want to stay stuck in that hole in that square hole then keep lying to yourself and keep
living a lie and that moment i'll always go back to that moment whenever i get a bit above
myself or a bit too big for my boots i always go back to that moment where i ripped
myself apart because it freed me as an individual and i promise you this and it's not
cliche this isn't some kind of [ __ ] [ __ ] story that i'm telling you it freed me as an individual because
i can remember remember standing up on them steps feeling like a new man
because i just identified who i was this isn't you get that out your life get out of your life get that out of your life
be you and i had those foundations to fall back on because i knew who i was ultimately but
it was discovered and and yeah ego covered with so much [ __ ] covered with so much complications that
i'd implemented on myself and when i got rid of it all i was just like that you know what i was
good at the military i've got best recruit best pt when i was in the army you know what i'm gonna do i
love that lifestyle but it's just around the wrong people i was in the wrong regiment you know i'm
gonna rejoin the military but i'm going to be a team player i'm going to be myself i'm going to be this
respectful gentleman hard worker that i know that i am which i mean i'm not going to go out
boozing i'm not going to go out fighting i'm not going to try and fit in you know if they don't accept me for who i am then so be it
the military obviously isn't for me i joined the royal marines i went straight down the careers office
straight down the careers office and joined the royal marines and within a couple of months because of my previous
um military uh history um i got him very quick and within a couple of months i found
myself going through royal marine training and when i passed out of war marine training i got um awarded with best
recruit which is the king's badge and i can just remember thinking to myself right and you've been here before
you know you've got best recruit best pt you know you rested on your laurels went to your unit didn't really fit in you're in the same position now now you
can either use this as a positive and push forward and and you know go on to achieve great things or you can try and fit in
booze fight be a be a camp hero you know a pub soldier
and just be back to square one where you was five six seven years ago there's something and i want to carry on from
that story but just going back to that i find it super fascinating that you're sat on those stairs and at a moment when your ego kind of
dissolves because of the circumstances you find yourself in um you're actually able then to go and
pursue your true self and i find you know i had someone sat in this chair previously and he's the biggest investor
in the world in psychedelics and one of the things that he talks about with psychedelics is it what it does is it strips back the [ __ ]
your ego the the identity you've been living to please society and what's left is like who you actually
are and it's and it's so funny that so many of the guests i speak to and some of the psychologists i've spoken to talk about
in order to like find your happiness and pursue your true self you have to get rid of that [ __ ] and what i'm what i was hearing when you
were saying that is you know you'd you'd create this reputation an identity for yourself which actually was leading
you astray but it was helping you survive in those circles absolutely and this tough tough decision
to say do you know i'm going to break out that circle leave that identity behind throw myself
into an uncertain moment and go in pursuit of like who i actually am and everybody faces that in their life
you know as a kid growing up in devon in a school of 1500 white kids pretending that i liked indie music and
pretending i was to fit in and survive yeah and i i left the city because i
deep down in my heart i didn't resonate with anybody but i was in that small town city surrounded by 1500 white kids that liked
the kooks yeah and then 18 i was like i'm out here i'm gonna go be steve move to manchester
you know and i dropped and i started to and i think everybody in their life regardless of what walk of life you you face that decision and either you've
realized that you're living an identity or a life untrue to yourself and you've gone on the journey to go
find yourself or right now as you're listening to this you are and you'll know it yeah because
the words that you've described there will ring true so that completely i completely understand that and that makes complete
sense to me and one of the things that i say um is the most courageous thing you can do
above all bravery is to be honest with yourself why is that
so hard these days i had one day last week was actually sunday where i didn't have my heel and i had a
little bit of junk food and i don't know what it is but i think my body has got used to eating clean food because for the next
three days i felt i still kind of feel what day we are now tuesday i still kind
of feel crap from the junk food that i i just had one drunk meal i had this junk meal
right i still feel crap now i don't know what it is i think my body has genuinely got used to eating good food so the minute
now that i put in something that is bad for me my body goes steve what are you doing um and i felt bad for the last two days
and i've returned to huell and i feel good again this is just an anecdotal story but i said this to my pa last night i said i for some reason having now
transitioned to a really good diet on your any sort of um dabble with the
the stuff that i used to eat is more sort of alarming to my body and i notice it way more than i ever had
so yeah you know it's one thing having a podcast sponsor that pays you money but it's another thing having a podcast
sponsor who you genuinely believe can help people change their lives for the better
Why is being honest with yourself so hard these days?
one of the things that i say um is the most courageous thing you can do
above all bravery is to be honest with yourself why is that
so hard these days you know people say to me and you know
what's the bravest thing you've ever done and i always talk about the story of the job center steps because that
took courage that took balls that that's bravery right there you know i've been in rooms where bullets are flying over my head i've
kicked doors down and you know i've taken i've saved life it's like that's not
being brave that's just me being extremely good at my job and loving what i do you know it's not there's nothing to do
with bravery you know bravery is almost forced upon you but when you decide to step into the arena when you decide to step
into that and go right i'm going to face this and put that mirror on yourself
ultimately facing yourself that is the hardest but most liberating thing i've ever done
and people shy away from that and they live in the void they live this life where they're just
living the void i call it and say you're on autopilot because you're lying to yourself and it's pretty simple therefore you're
going to live a lie i don't care it's i'm not the archbishop of canterbury you know i'm like
i'm not a rocket scientist it's just simple science you know if you lie to yourself guess what you're going to live a lie um
but standing in a mirror standing in the mirror and ripping yourself apart
does take away all the [ __ ] and all the complications and it frees you as an individual but it's you have to do it on a regular
basis you can't just go i've done it once so here we go i've found myself this is who i am because hopefully you're constantly changing
you're constantly evolving you're constantly um adapting your mindset you know that's what evolution is about you know the the
world is designed to to you know is is it evolutionizes and we are designed to do exactly the same
and the moment that you you're not honest with yourself
this game over for you it's like it's like you do you just want to be just that person you know like a lot of
people say to me and you know i've remember you remember me from the military i'm like yeah yeah yeah they got [ __ ] i you've changed a
lot you've changed i'm like that i haven't seen you for 10 years i hope i've changed and i say to them
you haven't that's why you're still just that guy that's why i'm at middleton and you're still just that guy
is because of course i've changed i'd like to think in another 10 years time when you see me that i've changed again because if i haven't
i'm doing something wrong and that doing something wrong is not being honest with myself and it all goes back to you as an
individual no one can do that for you no one can do that for you and i say to every everyone
everything starts with you and it's it's so true if you don't want to change
nothing will change around you you know if you don't want to be honest with yourself well guess what you're lying to yourself
it's a complete opposite therefore you're living a lie it's like you have to do this on a on a on a weekly on a monthly basis any
time an obstacle was thrown in front of you you couldn't fall back on right to be honest with
yourself be honest with who you are be honest with with with you you know with how you tackle things and
and and don't lie to yourself the cost of being yourself and being honest with yourself is it seemingly increasing in this day
and age and you know i find it i think that's a really really valid point one that i hadn't i didn't think expressed properly which
is you had that reflective moment when you sat on those stairs where you say [ __ ] it we're gonna start being honest with ourselves but then especially as
you get more successful you know in your media career and everything else the forces at play trying to get you to not be
honest with yourself get greater and greater and this is this crazy sort of i don't know paradox or whatever we see
in society at the moment which is you being honest with yourself is the reason you're sat here it's the reason
you're at middleton yeah but and that's what's made you go explode right
but then the higher you get it's like i don't know you know the the resistance for you not
to be yourself becomes greater because now you've got now you're more of a target right hard [ __ ] hard [ __ ] life to live
do you know what i've been witness of it you know the council culture the um don't say that ant because you
will lose this book deal you will lose that media career you will lose that production
and witness of it right now you know um i hear it probably on a weekly basis um
but then that's that square peg round hole it's like no i don't
you know it's it's every time i think about that and i always have two principles
with everything that i do is don't go out to offend so i don't say
things to offend people therefore they choose to be offended i don't say things to offend people i just
say things what i think is right was what served me um good in my experiences
and my career my mindset and the second thing is you know don't don't do
things maliciously so first of all don't go out it's it's verbal and also actions
you know don't don't do things maliciously because then ultimately yeah you're going to have a backlash you're going to have a reaction
to to to what you've done um so that's exactly what i do i don't go out to offend
but i go out to tell the truth but i also go out to seek the truth you know and i go out to
seeking the truth again everything starts with you and with who i am it's dangerous and it's it's it's
definitely in the social media area it's dangerous it is dangerous but hopefully you get past that
that stage of people realizing that actually this is ant he's not been any different he's not you know
voiced anything different he's not tried to fit into a media agenda he's not trying to try to blag anyone he's not being fake
this is who aunt middleton is and he will always be like that regardless yeah regardless but then
there's that platform of not reaching that level quite yet and then everything descending upon you
um and i and unfortunately there's a lot of people out there that are scared to say what they truly feel are scared to voice their
opinions uh scared to you know voice their values because ultimately it takes food off the table
it's a career stopper when your career stops guess what suffers after that your family and then when that when that suffers
guess what there's not much out there for you you have to rebuild again well all those 10 15
20 years career that you've you've built all for that one moment is it worth it no so what do you do
keep quiet what'd you do don't do anything just say what they want you to say and
do what they want you to do that doesn't [ __ ] rub with me that's
a sore point with me you know you try and you try and make me someone that i'm
that i'm not like i've been made someone them than i'm that i'm not you're probably gonna get even you feel
gonna get the worst out of me even more so because everything comes back around to who you truly are they're trying to control you
yeah it's a controlling measure and it's like listen i've i've let people control my life i've let
situations control my life and it's i've ended up psychologically not physically
psychologically on that brink of questioning who the [ __ ] who the [ __ ] am
i who am i that's what i question and the moment i start questioning who am i
then i know that project isn't for me i know that that that sponsor isn't for me i know that
that tv um channel or that tv production isn't for me because the moment that comes into
question and it's like you don't probably don't get who i am you probably don't understand who i am you probably haven't done your homework with
who i am do i fit into your agenda and it's like if you don't fit into one agenda
you get bounced boom straight across to the opposite side right it's like listen i don't belong on
that side it's just cause i don't believe in in this this side doesn't mean i belong on that side
yeah i'm i belong in the middle you know people say you are you on the left you're on the right i'm like i'm not on the left or
right i'm in the middle i'm in the middle
you say slightly something that goes against this agenda then again you just get bounced straight to the other side the
right road i don't recognize you the left won't recognize you so there's who are your enemies of both yeah but it's it's and it's a dangerous
place to live in this is it's it's it it's it's a sad state of affairs a real
sad sad um sad state of affairs and you know just because your values and
your views are different doesn't mean my message isn't isn't the same you know my message everything that i do
is about positivity it's about mindset it's about bringing people together you look at sas who dares wins what does it
do makes people realize what they're capable of makes them find themselves it brings people together brings families together you know mutiny
teamwork brings people together escape you know straight talking being honest and open
and and it makes it makes you feel good it brings you together it unites people
because they can be open and honest with themselves and therefore they know what they're capable of self belief starts to kick in and they
feel good about it's bringing people together right and that is you'd be inhumane
really to to not think like that to not want to help people out to not want to so the message is is is always the same
but it's this bit in the middle right don't you ever get pushed to one side you can't have this sort of in the
middle opinion of well actually my values are the same as yours you know i'm all about positive change
yeah okay so what why are you saying my values don't fit with yours because i'm about positive change look at my message for the last
five six years since i've been in the media it's positive change unity look at what i do everything i do
whether it's my books my tours my tv programs everything is about bringing people together
bringing the best out of people so just because this in-between bit i my
views are different and mine are probably truthful which people don't want to hear the truth it's like right bounce off to one
side and then and then you start to get cancelled but what's the answer though like so i i you
Cancel culture
know i hear we've heard pierce morgan talk a lot about this as well and other people talk about how you know if you don't perfectly fit the
the views or the perfect hashtag of the of the left or whatever then um you're
basically being cancelled in culture and i i genuinely this is a [ __ ] probably the most genuine question i've ever asked in this
podcast because it's one that i'm thinking about all the time is i also see this happening my views don't always fit the left or the right
and sometimes like in the black lives matter moment i posted on my instagram saying it was actually my best performing post of all
time i said because there was this whole narrative around like silence is violence and if you're not saying anything then you're a racist
i did a post saying like that's obviously [ __ ] yeah as i said it's unpopular black opinion if someone doesn't post a black square
on their instagram doesn't make them a racist people process things in completely different in fact the most unnatural
reaction to trauma is to take to social media so like and that absolutely it was it was it didn't fit the like silences
violence narrative and and my ability and i like of course that's [ __ ] true like i mean it doesn't it doesn't fit i
understand right but it's no one not one individual in the millions and millions of views
that that posted could tell me there was one slide in that nine that was they disagreed with but it was the
feeling that i wasn't wearing the football kit of the of the left that made some people go
you're an awful person to sleep and then i'd go why they'd go yeah yeah exactly you see their minds
ticking and ticking you're like tell me tell me what's wrong with the post they go oh you know what sorry
yeah and and i i i think well i'm i know i'm not going to change so when i look into my future i go at
some point i'm going to get cancelled because my brand is building i've got some stuff coming up on in the media and i'm thinking i know i'm
not going to change so what's the answer here like i'm always going to and i know that it's getting more is the answer this is why you're here
yeah i know it's like it's like it's like what the answer is to be true to who you are yeah and just take the intention
and it's like it's you know that's the one thing i've always fall back on
is just knowing you know if you're an idiot you know if you're irritating people you know if you're not a good
person and then ultimately you know you're going to get what's coming to you and you probably deserve it
but i know that i'm a good person i know my foundations i'm polite and respectful
you know i don't go out to offend ever go out to offend i hate confrontation
because of the way that i know that i can deal with confrontation it frightens me to get into that situation because i
know what i'm capable of okay so i don't ever i'm over polite i'm over respectful
because i think people should be treated like that now i like to be treated like that i wasn't treated like that when i started off in my army career and i know
what it feels like okay and i never would never want anyone to to experience that so i'm over polite
and i'm over respectful and i've always fall back on that i always look at myself in the mirror and i go and
you're you i know i'm a good person and that are the foundations that i've built that's my foundations that's
who i am okay so you can knock my bricks down i will but guess what i will keep
building and building and building and you can knock it even if you knock them down to the foundations
i can fall back on being true to myself and there's no more liberating steve
liberating feeling than that of being true to who you are going do you know what i'm not going to fit into that agenda
i'm not going to fit into that box i'm not going to squeeze myself in there to make myself feel uncomfortable
for your agenda because that's not who i am would you rather lose at all yeah 100 because i've got my foundations i've got
my foundations i will always build steve always build and this part of the building
is so high now that can you cancel me crack on because i guarantee you i just keep building this side this side of
this side decide because the people that know me know who i am and someone said this to me with all the
stuff that's been going on lately um you know i've had some sponsors i've
cancelled i've had some tv programs that i've kind of crack on but the people that by my side the
sponsors and the channels and the production companies that by my side that have worked for me saying and
we have the privilege of knowing you and that wrong accord to me though i'm like they have the privilege of
knowing me and i think to myself wow you've got the privilege of knowing i've got the privilege of knowing myself
because i know who i am and i'm glad i'm glad i gave you that privilege and it's not being big headed i'm glad i
gave you that privilege of knowing me because you know that this is just a storm of words
you know that this is just media hype you know this is just fake news you know this isn't real you know yeah i've maybe got a little bit of a
fiery side to me but you know you're getting that with me you know i'm rough around the edges
so yeah and i'm happy to you know to to to cut a few of the edges but those edges are still going to be there
do you know what i mean so when they said that to me and it's something that will stick with me
forever and it's from a very very good sponsor you know um very much to do with my books and i can
just and i remember sitting back and just taking that breath and going keep doing what you're doing then you're doing the right thing and then this last
week you know so many doors have opened production companies calling me
channels calling me um you know and you hear about it you hear about oh you know you get cancelled then
that's your career done and but then you've got your peers morgan's you've got your your jeremy clarkson's
and now you've got your aunt middleton's okay and
it just goes to show that i'm doing the right thing and that actually yeah i'm not gonna fit i'm not gonna be
comfortable with with everyone and i'm not gonna be their cup of tea well that's fine because
guess what i don't want to work with you if i get questioned one little bit about my
who i am like i said before if i get questioned one little bit about who i am by any brands any sponsors any channels then i will
not work with them i will say listen thank you very much it's obviously
you know not the right match um you go on and do your thing and i'll go on and do my thing because i will always
go on and do my thing and that building can completely drop to the foundations but when you're honest with yourself and
you know who you are those foundations are solid you will always have something to build from
but when you're not honest with yourself and everything comes crumbling down and you have no foundations to fall on
you're [ __ ] that's when you're in trouble that's when you start to go well i won't say that i won't act like this i
won't do this and i won't do that and that's when you become someone else that's when you become fake to who you
are and guess what desperate times then you're like a wounded animal
and guess what you're probably going to be right at the back of the pack for the rest of your life the
psychological impact of living a life that isn't true to yourself and i mean this is why people have these
like midlife crises when they've even in like the professional world where they've you know their mum and dad have told them to go and be a
whatever a banker or a lawyer they don't want to be they want to be a [ __ ] dancer or whatever and then they get mid-life crisis and
you look at throughout psychology i talk about this a little bit my book you know if you look at certain communities like the lgbtq
community their suicide rates are so so high amongst those groups because a lot of them have been
oppressed in a way where they can't live their true life they can't be their identity so they've had to
live a lie that's live a fake life and then you see suicide rates go up because that is a form of torture and this is when i asked you the
question about you know would you rather lose at all um one would one would actually maybe even if i question myself say well
what are you losing yeah if you're losing tv shows and you're losing things that aren't true to yourself is it a loss you know it's not a loss
because you will always find something that fits you dude i mean if you have the passion
and the drive and the ambition and the positivity of knowing who you are and ultimately
the world is your oyster it's like you know people have this impression of me that i'm this
hard-faced drill sergeant non-accepting person i am the complete
opposite go and be the [ __ ] you want to be that's my message if that's what then don't let anyone
force you into into saying anything doing anything or being anyone else be yourself but this is the side that people don't
see of you and this but this is my personal side steve i people see what they want to see the
media will write what they want to write they will they will make you they will make you out to be who they
want you to be but you can't put all of that into a hashtag you've got to characterize yourself in 10 letters yeah and this is
the problem with with issues that are complex and nuanced and there's different layers and you if it doesn't fit into a hashtag
then and this is the football team analogy as well quick interjection before we get back to the podcast just want to say that as you
know because i've talked about it a few times on this podcast i'm probably one of the biggest users in the world of a website called fiverr.com
f i v e r r dot com i use it for everything whether it's my
podcast or whether it's my personal brand content whether it's my business or other projects that i'm doing and this week i've used it again i've
used it to make a website called katana which is my investment company people don't know this my old company was called social chain and katana or
katana is the italian word for chain that's the inspiration keep that to yourself um but it's just another example of how
you can use fiverr to help you expand your capabilities as an entrepreneur as a content creator
and i've managed to get a website up for my investment company katana in the space of two and a half days and it cost me 400
quid typically that would cost tens of thousands of pounds and typically it would take months that's the power of fiverr allowing you
to quickly and affordably extend the capabilities of your team of your personal brand and achieve things that you might not have been able
to otherwise i want to talk though going back to your you know when you started in the military one thing i find really interesting is the guy that
Cutting myself off emotionally
was running around drinking boozing getting in trouble for him then to go into the military and
pass with flying colours is like a massive contradiction in my mind i'm like one appears to be a guy that's kind of out
of control the other one and and seemingly lacking the appreciation of authority and then the other guy is one
that's able to do what he's told and follow orders and and and how did you achieve such that's
what they want that's what they need they need the animal on the battlefield they need
the aggression they need the violence
because ultimately on the battlefield you counter violence with extreme violence you know there's
zero tolerance to violence in sydney street in society nowadays you show any form of violence you can end up behind bars been there
but in the military you you counter violence with extreme violence you you counter anger with extreme anger
and you're that's needed i i needed to be that person on the battlefield i needed to
to have to cut myself off from any emotional sort of feelings any emotional you know sort of
um discrepancies because
they were the missions that i went on now i was hunting down taliban commanders you know i was
getting into [ __ ] [ __ ] storms to firefights every week every couple you know two
three times a week i needed to put to call on those demons to come to the forefront of who i was to
get the job done and then switch it you're expected to switch it because
one moment you're kicking the door down you know taking out enemy combatants the next
next door you're kicking the door down there's women and children in there so you you live on that side or you live on
that side and then when you get the two confused
you know you i might be in afghanistan best man put me on camp you know
well you can't be doing that and well what who the [ __ ] do you want i mean you can't be doing that you can't be you know getting into fights downtown
you can't be you know getting you know i just get into a hell of a lot of fights you know it can help ruin my military career because you know
but then three tours of afghanistan are done almost back to back perfect out there man boom boom boom
boom boom so what what animal do you want you know and it's okay to be able to flip from one to the other when when you're here
but when you live on the complete opposite sides of the spectrum you're gonna get confused every now and
then you're going to be met with a situation in society where you're met with aggression you're met with violence and this
demon takes over you know what it is is it's a moment of madness it's just a confusion confliction between the two
you know and it's between the two two people and sometimes it goes whack yeah and before you know
it that crossover is too much they're both like trained to survive but in different
environments in completely different environments and sometimes those environments you know you're forced to act and those environments get switched yeah and it's
literally like a flash in front of your eyes it's like bang bang [ __ ] i used the wrong person there i
used the wrong environment it's it's and and that's that's the world that i live in that's the world that i lived in that
was my life that was you know i used to come back from from afghanistan and you know i've got four four four
four children at home i'm a fifth one from a previous relationship who's 19 but um used to
come home i remember coming back from afghanistan and my daughter was born
she's 13 now my daughter was born um 10 days before i left for a six-month tour in
afghanistan so she was born so i didn't know her and i came back six months later and she was like nearly seven months um
and then i went straight on special forces selection so for another six months so i came back after like a year really
of not really being at home to a to a one-year-old daughter who
barely recognized me you know she would push me away she would you know and i'd interact and i'll be
playing dolls on on the floor barbies and my wife came in one day and i was playing with these barbies and she
thought i'd lost the plot she's like she's like you know got these barbies together trying to make her
laugh trying to make her smile because for the last year she's just seen this pent up
war machine you know and i've come back and i'm not i'm not very easy to deal with you know
during those transitions you know i need a bit of time what do you mean by that you're not very easy to deal with in those transitions
well you come back from you can't just take a hit even though i can do it i can take your head off put
a different head on but that transition of
kicking doors down to being back with a family i need even now when i come back off of filming
when i come back i need before we actually start getting on again you know before i start settling back into the into
into the family it takes about two weeks and again me and my partner are the best most compatible partners in the world
the teamwork that we have is absolutely amazing you know hence why i've been with her for 16 years been
married for 14. um but it still takes that two-week period
for me of me breaking her her routine of me coming in you know taking over
everything you know with the kids taking taking the kids to school taking ruining her her life that she's built i come in like
a storm and it takes two weeks before that storm normally calms down and we go all right
you know i cannot argue in to this but you know just disagreements just control issues can you know it's it's
like two worlds colliding right and then after the two weeks as everything settles i'm away again
i might be on tour i might be like i'm in australia for two months now it's like so it's that constant communication or
that constant you know crossing over of of worlds that you need to really sort of mold together
and as my life is getting more and more and i'm not in these high octane situations i'm not in these life
or death situations um it's becoming easier and easier
you talk you know i had actually a military commando sat in in the seat as well who talked about his experiences and
when he came back from war he was talking to me about the ptsd he suffered and um just being around the house and
you know seeing the tin can stacked on the shelf at home and and like you know barking at his wife because they weren't straight and things
like that and feeling that you know feeling some of the disciplines of all coming home with him you i've seen you talk on this topic so
i know that you know you've you've handled that in a different way but um what are some of the the things
Whats the worst thing that you brought back from war?
that have come come back with you from war that you don't like or that you think aren't helping you in
your in your personal life um they're two different worlds
you know you deal with dark humor dark banter to get you through certain
situations and that dark humor and dark banter and dark way of talking is a norm to you
because you live and breathe that and sometimes that comes out you know
and only when i'm doing a military style show you know you you come out you might say something which is a for me
probably a throwaway comment or a bit of banter then you realize there's a hundred of crew members listening and there's
nothing you know it just might be i might say something about someone or my it's never direct you know it's always an indirect conversation that we have um
it's that military banter that i [ __ ] hate sometimes i hear myself talking like a military man and i hate it i
might say military words hoofing honking was you know there's loads of them out there
um and i think to myself why are you talking like that but it's just come it just comes out because i might find myself in in a
high octane situation in a stressful situation in a in an aggressive situation and a violent situation which which i revert back to
what i know works which is this ultimately this military person but then i think [ __ ] you know i'm not
in a military environment i'm not in in in a i'm in society you know i've got you know
and it's controlling that that i find really difficult um but knowing also acknowledging that
it needs to be controlled you know i'm not in the military anymore you know and i always hate this once a
marine always a marine you know you get people go hey once a marine always a marine i'm like i was a marine 12 years ago 10 years ago
you know now i'm i'm a media um tv presenter i'm now an extinguished author i'm now
you know i like to say like you know about mindset my mindset girl go around do my tours you know i'm in a completely
different space but i have to pull upon this young soldier every now and then in order to get the
job done because i know that that works you know i know that if i do that but i just need to fine-tune it i need to
buffer it around the edges which again is a work in progress you know i i put my hands up when i go [ __ ] hell do
you know what i mean yeah i shouldn't have said that i shouldn't have done that you know and i'm the first one to admit it
but people have to realize that listen it's it's it's a work in progress it's not
something i can change overnight you need to understand me you need to understand who i am
um in order to to acknowledge that okay well [ __ ] hell yeah that was a bit uncomfortable to see some of the things
that we do with the recruits you know they're like [ __ ] you know and she's like he's on on his knees and
you're you're literally you know saying to him that you stay there you know if you think you're not worthy
you know if you if you're a piece of [ __ ] blah blah blah but it's hard for people to see that and to watch that but ultimately there's
always a positive motivator behind that so that's where people i think get get
confused is like negativity is a great fuel it's a great source to use to get
to where you need to be but only if there's a positive motivator ahead of it so you can't use negativity to get
through a situation if there's not a positive motivator because all you'll do is you'll feel off in the
negative lane because there's no positive motivators to aim towards it's like a plow like i say the plow is is the positive
motivator and the fuel is the negative with aggression whether it's revenge whether it's you know prove
people wrong whether it's you know these are all things that that that fuel you but you
be sure that there's always a positive motivator so when i'm talking like that to the recruits what i'm doing it's believe it or not
to get the best out of them to make them realize what they're capable of make them bring their attributes and and and um
personality to the forefront so they can identify who they are and a lot of people they bring that to
the forefront or i fit that mirror on them and they look at themselves and they go oh [Music] no i don't like what i see they vw or
they go or they leave yeah so that's what i was going to say it's also a filter it's a filter and that's what a selection process is
and that's but that's how i it's not only what selection process is that's how i live my life steve
i'm i'm so brutally honest with what i do in situations i find myself in
and the environment that that i choose to be in is it and it's that brutal honesty it's that
brutal sort of truth
that the motivator is always becoming a better version of who you are of of learning something growing from it
and becoming a better version of who you were yesterday and how important is it to take personal responsibility for your outcomes in life
How important is personal responsibility?
because there's a growing culture of blame and you know victimhood and i see this as well as someone that
um you know the the best thing that probably happened to me is if i was successful and i had parents
that were rich and i had loads of money and i got a degree and i got these great grades people would immediately go well no steve can't tell
us anything because he got to hand it to him fortunately i was the opposite i'm a black kid born in africa
kicked out of school dropped out of university after one lecture got no degree parents are bankrupt so i can talk a
little bit more about like personal responsibility without being discredited people say oh well of course you [ __ ] say that and like yeah
but i see this growing culture because i was a kid in moscow in manchester stealing pizzas to feed myself only i
don't know seven eight years ago and i know that my mindset and the
the behavior that my mindset created is the reason i'm sat here now like of course there's luck timing i
understand that but my mindset increased my probability of being sat here now so when i preach that to people
especially people that don't want to take take personal responsibility or like you know victimhood or blame keeps them
nice and safe and comfortable and it means they don't have to look in the mirror yeah they go vague [ __ ] you [ __ ] you guy
but it's hard to attack me it's hard to attack me because what you're going to say yeah you know what privilege i had the
privilege i had was moving to this country as a baby but that's a privilege privilege of knowing who you are yeah so you can take
all that income yeah yeah because they haven't got the private privilege of knowing you yeah right but you have the privilege of
knowing yourself because guess what you've been there you've done it you've got the t-shirt you've been honest with yourself you you
you realize you know you realize your mistakes you realize your areas of your way you learn from failure you grow from
it you become a better version of who you are so that's what that's why i say that that statement of we we have the privilege of
knowing you is so powerful because ultimately that's what you fall back on all the time that's why you can take it that's why
you can take that take that and you can it will bounce off you just like that's your negativity that's your
it's not nothing to do with me that's that's you and it bounces off me like it bounces off you but the moment you step into that victim
mentality that's when you feel that the world owes you everything that's when you feel like
that you know why is he why is he where he is and i'm not there why has he got this and i haven't got
this why oh right well i could quite happily
go back and not be cancelled okay for example if i went guys yeah
really really sorry about that but i suffered from a bit from ptsd you know the death of my father you know
it's it's like [ __ ] hell it's it's like one i don't suffer from ptsd
how many times have i had that thrown at me steve going and if you say you suffer from ptsd who can question
that well no one can question it actually wait wait there's one person that can question it
me because i haven't got [ __ ] ptsd well no no no no you haven't but if you say that then
you know the papers will do this the um the the courts will do this people will start to go oh well actually
you know the stuff that he's been through and he's seen he's done he's witnessed yeah of course listen throw him another bone
give him another chance i feel sorry for him [ __ ] that jeremy and it's like when i went to
prison i left the military went to prison got into a violent violent altercation
yep violence on violence of course put my hand up 100 i'll do my time my lawyer said to me and
do you want to go to prison i was like of course i don't want to go to prison who wants to go to prison he said well listen he is you're out he
went say you've got ptsd if you say you got ptsd he said i guarantee you that's what he
said to me guarantee you you will not go to prison you'll get suspended sentence you'll have to go and do a couple of courses
um and then you'll be at home with the family and i had four kids and a and a wife
actually at the time i had two children and a wife at home that relied on me
i couldn't lie to myself i thought don't get me wrong i'm not gonna lie to you i thought to myself do you know what
that sounds appealing because who can tell me that i haven't got ptsd but then the question always goes back
to you because only you hold the answer steve only you have that answer only i
knew that answer i could lie to myself and live a lie and [ __ ] knows where i'll be now
right i might be a bloody ptsd with a counselor i might be you know but
i would have gone down that road for years right so i've got two years suspended since
two years of going down a road that wasn't me going down that road of pure lies every step i took wouldn't be a
true one i always say to people people will mould you and direct you in life
you know that's what people are there for good people anyway they try and mold but if that first footstep that you take
is not a true one i said do not take it and the only person that knows that
is you and i always always always go back to that do i feel
comfortable taking this footstep yes i do the rest of the world doesn't
well guess what i feel comfortable doing it but yeah but that she he's gonna have something to say about it she's gonna have something to say about
they're gonna have something to say about it i don't care is it true to me go back to who i am
yeah boom i take it and i deal with whatever comes at me because it can bounce off me right because
as we spoke about it's like it's like we know who we are we know what we're about we know we know we're good people
so i'm willing to take that bang bang bang and it does steve it does literally bounce off me but also it when
it does get into me because the moment it starts you know when it gets over it does get into you
once i sit down and process it it fuels me i feel like thanos you know it's like
it's just like because i'm being true to who i am and all this negative and i'm thinking right just just boom because guess what i preach
positivity till it comes home i everything i believe is down to a positive mindset and how you perceive
the way that you think um and the way you know we have this default mindset which is negative you know everything's
like what if this what if that won't do that because of this and mine's the opposite mind's like right the best outcome is this this if
anything comes along i deal with it okay and it's that mindset that i always
always fall back on and it's and again it's it's one of those i just find so liberating that i can just
just think that way but i put myself in the firing line i put myself constantly in the firing
line to constantly challenge myself to constantly flip these negatives into positives without
negativity you wouldn't have positivity it wouldn't exist it doesn't you know it's a polar
opposite so people say so i challenge negativity i love
negativity because i will challenge it and challenge it and challenge it i love the work ethic and the psychological
sort of resilience it takes to challenge negativity there's a lot of people that negativity
comes and they ignore it or they bat it off they run away but the moment you dig into it and you dig into it and you dig and it takes
time it takes time as well isn't it it tests you right and you dig into it and all of a sudden you see a little light
you see a little glimpse of positivity and that's all you're looking for is that one little seed you grab that
boom bank that and then you grow that seed until you find the next one and there's nothing more rewarding in
Flipping a negative into a positive
this world than flipping a negative into a positive because if you're willing
and again if you're willing to work hard enough and you're willing to take the [ __ ] and the [ __ ] uh and the [ __ ] and everything that
surrounds negativity if you're willing to dive into the center of it and you're willing to work
in order to flip it into a positive then i guarantee you you you will find a positive in it
and i guarantee you that would be the most rewarding thing you ever do it's like failure it's exactly the same
with failure i look at failure and it's just it's like a challenge to me it's like you can't do that and you don't know
nothing about that you're going to fail at that well listen i'll tell you what i probably will fail at it but i'm not scared to commit because i know that the
moment i commit to failure i take two or three or four steps into
failure and i might go yeah i haven't achieved that but those three or four steps i've taken
that that's that's what i bank those moments in the moment that's what i bank a lot of people they
they might take on failure and they might fail their objective and they think oh i failed that therefore i'm a failure
and they forget how far they've come that this is completely automatically written off because they're going oh i failed that
mean it's like yeah i won't go near that again that becomes part of your identity i'm a failure i'm a failure
yeah so they anytime failures that they think their safety bubble or victim but whatever they won't go
anywhere near it but i love it when negativity comes along and failure comes along
you know i'm so intrigued on what i'll get out of it i'm so intrigued what i learned from it because when you learn you grow when you
grow you become a better version of who you are it's just that it's that knock-on effect that it has and failure is exactly that
failure isn't going anywhere i found up to now in my life i'm gonna fail to the day i die so you so you so you every single one of
you in here is gonna fail whether you like it or not it is everyday part of life as much as it is breathing
it's surrounded by us so why do we ignore it if it's part of who we are and part of part of part of
what's what makes the world tick then why don't we use it to our advantage because the perceived cost of
failure whatever that might be you know jenny at work is going to think i'm not so whatever and this person is going to
write this about me the perceived cost especially in the short term feels greater it feels and that's the same force of
like the pc brigade or that you know it's like it's better just to stay in your lane today
and to just like put your head down be quiet because people think and this is the where it's
wrong people think that's the safest place to be reflecting on my own journey when i went to university
and i knew that i this was a piece of [ __ ] and that i needed to quit if i was actually gonna become an entrepreneur like it's calling my mom and then
telling her i'm dropping out and her telling me never to speak to her again right that was the resistance that was
the moment where life goes stay in your [ __ ] lane right yeah but when people get you were so you were so and
then you're but my brain was so clear the biggest risk the biggest failure
would have been staying in university and living a life not true to myself some people people say oh you're so you have so much
courage courage would have been staying yeah right and i think that's the that's the thing of course my mom says i'd never
speak to me again and i don't speak to her for two years but look at the upside of living my even if i'd failed like look at the upside of
being myself and i think that's pretty much what i'm hearing from what you're saying is like there's this you know
the there is the short time resistance where it's like oh my god if you fail you're going to lose it all so i know you'll lose it all if you don't try
exactly how the thing about it is the way that your mindset thinks then it is it's not a complicated way of thinking
it's like it's it's so simple really so simple stupid that it's almost
incomprehendable um and everything that i do and you just said it then and make what you
just said that makes complete sense to me every single word you said about that story i'm like that yes
it's like it's obviously like why wouldn't you do that right but sometimes the most obvious things that
are the hardest to process the hardest to to to achieve and with my books and and my tours
you know i don't get people coming off my tours going and you know i've tapped into this part of my brain now thank you for this it's
like they come off my tools i'll read my books and go it was always in there yes you just gave me this kick yourself
moment where i'm just like how did i not see that how did i not you put it in such layman terms because i'm
i'm a simple man i mean i'm not i'm not an intellect i'm not a bookworm i'm i'm i'm i'm a simpleton i'm a simple man i
keep things the way that i get to my answers is good bad right wrong positive
negative yes no i mean i keep it and it's listening but it's listening to who i am
and it's it's the most simplest way of of of getting to where you need to be
but we let the constraints and the [ __ ] and the complications
of society and what other people think cloud all of that
i almost see it like two dials right one of them is this voice inside which everyone has in them they say go and dance in the hills of costa rica
and then there's this other really loud dial right the sound dial and it's society and your mom and your
whatever and that one's saying go be a [ __ ] lawyer and shut up right and in all of our lives i think one dial
is a little bit higher than the other and the the the challenging thing but the most important thing you can do if
you want to reach your potential be happy avoid mental health issues avoid midlife crises is to like turn up the internal dial and
just try and get that that other dial which is society's voice right down to to [ __ ] zero
right and i and i just do you know i just feel if everyone could just do that in their own lives which is not easy to
do because listening to this internal voice is going to come with real resistance people are going to cancel you they're
going to my mum's going to not speak to me for years right but that's the short time cost for
a long term gain and as is the way with comfort i see like comfort and like avoiding with that resistance is a it
looks like a friend it's a short-term friend but a long-term enemy and if you you know if you had if you in
the moments where you've said you've been like cancelled quote-unquote um had you caved
short-term friend probably would still have a show or two yeah of course long-term belongs and i say to people
what you've got to realize is that you are with yourself 24 hours a day for the rest of your life
no one else can even come close to that no one else will will even come close to
that so you are with yourself your whole life people they come and go
situations they come and go so ultimately you've got to live with yourself first
before you try and live with anyone else before you try and live with any situation before you try and put yourself into any environment that's
what i say to people when they go well i'm like you're with yourself 24 hours a day to the day you die nothing comes close to that no one comes
close to being anywhere near that that's the person you've got on that's who you are yeah so that's the person who you've got to honor that's the
person that you've got to make make happy boss that's the boss right that's the person it's impossible to please
that voice and that voice right so like but please yourself and and ultimately you know what comes out
it will you know should should be war should be authentic should be true so and then you'll find your belonging
you'll find your circle you'll find you're like-minded people you'll find your your your yeah you'll find your belonging it's like
you know you must know as you get more successful as you you
know you start thinking you start changing start evolving your mindset more and more and more and more
your circle gets smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller i'm happy with that you know i'm i'm happy with that because
not that i'm above anyone or below anyone you know we're just on different ends of the spectrum okay because
guess what i'm going to keep evolving my mindset's going to keep changing i'm going to keep getting wise i'm going to keep getting more knowledgeable i'm
going to keep being honest with myself and for me that's my purpose in life nothing out there you know it's nice to
have the nice cars and nice houses don't get me wrong it's nice to have money i've had no money and now i've got
money i know which side i'd rather be on okay that's all but that's all that comes part and parcel with being true to who
you are um and my purpose in life
which is i will never achieve but which is i find fascinating is
trying to get the best possible version of ant middleton trying to get to that okay but knowing
that i never get to that answer because i'll be on this constant progression of becoming a better version of who i am
but i never become the best version of who i am because that's when you're perfect that's when
you're 100 you and that's not real it doesn't exist but the
purpose of getting closer and closer and closer and closer to that answer
is such a fascinating journey for me that there's nothing that comes close to it
there's nothing that comes close to it and whether i have the the counselling or the shows that keep coming or the tv
production companies that call me now and the channels that go whether i have failures or whatever it may be all of
these everything that bounces in towards me is a is something to learn from
and it's a lesson and it's gonna i'm gonna learn from it and i'm gonna grow from it and i'm gonna
get closer and closer to the answer closer and closer to
to my objective closer and closer to my purpose and that is to try and get as close as i can to
being the best version of myself and i'm fascinated with it i'm addicted
by it i'm i'm addicted to it i'm i'm obsessed with it um so like i said when i get that thanos
moment i'm like bring all this negativity at me bring it because i'm just churning away
it doesn't mean i'm always happy you know i'm not always happy you know you know i don't go around sprinkling
positive fairy dust i'm not that type of preacher right but i preach you know working on your
mind to make it positive you know you know challenging negative situation thinking negative situation i've got a tackle
with a positive mindset make a conservative effort to train your mindset to think positively to flip the script
from this default mindset where everyone you know thinks thinks negatively um and i love working
at that i love working out so all of this stuff that you give me it does once i got because i go quiet like this
last week has been a media storm and i'll go quiet and i'll be with with my family i'll be with my management
they're like aren't you quiet i'm quiet because i'm churning away at negativity i'm not unhappy don't
get me wrong listen but i need to be left alone for two three days maybe a week
because there's so much negativity coming in and i'm chipping away trying to find the light no nothing there and i find the light trying to find boom
bang and then i bank this positivity and then the next week i'll be boom
back to ant do i mean back to this positive naturally positive person because i've trained my mind to think
like that i'm always in a positive head space um but sometimes i'll go quiet doesn't
mean i'm always happy so don't get don't get positivity mixed up with happiness yeah yeah because they're two completely different things and happiness comes
from yeah in knowing who you are you know it comes from from being true to you are knowing
who you are and you could be the poorest man in the world and you could be there you know you could have no one or nothing but you
could still be happy you know you could be the richest man in the world and you know you know you know the script um one of them's like a general sense of
optimism that i'm positive about the future the other one's just like internal contentment and and um but our moods change yeah of
course you know we have [ __ ] days bad days whatever but we're optimistic and tight right yeah one of the questions i really wanted to
How to have a mindset like you?
ask you because of what's going on in the world with this whole pandemic in covid is i was thinking as i was like brushing my teeth or whatever this morning i was
thinking there's a ton if my audience could ask you one thing probably would be around the fact that the world changed
this year a lot of people's lives were uprooted they lost their businesses their jobs whatever and then i thought you know ants
probably well i for sure have been in situations where you felt like whether whether it's on the battlefield
or whatever that this was a fight that you where the odds were against you yeah and in those moments there's winners and
losers and i you know you always talk about mindset what is the mindset that people need
in these moments where the odds don't look like they're they're very much in their favor from that you've seen from the
battlefield where you've emerged victorious because you know you didn't you didn't indulge in victimhood or whatever
and you and you yeah does that make sense yeah it 100 makes sense um for me it hasn't
it's about embracing change you know majority of people they live their life
on autopilot or they they live in the void i call it um where everything around them is changing
you know the world is constantly changing everything around us is constantly changing whether it's
you know climate control whether it's you know in the way that we think the way that
we're evolving the way that the world is going the way that animals are evolving the way that the sea is
is is encroaching or you know decreasing whatever it may be everything is changing around us and we
are designed to change with it so what we're actually doing is we're actually going against
the grain when we become complacent when we get comfortable
when we get into one sort of situation and we stay in that situation it's going we go we're working in the opposite way
that the world should be evolving we should be constantly changing we should be constantly evolving we should
be constantly moving forward you know look at my career i've gone from the army to the marines to the
special forces to the media to to books to authors to literacy to
business it's like i'm cons i love love change i love
being put in a situation where i'm literally chucked in the deep end with dive boots on and i have to tread water
i love that because it's so challenging and it's so so stimulating that you're forced to
change you're forced to think of something different you're forced to to to do something differently you're forced to
change the way that you you approach something because you've been put in a situation where
it's been forced upon you but when it's not forced upon you when it's not forced upon you um which
the world does it forces it upon us but when it's not forced upon you when you when you get comfortable then you get you fall into this voyage you
fall into this complacency you fall into to not moving along with the world
but is that those your demons again because i'm thinking the reason why aunt loves to be chucked
into the water with his dive boots on is because you relish challenge and this
is comes maybe links to the victimhood point and a general problem in culture and society where
people like comfort cotton wool yeah a lot of people are being brought up now with cottonwood not designed we're not designed to be
comfortable we're not designed to have cotton walls wrapped around us it's society it's the restraints and the shackles of society
that is forcing us to be like this it's not who we are look how far we've
come you know look out look at look at just through history how far we've come and i feel like that
we're actually devolving now i actually feel that we've got to a point where we're going backwards
where you know you used to be survivor of the fitness yes you could push a rock in front of your cave you know i mean to survive you know
used to be at the you know the top of the food chain um you know it's we're not designed
to be comfortable we're not designed to be wrapped up in cotton wool we're not designed to be shackled down and that's
why there's so many problems in the world right now is because of these shackles
is because of these chains it's because of the restraints that society is putting on us it's forcing us into into mental illness
it's forcing us to to act in ways that we're not designed to act in is forcing us to to switch off to the
most powerful tool that the universe that's in the universe your minds we're forced to just put it on [ __ ]
dormant you know that be a it's it's we're going against the grain of what we're supposed to do
of who we're supposed to be on how we're supposed to act and how is it um supposed to evolve so when when
you've got this going around like this and then this stops is
it you you there's a synchronocity that's not working in in in partnership with each other you
know without us on this planet this planet wouldn't be as evolved as it was without the planet then we wouldn't be evolved as it was
you know and what what's actually happening is is you've got this this this these two forces that
are grinding against each other rather than working together with each other in synchronocity i i i
was reading this crazy thing the other day and i think i've talked about this maybe once before but it shows that um
the life expectancy in the uk and the us fell for two years in a row and everything was like last year the
year before whatever for the first time ever and they look at the numbers as to why the life expectancy has fallen to the first time ever and it's because
of like the opioid crisis people who are getting addicted to drugs and then they say why are people getting more and more addicted to drugs and they
say well because they're lacking meaning in their life and when people like meaning that the science is showing whether you do it to
animals you take away their meaning i i talked i think in the last podcast and i i hate to repeat myself but i also
don't care about these rats and i [ __ ] because they're right about my bucket so fascinated by it they put a rat in a cage and take everything from it
and they give it the option of drinking hair and water and normal water it becomes a drug addict they then introduce a partner some
stimulation some running wheels some other things and they give it hair and water or normal water and it doesn't choose the heroin
water it doesn't become a drug addict just by inserting meaning into its life it avoids the heroin and then you think okay so
what's going on in the society you say well people are lacking challenge and meaning because we're
trying to create a culture maybe where challenge and meaning are a bad thing and and that's actually having an
adverse effect because as you say very eloquently like that's not who we are you know i love how you just put that steve because you've just
put my thoughts into a scientific sort of into scientific form because again i'm
not an intellect i'm not a bookworm you know it's it's like i have psychiatrists come up to me and go where did you just study and well but not
honestly what brexit and i'm like no no this is all every single little ounce of me is through
life experience i come from the university of life you know what i've just said there's it's strange that
and that's why i love talking to people like yourself because i've put that as in how i'm thinking i
haven't read anything from and you've just put it into a whole sort of scientific and it's like that's exactly that it's exactly what
i've just said and you've just put it into into something that's been proven and that's that's the way that i think that's the way that i
that's the way that i perceive life and it's funny because as you say you're not you didn't see it i'm not an intellectual but i've sat here with
intellectuals and they've said the exact same thing like johanna hari he wrote a book on this nine reasons why people are getting depressed and anxious
best-selling book he sat here and he said the exact same thing so when i hear it twice or three times and then i read
it another i think these are just fundamental truths and when i get to that point where you've been you've walked a
different walk of life to that that intellect who's wrote a book on it but you've both arrived at the same place
that's going in my [ __ ] like in my diary forever you know that's that's super interesting as well
it's like you know you you but you can't take away that you know you can't
you can't unwrite that because it's written within evolution
it's written within the way the world it has evolved it's written in the way that we think it's written in in the organs the
muscles and the body that we have it's all here it's all [ __ ] present right now
yeah it's not in a book that we're going to read it it's [ __ ] happening right now it's here it's real
this energy source that you are your [ __ ] energy source where energy sources is synchronized with the planet which is
one big energy source it's one big ball and i'd have had a moment of clarity on
on when i was filming i've always felt connection with the earth you know i talk about
you know we can climb to the highest peak of the apex of the world mount everest we can climb to that because people said
yeah but we've had to do this this and this in order to get there you know working against the mountain i'm not know
the way that that mountain is formed is that's a foothold for you that's a that's an arm reach for you
that's you know it's that it's designed to work with you so don't look at a mountain and go off can i go
get up there it's working against me no no it's that little stone there that you put your foot that's helping you up to to to stand on on its apex it's
helping you up to stand on its summit and um i've always felt a connection with
the earth always always always you know when i put my feet in it when i put my hands in it you know i belong here you know and i
have this sort of i have this theory that people think that you know that if you put the planet as a as a as
Spirituality
a tree where they think we're just birds that come and sit on the tree and i think we're just visitors and then and
then we go we're not we're we're the leaves yeah we're the leaves of the tree i mean and then you know we grow in that
we're part of you know we're part of this evolution it's spiritual but yeah yeah i'm not a spiritual person but maybe you
are but maybe your definition's wrong because i posted on my instagram last week yeah i did so we've just had it's funny my instagram
post literally says i've never thought of myself as a spiritual person because i don't resonate with like the hippie
stigma yeah yeah like i'm not that guy however the end it's one story right the end of it was like i if you
define as feeling somewhat connected to the world which i now do then i now consider myself to be
spiritual this was just one story and this was like three days ago because a lot of people do ask if i'm spiritual and i i always say no
but yeah maybe i am but it's that's that theory of of being there's a con you know
connection there's one currently from the other and when when that when you know we're the leaves yeah we're gonna fall off and there's gonna be new leaves
you know but everything recycles back into itself do you know when we don't just all of a sudden go up into you know
everything goes back into the earth everything really generally spiritual because i i went and googled it definition of spirituality
and the definition i read was like the feeling or belief that we are interconnected with the world
the stigma is the issue that's what alienates both of us from saying i'm a spiritual because we're not like hippies we're not like you know but we are we like i love
that you know what i mean so and i go about going back to this moment where i've where it just resonates you
know and the reason why i do all these things is i just want to reconfirm that my way
of thinking is is true is true to me is is why i do this you know
and that's why i put myself in these awkward situations because it just it gives a light bulb moment where i go
do you know what bloody hell you know i'm i'm on the right path i'm getting this right and um as i wait i was away filming
and i felt this you know i was out in the mountains in um in chile in the andes and i could just
feel a real connection you know like a like a real presence
you know and it's it's just a lovely lovely feeling and i can just remember just a an energy connection it was
really strange that it happened an energy connection and i was walking by i was walking a lot alongside of this mountain and i was walking
alongside i heard a big massive bang and i turned towards the mountain and i'm not joking it was
probably about 300 meters away so it's like you know and this bit of rock went
it must have passed no no word of a lie within two meters of me you know and a big one because the
mountains it's an energy source they're [ __ ] bursting they're literally like that
and the mountain every now and then and it's the first time i experienced it i heard about it but i've never experienced it and i went bang
and it nearly took my head off to the point where i was like [ __ ] health was incoming you know i
was like and then i realized i was like well just and you see a little bit of
mount mountain fall off by one bomb and it's where the energy the energy of that mountain and you know
unless you get out and about you see it's like and i thought to myself wow i remember
stopping and thinking i felt that before that even not that specific moment but i felt the energy so i felt
the connection there and then that was it's almost as if the mountain was talking to me going
what you feeling is right listen we are listen we are powerful we have a connection
without you there wouldn't be me without me that wouldn't be you and just that confirmation just makes me
realize wow you know this is this is this is powerful stuff this is you know
this is how you should be feeling once you're in tune with yourself and then and and and connected to the to
this planet then there's there's there's not much
that you feel that you can't do there's not much that phases you in life there's not much that you won't try and achieve there's no
there's not much that you won't achieve and i feel i feel sorry or because you can i can
talk about being in tune with with the planet and being you know
being connected to to mother earth but unless you are in tune with that then you just
think i'm talking bollocks you just think what the hell is he on about he's some spiritual idiot blah blah blah blah blah
so you know this is the personal life that i really keep to myself you know i've spoken a lot about it today which i've
never spoken about before but this is this is who i am i mean so there's there's so much more behind
what the media put out and what the what the papers put out and what the you know the media agenda is on what
they want you to be seen as and there's this whole life behind me that is
that i just that's the real me that's who i am so when any of this other stuff
that's made up by other people that comes in from from not within it is so easy for me
just to battle so easy for me just go bang bang bang but don't get me wrong sometimes i work harder at it to batter off
sometimes it does stick and you have to go all right but it's such a liberating feeling and
i'll always say to people and this is this this is my you know find out who
you are go on that journey not self-discovery because that sounds spiritual right go on that journey of of
finding your purpose of fun of becoming the best version of who you are because once you start that journey
you will get addicted to it it is fascinating and it will it will only serve you well he will only
serve you well because it's a life i want i want to live till i'm 150 because you say i live to
until i'm 50 a hundred 100 years isn't long enough i still want more i want to know more i want to i want to be on this
journey for them for as long as i can be on this journey this is what gives me longevity this is what gives me purpose
i want to be on this journey for as long as i can be and when i think the only setback is when i think you
know i've got another you know 50 60 years of it it sort of saddens me so uh
i'm hoping that by that stage we can we can live to be a bit bit more immortal a bit more a bit
more immortal oh yeah well listen um i think that's a really powerful place to end
and i think that's um that's something that i'll continue to point out i wanted to say thank you though because there are a few people that are
have the courage in this day and age to be themselves and to speak their mind and that and unfortunately it feels like a bit of a dying breed but you're one of those
people and having spent time with you before we started filming and during this conversation i got to know
i had the privilege of getting to know who you are a little bit as you say and um that's a person that i do respect one
that inspires me and reminds me of the importance of following my my truer self so i just wanted to say
thank you thank you for having this conversation today and thank you for being yourself save your gentleman thank you thank you

Transcription:

Intro
is the question everyone wants the answer to it what is the single biggest killer of
relationships in the modern age
let's talk about sex today's podcast is very very different but incredibly
incredibly important today i'm sitting down with kate moyle who is a sex therapist and a relationship therapist to talk
about some of the taboos topics which we don't normally discuss things like erectile dysfunction
sexual inadequacies issues we all have in our relationships and sex lives the single biggest killer of
relationships in 2021 sexual anxiety how to keep a sexual relationship exciting
and everything in between i'm going to share some very personal sexual stories that i've never shared before some of
the things i've gone well and some of the problems that i've had that have caused relationships that have meant the world to me to end this is a very
very honest open podcast today you know this is why this is called the diary of a ceo and kate is the perfect person
to put them to so i think you're going to enjoy this conversation i certainly did i feel very vulnerable sharing some of
these stories with you but as i always say just keep it to yourself so without further ado this is
the diary of a ceo i hope nobody's listening but if you are then please keep this to yourself
sex i think i think it's fair to say that everybody has some kind of
My sex partner did not like sex
challenge with sex at least some point you know at least at some point within their life and i am no different in fact my last
relationship which was a very i thought i i genuinely at one point thought that was going to be my wife
um the reason that relationship broke down was because of a sexual issue and a sexual issue
that showed up about seven or eight months into the relationship and um long story short i know this
isn't a therapy session but it kind of is as well um at some point seven eight months into
our relationship she told me that she didn't like having sex and i didn't know what that meant and as
a guy that's never experienced that in my life um i read into it probably in
the wrong way but it definitely made me insecure i was like what you don't like having sex how's that possible
and i thought that was some kind of um condemnation on me i thought that was
something negative towards me or something that i was doing wrong and i tried various things i tried to to be a bit
more under you know listen a little bit more to what she wanted and how she wanted it and then it you know it progressively
got to a point where i was getting in bed and i was [ __ ] myself
because you don't want to once you get rejected i've never been like i've never gone to have sex with someone in my life and been rejected in that way and so you
get in bed and you don't want to even ask them for sex because you might take an l and you don't want to take
that l and then how how the hell am i meant to get an erection as a guy when i'm that [ __ ] scared of
rejection and eventually long story short we're in um we're away one time and
the same issue happened and she we were having sex and i clearly i was looking at her thinking she clearly isn't enjoying this at all
and we stopped she started crying she said um i've got a problem um she said like
uh you know i just don't enjoy sex i need to like address it i said to her you want to talk about it she said i'm not comfortable talking
about sex with you even though we've been in a relationship for a year and i left and then i broke up with her and i do regret breaking up with her
because um i did so maybe too flippantly
and i didn't understand it and i didn't think it was fixable and i didn't know how to fix it and yeah sorry for my brain you know my
dumping that on you but good place to start no i think and you know so much of what you've just said there's so many points there that
you know i hear all the time so difficulties with desire struggles with communication struggles
with knowing like where to start in terms of talking about it anxiety you know all of these points
which can kind of get in the bedroom with us or be in bed with us and we just don't know how we're
meant to address them we don't know what we're meant to do about them and we all feel that sense of what am i
doing wrong here or what's wrong with me do i have a problem am i broken you know
all of these phrases and actually working with all of the information that
you've just given me you know as an example we can kind of target or work with
each of those problems in an individual way which isn't terrifying for people which doesn't
create more anxiety which doesn't damage self-esteem but we don't have those conversations in
a bigger more normalizing way yeah and i think one of the biggest things that i talk about
is this idea that sex like everything else across our lives has good days bad days average days variability but we
expect there to be this constant and we expect it to be protected from everything else that we
have going on in our lives and that just isn't the case but and somewhat automatically right like we kind of
expected to take care of itself yeah and relationships as well we kind of expect that you know once they're good they're
always good that they shouldn't falter that we shouldn't have to work at them that
they shouldn't struggle and i think that there's such a problem with that as a basic
foundation message around sex and relationships how do you refrain that then how do i reframe my thinking in order to make
sure that i'm i guess that is a reframing of my thinking if i think that this thing
isn't going to take care of itself and it needs to be worked on like everything else in my life i guess
that's the answer to keeping it exciting yeah i mean i think there's just a normalizing of the fact that
our sex lives and our relationships are in the context of us they're not isolated they're not protected they don't have their own kind
of special area where they aren't impacted by how we feel about ourselves stress
anxiety our health our mental health you know physically what's going on for us um psychologically what's going on
for us but why don't we just give ourselves a break and but you know what we're not perfect or good or great at
everything else we do all the time so why would we be here i don't think you know i think as professionals
we often talk about like why aren't we applying the logic that we apply everywhere else in our
lives to this this part of our lives and in that particular case with me and my
this this particular person um she turned to me i remember we were away one time and she said to me
you know there's loads of people that are like me that don't have like a high libido or whatever and i have just never encountered these
people in my experiences so i thought oh that's rubbish was she right yes yes and how right is
she very right and you know we understand that you know this is a huge part of the
conversation around sex lives at the moment and sexual wellness at the moment is this idea about desire desire's not a
fixed concept that we're born with we're not kind of given or holding a set amount it's not like we
kind of have an amount and we like use it up it is context dependent it's responsive and
we understand that it changes but actually how we can change that within
kind of take power of our own i suppose or change that within the context that we're in how we can feel
in control of that is based in almost how we define it or how we understand it ourselves and there's a
huge problem we're just thinking okay well i had it now i don't have it in the same way anymore
so what's wrong with me or what's broken or what changed or what's
not working here rather than if i reframe my understanding my thinking about this it makes a lot more
sense and it takes the pressure off and when the pressure's off then i can work with this in a more
pleasure focused enjoyable way rather than an anxiety provoking and stressful way
what should i have done so the first time she turns to me she says steve i'm just not that interested
because what it was is we're in bed and we're away on a holiday and i like you know just i don't know what i do whatever i do to
to let someone know that when i have sex i don't know stroke their arm or whatever i did whatever i do and she was just
like nah and what should i have done then because you know i think a lot of people would take that
as a bit of an l and i certainly did i was like what i was and i was angry as well
not like visibly angry not like you know hitting with a pillow or anything but i was like i turned i remember turning
away and thinking you know like because i'd never experienced that before i've never experienced that like
it is a form of rejection it's like a form of it's a kick in the self-esteem what should i
have done well i think you know i can't talk to what was going on for you two like kind of in in that moment then but
you know the biggest problem that couples in situations like that have
is assumption so as you said like this is the kick in the teeth for me like that hurts i feel rejected
so we internalize and actually the best way for us to deal with something like that is to try and explain to try and move
away from assumption to explanation to understanding because actually if we can have a conversation
which opens up and you know we you hear sex next relationship experts talk about communication being
you know the kind of biggest pillar of sexual wellness or sexual well-being and
assumption kind of and the gap between expectations and reality
is actually the biggest place that we have a lot of these problems and i think that it feels like you know that's a good
example of that happening fast forward four months uh the same
sort of issue happened and she turned to me and this is when i thought it was completely over
is she said to me i'm not comfortable with talking to you about sex right and we've been together for a year
and i thought well if we can't talk about it and i don't really understand the issue and you're not willing to talk about it
then we are [ __ ] and i thought and that's when i left i left that country um soon after and
i broke up with her maybe like i don't know two three weeks later because i thought if we can't talk about it then how do we fix the situation
but i do regret it because i think i reflect and i think i don't want to be the type of guy generally that when they care about
someone will walk away from it so easily and i think i should have made a more active effort to try and support
as you say and understand maybe but i would say sometimes the hardest person
to talk to about sex is the person we're having it with yeah because of it's so loaded
it's so like intimate it's so vulnerable and also the fear of getting it wrong or making
it worse or leading our partners on or going in the wrong direction or us not being able to unhear what we've
heard or unsay what we've said so actually you know that natural human response to
feeling anxiety around something is avoidance you know we don't tend to approach the sources of our anxiety
unless we're trying really hard to hone in on it or focus on it our most natural instinct is
i don't want to go there you know like it's just easier to keep the status quo even if that status quo isn't working and so it's
it's about thinking about how do we how do we help people to approach that source of anxiety or
feel empowered to change their conversation around sex because it's really it's really hard it's like
talking in a language that we've not been taught you know we're not taught how to have these conversations
we're not taught to be comfortable about these conversations we're not taught that sex is normalized as a topic and
then we're expected to all be experts and that our partners are going to be experts and we're all
expecting that from each other and then when it doesn't work you know we have no solutions or ways of
knowing how to deal with it now some of us muddle through we kind of work it out we're like okay well
let's try this or think about this or take expert advice or listen to a podcast or read a book or get the information and we can kind of
work our way through it but for a lot of us that's way too intimidating you know sex feels like an off the record you know off the
table topic how do you bring on the table how do and i'm presuming that
couples that are successful in the bedroom are those that bring it on the table to some degree is
that a fair assumption or yeah i think that's definitely a fair assumption i think that you know it takes the courage to do it
it takes the kind of sitting in the uncomfortable it might be quite anxiety breaking obviously some people kind of
seek out therapy or external advice or someone that can help them manage those conversations or they might
do it in their own way so it might be kind of reading a book and sharing that with each other or listening to a ted talk and then
sharing that with each other and using that as a springboard to have that conversation but i would say it's
talking about it outside of the bedroom is the biggest way to put it on the table and is it possible
to be just like sexually incompatible with someone yeah i think it is and the way it's think you know impossible
possible to be incompatible with anything else but what we can also do is you know when
we have different interests or different preferences in other areas of our lives we can work together to negotiate that
to manage that to kind of work to each other's kind of preferences
or and kind of switch that around or manage that manage that kind of relational bit that
kind of bit in between and it is possible to do that with sex but also for some people they might have deal breakers and they
might not be able to meet those for each other this is i don't know if this is too much information but i don't think i care
um i i remember one day as well i tried to introduce because i typically when i have sex i typically use
a lot of additional apparatus so i'll use all kinds of stuff i don't care like i'll use handcuffs and all kinds of
ropes and toys and whatever else and i remember trying to introduce something like that because i thought maybe it would make it a little bit more
interesting for her and um she was like absolutely not she she said to me that she thought i think
it was a vibrator she thought a vibrator was for old people and you know i'm already up i'm really
up against it here that's so i'm trying to like do something to help and when she said that i just thought like maybe we
are just like sexually incompatible maybe just we just speak two different languages here so
i don't know but you know like sometimes one part nina what i would say is it's actually more common for couples to not be perfectly
sexually matched yeah than it is for them to be like perfectly sexually matched in every way
and for some people they are more ready to try something or you know they might be the one that leads
something and then the other partner kind of catches up or it's really in about also kind of like
how we perceive what our partner is suggesting or how we what we think that means
because one of the things about sex is we have this idea as humans about like metacognition like we think about
our thoughts we think about what that our thoughts mean and i think it's really really apparent when
it comes to sex and relationships because we're trying to constantly analyze what's happening or as you said
kind of looking out for like the risk of rejection or the fear of rejection we're trying to understand
what that means about us or what that means about them or what it means about our relationship and so we're
always trying to i suppose think about like what's going on
and the wider context or meaning of that now when it comes to sex
we're already in a culture and a society where it's a bit taboo where it's quite stigmatized where
we don't necessarily want to kind of step outside the norms or the expectations because what does
that mean about us as a person i you know since that um whole event i you know we we spoke a little
bit after we broke up and she she told me that was actually the first time she told me that she had like a low libido and i actually didn't really understand
what that meant so i googled it but then i started talking to some friends about it specifically some male friends
and i had another male friend say to me one of my best friends said to me that he also had the same problem where he just lost his um
sexual desire um in you know when he got to a certain age which i i was
shocked about because you don't people don't have these conversations so you don't think it happens so when we encounter it whether it's in
the bedroom or wherever else um yeah it really feels like a real anomaly but how how common is low libido and also
How common is low libido? And what are the causes?
what are the what are the typical causes of someone having a low libido i think really
common and i think you know like so much of the stuff we don't have huge and huge amounts of at least
up to date like sex research so you know it's something that people are really trying to kind of develop in the space
but what we understand when we think about desire so we've got desire and we've got arousal so arousal the body's physical
ability to kind of prepare for sex the desire the want to be sexual and what we understand is that
it typically changes across relationships and what feels really difficult about it
is that at the start of relationships when everything is new and exciting we're getting to know each other we're exploring
it feels like desire is very high we're kind of leaning into that because it's a way of getting to know each other a way
of connecting with that person and it's kind of what we understand is
it's triggered i suppose a lot because a lot of the situations we find ourselves in
are novel are kind of tuning into also the area of our brain that likes the new things that likes the excitement
and we have that sense of wanting to get closer to that person wanting to get to know them now
also what we see particularly this is with a relationship focus is there's like exchange of kind of like
novelty newness the unknown exploration for like routine security safety getting
to know someone so we kind of see these things switching out almost and so
it's just actually that as we get kind of more used to each other there are less of those kind of triggering like exciting moments which
are where desire can tend to thrive and what we need to do is perhaps just slightly more consciously or with a bit more of an effort
put in the time to create those spaces now chuck in i mean you know the year
we've found ourselves in where no one's had any kind of personal space or independence or ability to go away and come back
together kind of change of context but technology the kind of well third and fourth if there's two people in the
relationship wheels that are constantly taking our attention kind of demanding us
you know distracting us so we're missing signals from our partners we're missing
those kind of i suppose quality time moments we're constantly notified or we're distracted
and actually then it's harder for us to give each other our full attention to
kind of sit down and focus on each other to have the things that promote connection eye contact touch we're
constantly kind of looking around and connecting i suppose with everyone apart from the person actually that we're it creates a barrier
and so how do you know you get five 10 15 20 years into relationship um and you've started to get you know
secure and things are predictable how do you this is probably the most you know popular question i'm sure you
How do we keep our sex lives exciting and interesting?
get which is like how do you keep it fresh what advice would you give me to keep my sex life with a partner i've been with for x amount of years
still fresh exciting and uh yeah exploratory um yeah i think it's i mean it's the
question everyone wants the answer right it's it is about
a.s first thing acknowledging that it might be different to how it used to be so
again one of the biggest hurdles people can get kind of tripped over on is it's
not the same as it used to be or it changed now why does that mean it's worse you know
actually perhaps the quality of the sex that people might be having might be better because they know each other better they
understand each other's bodies better they feel more in tune with each other so it's understanding that you might be
in a different phase or stage and that's okay it doesn't have to be you know that famous phrase the
honeymoon period that kind of everybody quotes or goes back to so i think that
is one thing and i think actually kind of carving out the time and the space and the effort
and not seeing that as a bad thing not seeing that as problematic that we have to be a bit
more conscious of that part of our relationships is a huge huge factor because what
the kind of common narrative we see in like society i suppose is if i have to make an effort for this
then there must be something wrong with that because sex should be spontaneous should be
something that just happened that's what it says in the movies which is part of the problem right because
that's one of the most easily accessible visual versions of sex that we have we don't
see into other people's sex lives in the same way now what we do see is social media or pictures of couples
or images of couples or and we make assumptions about
them we make assumptions about they look happy but they have great sex yeah in porn it's just like the gardener's like
outside and then eli comes in and the husband's away and then like it's just boom perfect lasts an hour everyone
looks like they're having a great time but one of the one of the best phrases that i heard and you know um is trying to learn about sex from porn
is like learning to drive from watching the fast and the furious and it's one of the things that i go back to i wish i knew you said it and if
you know please tell me so you can claim it um but porn wasn't designed as an educational
tool but a lot of people have used it as one and that's again i mean like every man ever and also women to be fair like i
think men have this bias where we think women don't watch porn but then you ask a woman you know and
i've asked several of my ex-girlfriends if they've watched porn and oh yeah they do some of them do but i'd say and
this is a general and i'd love you to correct me here because i i'd love to not be i love to be corrected on
things like this where i'm so naive i i tend to believe that like 90 of my male friends watch porn and then i
think it's probably like 50 of my female friends do you know the numbers is that i don't know the numbers but i
you know we know that women watch porn we know that there are also a huge rise of like female-friendly female-focused
pornography platforms kind of coming forward and i think that a lot of those ideas again tie into
these old stereotypes and narratives about like male sexuality and female sexuality
and then you know we're trying to change the conversation around this and i think that it's also about
recognizing that they're not these kind of like two like so separate entities and actually that
we can understand that we're all sexual creatures and we all have our own versions of sexuality and what that
doesn't mean is that it has to again kind of line up with the narratives that have always been there
which is like men do this women do this but are there distinctions between um
sexual appetite and the type of representation of sex that men and women typically want to see i
was going to ask you a question which kind of alludes to the same answer but it's like if you were to create a point because you said there's men there's now
sites emerging which are like female friendly i'm like what's the what's the what's the difference what what's how do
they i suppose well you know one of the things that um a lot of these sites they're creating is a focus on kind of female pleasure
in a way which is that what we know for example is that the majority of women um or like the most common way of
bringing women to orgasm is through direct literal stimulation but for example in not necessarily porn but in the movies
we never see that and so then everyone is kind of replicating what they see in the movies
and no wonder it's not quite working so i think that there's also educational elements starting to kind of
come forward and a lot of that kind of content as well i guess that makes sense if the demand
for pornography has been skewed male then what you're seeing
in the pornography would also be catered to what a male likes to believe is
you know men as you like alluded to that men typically get their arousal from like what do they call it
vaginal penetration i guess that's not intercourse yeah or intercourse whatever but
women would typically get reach like an orgasm via clitoral stimulation so porn tends to
reflect the the former um so
has has porn been a a a positive or negative impact on
um our perceptions and images of what our own sexual relationship should be like
do you think oh that's such a big question is it again it's the one that everyone wants to know the answer to i think that the problem that we've seen is when
people have used it as an educational resource and that's not how it was designed um now what it has offered
is people who are exploring their sexuality and feel that it doesn't fit for example the
norm or expected norm you know however you want whatever terminology you want to use for that it's offered those people a sense of
community or safety in exploring or belonging or knowing that they're not alone not
isolated in their experience and so there are you know like
everything in life there's going to be huge pros and cons and like anything in life is how people use anything but i think for me
you know working with people with sexual problems and relationship problems isolation or feeling alone in your
experience is probably the biggest side effect or negative side effect
on mental health or on the problem itself of what they're experiencing of what
they're struggling with and so combating that which in a way is where therapy helps you know we're kind
of sharing that conversation we know that shame thrives in silence we're starting to externalize we're starting to talk
about these things is making people feel they're not alone is massive i am
one of the things you said i read that you had said before which i thought was really good advice
especially as it relates to keeping sex like fresh and exciting was just to change one thing every time um and i wanted to for you to tell me
why you think that's important and how that helps it goes back to some of the themes you've talked about but it was one of the things that i
thought i could immediately do in my own sex life to keep things
continually fresh yeah and what are those small things that you're referring to when you say i suppose what i like about that is it's
actionable so it's this idea that we can all be like empowered and in control to
do something in our sex lives and you know like one of the the phrases we hear kind of
all the time is that mixing it up spicing it up and what i think people get intimidated by
is the idea that they have to do something massive to do that that they have to you know go out like buy a whole new
wardrobe yeah exactly or try something that they've like never done before
or you know buy 25 sex stories or um you know try everything like and
that in itself then becomes a barrier to people trying it because they're like oh god that sounds scary expensive as well but you know like
that i it's that um god like how am i gonna do that there's no stepping stone to that it's a whole like bridge a whole
jump and that puts people off so again we're back to that avoidance thing you know what i'll just stay in my safe zone i'll
stay in my comfort zone i'll stay where i am like the idea of trying that and it not working or trying that and it
failing feels way scarier than where we're at right now and so i think that idea of
like changing one thing every time is it's also that routine doesn't
kind of help or promote or um kind of encourage desire because we're
like oh i know what's coming i know how this is going to go and what we're then doing is we're more likely to
kind of let our thoughts wander or be distracted and we see that with people you know they're like i know it's going
to go so actually i wasn't really noticing what was happening in my body or that experience i was thinking about like everything i
need to do tomorrow and so what it does is it works as a way of encouraging breaking up
routine now these are small things like having the lights on or having the lights off starting with your clothes on
or your clothes off keeping your underwear on or underwear off using lube or not you know taking intercourse off the
table for that evening and just focusing on non-penetrative sex trying a sex toy
or you know putting even something simple that i talk about is putting like your pillows on the other
end of your bed so your room feels different like lighting candles changing your smell having a shower or not you know
doing it in the street you can get arrested for that but um you know it's that idea of these
are all accessible within range non-intimidating things that we can try to create
shifts and changes my journey with huel has intensified a lot over the last six to 12 months the
the untold story of a healthy diet and a nutritionally complete diet is how you feel and really that's a much more
important thing because actually how you feel is the sort of precursor to you having the motivation the discipline and the
state of mind that will help you go to the gym and follow through on your goals and i feel amazing i don't think i've
ever felt better i've never had more energy i've been sleeping amazingly well my sort of mental cognition has been
sharper than it ever has before but i just feel good right and you often just get to see the physical effects
that having a nutritionally complete diet could have but there are all of these other impacts and other effects which are so much more
important and as i said are the precursor to the positive physical um effects you see so yeah you know it's
one thing having a podcast sponsor that pays you money but it's another thing having a podcast sponsor who you genuinely believe can
help people change their lives for the better is it possible for some you know because i've got this one friend and i'm sorry
What is asexual?
for just rinse one of my friends here i've got this one friend yeah this is a problem with being friends with me you always appear in the podcast if you've got any slight like
peculiarity about you um and like i feel like all of my friends have been mentioned in this podcast at least once they just don't know where
they're being mentioned but i've got this one friend who is a
guy and he i've known him maybe 10 years and i've i don't think he's ever had sex and he's
maybe 27 28 years old whatever and i don't believe he's ever had sex
i've never i've never seen him in a relationship he doesn't talk to girls at all or guys
for that matter um and i don't it's just so unusual because in our in our friendship group we talk
about sex a lot so we're always talking about you know who we're sleeping with in various things and we've basically just learned to just
not have the conversation with him or when he's there you know if we're just like joking with each other as
friends we will never joke with him because it's just this big question mark and none of us know the answer
um and i think my conclusion has been maybe he's just asexual if that's the thing yeah that's
the thing and what is that thing and what and if you i'm sure you've heard about this before right what is what's going on well i mean like
we we don't know what's going on for that person but you know asexuality is is some is an identity you know like
people who don't experience sexual attraction and what that also doesn't mean so we
have asexuality and aromanticism so those are two different concepts so what we can see is that people can have
successful relationships and be asexual because they can have connection and friendship and intimacy and we can see
that people who um are so we can understand that
it's not a kind of like pairing necessarily and something i also talk about is we can have intimacy without sex and sex
without intimacy now what a group that i've also worked with is lots of people who have
such bad sexual anxiety and this is in no way me saying what's going on for your friend but that that limits them in sexually
exploring or taking their sex life to where they want to go or dating or seeing people because
what it can feel a bit like is if we get on the ladder of for example meeting someone or dating then we get
closer towards the source of our anxiety which might be sex and i think that
people who haven't had sexual experiences and i suppose bear in mind you're only viewing this from your perspective
rather than speaking to the person you've been speaking to um is that
that kind of it can feel like a snowball effect of a new something that i talk a lot about in
therapy with people that i'm working with this this snowball effect of okay well the older i get
the more i feel that this is a worry or the more i feel other people will judge me or the more i feel that i won't match up to
what's expected of me or that i will get kind of found out and i think that
these anxieties around sex are also because what we assume is sexuality in people so we kind of
assume everyone's sexually active it goes back to that point about feeling isolated or alone in our
experience everybody else is doing it so what's wrong with me and that the problem we have when it
comes to sex is we can't know with people until we check it out we can't know until we we're judging
someone's inside world based on what we see from the outside and actually what we know with sex is that
they don't always match up there's no way of really knowing until we for example you know sit down with a therapist and
unpack it or sit down with a friend or a family member or whoever that is we share you know a partner that conversation
with i think there's also like i was just thinking then about there's also this like wider philosophical question of
like what is the purpose of sex because if you see sex as being you know just to ejaculate
then you know you might encounter a bunch of issues there because the the role that sex is playing for
your partner might be a completely different one so i guess at first you have to understand what role sex plays in
relationships uh to your partner but also to yourself like is that how would you define the
What are the motivations for sex?
purpose or the role of sex what is it why do we do it and what's it for we're going to make a sexual therapist have you yet
are we having my job in a minute i know you'll see tomorrow instagram page it's like sex with steve
it's just everything you've said um so one of my favorite pieces of research
and anyone who's listened to my podcast or any of the interviews and stuff i know is going to be so bored of hearing me bang on about this is
a paper called why humans have sex um and it was done in 2007 and it identified 237 reasons for why
humans
the motivations for why people have sex and there is such a wide breadth of those
and that might be um you know my favorite my favorite one from that study is um because i was cold
because i wanted to get warm but we can understand that you know it might be because i want an orgasm because my partner
looked hot because um i wanted to feel close to them because i wanted to show them i loved them because
because because because so the meaning of sex goes be so beyond the what of what we're doing
but we are so focused on the what all the time and then we get so tangled up
in everything that's kind of psychologically going on for us and i think that you know sometimes
we're thinking about the why you know what does it represent in our relationship if we're in a relationship what does it represent to us if we're
single what does it represent to us if actually the sexual relationship we have is just with ourselves you know i think
that thinking about that is such a big part of us understanding ourselves sexually
there's definitely emotional elements but there's also like a physical uh prehistoric maybe evolutionary role
that sex plays right and has that been somewhat lost upon us now like because my body my body you know the
chemicals in my body will start tickling me and telling me that i'm horny and then you know that will drive me
into action you know i feel like the the role the sort of prehistoric evolutionary role of
sex has been lost upon us a little bit especially now that you know we have all this contraception and we can swerve
having kids so i think it's become a bit of a sport for many people well sex is about pleasure isn't it did
you know you tell me well you know i think you know well what
we see is that the majority of the reasons that people have sex are not to do with procreation
yeah and also the the problem is i think something you kind of said
earlier um was it's so gold it can be so goal
orientated now again this is where so many people struggle with sex because
if sex is goal orientated and as you said like the goal is to orgasm or to ejaculate or to
finish then what happens if that doesn't happen we feel like we've failed yeah and so
what it creates then is this goal-orientated kind of pass or fail model for sex now the
complete irony of that is if we're struggling and we're focused on where we need to get to as a goal
the act of focusing on where we need to get to is actually the thing that is most likely to not get us there because it's
preventative because if we are in the moment enjoying what we're doing experiencing kind of pleasure and
sensations and able to enjoy it then that's actually
the thing that's probably most likely to get us there but if we're so distracted by the negative thoughts that are going
on in our heads we're so distracted by our concerns our worries that is going
to break down that kind of process of us getting there because i know a lot of people only
every sentence i say sounds so strange i think i know a lot of people that struggle with orgasms but i know i've
spoken to some of my girlfriends and i've asked i've asked them if they've orgasmed in fact my one of my
ex-girlfriends she said to me that she had basically never had an orgasm in her life
um which i obviously is a guy you find quite well well not obviously but as a guy that has
never had that problem i found that quite peculiar and i wondered why why some people can orgasm so easily and
then some people are find it a lot more difficult um in this particular case my suspicions were that
it was an emotional thing in fact what you've just described there about worry this is one of the people that i know
that's very very tense about the topic of sex and i just thought you know my suspicion again super naive
was that they're not knowing this person um they would probably not be able to relax
in bed and then when i when they became a sexual partner of mine i thought yeah they're just like not
relaxed at all but i wanted to get your take on why some some people find it so easy to orgasm
and then some people just can't at all well i think it also goes back to
almost like the first time you know early messages about this stuff as well you know early messages about what it's
like to have these experiences what it's like to be sexual you know is it something that's
never been talked about is it something that's shrouded in shame is it something that we um think that we shouldn't be doing
or we think about ourselves a certain way for doing and so there's so many components to this as a
conversation and you know probably um too many you know longer than we have time for but there's the idea of how we again think
about what we're doing how we know and learn about our bodies what we know and learn about our bodies how we
discover what works for us and our preferences so there's the physical element you know we talk about an orgasm as a peak pleasure experience
but also how we feel about it because if we're feeling shame or embarrassment or that we
shouldn't be doing this that is going to be something which again gets in the way of us
being able to fully let go and enjoy ourselves or giving ourselves in therapy we talk a lot about this idea
of giving ourselves permission to be sexual or to let go
or to enjoy ourselves or to experience pleasure again this is super naive but an orgasm
is a pretty natural thing isn't it it's like a natural physiological reaction to
stimulation so again super naive just i will just disclaimer from here on out that
everything i say is largely naive and i'll stop disclaimering every sentence but so one would assume that if you know if
we're struggling to orgasm then there's something maybe emotional maybe even physical that's being going unmet
there might be something physical going on but you know it's there's probably like something emotional going on but it's also about
you know have we learned to do this like have we learned to kind of experience pleasure enough to take us
there and also once we do then we're like okay i understand how my body works now i understand how
that feels and i think for lots the lack of sex education here is a huge part of the problem you know
pleasure has historically been left out of the conversation and particularly female pleasure
Who are your clients seeking advice?
who are your who are your clients who who comes to you with the sex issues and challenges the most
normal people with normal problems you know everyday people for every difference um genders you know
both men and women i work with both couples and individuals i have a lot of younger clients so a lot
of my clients are kind of in that sub 45 age bracket but i work with a lot of people
in their kind of early 20s and i think that the early 20s kind of 30s but also there's there's
a couple of things that are going on one is that therapy has become much less taboo in itself and sex much less
taboo and we have this kind of corner of therapy which is psychosexual therapy where
i think people recognize that it now can be a solution or that sexual
problems aren't just medical that actually there can be something psychological or emotional
going on and i think that the idea of accessing help for this stuff now
has become much more normalized which is brilliant i think you know and much
needed and there are some amazing amazing sexual experts and sexual therapists in this country who
you know i hope are really being and i know have really been used by people to help them improve this part of their
lives and i think that again a part of it is any other aspect
of our life we would go and see a doctor or go and see a physio or go and see a
nutritionist or whatever it is you know if another part of if a part of our body wasn't working
we would access help for it without feeling embarrassed you know if we'd injured our knee we wouldn't feel embarrassed about going
to ask someone about that but why when it comes to sex do we feel that we shouldn't access the
help and then the longer we're struggling with that the more of a problem that becomes because we don't just have the original
problem but how we think and feel about it but is there like is there like an age range where
people are more likely to go into a sexual therapist
no i don't think there is then i think evenly distributed from like 20 to 80. yeah really i mean
and i think you know again it's a bit about life stages isn't it you know what are people
looking to explore at different stages we see for example people might go after a cancer diagnosis or cancer treatment or
for example around menopause or that there are certain health conditions that impact sexuality or
you know common side effect of a lot of anti-anxiety medications and antidepressants are an impact on sex
lives or it might be that someone is starting their sexual experiences or they've had a relationship where sex has been a
problem and they don't want to carry that on into their next relationship i think that it's about understanding like what has brought that
person to therapy at that time is a big part of for me as a therapist anyway kind of
exploring what's going on for that person what's the trigger for dealing with it now polygamy
Polygamy
um do you have a lot of people come to you with in polygamous relationships so you mean
like polyamory like multi-part multi-part relationships and what are the issues typically that um
you'd see with yeah polyamorous polygamous relationships yeah i think that it's something that
people have a lot of questions about um it's something that you know i've talked about on
my podcast because it's what people are curious about um because it's also a breaking away
from our kind of heteronormative like mono-normative model of relationships and i think the big
questions that people have are how do we do this you know how do we navigate this how do we manage it and
that's about working out what the rules are for those people you know how do they hold what are the rules for
them that work for them how do they understand the rules you know rules around things like disclosure rules around
things like how much detail do we go into how do we manage this but actually communication for lots of
those relationships is really good because they have to be really good in order to
manage that different style of being or you know also just the practicalities of there being more than two partners in a
relationship i've always wondered if it would cause a lot more problems but i guess you've
answered it there it's about studying selling clear rules and having effective communication my next
my next question again which i was really excited to ask you was like what's the and this is a super hard question so just get ready yeah what are what are
What are the most common misconceptions about the opposite sex
the things that men don't and typically don't understand about women when it comes to sex and
vice versa it's a hard question isn't it it is a hard question i was just thinking i was thinking because i know
men are super naive and we watch we're exposed to a certain type of media and content and then we like rush into
the bedroom thinking that i don't know our partners want to be i don't know tied up or dominated or whatever else
and then from the other perspective you know when you speak to a woman about sex and what she's looking for
there's obviously she's experienced a certain type of media but she also is i think typically again with being super
binary here typically a woman is is is um
has a slightly different expectation from the man from my experiences anyway
i think part of the problem in that is that binary approach is that if there's something that i
would want everyone to understand it's that we can be different but we are also so similar um
you know and like this idea about like performance when it comes to sex is hugely
detrimental to everyone um and
again probably like what is one of the biggest things i want everyone to think about is the assumptions you know what are the
assumptions that we're making about each other based on gender norms and expectations based on
historical messages how do we break away from them and it might be that that's a conversation
between those two people and that's the best way of doing it but also there's you know all of these kind of so many of
these ideas about sex is so steeped in history but we've never asked them we've never had them challenged so
an assumption being you know a really historical message that we hear all the time means something i hear all the time when i'm talking to people about like
myths you know what are the sexual myths or what are the sexual rules that you think are kind of applicable to your sex
life a really common one is that men initiate sex like men are the initiators the sex and
women are the responders now how does that fit people then when
they're like oh but that's not how it works for us or you know a for example male partner
if we're talking about hetero heterosexual relationships who is less confident and a female
partner who is more confident and so actually it's the other way around but then they're thinking okay
but this isn't what we think everyone else is doing so maybe there's a problem here when there isn't because that's what's
working for them and you see big distinctions between the issues that heterosexual and and homosexual
relationships have i think that what same-sex relationships don't battle
with as much is the gender assumptions the gender narratives the gender norms
that kind of idea of like men do this and women do this but you know there are also kind of
every relationship struggles in some way with that dynamic of we're two individuals
how do we work on our differences and our similarities together that interrelational part which is what
happens between us you know how what are our triggers
what how do we kind of what makes us both anxious or what makes us both feel secure or what makes us both feel closer
and also navigating that you know that that's really the battle that all couples have again
super naive question but i'm sure it's one of the most popular questions you get asked which is like is there a healthy amount of times for a
couple to have sex per week or whatever i used fiverr once a month before they became a
sponsor on this podcast and since they've become a sponsor on this podcast and i've delved into what the site does and how all the services
work and the vast array of things that you can achieve on fiverr using freelancers around the world
i swear on this dog's life pablo my dog here who sat on my lap if you can't see i swear in his life that i've used
fiverr at least once a week for the last three months we've built so
many websites we've designed so many decks we've had video clips edited we've had subtitles
produced if you haven't checked out fiverr before hit the link in the bio fiverr.com ceo
go to the website check it out and every single time i do this podcast one person who dms me
with a service from fiverr that they need doing for their business for their podcast for whatever project they're working on i will pay
for that service to be done for you so find a service on fiverr that you you want done send me a message and one person every
week will have that service paid for by me super naive question but i'm sure it's one of the most popular questions you
How many times a week should we be having sex
get asked which is like is there a healthy amount of times for a couple to have sex
per week or whatever and you know one would assume that changes over time
right because i think i know just judging by my relationships it starts we start like [ __ ] energize the bunny rabbits and then you
know life happens but is there you know and i hate these questions because again they're so like
unnuanced and so like narrow but is there an average amount of times that couples
you would you know if you had to answer this question and not swerve it in this for the sake of nuance what
would the answer be i would like to know what you think the answer is i think
again context like i'm going to go into nuances here but context matters like if you live on opposite sides of the world then
obviously there's there's barriers but if you're living in the same house if you're cohabiting living in the same house i think like at
least twice a week you know once in the weekend tuesday
but where okay so where do you think um that idea of twice a week would comes
from just looking at my schedule wait a minute where can i find time
probably like once in the week and then on the weekends i have a bit more time so
um yeah but i mean it obviously changes over time i feel like i probably have sex every night but if i you know but
just energy levels and yeah what's the answer then so someone i
um interviewed talked about the amount of sex we have as a red herring
so the kind of regularity of sex doesn't determine like the satisfaction of it or
the kind of pleasure of it or the enjoyment of it and i think what it feels like we've been trying to
do is find an objective way of measuring sex so it's this idea of okay well we're all
trying to find the answer to sex like how to be good at sex like what that looks like how to
know where we pitch ourselves against everyone else and regularity is one of the only kind of objective measures we have of that
so it's the one that we kind of will lean into or we want to know the answer to whereas what i would say is i don't
think we do have an idea of i don't know what kind of modern like surveys say there's a big survey that's done um
kind of every few years but i haven't actually seen the results of that one yet but what about the monkeys how often are they doing i feel like they were like
what are the orangutans doing um i haven't got a clue to find out maybe your next guest yeah
like a zoologist or something um but i think that the the thing is is
working out again and what it what we're looking for is a measure of like how we're doing yeah by knowing that um answer and i
think one of the things is for some couples it might be as you said they might kind of work in different
countries it might be every time they see each other they have great sex and that's enough like that works for
them for other couples it might be we have sex once a month and it's really good you know we're both enjoying ourselves
and we feel like our needs are met great for other people it might be once a week you know i think it's about
determining like what your normal is or what your what is right for you
but again the kind of worries and anxieties and stresses come from a we're not having enough sex
why is that yeah you know is it because my partner's no longer attracted to me that tends to be the first thing people go to and what's
going on um is it because our relationship isn't working is it when we don't have a clear kind of obvious answer like we've
just had a baby for example um so there's the assumptions that go with that why has sex
changed what's going on but also the well everyone else is having sex once a
week and we're having sex once a month so that we must have a problem there
must be something wrong with us speaking of my ex-girlfriends i feel like i've slightly thrown several of them under the bus but i had
another relationship this go this goes back a little bit further where i just like fell in love with this girl
in every other aspect non-sexual so intellectually in every other way and then when it came time to have sex
which is actually quite a little bit later than it usually is in the relationships that i have
like three or four months into knowing this person um there was i don't know how to say this
because it just sounds i'll just go for it um
the the
Practicalities of sex
i tend to think especially when it comes to like vaginal penetration that it's like a
hand and a glove and the hand in the glove didn't match and
again i genuinely thought that i could have spent the rest of my life with this person but i saw that as
a like insurmountable object like my penis didn't suit her
vagina and i thought we can't change you can't change this um
yeah is this something that people come to you about often they talk about like the
practicalities the practicalities like the hand in the glove yeah i think
it is and you know there are for example like conditions that mean that people
can't have sex for numerous reasons so like sexual dysfunctions or you know particularly for women there
is a condition called vaginismus which is where there's an involuntary contracting of the pc muscles the pelvic floor muscles
where they're unable to have sex and that we think affects about one in 500 women in no way am i saying that's
necessarily what was happening here but you know we also know that that it's about how we
work together as couples how we work with bodies what would make things more helpful how we can look for
kind of practical advice but it's about understanding like okay how do we help ourselves here rather
than again that assumption of like something's going wrong because it made me believe in this like idea of like
there's a physical compatibility to sex as well not just like a a desire compatibility
or like you know an experimentation compatibility but there's like a physical
um compatibility as well to having like good sex where you can just like physically not
be compatible but i suppose it's then where how do you
if you want to like explore working around a roadblock you know how do you kind of
because that's build yourself so hard to talk about like i could never bring my i could talk about
the um libido issue with my partner but i could never tell
that partner that i wasn't that i was basically turned off by our lack of
physical compatibility i could never mention it so i ended up the end the relationships
i tried multiple times to like fix it in various ways and i just couldn't bring myself to talk about it because i didn't want to hurt
the person i didn't want to say something that might hurt them and stay with them forever so i ended the relationship on the
grounds of something else but that was fundamentally the issue i've actually had two relationships in my life but like sexual partners in my life that
ended purely because of that but yeah and i think it's so hard again isn't it
because we just don't know how to tackle these as topics as you say like
how do we manage talking about something or exploring something that we just have no idea where even to start and i
don't offend the person which that must be it must be a huge thing in the work that you do like not wanting to offend your partner
because as you said it's such a sensitive topic and i don't know how i could have approached that situation without
offending the person and i think that it's the fear of judgment like the fear of offending the
fear of hurting our partners the fear of us not being able to go back once we kind of it feels a bit like pandora's box for some people like this
idea of talking about sex in a relationship you know like if i open this up like how do
we close it or i think a lot of people have the fear of if i open this up then every time we
have sex we're both going to be thinking about this and we're both going to be completely in our heads and what we know
is when we're completely in our heads when it comes to sex we're not experiencing what's going on in our bodies and that is interrupting arousal you
know the body's process of us kind of enjoying you know our body kind of working with us the kind of
sexual arousal process and so you know our thoughts are as distracting as they're kind of being
like someone in the room that's not the person wearing sex with or someone actually like walking in or
kind of saying all of that stuff to us just because our thoughts are not a physically represented being doesn't
mean they're not as distracting as something else and you're completely right because from then on i didn't say anything
but i carried on trying i thought maybe you know one bad experience whatever we'll try again we'll try again
and it got to the point where i was i was almost avoiding sex because i knew that
it was going to be an issue and i started to overthink and as a guy
overthinking is not what you want to be doing when you're trying to maintain yourself so
i am so i started having issues keeping my erection up because i was just i was walking in i was
getting in the bed thinking oh my god here we [ __ ] go again and i've got a you know like are you gonna be able to get it up because you you really
don't enjoy this and and that all of that just became too much i couldn't tell her because i didn't want to insult her
and i was starting to have problems like you know being aroused because it was a big issue and you're right it's
a snowball and performance anxiety is one of the key things that i work with
with men because where there is not a physical kind of indicator
or reason for why they might be struggling for example with erections because
getting into your head too much again creates a speed bump for
sexual arousal because when you're feeling stressed or you're feeling anxious you're in that kind of fight flight free
state your body is preparing not for you to kind of lie down and have sex and be comfortable and relaxed but it's
preparing for that kind of threat response and that
is not compatible with being sexual in that moment so in a way your body's kind of working against you
and so what you have to do then is work on this kind of like frontal bit of your brain you know your thoughts
like focusing on that in order to in a way like reprogram because sex has become not fun
exciting pleasurable connecting it's become anxiety provoking stressful fearful you know don't want to
be here would rather avoid so in a way the way i describe it a lot is the meaning of sex has changed so the
way we relate to it has changed how does one give their partner good positive
How to give constructive feedback about sex?
constructive feedback do you know what i mean like because i'm sure there's i was thinking
then i'm sure there's so many people listening to this that are in relationships that would like their sex to be slightly
different and they probably in the same way that i was anxious about approaching it with my
xxxxx girlfriend um what is the best way to approach these sensitive self-esteem
attached topics with your partner not in the moment when you're having sex so
not just kind of like in bed like just before because also what you don't want to do is you know kind of create like a scent a
further sense of like stress or anxiety like in that sexual space so what i always talk to people about is
like leading with a positive you know like i really love our relationship like i'm loving what we're doing
but maybe there's something we can work on here or how can we do this better or so leading with a positive you know
affirmation because if someone comes at you and um you know we're often really
sensitive to criticism also in our intimate relationships and this isn't good enough or you're not
doing this or our immediate response is defensive or attacking
we're not open to hearing what they have to say we're already like shut down before they've even got there
so kind of approaching it without that positive framework or like connecting framework
or open framework and also let's work on this together this is a shared venture something we want to do together some you know
something for us to think about like how can we go about this because
what can also happen is we isolate the problem in one partner yeah when there are two of us
there i guess i guess another sort of attach to that would be just telling them what you you like as
opposed to what you don't like so it's just like the same outcome but different framing so it's like oh i like when you blindfold me or
i don't like when you don't blind you know what i mean and just making it i might some of my sort of sexual partners
that have given me positive feedback in the past have done so by telling me
what they like more of because then we can lean into that yeah exactly and we all like to be
told we're doing a good job we all like to be affirmed we all like to be especially in sex because we don't have
a reference point you know are we doing a good job and we feel you know if we think we are bad at sex
with that's really personal yeah isn't it it's brutal you know that's really a difficult thing to hold on to and then
we go into our next sexual situation thinking i'm bad at this and actually what it's more likely to do
is make us struggle and actually when people are relaxed and comfortable and calm in those situations they're
able to connect with the other person more and we're kind of able to i suppose follow the pleasure path a bit
more or kind of affirm each other a bit more and understand that actually someone says
can you touch me here it's not because you weren't doing it the right way it's just because that might be their preference but we cannot
be mind readers we cannot know what our partners like until we communicate that with them
that's such a fascinating thing as well that we never know if we're good at sex we're just like kind of trusting our and
especially because you see all these movies and we read these magazines about people faking orgasms as a guy i swear to god
the first couple of times someone said that i was like good in bed or whatever i thought you're full of [ __ ] i thought you say this to everybody and
then like i still i still and i've heard that a few times whatever but i still don't know and that's crazy that like
with everything else you have a fairly um accurate gauge of whether you're good at it but because we've never seen like pretty
much we should really we've never like seen anyone um doing it in real life or really got
to observe it outside of the fakeness of porn and you don't know how it feels for the
other person and sometimes you don't even know if they're faking it or if it's real you can't i th well for me in my mind
like kind of float through life assuming you're doing okay until told otherwise but it also assumes that here we go
again good at sex is a formula that you can apply across the board like everybody it's every sexual experience
is going to be different between those partners in that time in that moment in that context it is not
like a universally applicable true formula now what we can do is we can
sorry i just passed your purpose but my ex said i was
like what we can do is we can feel more informed so we can make no i consider a big part of my job to be
helping people to make informed choices about their sexual wellness and well-being so that might be
you know thinking about the narratives that have shaped how they think about sex thinking about their current definition of sex
thinking about sex education how can they feel informed about things like anatomy
things like their body their preferences their likes and the communication bit how do i then
communicate that with a partner and all of that can contribute to better sexual self-confidence and again what we
know is like sexual self-confidence is in that person again it's reflected back to them in situations with other people
but really it's kind of all about that relationship with self and i know that sounds very
therapy and something that all therapists say but it's really true because we put ourselves in those sexual
contexts in those sexual situations for some people they might never struggle with sex they might have kind
of muddled through you know like trial and error worked it out kind of and always and be okay and they're
satisfied and that's great but for some people they do struggle for some people they have a period of normal sexual
functioning and then they start to struggle and it might be that they've never thought about sex really before
until they feel like they have to so again there's no kind of one route to all of this
and although there are themes for example in the conversations that i have with people everyone has their own journey their own
story their own experiences that have shaped that and some of it can start in you know the
playground like playground banter about what sex is like but at a younger age
when we're quite impressionable and that sounds really scary what people are talking about we can kind of carry that
with us and then it presents further down the line or we might have had
a negative sexual experience early which means that we then don't want to try again and so we hold on to
that negative experience because we've had no in a way like challenging or corrective or other more positive experiences which
can go against those ideas we're ever evolving you know humans and
people and we're changing in every way you know mentally physically i think one of the things that has
it's going to be honest because i think that's just the point i think i think when i'm honest i think i resonate with more people one of the things i'm slightly concerned
about is that at some point in my life i'll fall in love with somebody and the sex will be great and everything
and then me all them will change in that we could change in a variety of different ways
whether it's our desire but but more so even like i'm we might not be attracted to each other
anymore i might you know deteriorate in some
form and i wonder how much of an issue that like two people changing and falling out of
Is falling out of attraction with your partner normal
attraction with each other is um prevalent in the work that you do in the pit and the people that you know
come to you for therapy and for advice i think it is it's not probably the most prevalent thing i deal
with but also what you're basing that on is an assumption that that's not something that can be worked at
it's not something that people accept when they are in a relationship with each other or
that they you know i think it goes back to that relationships moving in stages and phases
bit as well and i think there's that's that fear of like things not always staying the same whereas actually
what i would say is if we accept that things don't always stay the same then we can change and work with that and accept
it and improve it or adapt you know as humans we're really really adaptable
but we want to feel encouraged in that rather than i suppose kind of put off or challenged
by the fact that we need to in the world we live in now there's just this incredible like
perspective perception of choice i'd say like more so than my grandparents around i imagine they're
dating their sort of circle of possible matches extended to like the size of their like street or village didn't have tinder yeah exactly they
didn't have tinder or instagram but now in my relationships if it's not going well i've got apparently
a gazillion people right here that are perfect they're all filtered and i think you
know 32 000 of them just like my photo so if i lose attraction with my partner
in the world we live in now where we've got this huge sort of perceived amount of choice and accessibility just one swipe you
know it must make holding relationships together at times when they hit you know rocks more difficult than ever
before no yeah i think that there are often ideas that like the grass is always greener
but equally we understand that relationships take work and i think you know we we've seen a
breakdown of norms we've seen that you know divorce rates are at an all-time high but it's not the same stigma that it used to be
that kind of people changing their models of relationships so changing relationships
is not kind of such a a big thing but also something i think is important to say is
just because a relationship has ended doesn't mean that in itself it wasn't successful and i think that's another
thing that we need to like to reframe you know people can be in a relationship for 10 years
and it ends that doesn't mean that relationship failed or was a failure it might have been for that person at
that time this is part of the issue in my view with marriage because marriage you say till death do
us part but we all know that if there's the only constant is change we're all going to change
so how can you honestly make a commitment that you're going to stay with this person why would you want to until death
knowing that you're both going to change in various ways that are yet to be seen but can't you also change together
in a positive way you can like i think i think people are moving they can move if you think about it as
like two parallel lines they can go they could be slightly tilted one degree
to the the right which means that in 10 years time they'll be too far apart or they could be slight one degree to
the left which means that in 10 years time they'll be closer together um or they could be perfectly straight
right so perfectly parallel which means that in 10 years time they'll be the same they'll resonate in the same way they'll
be as close you know whatever but you don't know that yet so i think that that's why i've always been slightly
let down by the concept of marriage because i think you know you can't predict the future so
why would you want to make something like that so final um and i've i've i think like
Marriage
you know the men in black have you seen men in black oh god a long time ago when they get the pen and they they hold it up and if they press the button on the
pen basically it raises your memory i sometimes think i think if if we held that pen up to the world and erased
everybody's memory what are the things that would come back like science would come back religion would never come back the same
we wouldn't it wouldn't come back the same right science we would figure all the same things out same experiments marriage i'm like no
wouldn't come back the same not in 2021 i don't think that would come back the same um i think we'd have a much more bespoke
open flexible form of marriage that would involve less of the law and would involve less
of the church um and i probably think would be a little bit more effective
so i guess my question is about marriage what do you think about marriage are you married
you know i think that it's what what does it offer people you know like what are people looking for and i think for a lot of
people it's security you know and it's it's form of insecurity though like i think i tend to i'm going to play
devil's advocate here yeah i do because i think if you're looking for security from like a legal contract i'm like then that for me speaks to a little bit
of insecurity somewhere else but i think it's also about you know i suppose marriage has been the norm
right historically it's always been the norm it's always been also considered the gold standard or
like what we should kind of aspire to be or aim for and i think that
again you know that that impact of history like us doing the things that we've always done but it's an institution and a lot of
people subscribe to that now what we see now is that people can be married
multiple times and be happy in every relationship or it be perfect for that stage or for them or for that
relationship that people don't need to get married that people can parent and become parents without being
married that it's i suppose the biggest um representation of commitment that
historically we've always had and people now can find other ways to commit to each other you know buying property together
that doesn't require it so i suppose children it's probably the biggest commitment but it's also about what those people are looking for
i think i think that's you know people think i'm really against marriage it's actually not the truth and my friends say to me are steve's against
marriage i've listened to his podcast i'm like no you didn't listen what i'm against what i'm for is a more bespoke
um tailored approach to how two people come together i actually had a friend of mine say to me this week that he and he will
be listening to this podcast for sure he said um he thinks he can only be with someone for a year at a time
he says after a year i just i don't think i can you know the relationship can't go on so
he's having these continual one-year relationships and look i guess the most important
macro question is like are you happy yeah um and people's happiness is derived in various ways
um i do think i do think marriage is somewhat you know i think maybe it's because i tend to have a perspective that
convention um conventional solutions um aren't always very well equipped to solve new problems
and the world we're living in is a very new one we're living longer than ever before we're exposed to different types of information we have
much more freedoms than i think our some of our ancestors used to have so maybe the the way that humans commit
to each other should not involve the law it shouldn't take two years to divorce someone which i think is crazy
um i think it doesn't have to and i suppose it's about what people are looking for and i
suppose as you you know you're asking earlier about like multi-partner relationships or like you know consensual non-monogamy it's
about us making informed choices about what works for us and our
relationships and i mean that's a conversation i was having with someone just yesterday is how do we feel more informed
you know how do we explore what that might look like in another way because for some people trying to fit into what
they feel they're expected to do might not work for them it's a it's a system or a model that doesn't work
so how do we then start to like open up that conversation
for ourselves but also we have our fears you know we're humans
we like to i suppose feel that we fit the normal fit what's
expected or you know some of us do at least that what well other people think of me
if i step outside that so as humans we have that balance of like what do i want but also what
will other people think yeah which i think is typically quite awful yeah but it isn't it one of the biggest
things that drives people in a lot of ways drives them try somewhere though like i think i just
think in every facet of life it's like your mom wants you to be a doctor but you really want to be a ballet dancer in costa rica
and it's like you know what's expected of you you know you're expected to go get married or and then become a doctor but like your intrinsic joy will come
from going and being a ballet dancer in costa rica and uh not getting married or whatever and smoking i don't know whatever
in the mountains over there but you know i tend to believe and this is probably
there's no like i don't have a huge scientific basis for this i have a couple of like philosophical studies i've read but that um people who abandon like their
true selves or that conform to society's expectations typically have some point in their life some kind
of um moment of realization where they realize that they've not not fulfilled themselves as they could
have isn't this back to that point of expectation versus reality though
yeah i guess so like the gap between what we expect and then where we kind of
find ourselves to be or what we what that looks like because i think again that's that
and also you know i'm it's that idea again i feel like i talk about gaps a
lot but that idea that gap between the person i kind of know myself to be in the person i show everybody else that
i am and the bigger that gap the more space for struggles or battles or mental
health challenges around that what is and this might just be the title of this video because i
because i think it will be so we'll uh we'll clickbait this part what is the single biggest killer of
What is the single biggest killer of relationships?
relationships in the modern age in 2021 in your view if you had to say this one
thing is the single the biggest killer of relationships what would it be
unrealistic expectations one of the big problems you you talked about it
earlier this idea of like what we see in the movie so we're like oh that's what it's like so then when it's not like that we're
disappointed our partner fails us they haven't met our expectations they haven't met all of
our needs you know we talk about this idea lots of relationship experts talk about this idea of how we shouldn't expect
one person our partner to meet every single one of our needs but we do and so they're kind of doomed
to fail then in that way so how do we change that how do we start to kind of
like open that up how do we you know we have other relationships in our lives we have family we have friends we have
colleagues you know we need to start to think about like how we can do that for ourselves and then our we work with our partners
to create something together i completely resonate with that and i think most of my relationships fail
because the expectation that my partner has on me it goes unmet because i'm very selfish
and i like to work all the time and to think about my stuff all the time and i'm like very self-absorbed and when i have free time
i just want to like i don't know do something for me um i've tried over the years to like manage that expectation by making it
clear as early as i possibly can that like work is a huge part of my life and i am very selfish
selfish sounds like such a negative word but it means that like i'm so consumed with my passions and the things yeah like you could say focused i use
selfish because it makes it because i'm trying to take a little bit of blame i guess but i am so consumed with my passions like i will
work all day and then i'll go on youtube and want to watch something about spacex and elon musk taking spaceships to mars
and then in the morning you know i just want to do and i kind of want them to do their own thing as well
so i try and very early on lay that expectation down but it just never seems to work because
at the start someone will tell you that they oh they're cool with that they're never cool with that
ever i suppose it's about that you know relationships are about that balance of independence and dependence
and so it's where that balance sits i want independence
i want them to be independent me to be independent and will like meet in the middle sometimes but yeah i
i don't know maybe i i maybe i'm the problem because i think that compromise is
important i don't think i compromise very often as much as i should um
i went through my life i think pretending that i was just so focused on my work and no one could deal with it but i probably
think that i'm also like i think selfish is probably the word and unwilling to compromise and like i think so like the negative version of
selfish is also the word where like i prioritize my my needs more than someone else's
i think that's caused me a lot of problems i i sit with people in this podcast all the time that's super successful and they
they'll they largely struggle in relationships do you think that's because their
primary relationship then is with their work yeah and themselves because it meets you
know we see that right we need people talk about their businesses as their babies you know like that's my first baby or
that's my baby and i think that you know are we for some people we get
our needs met through our businesses through our passions through
our sport through our careers and for some people they might get enough of
their needs for relationships met in those kind of smaller doses or not in those kind of like single
intimate or couple or relational relationships but they have that met in other ways
across the board or in kind of smaller ways now who are we to pathologize that i suppose
difficult i was hoping you'd have all the answers i'm sorry i definitely don't have all the answers i can but compromise is important right yeah
but in any relationship you you compromise with people you work with you compromise with friends you
compromise with family members like we all we all have to compromise because relationships are however many people
there are but you know if we're talking about couples two people who are independent different
people trying to work together and they're not going to perfectly fit
together or be aligned in every single way so how do we navigate that when you're running your own business though and you're the ceo
you don't have to compromise as much do you know what i mean things tend to go on your schedule when you know you get to kind of lay
down so in your and then transitioning into your personal life you have to almost perform the opposite
behavior which is like high patience listening when you're the ceo you can
you know condense things how you want and you're leaning into your natural way of working and things are kind of going at
your cadence within your how you want things to happen whereas in your personal life that that's maybe where i've struggled
whereas like i've learned one behavior in my professional life which is about saving time on everything and optimizing
everything to be more productive and performance-based yeah and i'm like i don't want any sentence to be longer
than like it needs to be um so then transitioning into my private life where
things you know you can shall we go for a walk a [ __ ] wall like i'm like what are you doing what a
waste of time what what for like do you know what i mean and i think i've struggled with that
transition because the decision making framework i have whether that i use at work it can't be the same it's applicable oh
my god it's the worst and sometimes maybe it seeps over into my personal life so they're different
it's almost like different operating systems exactly exactly two different objectives do you think
that so if i like kind of push that back on to that kind of question of like how
relationships work back on to you then do you think that entrepreneurs or people who then kind of
go out on their own and do that are more prone to that different way of
relating or more that's their more natural style as in do i think they're more likely to
say so just to make sure in terms of you were saying like you know as a ceo you're like the person in charge you set
the agenda you set the time like it's more you're kind of leading that that in a
way that might be a piece of being an entrepreneur is
someone who kind of puts their head down and does that yeah but and it's also like heavily
learnt it's like you learn imagine if you put i don't know they say like you know how diamonds are made that it's like the
pressure over a million years or whatever um you get pressured over 10 years and you learn
a philosophy for your use of time for how you want things to happen whatever
um and that becomes part of your character even if it wasn't when you were you know 10 years before when going through that experience it
makes it part of your character where you're like quite impatient things you know typically operate
in the way you want them to so you learn that personal philosophy because that's what made you successful
and also that's what's required to succeed yeah yeah and i i genuinely
think that it's for me anyway i mean of course i've got these crazy hindsight biases but that's what was required for me to get
to where i needed to get to but if i want to be successful in my relationships then it's like all these
other things which is like compromise and patience and doing things for the sake of doing them as opposed to
where they're gonna get you yeah with some kind of outcome that's what i've struggled with anyway um but anyway enough about me you know a
How good are you at implementing the things you know?
lot of stuff right questionable yeah you've learned a lot of stuff so how easy did you find it
to implement all of this stuff that you know into your own life and in your own relationships i always whenever i have like an expert in a
specific topic on i'm always fascinated by their own ability to apply their knowledge in their own lives
um i mean i think you know speaking for myself in this space like i think we can i can
be a hypocrite i think we can all be hypocrites in our own ways and you know that's because we're also all human you know we all
still have our our triggers our anxieties our defenses and
i try my best and i think that you know that's the best you can do but i think that relationships there's
an acknowledgement that relationships take work and take nurture and i think actually when you try to talk about this
stuff all the time you actually sometimes need to kind of step back and be like okay so what am i doing here you know like at home how do i
implement this as a partner as a parent as a family member as a friend and it's kind of acknowledging
that i'm being thoughtful of it and i think that there's also that idea of like how
am i best working with or serving people close to me rather than kind of like
everything else something else to do for me it's about pulling away i suppose from being a yes man you know there was a stage in
my kind of life career and i said yes to absolutely everything and now you have to be a bit more selective because otherwise
then you lose the quality time and i think that quality time is an important part and it's actually making sure that
it's carved out protected um so i think for me that's a big part of it but yeah i think
not you know what what is the perfect relationship you know we're all working at everything all the
time and i don't pretend because i'm someone that works with relationships and sex i've not to be working on it myself
i bet all of your friends come to you so last night you like did you get that
a lot i think a bit but you know i think i feel incredibly um fortunate that i have a very
you know emotionally open emotionally intelligent group of friends you know like i surround myself with the people
where we have those open conversations we are able to go to like the difficult places it is very
mutually supportive and none of us pretend to have it all worked out or
that it's all perfect you know i think there's kind of a almost like a celebration of like the perfectly imperfectness
yeah of it all and also putting our hands up like wow this week is tough or i'm really struggling with this
or you know this is going on and i think that there's something in knowing you can
pick up the phone and just say that that is hugely hugely important
do you ever instruct or advise any of your patients to this is a [ __ ] rogue
question but i just came to my mind to go and get some kind of like training
sexual training is that a thing i've seen it in like a documentary i think it's quite like a place in amsterdam you can go and
i'll teach you how to you know give someone a hand job or something i don't know no i think you know i think
the where we're at now you know in the world is that there are online platforms kind of creating i suppose like more
instructional content so there's an amazing one that was launched by the kinsey institute which is one of the
leading kind of sexuality research institutes in the world and it's a platform called omgs and it's basically
about helping like instructional videos and interviews about like how to um create female orgasm or
stimulate female pleasure what's the website again
but i think that you know we are now you know with sexual wellness and well-being becoming such a big important
topic we're seeing that these platforms are coming up which are to help instruct or to help offer advice
and that means that the educational content is available to people and i recommend lots of that stuff
because if people feel informed they feel more confident and that means that they can have actionable things
to work on to build on and that they're more able to be like okay yeah i can i understand how this works
now whether this is our bodies or someone else's bodies to a certain extent so that can kind of help set me up for a
sexual experience and lastly just to sort of loop around
What are the principles for a great sexual relationship?
from the from the start what are the if you were to say that they were there were similarities in couples that do
enjoy great sexual relationship just principles top-line principles what are those sort of key distilled top-line principles um
such a big question communication communication yeah is like top of the tree and i think i
think it's top of the tree and i think it's the one that people don't want to hear because it's less actionable and it's
quite scary yeah exactly it's like in a way i think talking about it is the
hardest thing to do and but it is you know any relationship kind of expert any expert in the sexual kind
of well-being how space will say to you like communication is that and then it's like okay but
how do i do that and you know we talk about these
communication exercises things like kind of speaking from your own position so like i say so there's a place called the
gottman institute and they have you know done so much research on couples but it's this
ownership like my feelings are i'm feeling my perspective is because actually what
you're not saying to your partner is you yeah it's not blame it's not blame exactly so i think that
the communication part on like positive communication is a big part of that but it's that breakaway from assumption
it's like clarification or assumption assumption is what trips us up so much of the time because we're mind reading we think we
know what our partner's going to say before they say it so we don't even give them a chance yeah that's true well listen thank you
so much for your time i feel like um it's been a very enlightening conversation and i appreciate that the fact that you've taken the burden of all
of my sexual every sexually show i've ever had it's good to get it out of that i feel like
this was therapy for me more than anything else but um where can people find you and i know you're involved in a bunch of other
projects i know that you've got a sex toy project which you're involved in as well so where can people find you and reach you
yeah so my website is my name kate moyle.com at uk i host a podcast called the sexual wellness sessions where
we have um informative but informal conversations about different areas of sexual well-being so
whether that's desire sexual functioning kind of sexual mindset um infertility and sex you know try and
i try and cover kind of um specific subjects around like what people might be struggling with
um and then i'm on instagram at kate moyal therapy but um this expo project is on the uk sex expert for lilo
so um luxury sex play brand and they do some amazing amazing products as well so
and i work with um brands kind of creating like sexual kind of wellness focused i
suppose projects or huge products yeah and i think brands are really trying to get it right
and i really really respect that i think that's amazing so i actually love that work because it feels like it's taking the learning from inside the
therapy room and putting it out into the world and hopefully then that's creating that social cultural kind of sex positive
shift that i think we all need well thank you so much for coming on today it's a real pleasure to speak to you and i was so i've been so excited
about this conversation for a long time probably because i've been able to unload on my own personal issues but because you're someone that really
um has a powerful insight on a part of our lives that as you say is taboo
and often not talked about enough and that's why i thought that was good to to have this is one of the pages in this
podcast diary so thank you so much and um i'm sure we'll uh we'll i'll be in touch
with all my other issues every year i'll be in touch just just wanted to say thank you thanks
this is huge news i finally got to meet my debut book happy sexy millionaire it
arrived from my publisher last week and it was so surreal
seeing this book after about almost three years from the point where we had the idea and
i started speaking to publishers about it to the point where it's in my hands has been almost three
years and i traveled the world to produce this book i stayed in two different jungles on two different
opposite sides of the world for 60 days in total completely alone completely in isolation
to write this book i've poured so much time effort research studying into it i've met mental health
specialists i've met some of the most successful people in the world i've met clinical psychologists professors people that are experts on
divorce everything and i've poured all into this book mixed in with my own life experiences
it's without a shadow of a doubt the single most important thing i've ever produced and it's crazy because you have to sell
a book that's what like fuels the industry right that's what gives you a publisher that's what gets into shops that's what gives you
distribution but if i could if i could click my finger and everybody got it for free and it
meant that i made zero i would click my finger in a heartbeat because i think it's that important and i just want people to read it i don't care about the
money side of it it's everything i've ever learned all of my most important lessons distilled into this small book
and i teamed up with one of the world's leading artists in sort of visualizations and he produced about 25
images for the book as well so i know that some people learn through words some people learn through images
the book is a combination of the two happy sexy millionaire you can pre-order it everywhere now and if you do get that pre-order please

Intro
but i do personally think it's the best thing i've ever done in my whole life full stop and i was like look you're clearly
insane like i'm i've never drank air cold and i'm not gonna touch an illegal drug
but the biggest interference is death it's not my i don't choose the time i don't choose like and we need to change that
my guest today is a friend but he's also most definitely the most interesting
human being i have ever encountered in my life he's an entrepreneur he's an investor but he's also just a
really nice guy and he's invested and started companies in some of the most fascinating industries from
psychedelics to space tech to artificial intelligence to cryptocurrencies to fintech
you name it he's in there in fact he's the single biggest investor slash driving force
behind the whole psychedelics industry which is currently trying to cure mental health disorders this is undoubtedly the most interesting
person i know and i think this is the type of podcast where you're going to demand a part two
because we spoke for two hours and even i was left feeling that i was only scratching the surface and i wanted to
know more the man i'm talking about is christian angemeyer and i genuinely believe he's
going to become if he isn't already one of europe's most important investors and entrepreneurs in
the same way that people praise elon musk for all the work he's done in the us i think he's europe's answer to elon
musk without further ado i'm stephen bartlett and this is the dharva ceo i hope nobody's listening
but if you are then please keep this to yourself
christian i i know so much about you and the work you do i i know you're
The story behind the man
you know i've observed your behavior in person over the last you know six six to twelve months um deeply deeply
fascinating but the part of you that i know very very little about is your early years your upbringing your childhood
cute child really i've only had slithers of that part of
your life so could you tell me a little bit more about uh the childhood that made the man the
main point i'm always making which i'm really literally happy about is that i was a very very happy
child meaning i'm still a very happy person but i think the reason why i'm groundedly happy is because i had a
great like how you say childlike upbringing like i was growing up in a 90 people village
um so in bavaria i literally knew everybody then there were a lot of other children
so i'm an only child but like i had a lot of children sort of same age plus minus four years
to to grow up with um and we were literally like in the tv series we were out
all day like in summer in winter like it was very much like you would picture like what is this american tv series
where they might they on a farm or whatever like it was like that like sort of um idyllic childhood yes really idyllic
like yeah no crime like no risk like i was literally my mom
sent me out in the morning uh in summer winter and i came back in the evening since i'm like five like i was
because there was no risk for anything like um yeah so that was sort of the very very
this was till i'm nine and then we moved to a town mini kansas city town with like 2
000 people so it's me nearby like killer kilometer apart so it was all very very rural very
which i liked so i'm actually was thinking about if i have children when i have children then how to
recreate that which i think won't work so but like i think it's great to have nature which is also by
the way meaning already jumping but like yeah because you know that that would i do a lot in in
like in mental health work like and one thing which is really healthy very very simple uh for your mental
health is nature yeah like there is even in japan they prescribe like a war walk in the forest as a as a
treatment for depression so anyway so i grew up in these super nice childhood like i always was funnily um
very entrepreneurial yeah and nobody else is so not in my family not in this
village like so that was always literally like with six my mom still has the so the first thing
which i did when i learned writing was writing invoices like so it was tiny bills like
i said oh give me fives give me five cents for for salads so i was actually had a very a
flourishing gardening business so since i'm four like five yeah how's it going
i'm sorry wrong english terms not psychedelics no i i stopped it later on when i was
12. like you know what this is how i started my first business but my mom still remembers that the first thing i did
with my writing skills was writing her an invoice for salad and everything
and then i was literally liking a movie it's very stereotype but i was selling um lemonade to neighbors then i was
selling lollipops in school i was selling literally everything like i made a business out of everything so
i i remember when i went to the my first cinema um ever i think it was like seven
um then i was so fascinated that people are buying for something which is apparently also on tv
and they didn't get the difference yeah so then i started charging my parents at home when they wanted to switch on the tv
because i was pretending i was running a cinema so uh yeah so every literally everything
i was doing i saw through the lens of a business and and when you look at your channel my parents were deeply worried
in a nice way but they were always tend to be with with kids that are slightly different but they exactly i yeah so i look like them so
the discussion uh if they maybe not my parents was early off the table yeah but like sort of from the way how i
see the world and i'm very different what were the factors the sort of macro
factors at play that were making you into this entrepreneur at that age but also the entrepreneur you came to become
it was always there like sometimes i think for myself i think because my parents were never around they created this big sort of void of freedom
and independence which i thought made this connection in my mind that if i was going to get something it came from my behavior i'm thinking about those
factors that you know freedom you said you know i've heard you say that your parents were
very keen for you just to be happy yeah exactly like they were always like i can be whatever i want so but
it was not that i don't i don't know if that automatically leads to entrepreneurship it could also have led
to me being an artist or whatever like i don't think there is a connection between freedom it's actually the freedom to be
whatever you want and then i think maybe you maybe it's genetic maybe it's like i don't know like uh i really this is
though the point meaning it was always there there is not there is not a moment i can think of
where i sort of changed but it was literally since i can think
since i'm four five six like very very early it was always there to make a business out of
everything in a nice way hopefully that coupled with some kind of innate curiosity
which is theo said when he did a quote about you in sifted he said that curiosity is one
of your real sort of yeah benny i don't i just thinking if that was that early visible i loved
school which i think it was a very nerdy child as well so i yeah i i loved actually i did love
school for an evening now more talking than later high school for the one reason
and even if i look back now i really miss it a bit because it was the only time in life where you
do something for the pure reason of learning something with no material
sort of meaning i turned that then also in a business because i started my my this was my first real business was
when i started a tutoring business when i was 14. um and then i um what's that business
tell me tutoring like like giving sort of other kids yeah because it was extremely good in school so it
was always the best one in my school but it was practically always the best one in like the bavaria whatever like top ten yeah and
there was always i like to explain stuff so so i think i think that still helps me
now because it's part of fundraising to explain complex sort of things
to people anyway so i liked i did like to explain stuff and i did like to um and i was
good in the matter so so i started tutoring then there was this tiny thing i i think a bit that
because the teachers very much liked me because i was always like uh the good child like everybody
who came to me automatically became a little bit better because teachers were treating these children
more nicer because they were coming to me so it became these sort of um
positive virtual circle that more and more parents were like oh god we have to send our children to christian because it really works and i think and what
were you doing for these kids well tutoring like how are you teaching them teaching the same thing the same thing because they were these were the
the ones who didn't perform well how are you calling english tutoring right yeah and they were your peers they were the same age the same age or younger no
or younger like it was mainly like a little bit younger like one or two years but not a lot younger so anyway and then i was like after half
a year i was so like full like i think i worked like
10 15 hours a week uh practically all the time like it was tutoring like
and then i was like how do i really scale it up and it sounds not very um
i don't know very bail yeah but for me this was like the first time i really thought about business like in an
entrepreneurial way how do you scale it up and practically i realized i have the brand because parents want to send their
children to me so i was employing other
other pupils my same age or even a little bit older and said you can teach under my brand
and you get half of it and i get half of it so 50 margin and i started employing and i
continuously till my final grade had like 10 people like always employed yeah who
what you're doing other children yeah so it was a very lucrative business um many for for a child like but that's crazy it's
absolutely crazy yeah and then so you get to 16 you get to 18. in that period of your life i hear that in bavaria they have this
like public service you've got to do free yeah i just was thinking like how compliant do i have to be because then it's all i
think what is it called when it's out of time is back like nobody nobody can claw
it back like because what happened is like i was always extremely libertarian and in we had back then it changed in
germany but we had back then like the israelis have still you had to go to the military for a year
and i think in generally this is wrong not because i'm against the military but i think you can employ people this is a job like
people should want to be a soldier or should want to be something else but like i think as a government meaning in
general i think the less government the better so i i was thinking hopefully this comes across charming but
because i was thinking all the time how to avoid it unfortunately i was not daring enough back then there were tricks to do it
like you could have had said you you're sort of mentally ill or whatever like i was not brave enough to go on with
that so i i decided to do um you can you could also opt to do
civil servant i saw it in the civil servant like go to a hospital or whatever so and i tried to be really nice so i picked a
job which i knew is it didn't really really require me it was more like
okay you had to put these children who didn't want to go to the military you could say you're pacifist you had to put them somewhere it was not
that somebody was dependent on me so i was sitting in that hospital and my only job was
to bring stuff from a to b like whatever so then i made an i remember that i made a
um how you say a proposal that if we reorganize everything in the hospital
i could do my job in an hour and then go home yeah so this was i was 18 and then they were
like okay this is crazy like it's not really really popular um
so and then i made a decision that i'm not really gonna show up anymore um and the only way to do that was to
um to get always like doctors to give me like um a letter and so now comes but the
important point because like till that time i um i was extremely like
i loved learning so i was actually thinking i'm gonna if if i would have gone and i think this is
sometimes how crazy stuff happens and then it changes sort of the whole
course of your whole life practically so i think if i would have gone from high school to university i
i would would have just been in that sort of mode like of learning being extremely good so i guess
i would have just went on with what i was doing like meaning producing great academic
outcomes so to say so then came this one year which i was completely bored so i i got these doctors
um writing me letters that i didn't need to show up but in return i started managing money for them
because i was already speculating on the stock market since i was like 15 16 and i was not bad in it so i
became friends with all of these doctors even in the hospital i was working and they were all like well we help you
if you help us because this was the early days of the or you know like it was 1998 1999
like this was the stock market boom whatever so everybody wanted to be in it so this was sort of my
trade-off for these letters um and so and i can't be i'm
easily bored so i always want to do something so practically because so i was not the type of person who was okay i have a
free year now and i'm going just partying like i was like okay i have a free year now i'm gonna do more
tutoring yeah and i'm gonna do managing money for these doctors yeah and sort of that completely switched my
i say course like so i wasn't these i actually wrote the book yeah and tried to sell
that this didn't work out but i did a lot of entrepreneurial stuff just because i had time yeah and then when i practically went to
uni then a year later i was sort of mentally not anymore in that
sort of learning world i was in the okay i want to be an entrepreneur world and then i was in this sort of when i
met re-met actually two guys who finally were my tutors in a scholarship
i had had during high school already like for it sounds awkward but for highly gifted children
yeah so i was sort of in summer summer school that was university this
where i knew them from we re-met kind of and they were telling me about this idea
and it just sounded great and they were like my tutors in terms of i was like okay these guys are the
pinnacle of biotech um and then i was let's do a company together and uh
we did and this worked out really well and then i dropped out of uni so they saw it i think this how was this sort of
i think without these one year in hospital or sort of one year in hospital not in hospital
yeah i would have stayed in a completely different path i hear you talk a lot about you believe
in like the serendipity spirituality yeah which almost seems surprising because you're such a like a
scientific led person whereas you do you do believe that things happen at the right totally totally actually i'm actually very
extreme with that so i everything which has happening literally everything this conversation today well this
conversation happens because we planned it yeah but like the fact for example that we met originally
yeah while our mutual friend whatever so i'm always everything which is happening to me which i didn't actively say hey i need
to have a meeting like which is not in my usual rhythm yeah i always think
hey it's happening for a reason and also it's happening for a good reason even bad stuff i believe in this power
of positive thinking but like more like people always then say oh this means like if you wake up in the morning you're
if you feel great it's gonna be a great day i think it's more deeper i believe in this what there is this great book law of attraction like
whatever you sort of think and rather how you think not just the
meaning sort of the essence what you think not like the detail partly but more the essence and if you expect sort of good stuff to
happen you're sort of attracting that yeah you think there's a do you think there's a spiritual force that attracts it your intention moves you in that
direction so look i'm very pragmatic meaning i mean first of all i dare to talk about
this stuff because i'm very also scientific so i'm like look nobody will think i'm crazy
yeah uh maybe a bit no no joking like so but the other thing is like there are multiple explanations and i
don't really care about the explanation you can have a very spiritual explanation yeah it's the
force of the universe yeah and then you give a very pragmatic explanation that if you continuously expect positive stuff
then you look out for that stuff and then it's more like a a numbers game or like uh yeah but and i
don't care like it it works tremendously well for me since i'm 16 yeah and i had these i had some
very crazy things which go borderline which you could explain
like sort of with statistics or whatever yeah um so maybe too crazy with the chat but
but but like but there were some there were some things where i tend to believe in their spiritual
explanation yeah because they were yeah i think harder to explain or you can always
explain them with statistics but i you know what i mean like but i don't care like it does work tremendously well for me
okay so going back to this company you founded with these two your two sort of like universities mentors this company went
on to be really successful i think you said it's worth probably about 15 billion at last check market cap today but like
i sold very early but very early i sold when we went public for a billion so it was it was actually
fun do you regret selling well there's there's a short and long answer no because like the short answer is no
because like a that money was the basis for the rest yeah b also people always mix up market
cap and share price so meaning i sold at the lower share price that it's today but the share price is not 15x because
they did capital increases there was dilutive stuff like so so anyway long story it was an
amazing start yeah so um yeah it was actually the quickest biotech ipo i think in germany ever uh we ipod three
years three and a half years later after foundation and for a billion so it was was everything
um and it was sort of i dropped out of university before but it like was the sort of sort of catalyst i would say yeah so i
don't regret that and uh and since then sort of i'm investing and being
entrepreneur i'm somewhat in between i would say i actually sorry when i'm jumping i had this one story again by the way which is
Visualisation
completely you can serendipitous serendipitous and like even a bit more so i remember it exactly
i was 14 years old and i was with my best friends back then
in munich which is far away meaning for me this was like going going to the big street
and we spent the weekend with family members i mean i really remember every single detail of the
weekend like what we did and like where what and we went to a bookstore
which is for germans who listen who can do places back then was like sort of like i don't know iconic
bookstore 100 years old in munich i think it's still even there although books are dying out
um smaller so it's in the prime location of munich and so i remember it so i go into that
bookstore and there was this whole i was a promotion
wall right yeah with just one book which uh which which is uh the american
think and grow rich from napoleon hill and do you know like when in movies like the 14 year old boy
goes in and then the light is coming down and then the hallelujah is coming sort of that meaning there was no music
there was no light i was like that's it think and grow rich i need to have that book so i bought the book
and it was practically my first kind of i mean napoleon hill is not as spiritual
as some others but like that was my journey into that world of let's say
spiritual infused success how do you define spiritual well there
is like napoleon hill is sort of and i love it by the way because they're all so old like they're all out of the 1920s
so they they don't have the zeitgeist which i think in terms of success is rather negative like
so it's sort of like raw american only principles yes exactly like
and napoleon hill has this why was a great entry into that thing because his view was
if you read minnie the book starts that he says he got commissioned by um andrew carnegie who was the steel
magnet to find out and do interviews which i think by the way you are doing in a certain way
yeah with successful people um and find out if there are common traits
uh you say tracy common denominators which make them successful and he did that with all the famous
people of his time from andrew carnegie himself to a lot of other famous people and then he made that into the
book and he's actually saying that the question he doesn't answer the question why these uh
rules so to say work he's more a neutral observer and then the next one is actually there's a guy called dr joseph
murphy who wrote similar books but more like with the spiritual undertone
why these rules work same rules sort of more explanation why they work which went more into the religious world
and then you have all the other book and law of attraction is nothing else which is sort of the modern version and
the key which is a sort of a simplified version of an anyway simplified version yeah of
this stuff like but it's at the end it's always the same rules some we think they're god given some
which say look again this is statistics whatever but they do work i deeply believe and
these things do work yeah um which is like visualization the the way you think it's visualization
is that the main thing i think is two things is visualization so i meditate in the morning and evening but it's not real
meditation it's more like visualization so i ex i always have a plan for the week for the months for the year for my life
yeah and everything kind of did come true so far so i'm always
thinking what could i add like a wish list yeah and now again you can say if you add something and then you you focused
on it it might come true because you focused on it there could be a very banal explanation that it's relentless execution and nothing
magic and again i don't care it's like i'm like well like yeah it does work so and the
visual i think it's the two things visualization and it's also these that you have for example i'm not it
sounds very crazy but i'm trying to not have negative thoughts so and then there is a number of negative thoughts you're going
to have anyway because you have to deal with stuff when you run a business but i for example have never watched a horror movie since 20 years
at least because it gives me negativity so i and i go the extra mile so i told for
example friends when they are too much complaining meaning i'm the first one friends can call for a problem but then
i'm like let's go through the problem that's the solution that's what you're gonna do but if they would repeatedly
because some people want to not solve the problem they want to repeat the problem then like you can't call me again on that topic
because no negativity yeah so i really have a rule yeah so no negative movies i never watch
a movie with has not a happy ending so i have people check or i check yeah before does
it have a happy ending no bad endings nothing which makes me sad nothing which makes me negative
because i'm not i'm not allowed in my own religious philosophy to have negative thoughts and feelings feelings are even more
important than thoughts because i think they are the underlying driver so and it sounds now maybe
cheesy and simplified but i think if you this is what i'm doing since i'm 14 and if you train yourself
not and again you will always have an sort of amount because sometimes hard things happen
yeah and i don't want to pretend as if my life was easy because i did have very hard times in business
but even in those times i was lying in my bed literally and was like okay this is not fun what's happening
right now but it must happen for a very very positive reason because this is how your world works and
finally it always the worst things in my life turned into the best ones
yeah so because i again and you can say now maybe somebody would say well because he
was persistent and he didn't fall okay then this is the explanation maybe there's a deeper one again i don't
care i can always come to like so but i would tell everybody the two things emotionally is like don't have negative
thoughts just focus on positive sort of thoughts visualize these are the key
things be happy so many things that you know and dare to be happy because most people are again don't allow themselves to be happy
and even think it's a little bit negative yeah so there's this whole thing happening on instagram i want to come back to this point about
this movies and because i think it's very much linked to your whole thing about alcohol and stuff this this happiness
equilibrium you talk about but just quickly on that point of being really positive and unapologetically
positive and saying listen don't call me with the same problem twice don't interrupt my positivity there's this whole movement happening on instagram at
the moment where there's such a thing as being toxic positive it's called it's [ __ ] like everybody's like no and
they're like getting on this point like because that's one thing i think i mean again
maybe so i have to so maybe i'm sitting there i'm already so old that there is another
generation i'm thinking about the other generation and because i'm reading a lot like very
old stuff and you find socrates complaining about the youth so maybe that's a recurring thing yeah
but i really think part part of the millennial culture of this victimization and always like
that is this is so wrong this is so wrong yeah so to pre-take a question because they
normally say well you saying that because you're rich you're white yeah so i was like okay this is maybe a
point let's go back because i didn't talk a lot about it but i'm happy to already like i grew up in these 90 people village
yeah i'm gay i'm actually happily gay but i look mean i know i'm i'm gonna gaze in some 11-ish roundabout
so and i was looking at sort of that world i was growing up in and i was like that's not gonna resonate here yeah so
seriously like and that's very very uh very uh positive phrase
yeah so in my school people were saying let's beat up gay people and i was like that's not gonna end well
so but i didn't think that this is anything bad by the way i didn't even think these people were
sort of wrong obviously they were wrong but i was like they don't know better i'm not like ah these are bad people i was just like
be pragmatic sometimes life is not fair sometimes life is not nice but you can decide if you react on it that's
one of the other points i really believe in that you have these tiny milliseconds in life on everything
if somebody is sort of rude to you if somebody says something very bad and you can decide if you hurt or not
it's your decision by the way nothing's going to hurt you if you decide you're not gonna be hurt yeah so and i was like they don't know
better and i can't by the way and by the way gay is not what defines me so i was like well then i'm i'm not gay
for a while until i'm out of here yeah i can't have because there are other things which define me like friends like you know like you know what
i mean like it's not that i reduced myself to this one thing and was like and now i need to shout it
out to the world and in return would have get beaten up like i was like just like just don't do it like but don't blame
the others yeah and then move away someone also i mean i mean it's all like don't try to change everybody else work
on yourself and like and your environment what you can change like i could have started like oh my god
my life is miserable and i'm growing up in this village and blah blah blah and actually
talking about serendipity i'm i'm honestly i'm but again i'm trained to see the positive stuff
because if i look back if i would have been straight i wouldn't sit here for a very simple reason because i would
have dated every single free minute i would have had like yeah and would have enjoyed
that yeah so but i couldn't so so what did i do i was working my ass
off and learning all the time so and if i hadn't had the grades i had i would have ended the first money i had
i would have never met these guys with whom i started the biotech company yeah nothing would have happened i would
have been an ordinary straight boy most likely smart yeah but not uber smart because sometimes
it's smart and hard work to get great yeah it's not all false not fun so so so the practically
the if you say like that you say adversary or the negative thing being gay in a very hostile
environment and not talking about it and focusing on other stuff completely made my life yeah in a very
positive way i i wouldn't i mean yeah i i'm so happy that this was the case
yeah and again and everybody should look everybody has um limitations and negative stuff
but you should look at it and say they are there for a very positive reason and something
amazing will come out of it i just need to have this continuous sort of expectation and optimism and yeah yeah
and you have a real sense of like personal responsibility that comes across like you'll take responsibility for yourself and your actions like who else i mean
it's like who else should the government or you know someone else jesus we see that with the vaccine give the government a little bit of
responsibility and it goes totally wrong you don't want anybody be responsible for you than yourself
so going to this point about the horror films which i thought was somewhat connected to what i've heard about your rule with alcohol and cigarettes you i
hear you've never drunk before ever you've never had a drink exactly so there were two reasons for it they were connected the one again by the
way the one reason was because i was actually thinking like if i'm gonna be drunk 14 15 i'm gonna
spill out i'm gay and then it's over yeah so so my social life of being the darling of the school
day yeah exactly now and i was also like i was very nerdy so teachers loved me but i was also how
you say school speaker speaker of the school whatever so i was socially had a great life so i was like no
that's not risk then like no alcohol you could say the wrong stuff yeah so there was the one thing and the other
thing was that i always sort of because you do that as a child but in general and i think it's a good thing like
if you have one weakness in my case the weakness for the time was being gay the others you build on your strengths
which was like okay i think i'm kind of smart and also like smart in terms of learning smart i learned very easy i always had the
best grades yeah so i was i was sort of focusing on that so i was also like okay alcohol could
take that away from me uh because i thought it makes me dumb which by the way does
yeah in a lot of amounts i still wouldn't drink but so these are my childish reasons not
to drink and then i just decided okay i think i have the perfect equilibrium
like uh being always happy having very good grades everything was perfect so i was like i'm
not gonna touch any drug ever and you still haven't touched alcohol cigarettes no so i have not i
haven't drank alcohol i haven't smoked a cigarette ever i haven't smoked a joint ever i've never take cocaine i've not
anything like no comment i did i did actually drink alcohol the first time when i was sorry echoes eclectic
coffee uh the first time when i was 28. so you're good coffee as well i was even avoiding coffee and tea yeah because it
was a drug it was almost like the very religious people so i would have been a good mormon um so um but then coffee i started
drinking when i was 28. there's something crazy here where you think okay so the guy that doesn't want to upset his equilibrium
goes on to be the biggest psychedelics investor in the world which is i think that was a very good ground because what happened is
so i had a discussion or dinner it wasn't a discussion it was like a dinner discussion like we were say
somebody set us next to each other uh with finally the joke and said oh
you the guy was very or is a very famous um drug researcher like he's the david nut
Psychedelics
of germany like the a drug uh yeah uh adviser to the government that uh yeah a neuroscientist and
somebody said oh you should you should sit next to each other because maybe you can loosen christian up a bit and you could drink a little bit of
alcohol so so this is how i met rhino his name deputy again it's no but like exactly like again by
the way everybody else would have said i remember that i was like oh my god that's awesome like and everybody else
would have said well again in every single thing happening i see it's good for me yeah so um so anyway so
we had this discussion and i mean the short version is he was like look everything you
think is bad is bad like so don't don't touch it exactly he actually showed me these and
uh whoever is watching and maybe i don't know if you can put it into the the like this yeah so he's like
this is this very famous but it's so um to the point i mean david not in the uk wrote the whole book
about the misperception of drugs but this one like he had this one chart which david not
made and reina pulled it uh pulled it off in the internet where you can see sort of the harm um of
each drug yeah so how much harm there was this harm scale and correctly on number one is alcohol because
in a in a holistic approach alcohol is the worst and then closely followed by heroin
which by the way the media used a little bit against they would not which was highly unfair because the headline i remember i think the sun or whatever was
like oh guy says heroin is better than alcohol no the thing is like they're both very very bad
like but alcohol is as well we have these and this is the chart that says the harm to you and the harm to others both it's
it's it's one second yeah so yeah a chart that shows the harm that these different drugs have on you and others
and alcohol is the worst exactly i was the worst but closely followed by heroin yeah and closely followed by um crystal math
or whatever like everything is bad and i really like if there is one positive outcome of people
watching that don't do it but don't do alcohol don't do heroin don't do crystal meth don't nothing no there is no by the way and
i'm the most again pragmatic person because what i was talking with him was like is there any drug there could be a drug
where you say oh it has a little bit of downside but it has enormous upside and then you can think for yourself
again you are responsible i don't think the government should be responsible to think for myself is there any
upside of me taking that risk because if i go in a car i came to you in a car so i took a risk of dying meaning very
low but there was a risk but i was it's worth to sit with stephen and do their podcast like no but
everything we do in life by the way people should look at is like risk return yeah so maybe somebody says
oh if i smoke a joint once in a while it makes me so relaxed but you should be aware of
the risks and i think people aren't especially not with alcohol yeah and if you then still decide actively i'm gonna enjoy my glass
of wine and i think it's great but you should know it anyway so but at the end of that scale it said
um probably with at the very end these mushrooms magic mushrooms and before their endless second sort of
easiest or second lowest risk is his lsd practically the psychedelic group of uh of drug and he was like christian
like i can't tell you what my host told me to tell you that you should try alcohol don't meaning i can also tell you're not
gonna die but like don't do it yeah uh but you should do actually magic mushrooms
and i was like look you're clearly insane like i'm i've never drank air cold and i'm not
gonna touch an illegal drug yeah and he was very very uh
persuasive because he was like look first of all you do bio attack you started your career empire tech like
i send you um i sent you all the research i did or i do but also which was very cool hindsight i
didn't even value it back then he was like i did my phd with famous hoffman who invented lsd so
so ryan it was replugged into like the old guard of psychedelic luminaries
and he was like i sent you all what what he did like read it because there were all these studies it's not like a
crazy idea meaning again actually magic mushrooms or the ingredients of cybin was used
as an approved medical drug in the 50s by sandoz actually very at least in germany famous brand um
for for depression he was like look it was medical it has no risk as you can see i tell you
as in the older studies at least read it and again i'm very curious i was like well send me i'm so that was actually again
serendipity and so and now comes the biggest territory because like so for one year i was just like not meaning it's not
that i had it on my mind every day i was it was there like i read a little bit here and by the way again
i know there's even a book about that okay right which says what some people believe is destiny it's
just like if you aware of a theme yeah it's a little bit like when i tell you don't think of the blue elephant or
the white whatever you think of it like so there is this one book i can't remember the name which again would be fine for
me like because again it works was like if you are aware of a thing of a theme
then it pops up everywhere you'll see it yeah so over a year there were not a lot because it was completely not in the
public domain but like they were once here and there i was like okay read something again whatever and then
more or less exactly one year later i was with my best friends who
actually have a stake in a tie so they happy with my best friends in the caribbean uh so disclaimer
it was a place uh where where it's legal um and they had magic mushrooms and they
had it like it looked like mushrooms like this was good because i i'm so hypochondriac and
frightened of everything so i would never have taken anything which didn't look like mushrooms
so but these were dried mushrooms like so i was like from the ground yeah i was like okay that looks real like and
they were like and i trust them they're my best friends yeah so big shout out to landon and julian
yeah so i trust them anyway they were like we grew it ourselves so like safe we know what we're doing yeah um
and i was like actually calling rhino and a guy in germany yes so i'm not mentioning his
last name because i don't know if he works still in a very famous job uh he
was actually saying the sentence look as your doctor friend do it it's the best place best people you know
it's real it's a certain setting everything is perfect do it so so i took all my courage ahead um i was
really like and it it sounds now i can't say how nervous i was in sort of
both anxious and positive like it was like really not maybe people say oh he's talking about benchmarks all the time it must have
been an easy decision it was not yeah for days and i was like okay let's do it i still know exactly the point on
the beach yeah because we're going there every easter and somewhere i'm going to put a big magic mushroom statue here
uh i really will i really will i know the guys who are on the island so i yeah they already know of it actually
the guy who owns the island is now a shareholder thai as well so everybody is literally everybody's like
so um so i did it and it was the single most meaningful thing full stop and by
the way it confirmed everything i just said so because what a lot of people report
is that um that you it's a very spiritual experience and
in that case it was not just a spiritual experience but it really confirmed a hundred percent my fuel life which is
by the way interesting because if we look now at people because a lot of people ask me
especially successful people they're like oh i've read somebody takes it and then he's want to be a farmer in
brazil by the way which was my biggest fear my biggest fear was like i'm gonna come out of that and i'm gonna change my whole life
because i realize that i don't know i want to do something else hindsight
i tell everybody that look at me and look at others we have both we have people like me who come out are
very even more happy but it for me it was a very big confirmation of what i'm doing yeah um
because um yeah i don't know because like it was a confirmation like okay you see the world in the right way
everything what you do how you do you can work on it so i got a lot of ideas how to
make it better but like sort of the message was you're on the right path so some other people come out and the
message is look you have to do something completely yes what is why is it different it's actually the same what it does
i think one sort of how you say one description of psychedelics is in
general they you realize or you um you recognize yourself and all
your sort of positive and all your dreams all your trauma and everybody has a bit
of strong must not be a real so everything and then and some people and then i was always
hindsight i can say now i was right like i or i was right i i was good in it i was always living a
very honest life to myself again doesn't mean that i say hey i decided for example
not to tell anybody i'm gay but that's not from my point of view this was not a lie because it's my decision but it was not
a lie to myself yeah it was an active decision to just make your life interesting yeah it was suppressing it that was just like
pragmatically yeah by the way it was also very simple there was also nobody to date i was very simple like
no exactly risk return there was no upside because there was nobody who would have
appreciated that yeah and if there would have been a hot guy and i was like he's gay i'm gay it was like hey
immediately like but there was no upside but a lot of downside anyway but what i'm saying is like i always lived a very honest life
um to myself yeah again this doesn't mean you have to shout everything out and this was confirmed so other people
who don't live an honest life to themselves and lie to themselves and maybe tell
themselves that they are happy with xyz they might realize on a magic mushroom trip that they're not like they
need and this is the other people who change yeah but so it's very dependent on yeah but it was just one aspect of so
many positive aspects and then sort of i i immediately after the trip had sort of
the idea okay this should be actually legal i was actually not even the first impetus was not that
i should make a company because i was very sure people must work on that stuff because it's so
powerful and when i then found out actually took me two years i was looking around like that there was
none then we did it ourselves just to go back to that point though you you categorize that moment your first trip
as the single most meaningful experience of your life yep today full stop nothing comes close
and maybe i would add plus the follow-on trips over the last year so it's not just this one trip i would say
as well but i would i would i would summarize my psychedelic experience
and i still like try to do a trip once or twice a year in a country where it's legal yeah i would summarize as the most
meaningful sort of holistic experience i've had in my life false yeah for sure like
you do this trip on the beach with your friends you you think to yourself you know this must be legal fast forward
you get a call from one of your friends called mike no it's like it's way crazier it's way crazier again
super serendipity so fast forward for two years i was very very carefully
looking around and actually not telling a lot of people about it which was wrong and if i would have gone on like that
i wouldn't sit here again meaning at least not no i would sit here maybe maybe but like not talking about mushrooms or psychedelics so for two years i was kind
of extremely holding back so i told my closest friends actually the ones who knew me very well
saw that or positive like my parents were like hey you became an even nicer child we have an amazing relationship but it became
even better so my mom was very quickly saying something happened in your holiday yeah yeah so so uh so the ones who knew me
well but like i didn't shout it out and i was actually very very careful and shy because it's like
technically yeah and back then by the way let's not forget like we're talking about it also now so easily because
all the books came out we have the success like compass is listed like
now is completely different than so anyway so for two years i was very like low-key
yeah and then i had and again this is like maybe the biggest financial serendipity uh or is there any
like message of the universe if you want to see it like that because for two years i was sort of like just
telling friends very close friends and then i had uh one other trip within a holiday trip
the main message on that trip was christian this makes you so happy you have to talk to other
people about this don't be shy just good thing will come up things will come out if you talk about it
so i had a real mission so i got this real mission on that trip to sort of be open about it and then
actually from that holiday i was flying literally the week after i met a very
close friend and business partner of mine mike novogratz um who's big in finance last
yeah so but he's not what i want to say he's not the guy who would talk about mushrooms normally and i
wouldn't have had but he was my test case because i had the mission the mission was don't be afraid talk about management
because it's going to be good for you and the world so i met mike and he literally mike he's always like that
what's up because i think i do cool stuff like from a lot of stuff so a lot of friends are always
like hey what's new what's up what are you investing in i was like mike you won't believe it i just had
a mushroom trip and this was amazing and i want to talk tell you about it and he was like this
whoa mushroom like i remember mike said the descendants like he hasn't talked about it hadn't back
then for like 20 years because especially in the us a lot of people it's like a college thing like party journal yeah uh he was like 20
years never heard about it again since college so i told him all of my experience
on that trip um and in general amateur so and he was like very interested yeah and so the next day literally the
next day my phone rings mikey's on and actually he said it yeah he said look christian this is the
weirdest coincidence so since 20 years or i haven't talked about psychedelics for
20 years yesterday you were in my office talking about nothing else in psychedelics
and this morning my sister or sister her sister called him so my sister called me and she's on bali
with these crazy couples from london who told her they want to start a company which is working on bringing
magic mushrooms back in the living room and they need somebody who's financing them and nobody wants to touch it
and i was like this is such a coincidence you're in london in london like yeah and these are george
and katya the founders of compass yeah and i was like connect me immediately and i remember this was
january and then we met when i was back and they were back from bali in february um 2017.
yeah and i they tell me if we talk about like within the meeting i was like okay we
got we're gonna do that together that's that's what i've waited for since two years and again if i hadn't taken the
decision to openly talk about it um i wouldn't have told mike i wouldn't have met
george and katya we wouldn't sit here at least not sit here talking about this one and the magic motions were the thing
that told you to talk about it's a trip and you end up being you know the single biggest investor in the space
a space which is now really sort of main becoming more mainstream at an alarming rate a sort of a category
that's exploded from a financial perspective um and you've you've fat co-founded and
invested into the two biggest sort of companies in this area atai and compass pathways exactly so practice
co-founded bowser in compass i was more the seed investor because it was georges and katya's idea and i
added actually a very close friend of mine lars as the third co-founder and i was the seed investor but sort of i was
there even before the company existed we were sitting in my in my living room and planning it and then when i realized
how positive or it was actually easier as the wrong word but it was sort
of i had i had expected more
hurdles yeah and it's maybe sadly actually the time which is helping us because
there are so many people suffering and it becomes sort of also financially sometimes life is very
the world functions very pragmatic like in the moment something becomes a big crisis also financially yeah the
yeah good regulations api so anyway whatever it was it was the right time so
compass quickly actually got fda um fast track designation which was
a big thing stuff like that so and then i actually realized oh there are more psychedelics
out there than meaning everybody's always almost using magic mushrooms and psychedelics as the same but like
we have the headline psychedelics a group of drugs and pseudocybin the active ingredient in magic mushrooms is one of them
so when there are more of them from mdma to lsd ketamine ibogaine whatever and and compass wanted
always to focus on um on pseudocybin so i was like okay then i'm starting a
tie as sort of a platform where we actually bring on more more of these compounds
to explore them for mental health issues of all the compounds in a tie and i know there's a lot of them right i
think you've got over 13 compounds different psychedelic compounds within a tie um we've talked a lot about magic
mushrooms and that the active compounded magic mushrooms for anybody that doesn't know is psilocybin which is what compass pathway does
of all the others and i know this is like i've heard you say before this is like choosing your favorite child which ones of the psychedelic compounds
is incredibly compelling to you and really stands out is being able to have a really significant impact
that's really hard to say every minute because like it really meaning because they all have
all all compounds we work on have a sort of reason to exist or positive like
have a have a place in treating mental health issues hopefully tell me about ibogaine then yeah so so then now it's what i want is the
question is what is your what what does somebody sees as the
biggest problems or name me the problem you think is the worst and then i tell you sort of which drug is the best like kind
of so so i think ibogaine is this is interesting because also
because ibogaine goes against addiction and there is actually almost nothing else
which works for addiction so addiction see we talk about his severe addiction like especially to opioids and heroin is
sort of i don't know if you can say it on english portugal you're really [ __ ] up like it's like
that's one of the really severe mental stuff like where most people have um how you call
it like um relapse relapses like it and then it's also one of these sort of things if
you look at i don't know families and friends where somebody is addicted sort of it's very like
it's a cancer in in in the social environment so it's sort of it's it's but age but or i would even
say any mental health is like it's always affecting others as well but i think addiction sort of stands out in a certain way
and ibogaine is the only drug we know which potentially i always have to say with all these drugs potentially because
we are about to prove it once and for all with scientific terms
our scientific framework fda sort of compliant but ibogaine has the potential
to really cure addiction with one trip yeah and there will be a massive game changer for the whole opio crisis
uh but even alcohol addiction like it's not just opioids like yeah and yeah you know you're trying to
you're trying to make people's lives better right you're trying to get them it almost seems like you know because you've
you've been gifted enough to be happy your whole life you you're doing a lot to make sure other people can be happy on one end but the other thing that
you're doing which also kind of blew my mind when i met you is trying to extend life you know you've got elon who's like trying to save
life on earth but also take us to a new one and it seems like you know a pirate on your investment company is trying to make the life we live more
Life longevity
joyous and fulfilled but also trying to extend it and the work you're doing with life longevity i actually find
maybe even more [Music] bonkers like when i first heard about
psychedelics i was like really and then i spent six months nine months learning and i was like oh my god like
i get it but life longevity for me is like really we can really we can really extend our
lives and you've got companies which are working on that challenge so tell me about life longevity is it
possible i well okay let's so so
let's phrase it correctly like because even i if i want to sort of say something very
um pokey i'm like oh we're gonna live forever yeah that's not gonna happen for an excellent
reason meaning yes you could say maybe we live forever if we really upload our brain to our computer but that not
that i think that's completely impossible but i think then we're not human anymore that's a different discussion like
so but i would say as long as we stay fairly human meaning having a body
having sort of the human set that we have yeah there will always be an end let's
start there because the worst case if you live hundreds of years you're gonna have an accident somewhere and somebody blows you up you have a by the
way it's gone like it's a as a side note i think it's gonna change once we get older and older it's gonna
change the way how we look at risk because i already start avoiding crazy stuff
because i'm like it's not worth it again risk return like i have this one colleague i always try
to convince he's 50 and he drives a motorbike and i'm like you shouldn't do it like the sort of statistic the risk is so big
of driving a motorbike and his answer is well because he's still thinking his life expectancy is 70.
he's like well but i'm exchanging 20 years if it happens against my biggest passion and this is a
trade-off worth it and i was like well hey it's already stupid but if you if you it's okay if
this is your opinion 20 years against the risk of losing it but i tell you like it's not 20 you
already if you're 50 i'm gonna get you up or we gonna get you up with longevity science to maybe 90 or 100 by the way in a good
way so would you exchange 50. and then suddenly you see okay then he starts thinking because
so and now thinking a little bit further like if you say hey our natural life experience someone will
be 200 maybe we stop doing stuff we're doing now because
it could sort of yeah so but you know back to your question like longevity never means immortality because
again as long as we stay kind of human because there is an accident risk by the way i also believe spiritually
again that we don't want to live forever i think part of being human again as long as we
say that and we can talk about that as well because another thing i'm thinking a lot maybe we don't stay human in our current
form but so i think two part of being human is having an end because that makes
everything we do yeah so i just don't want it now like i would have more of it but i think the the sort of the lim that
there is a time limit on being human is actually which makes us thrive yeah and which makes us
everything special everything special so i don't think i want to take that away i just want to extend
the joy yeah doesn't it just become relative again then so if you live to 150 but right so so what i really believe
what we get in the next maybe like 30 20 to 30 to come it's i
think it's gonna come way quicker than people think is that we're gonna get life expectancy
up to to a time or two to a to a to a size to magnitude where
we want to die and i think it's even like this will be a range and some people might already
say we've had nerd i had it all i had enough birthdays enough
um christmases i know so some people want to maybe leave to 300 but i think we're gonna give people that optionality sooner than
we think and then i think dying will be like this is my vision like it's a celebration
i would someone say look guys i had it all i love you love life but i really think i'm ready
for whatever comes maybe comes nothing i don't know but like i have an expectation but like yeah but whatever it is i'm gonna finish
it now throw a big party say goodbye to everybody and then go out on my own terms on my own time i think
that's gonna be sooner than we think you whisped there i have an expectation
well i think there is another life like i think it's a continuous uh cycle but that's not a spiritual
question like but like i i very much believe we have an eternal soul yeah i don't even think there is a number but first of all again i come
back which gives me a lot of thing i don't believe in the christian thing that we have anything to prove that's
already starts because it means you're not worthy and you have to prove yourself worthy like it's like
you i think everybody should be deeply happy and do exactly what he or she feels is the
right thing to do now by the way again this is i think what people realize on the on the psychedelics is like they
i always like to say like which is maybe a good way to describe a psychedelic trip like since we're young and again
maybe my parents were like better than other parents in avoiding that but since we're a baby people start
telling us what we should do what we should not do how we should be
how we should think how we should so and i always say like there is your soul somewhere like from what the form
of your soul is like but there is somewhere the level of you use and again the problem is when we have this
discussion and what i want to avoid why i'm sometimes so blurry is that if you start using religious terms then
some people might be set off yeah or pushed away because if i
use the word soul or god then a christian person might have a different reaction than a muslim person than a
then a hindu person yeah interestingly a lot of people who went through psychedelics have sort of the same
description because so so anyways it's by trying to use as neutral words as possible so let's call
it soul or inner you or whatever and then you have all these sort of external
sort of garbage almost what other people put on you yeah and and i think some
people literally lose sight what they really are and want so and i
actually was always very good so what i realized under my trip that sort of so what happens under a trip
sort of all this garbage is taken away so you really look at you but you and you are real
naked sort of form like for me i mean like you recognize yourself all your fears
all your wishes all your whatever yeah and interestingly it was
for me it was still a great experience but it was not so different so which told me okay i did a good job
before psychedelics to sort of be again true to myself and i don't believe in what what some
faiths say that that oh you have to be worthy because you are worthy yeah and you are great you just should live
the life as sort of it is fit for you and again this is for everybody it's different but you
need to know it yeah so so but to compare so this is my belief and then so and be so so there is no okay i have it's not like
a computer game where you have to reach a level and do certain things and then come to the next one
i just think it's like an endless positive sort of cycle of experiences yeah so and i
definitely know that somewhere and i'm gonna want to go to to the next level is the
wrong word to the next experience yeah um but for now i want to actually extend this one
a lot of people don't get to live and this is what i was thinking is like this this idea that people will get to a
point in their life where they say do you know what i've had enough this has been great i j would you do you genuinely believe
you'll get to a point where maybe 150 whatever what do you think i think someone is going to happen like i maybe it's very late meaning i hope
but again i think this is the ultimate meaning i'm already pissed about the government interfering in my stuff in any way
but the biggest interference is death it's not my i don't choose the time i don't choose
like and we need to change that so i think the biggest sort of liberty everybody has
will be choosing his or her own deaths but you'll always be curious the world will always be changing
they'll always be go on like a long time i i i'm trying to understand if i if i genuinely believe that christian
angermeier will ever get to point where he's bored because you're such a curious but it's great if that is the case i
really don't know like meaning but i'm just saying i believe like again i think there is a moment everybody will
come to that maybe it's very very great like i'm working on it like and you don't think death is in that is
a especially that age is like a natural thing i hear you talking about it as a
as a bug or as a disease or something well that's i would say definitely aging is a disease something
is wrong so something is i know how the 20 year old christian
looked and who was and felt and by the way my dna is the same like it was when i was born
like it was when i was 20 like it's now but something of the same dna it's like a little bit we know how the house with
the construction plan of the house is the same and some why the sort of minions who
who translate the construction plan into the building yeah change it and not to the
better from age 20 on like a cray hair whatever like so but we know
still it is there like the original source of information is there our dna so we just need to find out
it is super simplified what changes the translation of our dna
into mistakes and into what we call aging yeah that's a very simplified view but it shows you that it's not so natural
yeah because it's not that your dna is if if it would be natural maybe your dna would change you would say we can't
change that yeah but it's not like your dna is the same until you die like so we just need to make
sure that the translation happens like when you were 20. so by the way i deeply believe not just that we can slow down
and stop aging we can reverse it because again i know how stephen and you are still obviously at your prime
yeah but i know how christian in his primes looked like you know what i mean
yeah and we can't bring it back so sometimes yeah some animals live for a couple of days though so i take like i look at take an
evolutionary perspective on this and think like you know there's some like flies that live like four days but it's enough maybe we are there at
the moment to escape the evolutionary velocity maybe that's the pinnacle where we sort of start becoming i know
because i don't mean it like in a plasphemic way i think we're meant to be like gods in our own way yeah and we start now to go to the
sort of source and construction of life ourselves and i think that's an enormously curious thing and like yeah
maybe that's what we meant to be i'm rather on the positive side this is not blessed for me or whatever but this is like what
god set us up for so to say by the way every single religion it's very fun nobody ever i don't think i love
by the way and you know we can't say today that there is a big thing coming out about religion and and science of
religion but i always loved that i'm always was finally drawn to the mystical side and the religious side and aside of what we
discussed on that what i call spiritual side i was always always very interested in the history of religions and interestingly a
one sad actually happy and sad observation is that in the very core religions are the same
they all preach the same good stuff be nice be nice to others and then
once they become an organization the [ __ ] starts yeah so and and also one what most religions
have just going through but yeah literally most religions have the big ones
is that they at the very beginning say that we are a part and a mirror always it's the
english term that we are an image of god and we don't talk about that because now everybody's like oh if you
if you want to live forever but a lot of people again if you want to defy aging and
there are a lot of people that oh you want to play god yeah this is a lot of different there are bottles and i was like but maybe
that's what we meant to be because if i go to the bible it says we are the image of god so maybe
we are meant to play god because that's what we are in a philosophical way so i don't think it's
not ethical at all i think it's the ultimate actually challenge we have to solve yeah um the other rebuttal i
would i thought the first time i had about the the possibility of extending life was that you know we'd have a really aging
population where we'd all be so it's interesting you talk about reversing aging but we'd all be 170 and slightly
like you know slow doesn't make any it doesn't make medically or a sense we won't be 150 and super old it
doesn't make sense you can't extend lifespan that much without rejuvenation it comes at this
thanksgiving nobody wants to be like because by the way that's what most people fear though why
they it's interesting how many people reject the idea of living very long it's none of her ever living
very long but the one of the very banal reasons is that they automatically
think okay if christian would succeed in making us live 250 they take
okay i know a 90 year old granny from of mine and she's not in good shape and now they add another 60
years and they're like no that's not what i want but that's exactly but that's not what's gonna happen in the moment we can push
life expectancy way further than 90 it it goes hand in hand with rejuvenation
and then more people want it and what time frame do you expect i think we're gonna see
step really really tangible steps forward the next 20 years yeah and then let's say 20 to
40 laters like by the way which is not that far yeah and um and also
um the um this is gonna change society meaning everything and interestingly every politician i
talk to things like well that's far away and i was like no it's not it's not that so far away than
you think and like it's gonna affect us sooner and we need to talk about it about about social systems about anything yeah
uh it's gonna be one of the massive black but not a negative way by the way i think it's gonna be good but like i'm
an eternal optimist like um but like you know it will be a massive change for the world
but let me drink this delicious drink what's it sure
i called it like in a commercial in that we should like leave the lane it's like hopefully who will you yeah yeah
human fuel human film okay it's a very good name yeah that's right who came up with that
name julian oh yeah um so switching because in fact the
topic the topics of conversation we've discussed are super interesting but personally the things that i find most fascinating about you
are you're just like ridiculous ridiculous work ethic and i've talked to
some of your friends i spoke to aaron i spoke to people around you just to confirm what i thought
and the intensity and the amount you work i think is just like staggering i think i'm really hard working
i've seen you in action around the clock over the weekend the fact that we're doing this on a saturday i don't normally record the podcast well it's a
hobby it's like it's like having fun it's not like work but i know it yeah my point is about you know
in culture people talk about this term work life balance and i think you've kind of responded to it there very easy there shouldn't be a work-life
balance there should just be one continuous hobby it's my view on it people should
love what they do in a way obviously you do different things and i love more things so but like i i always said since i'm
16 or actually 14 since i have my tutoring if i would call it work-life balance
then i have a shitty life because it's just work but my work is my life and i love it and it's integrated
and most of my friends i work with and like even like friends who didn't this is how
i came to the movie business because just like i had friends who were actors and were in a movie business and then i was like maybe we should work
together we should find a movie like it's like yeah i don't want to see it as a separation separation
quick one starting from the minute the lockdown is lifted we're going to start bringing in some of our subscribers to watch how this podcast is produced
behind the scenes means you get to meet the guests meet myself and see how we put all of this together if you want that to be you all you've
got to do hit the subscribe button let's talk about more personal things so relationships how does someone who works
as hard as you find any i'm presuming you value what relationships can
bring you well a complicated topic is working progress welcome to the podcast
now it's like no that's work in progress so that's like because obviously like
i'm so much in love with my work that um that it's always it's hard i
Relationships
think for another person although i think i can try to be very uplifting because i would try
and say the same what i told you is like i would tell every partner like you have to find you can't
expect from me to get give you meaning you need to give yourself meaning and then we can be happy together yeah but this is unfortunately not how a
lot of people work like so it's very easy that's sort of i have a quote on instagram my best
performing whatever it says um if we're dating i want to be your second priority i want your first priority to
be you your passion is your future if we're happy alone we'll be happier together yeah that'd tell us
i'm happy alone by the way yeah i i'm also like an introvert extrovert so people think i'm very extrovert
and i can be and they want to be like can i like to host parties and dinners and do things
like that but then i want to be alone actually a lot so do you value
and tell me the value of a relationship in your view of like a really good committed
relationship do you value it that's a complication right so um because because if i say no it sounds
brutal no no and i don't mean it like i i think it's more the answer is more complicated so
i built myself that i that i'm sort of very like independently so so i
value relationships a lot so that's the real answer but i i'm not
in the concept that one should stand out so i rather have groups so i i believe
that or a belief like i do have like 10 but not one like 10 very very close
friends who most of them i have since very long time i actually extremely value
relations but i'm not saying okay there is this one relation in my life which will completely stand
out from the rest which is maybe a um a complicated thing for racism i do think though this will change
once you get children yeah so which i want so that's sort of the yeah um and by the
way i also do think people change like and um and i don't think the core view changes and like the core but like
you can make adjustments so i know for example that when i want children or once i have
children that i have to make adjustments because i just want children if they have the
same happy childhood that i had so i want to be either no dad or a great dad yeah so and then i
know i need to make adjustments so but then it's worth it and then it's my active decision to take it
how is it you are the busiest person i know it's just thinking then i'm thinking is this the busiest person i know you probably you're the busiest
person i know i'd say have you struggled to have romantic relationships because
of that busyness um like you know like uh interrogation occurred what
these are the things no one talks about right i sit here single struggling so i'm like i'll ask christian because
he's way busier and i'm struggling so is there any hope for steve yeah i'm totally lying
it's funny this feels like a bit more of an uncomfortable topic for you for some reason no it's just very
private it's not uncomfortable i will tell you my views in private easier because um
100 000 people watching exactly hundred thousand viewers yeah now it's getting really like cringy um
no it is definitely a problem full stop like yeah and you realize that you're
gonna have to adjust if yeah and then you always say like okay
you do that the issue is like what i thinking a lot how do you know when to adjust like in terms of because you would say
romantically would say you adjust when the right one comes how do you know that the right one comes if you don't have time to figure out to
the right there is this a little bit and i haven't figured that fully out you're someone looking at the past 40 years of your
life that does whatever he wants to do and isn't actually very good at adjusting unwillingly you've never been good in your life
story at doing something unwillingly exactly you go the way christian wants
to go and i just i wonder i'm like when will what will be the catalyst you said kids may be there but we'll be the catalyst
that makes christian adjust but maybe it's a romantic thing you really like love at first sight i
mean again the good thing is that i i deeply believe that makes me very common that coming
back to what we had this i i deeply believe it's gonna come at the right time
and i know that i'm sort of enough open for it because it's the same like with business ideas or the same with other
stuff in my life again if you open open heart open mind you're gonna see it when it comes so
it's not it's a little bit like with anything else that like you don't have negative thoughts don't
think oh i need it now like yeah so it comes when it comes like because everything in my life came at
the right time why not this one so i'm very that's how i see it
well i guess at the macro level by the way if in the moment things came i can just say now business stuff but
like i get it business is my like when psychedelics came and then the business meaning that's
sort of very a big part of my time allocation over the last
like four or five years was in the into the secondary business i made space for it and so i'm always like it's not again
when things comes you realize that you you realize the message and
then you make space for it but there's a chance you said that you might be obstructing it from coming and happening because
you're so preoccupied with no i'm thinking about that but then my conclusion is then usually that or is
because again like i'm because romance is maybe but it's not maybe it's maybe not like
finding a good company maybe that sounds no very um very non-romantic but i don't mean it's
romantic because i also think finding companies very romantic or very very uh emotional yeah if i look for example
the psychedelic business i think that but i do actively again it's not that
i'm ignoring it's what i said before my my philosophy of not having negative thoughts doesn't
mean that you cannot analyze sort of stuff and sort of look on the risky side so i do think about it
is my life how i lead it maybe preventing to have sort of the one and only
romantic um experience yeah my conclusion is then mostly
that i'm like okay no because like it will come at the right time and then you're gonna realize it and then you're gonna make space like you make
like i make space for everything else it's so funny because because you're such an eternal optimist i almost can't get you to but that's how
it works bad things happen to me as well bad things are there but my mind twists
it around or twists like this is what i'm really training since i'm 14 since like what's the book in music like every so
throw it to me a negative thing and i'm i'm maybe a little bit puzzled for a
second or for example even like this is how it works like things even if things in our portfolio don't go well i'm like a little bit like
shaking for a moment and i'm like where's the good thing and how can i turn that in my mind how
can i see the upside yeah it's fascinating because i was yeah i'm trying to get you
to you know the reason why i started this podcast is because i sometimes i want to highlight that for all the great things people see that you
know people watching you thinking i would want to have all these companies and manage two billion of assets and all these things but there's always a there's
always some kind of down not downside but sacrifice we could say that's happening and i'm trying to get
out where that sacrifice is and the problem is you are happy so
and you're pursuing yourself so it's hard to identify a sacrifice when you're that opportunity
exactly i know what you mean i just try also as a message not to see it like i think people
shouldn't see it because that's the negative story about success the negative story of a success is that people see people
and say oh i want to be like them yeah i would like to have the wells i would like to have xyz
then they can't immediately have it because by the way it's a long process and you need to work harder but
and then they tell you oh they must have gone through a lot of sacrifice yeah and then this is a little bit what
calms them down or they they have a lot of bad stuff like coming with it i think that's the wrong way to look at for both sides like i
think the right way to look at it should like do i really want that is this really what makes me happy
yeah and then it's by the way not that easy just meaning everybody would say like oh yeah i think it's like
simplified money makes me happy but then again do you makes it happy what comes with it but i don't want to call it a
sacrifice because i wouldn't do it if i would have to sacrifice stuff in order to get money because it's not about money anyway by
the way money from a certain moment on is not really
the driving force there is there is that there isn't meaning that there is great research it's not my it's like that for from practically zero
to x money gives you happiness because it makes your life easier so but then somewhere you're not going
to spend it because then when it becomes a figure yeah and then it's about do you love what you do yeah
so latest then yeah but like so i don't people should see not this you can't see i don't know wealth
or anything separated from the the process of how you got there yeah
and then it's not about saying oh the process was hard and sacrificed it's like is the whole process what i
love doing then you should throw you sort of or is it something else what i love and then you should not
though envy other people because that makes you miserable as well you should always embrace what
the problem is people often don't know what they really want yeah and then again psychedelics give
you like but like in the moment you embrace what you really want and maybe
like like a housewife maybe really loves it it's not something where she should say oh i'm just a housewife and somebody else is a
big entrepreneur maybe that's what she really wants in this life she maybe wants to have children take care of them and take care of him
in exactly way but it's about knowing that actively not letting other people
put you in that position or let circumstances put you in that position but like
actively know yourself is that what makes you happy yeah i've written about this at length in the book this idea
that like um but obviously the huge force in our lives at the moment which whispers in our ear that we want to be something
else is like social media and society to say you've got to be a doctor your mum might say or instagram will say you've got to be a
billionaire and really you just want to be an artist that dances in croatia you know what i mean exactly embrace it but again you need to know it
like by the way i think as much as i love tech that's one of the other topics which
which really like sort of how you say keep me aware yeah but keep me away at night is something in
the world we live in or actually something in the world we are building because we we're
reconstructing the world in any form and people i think have no
no real glimpse yet how crazy this will be yeah we're going now people think we
The tech boom is coming
were in like a 20 year of tech boom which is true on the one side but if you
really honestly there is this famous quote which i love to use from peter thiel who said we wanted flying cars
and we got 140 characters on twitter yeah which says practically if you look at
the last 20 years yes we had a tech boom but more or less i'm simplifying yeah
what changed is the distribution of goods amazon now we're not shopping anymore we're getting it delivered but it's still the
same goods yeah and social media changed communication
changed but we didn't go to the fabric of society industry and ourselves
so now we're starting going to reformulate and re-change the fabric of ourselves longevity we're
going to really make not just five years ago maybe we would have hundreds which change everything we change
and this is all interdependent and in a moment we changed the fabric of our body or then we changed the fabric of society
because society is very much linked to an 80-year life expectancy yeah flying cars are now really coming
literally we have fly yeah we have flying cars now so yeah we're gonna go to mars somewhere and
it's gonna happen maybe twenty maybe it's gonna happen so the world is gonna change like we have never seen it before
so and i love it yeah and you love it and maybe even the people who watch that love it because otherwise they maybe
wouldn't watch it but like the majority of people doesn't yeah so and i think that's one of the
underlying reasons which makes the society more and more depressive
or mental health because like i think there is this enormous fear um and people often have like i
think it's another word for gut feeling like you have you can't really explain it
what makes you nervous but it makes you nervous and i think that's what happening so i think the sort of the world as a whole except of
some internal optimists and some techies yeah are like yeah maybe i like a single
piece i like my iphone i like that but as an entirety that makes me deeply
uncomfortable the rates have changed around exactly yeah so and even if they don't know it the bus driver
maybe can't fully explain how a self-driving bus will work but somewhere he feels that in ten years
it's not gonna be his job anymore yeah and i think that creates a lot of risk because the last time that happened
that was when we changed from the agricultural society to the um to the industrial society
yeah and you can say now we change from the industrial society to let's call it data society
we need a word for it so we're changing and changing a massive way so and then so there are a lot of
parallels of the time between 1875 and 1920
the people were there was this elite technically who said everything is possible you had um it was i think it was in 1870
but i don't know something when the eiffel tower was built there was these uh what is it called world exhibition like
and people were like oh my god i mean there was jules verne but it was also around the time and hopefully i spell him right in
english like he wrote all these books yeah like the sci-fi books yeah so the world was already there once
unfortunately we had then two world wars yeah and you can look at a lot of reasons why world war one and two happen
and there is a lot of different layers of of reasons but i believe that the main
reason is this sort of disenfranchisement of the agricultural society who were deeply
panicky like what's happening to the world because the world the farmer yeah in the 19th century knew
was disappearing in in front of his eyes yeah and it's exactly happening the same again
so could there not be a another reason linked to that why people are becoming depressed in the technological evolution because you know
to start this podcast you said about the importance of nature and i've read studies about you know prisoners who face who face nature versus a brick
wall are 30 percent less likely to be depressed and the the sort of very human prehistoric origin of the
human being is one that's in nature it's one that's in a tribe it has meaningful connections and the
technological revolution is really you know i now live between four white walls alone in a big grey city could that also not be part of the
reason why people are we're getting less human than ever and in fact what i like about you know
when i read about some of the social reasons why people are getting more depressed it's because we're getting further and further away from
being human this is maybe a little bit more philosophical but like if you look at like the things that help
with mental health some typically it's it's meaningful connection it's nature it's good diet
no more junk and these are all things that humans did ten thousand years ago it's like we have to go back to find ourselves
again or we have to find our human place in a world which is
changing so yes so i i do i do think a lot how can we stay human in a world which is changing
that crazily as it does which wants robots it's like this world now would appreciate if i was a
robot more productive no i i no i think we can adjust and by the way and i know what we need it's like and i'm saying that with
all the disclaimers it's not legal right now and i'm always coming back to that but i do think some when psychedelics
will be will be the medication for that because it keeps us in a certain way
very human but at the same time makes us very adaptive in our environment um so that so
i give you is more or less the same what you said so how i see what do humans need to be happy i think it's three
things it's some form of faith and i explain it a second so it's faith
it's purpose and it's love it's super cheesy what i'm saying no but like these are the three things which i
i think make us as a as as a the combination of these three
things make make us happily then i think let's go go through it the face means any form of um
higher meaning or the other way around i think being atheist or believing ritually in a materialistic
world where if you die you're dead and then you rocked yeah makes people very unhappy this is not a again many i made i think
the case that i believe in in more but like let's it's not even a case it's just like saying like
factually i think people need that we need this why every society ever developed the religion like
i think we need it why because we terrorized of dying we don't admit it i admit it i don't want to age aging
sucks dying sucks and even worse by the way dying of people i love sucks so and we
don't talk about it we completely pushed it away from us yeah and i believe religion always gave
people that sort of calmness or a little bit of a calmness
that as death is not the end you're going to see people again people you love whatever so and i think it's important
because otherwise you have this permanent terror of death in your head and you might not have been it but you have second point
is purpose what i said with the bus driver people need a purpose yeah and they need to know why they wake
up in the morning and and what they're doing so having said that
uh in front of our very eyes at the moment like these these things are dissolving that the purpose is so we
need to find new ones and the most important is we need love and in a cheesy way must not be a one-on-one relationship
but it could be it could be a one-on-one relation it could be a family it could be a close friend could be a community yeah so love on
various levels so and actually the bad thing is if you look at where the world is going at the moment
all these three things are dissolved so faces on a super decline yeah then purpose is only decline
because we changing the world and most people don't find their purpose immediately there and then unfortunately also communities
are on decline traditional family structures but also communities i mean if i remember if i grew up i had like
what do you call it in english when you go to like a theater group and i had 10 groups like it was all like it was it was the sort of the pinnacle
of community we were so and it was great yeah and i don't think if you have that anymore in that way yeah or at least this sort of vanishing
yeah statistically accurate there's a study in the us which says um 15 years ago
people would respond to the question how many people can you turn to in time of crisis the medium answer was three it's now
zero crazy like i had ten when i was young and psychedelics are giving you that all of that they're giving you faith
spirituality they're giving you purpose because you you re you realize that the purpose lies within you and you can reinvent yourself
and they're giving you love because you realize the value of connections whatever
i read tons of things and this is a bit of a sideways but i read it great oh it's really great like what is great
i love it like he's talking about the hue or he's drinking it's good i will send you a big box of it there's different flavors this one's
berry so we'll send you this flavor as well but it's also really good for you it's the reason i'm in the best shape of my life i've read
something really interesting which again goes against a couple of narratives i would expect from you you said you have 42
pills a day round about is someone that doesn't want to mess with the their equilibrium it's having 42
different pills yeah but it's it's not it's okay
no no it's like someone gonna put it online because so many people ask like so i um first of all i think everything
we take we eat is an active decision so i like so if you remember like before the the
the um the podcast i was looking at it because i wanted to know what is in it like and there is seems to be a lot of good stuff in it
yeah i think that might be one of the greatest endorsements ever the fact that somebody who cares that
much about their health that they won't touch anything bad looked at what was inside huel looked at
the the vitamins the the level of protein the carbs and all of the amazing things it has in it
someone like christian who is a billionaire and decided that it was good enough for him right um christian is obsessed with his
health and uh and also i guess the other thing is he really really enjoyed the flavor as well he tried two flavors he tried the new
banana flavor which if you haven't tried i highly recommend you do but he also tried the berry flavor which
he actually decided to take with him which was my old my old favorite flavor my new favorite flavor is the ready to drink banana
flavor but um i believe you know someone like christian who cares a lot about his
health who cares about convenience and who cares about consuming things that taste good i believe christian's
the perfect customer for you if you are someone that is often skips meals or doesn't always get
the sort of nutritionally complete diet that you need to function properly and to extend the length of your life
and to be healthy in your body and mind and health is just such a good solution so so i don't
i'm not in the camp where some people say oh vitamins or any form of of added stuff is bad because i'm like
everything i eat is something external going in my body yeah so and then
my view on aging at the moment is at the moment there is unfortunately we're working on it hard yeah but there is
nothing which really slows down aging dramatically yeah dramatically or and or even
Easy things to prolong life
reverses it however there are things which give you a little bit of an edge
yeah and the edge is not big yeah but unfortunately i'm not 20 anymore if i
would be in 20 which uh then i would say hey no then then that optionality would be super
easy if i would be 20 now and i tell that my god children i don't believe it they're 10 i'm like you're gonna live for hundreds
of years yeah so i'm unfortunately fortunately because i still have the opportunity
and again my decision was like i wanna work on it because i think i do it better than others yeah and then rather trust myself than
waiting when i was doing it seriously like we're like i'm like okay but i'm i'm at the borderline like because i need to hurry
up so so even if i do something now at the moment which gives me statistically two more years that's two
more years like yeah in a in a race yeah tell me how these things are well i think because i'm 20 so i'd like
to yes so i think there are some some easy things to do like um the uh for example sleep is super
important yeah then um why why sleep important
i mean we could you should do i told you that you should do a podcast just about sleep yeah sleep packs barn
last two weeks ago yeah oh you had so it's perfect like there's so many reasons but sleep is one of the core things
we don't fully understand it yet but like who has practically if you mean i don't know the exact number but
read why we sleep from matthew walker like i think if you if you sleep two three
hours less than you should for some days your immune system is collapsing if your immune system collapsing that your probability of
cancer goes up and i mean sleep has so many good sleep is so good for you and neg
too little sleep has so many negative consequences that so sleep is super important so i try
to sleep enough for example i try that's one of the luxury things uh which i can do because i work for myself that i don't have
early morning meetings so and i have always something to do like emails whatever but i try that i can wake up naturally
so i never wake up with an alarm clock as unless i need to fly or whatever yeah
so um so that's one thing then obviously no alcohol alcohol is it is toxic like full stop cigarettes all
all drugs except of psychedelics are toxic yeah so don't do them yeah very bad for aging yeah you see that by the way when
people like yeah um i don't wanna say now that i aged well but like if i
go to a class reunion or whatever like some people who drink wearing a lot of alcohol and eat [ __ ] yeah they look older like
yeah it's like so so they say is their food like insect be healthy don't carbs like sugar is super bad like i
think so so i don't want to go yes i do 42 pills or whatever it is yeah and meaning
i mean the list would be long maybe again maybe i put it somewhere online but i think the message is because if people jump
from zero to 42 pills they won't do it anyway so whoever listens now i would say if you do the three four five things which sort
of it's these 80 20 rules i'm trying to carve out the last 20 but go for the sort of the easy
hard and easy first sleep healthy food exercise is super important must not be
super hard exercise but like every day like 20 30 minutes of mild to medium exercise
as i said no drugs no alcohol whatever um these are the main ones you're gonna
be significantly healthier and how do you talk about intermittent fasting yes oh sorry intermittent fasting is one yes
so i try not to eat for 16 18 hours a day every day and once you start doing it you you sort
of you why why'd you do that why do you intermittently fast i've always been curious about it i've never done it
uh because it's very healthy meaning there are enough a lot of health benefits your your blood sugar levels sort of
normalizes which has then sort of a lot of um follow-on effects yeah it's also
you lose weight it's very simple like yeah um i am i actually have one other thing
that i wanted to ask you about i mean i i don't i have a million things but in the interest of time it was about bitcoin yep you you've
been a big investor in bitcoin and the future of bitcoin you're bullish super polish because what i think is
like all politicians from left and right from from any part of the spectrum
and by the way i think about a lot i think maybe it's not even a stupid decision what they took but like all politicians
decided that money printing is the thing to go yeah so we're gonna see this massive
Bitcoin
devaluation of fiat funny and never before again i really love history and normally
this happened to one currency or one country or whatever at the moment it happens it's it's
happening to all the major currencies in the world euro uh remnant b
like us dollar everything is sort of devaluated at the same time so and because everything is relative to
each other obviously by the way it's not just bitcoin but assets go up this is why i'm on a 10-year horizon
i'm extremely bullish on in general quality assets stocks bitcoin
anything which is not cash i think the most dangerous asset class for 10 years is
cash doesn't mean by the way there can't be stock market crash whatever in between where you want to have cash
to buy yeah so you should have like how you say english tactically cash but not like strategically cash
um so but bitcoin and so and bitcoin is one of these assets first and then second the world always
needs a store of value so for thousands of years gold was the store value of choice i mean you
think about it how many currencies were there and many thousands because by
the way always politicians mess it up always like politicians can't be entrusted with currencies
full stop it's always a bad idea yeah always 100 and so people always had gold yeah so
but gold isn't is also people that say oh bitcoin has no value gold has no value you can't eat it it's actually one of these things like
you can't he did it's maybe nice to look at but like it's just a convention it's just an agreement
humanity has and i would go further it's embedded in our cultural system there are so many fairy tales and things
about gold but if you ask a 10 year old for him it's bitcoin bitcoin is his pop culture sort of value
and that's exactly a goal so and i think that shift has happened or is about to happen that bitcoin is at least additionally to
gold and someone will completely make gold redundant yeah is the new store of value and it's just
you can argue now what's the value of bitcoin because it's a it's a convention it's a deal society made that we accept
that that's the value yeah there is no nothing more meaning you can add that and say oh maybe
bitcoin is disrupting the financial but it's all secondary the main thing is is it a sort of value not and for me
it is a store of value yeah that's sort of the main driver of uh bitcoin is the new gold that's enough by
the way to make it still go up dramatically compared to gold we could talk about this forever but um
my last question and this is definitely my last question is as you think forward you know in your future you set up at
the start of this podcast about visualizing every morning you visualize and you think about the things that you want your future to hold
i know if i said to you like what's the end there is no end i get that because i understand you're thinking this is a continuous pursuit of your own hobbies and
interests but when you visualize what you want christian's future to look like saying
you know a couple of decades from now what are the like the principles of that future what are
What does your future look like?
the characteristics of it still want to look like today you want to look super sexy and young yes you want to be 20 years old
we're going to make that yeah we can do that on photoshop no not on photoshop we're going to make things because i value human connection
photoshop doesn't work because you wanted to be cyborgs anyway so in virtual world so well i think
we're going to be cyborgs i think we're going to that's one of the drivers which i think is still human we're going to merge with technology we already are meaning
uh what is it called like what you put on your heart like a scent or like whatever yeah yeah it's already like a cyborg
it's just like very early exactly it's very so but that's the whole point i there is no end game because that would
be kind of sad it's this what it's the same like with work-life balance to say if i would just work because then you're
back at these famous sort of what was it a novel from whom was it like that or this old tale where the fisher is on the
the guys on the beach and meets the guy who like the story yeah you know which one i mean like yeah so
where then he comes out oh he works his ass off just to lie on the beach and then the poor guy is saying why you could lie on the beach now
that's the whole point it's about the journey it's not about an end point so i don't have an end
point and i never had i just like try to keep my again it's all about
keeping my life exciting because if it wouldn't then i would want to die so keep my life cool
and this by the way this can change when maybe in 40 years it's not i'm not a robot like this is not gonna
i'm not gonna be i'm maturing like oh maturity like i'm changing in a positive way like
uh maybe in 40 years i decide that i don't think so but i don't know
like and it's like the good thing is that i'm open for i don't want to be already maybe in four years i look i had now everything i had
on a in entrepreneurship maybe i want to you you feel yourself changing and maturing
yeah but maturing is i wonder you don't yet changing but in a good way that again i'm trying to
continuously analyze what now we're back at the word soul or
whatever you would call it your inner voice is telling you what is good for me now and it might be that
this is changing over time so for example i decided decided the wrong word like i
feel that it's getting time somewhere not urgently to getting children like if
you would have asked me 20 years ago i would have said no i don't want children like yeah so but it's like hope being open
for that and maybe in 40 years i'm just making it up now as an example not that i feel like maybe i say look i
want to be a singer now got beware and the world is like no no no but like maybe i have some new
ideas which really like are different what i'm doing now but like it's important to stay open for that inner voice
because it might change and just because again so far continuously i love doing what i do and exploring that but
like you know what i mean like i can get you yeah so don't put an end point there is not this one thing
because that would be sad like if a most depressive day ever isn't it exactly like today you lose all meaning seemingly
yeah well listen thank you so much for for agreeing to do this you are honestly the one of the most fascinating people i
i've i've ever met and i i'm not just saying i want to win i'm sure you do no no i want to be doing
something creative like something artistic artistic yeah so i've i've gone through the same thing
since leaving social channels like i'm gonna dj i'm i've done a big uh by the way i thought it was very cool when you told me that
i was like that's a cool thing i've got i've directed a theatrical show with the associate director of hamilton it's it's
theater it's called the dire overseer live it's the theatrical version of my life there's a 50-person choir
sold out already and i said to myself that i didn't want to be a label so i don't want to be a
social media ceo i'm a guy that has a bunch of perspective and that perspective can be applied to art my book
which i wrote myself the show creating music i've got my first dj performance at festival this
year and i just thought what if you detached yourself from your labels what kind of person would you become you'd become artistic you'd become
health-centric you'd start businesses you know for example i always think i should write the script because i can't act
when i could like when i'm not good at it like also you should be always self-aware it's not worth pursuing but like i
always tell you maybe you should write a script i was like because i love movies i produce movies so so i so i was like maybe i should and
but again it's always listening to yourself what your soul inner voice however you're going to call it not society
exactly and not outside world is telling you you are the probably the most
interesting person i know in in a really compelling way sometimes i know people and they're like
successful and i think oh god i hate to be that person but you are in like a really compelling unique way because of your work you do
but because of your philosophy for life because of this sort of this i guess like almost i don't know how they refer to it but this like
how your how your scientific view can can merge with a spiritual one and a religious one
i find super fascinating and i think it's those sort of intersections that create really interesting ideas um you're also the most hard-working
person i know um but you're also a really nice guy oh thank you really like nice guy
behind the scenes as well and so thank you for coming on the podcast i think you know i think your future is going to
be staggering i talk about you all the time to my team all the time i'm like you know because you are very very
compelling in a number of really positive ways i think i think the work you're doing with a thai campus and all of your other
companies are staggering and i think you're actually going to be one of the most important entrepreneurs
creators of our time i think the world is like no no i don't really
i genuinely was like i know christian coming to my podcast now i know in 10 years time this is probably gonna be one of my most few podcasts ever because of the
trajectory you're on and the way you think it's my my prediction i'm very rarely wrong
and it's been a privilege to work with you over the last couple of months and understand that because it's been inspiring for me um thank you for doing this today i hope
you've enjoyed it yeah i did i did very much amazing thank you thank you thank you people ask me for book
recommendations all the time and i finally got one for you it's a book called happy sexy millionaire which is authored by me
i spent the last almost two years in jungles around the world in costa rica and indonesia in solitude
writing this book it's the there's this crazy thing when you write a book because you spend so much time pouring your
heart and soul into it and everything you know and all of the revelations you've had in your life and then there's this barrier which is
that people have to buy the thing in order for them to get that thing that means so much to you i wish that wasn't the case
it's just the way the industry is and in order to get that distribution and to get it on shelves you need a publisher so
please please please if you can if you've ever liked anything i've ever produced this podcast my instagrams
anything i've ever said read this book there was no ghost writer i wrote every single word myself there's
some real surprises in there it's an honest sometimes hilarious incredibly vulnerable hopefully valuable recount of my life my
journey everything i've learned across across the way and really the answer to being fulfilled to being happy and to
achieving success it is the most important important thing i've ever created so i implore you to go
to amazon now or wherever you get your books and get that pre-order if you get that pre-order i'm gonna put you into a group
with everybody that's pre-ordered it and i'm gonna send you some exclusive stuff so the first things i'm gonna do is a series of voice notes which i think
are um are going to be pretty powerful i'm going to give you access to some tickets which nobody else will have and i'm going to do everything i can to
thank you for for giving me that sort of nine quid of your money whatever it is happy sexy millionaire
you can pre-order it everywhere now and if you do get that pre-order please do dm me because i'd love to thank you myself

Transcription:

that's it i was like my career is over i had like no confidence or no i was like
a shell of like my former self
you don't often get to hear about the real human implications of cancer culture you don't
get to hear how it feels for the recipient you don't get to see how it plays out in the moment my next
guest he can tell you jack maynard was caught in the middle of a well-known well-documented british council culture
moment when something that he had said almost 10 years earlier resurfaced while he was at the peak of
his powers while he was fulfilling his dream while he was in the middle of filming i'm a celebrity get me out of here a
couple of years ago and the events that would unfold following that council culture moment would change him
forever ptsd anxiety depression shame he even remarked today that there
was a high chance he wasn't going to make it to this podcast because some of those symptoms still remain
i guess the question is how do you pick yourself up from something like that how do those moments feel what actually
happens when you're told while you're in the middle of the jungle in australia filming a show
that the outside world has turned against you these are the things you can only learn
from hearing the truth from someone that's been through those situations so without further ado my name is
stephen bartlett and this is the diver ceo i hope nobody's listening but if you are
then please keep this to yourself
Youtube and your family
so jack um i did a lot of research on you and your your background what you're into
the work you do and your sort of professional endeavors are quite eclectic that you know it's hard to pin down
whether you consider yourself to be a youtuber now yeah or a dj yeah or something else so i wanted to despite
all the research i wanted to ask you like i'm not a fan of like labeling oneself how do you how do you classify yourself
i still do describe myself as a youtuber like to everyone on me i kind of say oh yeah you know i do
youtube and you still to this day get a look of like which mean you do youtube that's your job but i think
like you said there's kind of a collective of things i do and when i kind of break it down to everything i do they yeah like kind
of fully understand now like very recently as well people have only just started to
understand like what it actually is in that youtube and just social media itself can be
obviously a job so yeah i still go for youtube that's why you don't post as much as you used to on
youtube no mainly because literally at the beginning of last year
i decided right i want to go kind of bigger productions a lot like a lot of the music videos i've done and
things like that and i just want to kind of get out there like other i kind of really want to just get loads of like celebrities and like reality tv
stars on my channel and do loads of fun things in places like you know all over the world with them and then
obviously kind of covert came in because i was just at a point where i was so like honestly like sick to death of
filming videos at home like in my flight you know i was honestly just beyond board and i had so many other
things i was doing as well you have i think you i think i saw four videos this
not many is it considering i was uploading once or twice a week yeah before but
yeah like i said i really just kind of couldn't face doing those kind of videos and
for me youtube's always been something i enjoy so much and my best videos are honestly the videos i've kind of enjoyed
making the most what's the like the you know people will look at youtubers especially especially young kids and
they think oh god i'd love to be a youtuber i think i read a report that said um one of the especially in the the
western world in the uk one of the jobs that people aspire to young kids aspire to the most gen z
is to become a youtuber yeah but i'm sure and i know because i've spoken to a lot of youtubers that
there's a lot of um adverse side effects of the job yeah definitely i think well
the first thing is people think it's obviously like people do think it's easy 100 you know you get to sit around
making silly videos in their eyes i think if you ask you know 100 people probably 80 of them
would probably say are they just going to sit around making like stupid videos they don't see a lot of the stuff kind of that goes into it
but it's definitely not easy you know there's no guarantee that you're going to do well on it you have no idea if you do
well on it how long that will last and all like you know there's all those kind of things and it's just
a lot of pressure because it's not like uh cool i know i'm gonna do these every week i'm gonna
get paid like x amount this is gonna be my job this could be my career like you're on a salary site
no you could you know you could put all your time and effort into it and maybe like money into certain things you're trying to do and
if it doesn't pay off it's definitely and the algorithm changes yeah well things are changing on
it constantly you've got to really like kind of try and keep up yeah exactly it's anxious yeah
you can have a month where you do really bad or you upload a certain video that you're really proud of and it does really bad and you're just like
oh god why is that and then you kind of fall back to your safety net of things that you know maybe will do well but you don't want to
do those anymore and it's just like a yeah it's very hard and i think it does
affect people in like many different ways some people kind of love that and they love the challenge you want to keep on going
which is amazing but yeah like i said there are people who want to do this one thing which can do incredibly well and then it
switches and it suddenly doesn't do well anymore not through any fault of their own but just because youtube have kind of
decided yeah we want to see more stuff like this and they can push all that kind of content in yeah people
can get incredibly bad like mental for me and i think people are very vocal about that now as well which is which is amazing so
it's really good but i think yeah especially obviously all youtubers are pretty much like self-employed so
if you are doing very well and then one minute it drops and that's it i remember frankie cacosa said yeah do
you know frankie yeah he's from brighton yeah frankie said to me one day i'm sure he won't mind me saying this that um obviously after all the
fame he had a fairly young age x factor he did a couple of other shows and then the money dried up yeah and he
was like well i can't go and work at [ __ ] tesco now because yeah i just like an ego still
yeah it has the money but the ego is kind of still there in a way i see that with youtubers a lot i think
i think they because they've they've been in the public spotlight and they've built fame yeah you know or notoriety in whatever
way they then feel like they they can't go and have a normal life because yeah fame your
your family is fairly famous i'd say yeah relatively yeah yeah i heard your your grandpa your
grandparent your granddad your dad were also singers yeah so my grandad i i don't know like too much about it so i know my dad
appreciated like west end when he was younger kind of like a kid but you might still be making that up there you know give
him up i have no evidence of this i used to be a football player but they did that and then yeah my
granddad as well was like a kind of like stage singer and things like that um so i think
that's probably where my brother gets it from that's for sure and i guess he's had like the most fame out of all of us
um but yeah he kind of started on he's the more you know traditional like famous like
pop star whatever you want to call it but he kind of yeah the same as me side on youtube and he's kind of like back to
that now as well has kind of gone full circle so he's kind of back on there and how was that when when he i've
got two brothers i know people ask you a lot and i've seen them ask you a million times like are you jealous of your brother or like whatever but um
how was that when he started to get a little bit more well-known um and you're a younger
brother yeah he's two years older than me so i've got two older brothers as well so i can relate okay but i can't relate to them being
famous yeah to be honest it was there like honestly was no jealousy because i think one i was so young like
i was literally sitting in school just finishing school like leaving school he was like kind of yeah relatively
famous got signed all of this so he's doing that really well great money coming in like moved to london all these things so it was just
like so cool feels like so cool to just be around all of that stuff and just
experience it all with him and it was kind of more again i said not jealousy but i like saw i just saw that
opportunity there i was like there must be something yeah i can do even if it's like working for my brother
somehow doing something god knows what it would have been but like i knew i could have
kind of figured something out and just conveniently my brother like basically broke up with
his girlfriend she moved out and he was like oh do you want to come and live in london with me
i was like yes yes obviously i wouldn't do that absolutely so i made a deal with my brother because he kind of knew he was like
i was always arming and hiring about starting youtube he was like well let's make a deal this
was the best deal kind of much ever made in my life in a way because i'll let you live in london with me rent free but you have to like you know
promise your maker and put out a youtube video once a week every week just why did he say that to
you because i think he like it just needed he needed to like incentive for me that i am like actively like working and i'm at
the same time i'm still trying to find other work in london but it's like he
wanted me to live with him like he did he did he kind of like needed me to live with him in a way
but at the same time yeah he didn't want me just living there rent-free sure living it up doing nothing
so yeah it was like a pretty good deal and very fortunately for me i couldn't
really pinpoint why but yeah my youtube like took off really really fast after about
kind of two months of doing youtube i didn't really need to find a job anymore i was making like
more than enough money to kind of carry on and luckily he was like really good friends with people
like well and then so was i at this point like casper joe sugg all of these who were you know oh geez
oh geez huge at this time so we all just kind of started filming you know every video like all together
is like a big group and then it just like yeah really like blew up from there so the golden days lucky yeah definitely
definitely the golden days that's for sure bro yeah it was everyone talks about those moments like alfie does the same and
i know josh i've met him a few times yeah it's fair to say it was so much easier then like i could sit at home and film some
weird game with my friends and get like three million views in like a week just off that one video
so it was just like wow now if i did that it wouldn't yeah i wouldn't do the same so this is when i got to the point where i was like right i wanna
do like something different from all the others i don't wanna come up the next youtube idea i kind of wanna
break ground in terms of like tv and and youtube tv
Iâm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here!
yeah your first experience on tv mainstream tv was that your celeb yeah how did you
feel you get the phone call um i didn't think it was and i honestly did not think i was gonna get on it
whatsoever but i was like let's definitely go to that meeting you know the whole thing of let's see so they can see my face and they're like
we'd love to just chat to you about something you're going to need just called me in flight a meeting and i don't know what it was that day i
remember leaving the meeting thinking either they're just like really nice and good at acting all that one like so well
um i just like kind of felt like i was on fire that day i got in there like nothing to lose i was like i'm not gonna get it but this will
be you know i was more thinking cool maybe next year then the next one then i like will get
on if i carry on and do all this kind of stuff was it an audition it wasn't an audition it was just a meeting you met like the
like the casting people i guess and i know a few of my friends had also met them i think like casper and stuff
had also met them it was like two months i just had the meeting i never told anyone for some reason like again like i said because i just
didn't think it was gonna happen and then the boys oh yeah this like meeting as well and i was like oh oh well you went there then i was like
we got told like a couple of weeks ago that uh you know it's not going to go any further but thanks for coming in and i was like oh i haven't got that called i didn't
say i think i'm pretty sure that hasn't happened unless my manager hasn't told me or something
and literally it's like the next day they called oh we really want to meet jack again
and i think i met them i can't really remember me this one was more just sort of like a
kind of how it all goes if i do do it and literally like the next day they're like cool we want jack to do it
can you do it i was like obviously obviously i can do it i was so scared though because i'm actually like
terrified of bugs so i was so excited and i was like
this is it could you you couldn't tell people for a while right no i couldn't obviously i did
but i was just like i think i was like so scared i was like how the hell has this happened but the one
thing i will say i didn't is and this is like bad obviously i did when i knew i was doing it but i never actually really
watched the show before obviously i completely knew what it was but i didn't realize how big the show was
i didn't realize at that time it was arguably the biggest show like in the country yeah between like
that like kind of strictly things like they're all like battling out for number one so yeah i just kind of
prepared myself for it all like i said i was i was feeling great going into it i was feeling like really good
how much notice did you get between knowing where you were on the show i think i actually knew for like a while i must have known for like a
couple of months i remember getting there and people like i found out literally like a couple of weeks ago really
i was i knew for like ages because i said i guess they knew they were getting youtuber on like
the end of the season before they're like oh next year we need a youtuber or something so you flew to australia yeah i'd done
all my stuff i was feeling good flew to australia and i was the first one to get there so i was there for a week like no phone
and i was an idiot because i said i was in the jungle people were telling me like oh did you not just bring another phone and like hide it and i was like
obviously i was too scared to do that so i was like oh no they didn't do that yeah everyone did all the other guests
they just had another phone with them somewhere in their suitcase so they were just like talking to a
friend i guess whatever like no i didn't know who else was there at the time but when i was in the camp
while they were in the jungle no no no they were like in the like kind of like the locked downy kind of thing
before you were shot in a hotel room for a week and you didn't have to see anyone
and you're like jet lagged as well but luckily the lady who's looking after me yeah she just i could not leave my room
without her being next to me but she was really nice like we got along so well so i was really happy with that and every morning at breakfast she's
like oh you know another one's got here and everyone's got here and she wouldn't tell me who it was but she'd give me clues and then i was like
oh it was just annoying i was like i wonder how my social media is going again because that's just what my thing
was like an everyday thing for me i posted every day i do all these things it was so weird not checking it i was like look let's make a deal i kind
of deal with you there was no deal in my heart not my mom but you know we do me a favor
just have to don't say anything you just go on my instagram and let me look at like what's been uploaded and
let me just see it's going well and i think at the time i was averaging like 40 to like 60 000 likes
so it's going like pretty well and then she's like yeah but you can't look at the comments or anything they might be saying who's in there i was like deal
and i didn't actually look but i was looking to my photos and i was getting like 250 000 likes i was like
what and that's when i realized how big the show was like that moment i was like oh my god just from being announced
yeah like it's just gone crazy and i was thinking you know maybe they're making a bit of a
like it probably is causing debate like oh this youtuber is he is celebrity is he not
and i was like welcoming that because i was like let's get more people like talking about me he gets my name out there more
so that's when i was like oh my god this is massive i need to win this i need to i need to win this what was
your strategy because i've always thought if i ever got into a reality tv show i'd be like how do i not be a prick like for me it
was just on it like to be honest at that point i had like
no anxiety no stresses i was not scared at all i wasn't even nervous like
nerves never hit me that was always one of my strengths i found so i was just yeah i was like confident
not so much coming down i'm gonna win but i'm just so confident that you know i know i can go in there and come across like
fine i know i know i won't go on there and be like a horrible person or whatever that's just not who i
am so yeah i was confident and went in there first couple of days of filming with
everyone just felt like great like so natural i guess i kind of knew what was going on a
little bit because we got partnered up straight away and i was obviously the youngest i was the youngest person on there i was
the youngest guy and then toff was the youngest girl then we got partnered it was like the people at home
voted who was together so i just kind of saw where that was like going it was like cool so they're trying to
do that kind of story so you're way there so i think to realize i think she's like
a very smart girl i didn't ever play a character it was like play the most entertaining version of yourself the
whole time i'm just like yeah kind of giving the people what they want and i knew she was doing the same
as well like she read into the situation and i remember thinking i was like oh
it's going to be it sounds really mean for the other people on there but i was like i have like a feeling maybe it's going to be
between like me and her or i think we'll both do like really well if we keep as we're going just like little things
like you realize we were just maybe saying the most like kind of jokes between everyone and like we were maybe the most like just
having the most like like fun with it a lot of people were quite stressed and stuff but we're having like a lot of fun um
and then yeah obviously it took like a massive turn i don't know what you're talking
about if you don't that's fine congratulations
yeah no one knows they're going to say what happened next um i mean i don't think i'm allowed to
get too into in terms of like what happened but it's like in terms of i won't tell anyone cause i was there
in the morning like super early i mean it must have been like 6 a.m so i'm like 5 6 a.m
and there's like a rule like two people always need to be in the camp at one point and they were calling the you know the
voices of god the person on the microphone was like calling people to go and do
something like oh you need to go down there i realized i was on my own and i was like i swear this isn't allowed
but i was like oh well maybe you know we've been in here a few days now they're like loosening up
and whatever you know we're all adults here i'm sure i'll be fine type thing and say oh jack can you come to like the
medical hut i was like okay and i had two things on my mind
first being i had like a tick the day before right and so i was like oh maybe they're just checking in on that or
this is like really depressing i was like oh here we go because they always in the show kind of pull someone to the side and they have like kind of like a
secret mission-y type thing oh yeah they do in the show there's always someone who has to do something without anyone else knowing
is this that oh maybe it's that so i was like going there like really quite excited intrigued and then i went
in there just like all the producers and stuff and i was like this doesn't look very good i was like
what i was taking out with like no explanation whatsoever i had no idea you weren't given a next i was not told
for like four hours i got taken out and the hotel was like four hours away
and pretty much until i got my phone which is the hotel which was that far away i didn't know anything they just said it
was like oh something online i was like wow that was really oh that narrows it down like my whole life's online this is something
something something i'm online i'm just thinking like absolutely like worst case scenarios of what could like possibly
happen to a young guy on tv because i was thinking all kinds of things
like it's weird like you're sitting there thinking of things i know i've never done in my life but i'm like oh god
someone never said something yeah someone said something or made something up or i don't know you're just thinking the worst
and you're panicking and then i mean it was like the weirdest you get back to your friend yeah i get
back to the hotel room finally and i get my phone and my
phone's like so crazy and then well i think like the
next day i realized they'd actually like announce me being taken out before they took me out so like my i mean yeah everyone knew why
Finding out what happened
i'd left but i didn't so i was seeing things on my phone i was like what the hell just like everyone was just like you
know i hope you're okay like i can't believe this and all that and i'm like oh my god i don't know what to do i don't want to
look at it i'm like kind of standing in my eyes closed like my phone's man [Music] i don't know what to do but two calls i
need to make here i've got a call from my brother and then like a thousand from my manager
so i call my manager and it's like my manager lawyers the ceo
and everyone there's everyone of any importance in my life is on that call and yeah
let's find out you know this is something that's been going on for like nearly a week in the papers and stuff of
like tweets and everything like this and obviously i'm in there i don't have a phone so i have no control i can't say
anything how are you feeling then i was like crying i was like oh i was like all over the
place i was i was just so frustrated that's what it was i was so frustrated and like angry why
i don't know i just felt this could have all some they were sitting on the like they
were sitting on this for a while these tweets and stuff i just know it because it was deleted
long before i went on this show like a year before i even went on the show they didn't exist anymore because they were awful it was stupid
so i kind of got rid of them when i was kind of coming up on youtube as i wanted to first see my management made me do
that like cool let's go for everything and lee anything you've said that is just idiotic and i was like we should
definitely definitely do that so i knew i'd had twitter since i was like
15 14 or something so it didn't have to get to the point where i was taken out
to then have to address it all i wish i could have before i even went on or after or or just after
kind of late yeah like stuck with it and kind of adds more drama to it yeah it just made it look it made it
look worse they said oh jack wanted to leave and address it and i do feel like i did need
to address it as soon as possible don't get me wrong but i mean yeah i didn't say yeah i should i should leave here and and
and address these things so just frustrating and yeah so i spoke to my management we kind of went over everything and like
what happens now and it's like do you want us to come australia no i just want to come home
then cause i was like although i knew i'd done like bad things how it was all handled like i had like
hatred at that point at that moment in time anyway for the people
that were involved like in the show that were like near me but i said i was so frustrated so i don't want to be here
no way i want to come home then if this if this is it and i'm this is done then i'm coming home what is the point
of me being here right yeah might as well come home so oh that was a range i was literally a
flight in like three hours or something so i just like legged it so yeah paul yeah again i hadn't like looked at my
phone i hadn't looked at anything and i opened whatsapp twitter instagram like nothing
i still don't really know the extent of what's happened and then like yeah i
called my brother he was like speechless as well but he could but again like he'd kind of been
i said it's been going on for a week so he's been on the phone type my management and stuff for like you
know days and days and days going through all of this kind of trying to help i don't know i don't know really what they were asking him or how
he could kind of help but they were like you know they don't reach out to you don't say anything don't comment on anything don't do any of these things and he was like
trying to help in whatever way he could did you worry that it might have an impact on him
yeah when i spoke to him that was kind of one of my first thoughts to be honest i felt like
i just like [ __ ] it for everyone like i said at this point i didn't really know and then we were talking about it he felt like you know this is
my time to shine and all of this it could have been like life-changing if i'd have like let's
just say i went on like one could have been yeah life-changing it was but
not in the right way and then he was like have you looked online or anything and i was like no i don't want to
i was like scared and he was like oh and i think you should like have a look i was like why he's like look just hang up
have a look online and stuff go on twitter so it did when i went online and twitter
to be honest like all i saw was like support for me because it was a thing of
everyone knew what i said was very stupid very naive me like really bad
but you know people also knew what i was gonna say people have kind of been there themselves people understood
that okay yeah he was like a kid at the time i was actually like still in school and these things that happened
it was before i had any kind of like following i didn't want you know the jack of today to be
you know known as the jack of like when i was 15 i fully understand this is like one of the conversations i had with my mum i like accept when i was
like 15 16 whatever i wasn't a very nice like kid i was pretty like bad i was like kind of a naughty kid i
guess so people like understood that you're an idiot but at the same time
we feel kind of like sorry that this has come back to like bite me on the ass you
know like seven years later or something in that moment when you go online and you see everybody
like the world you know it must feel like the world is ending to some degree yeah what are your thoughts about your future in that moment and like oh
i thought that was it i was like that that's it i was like my career is over but i also wasn't thinking oh
what am i going to do but i was just like i don't care about what i'm going to do now but
i reckon that's it but then also when i saw online and like the amount of support i mean it was like ridiculous it's like
trending number one like twitter and all of these things but it was just like huge in the amount of
celebrities that were like in my corner or whatever you want to say
it's like very overwhelming the weirdest one i saw was like katie hopkins i was like
she was like oh don't worry jack you're an angel compared to me because obviously she was on the show and like nothing
i was like that's not the person i don't know behind you there's like donald trump and katie hopkins
everyone was just very divided i think it was a to sum it up you know i apologize loads
of times on tv on my youtube channel in like newspapers and everything
what's the silver lining oh my god i like to think i probably actually won't go anything won't go through anything as bad as that
ever again like the toll it kind of took on me like my mental health and everything but
that didn't kind of come until like a year after because i think like i said although i was very upset and
everything i kind of brushed it all under the rug type thing and just put on like a happy
face ah you know what whatever kind of time to get on with it but me it was like i've definitely learned
a lot from this like i know now what is and like absolutely isn't like
acceptable and how to like deal with those things and like move forward and just how to face
horrendous situations like that and like i said hold my hand up and fully take
like the blame obviously but it was just like did you pick ptsd i think i read that
somewhere yeah so it was like um so i've gone full
gun hoe on huel and from having you know a little bit of an eye at the data it seems that i'm not the only one in
times when we know that we're going to get our lives back and we're potentially going to be having a great british summer rebound
there's a lot of people like me right now that are piling in to heal um i'm doing a few things i'm having
fuel i have at least two or three heals a day of the ready to drink berry flavor but i'm also doing meal prep and so now my diet
is fuel which is super convenient and it makes sure that i'm hitting a lot of the things in terms of like vitamins and
minerals that i'm not getting from my other food and my meals and for me that is the perfect combination
PTSD, dealing mentally with what happened
did you pick ptsd i think i read that somewhere yeah so it was like um so like i said i wasn't facing it for
ages and then like a year later or like 18 months later
yeah i just started feeling like awful like really anxious like all the time and like just
super like depressed but at the time i didn't know it was that i just felt really weird i was like what the hell
is wrong with me i didn't even like go for like dinner with my friends without like wanting to like desperately leave
and i'm feeling like so uncomfortable like like my safe place was like at my home i just wanted to be at home became like a
bit of an introvert because i didn't want to do anything it massively affected my work in terms of i just couldn't
face going to any kind of like meetings or anything doing any kind of work it would like for me to do that i'd
literally have to like i was like going through hell just to do like just to go to like a meeting or
something i had no idea what it was i was very quiet about it i never like spoke to anyone which was obviously making it worse and
then how did it feel though in terms of it was like it felt like a lack of motivation yeah it was just like i didn't want to
do anything i didn't want to have to face doing those things i basically now looking back and it had like a complete loss of confidence i
kind of felt like i wasn't good enough to do any of these things i was like a shell of like my former self
like i said before i had like nothing i was so excited to do that show i was kind of going in there to win it and everything whereas now
at that point if they asked me oh my god even if i hadn't been on it type thing before myself at the same they asked me to probably have to be like i don't
think i can do it because i don't think i've had it in me to kind of push through
and then yeah eventually my friends kind of clocked on like okay something's really wrong and i think they kind of
knew it was my brother's been through it before like really badly before me it was like him and a few others and things kind of like yeah like oh
sat me down and yeah it's kind of like opened up to everyone what did they notice
i was just like not myself like i said i was like one of them one of the main ones i
remember was on my friend josh's birthday and i had this thing of like because i knew i would always want to
like not go and leave these like events or dinners or whatever i'd go
early it's like 20 minutes early so i can kind of get there they sit at the table
and just like calm down type thing essentially i was having like an anxiety
attack pretty much like once i got there when i was on the way so i get there and i kind of get past it and then
like get on with my night type thing and hopefully feel a bit better but most of the time i'd get there and
i'd leave before and i'd just text them some weird excuse oh i've got to do this
ah this has come up sorry i've got to go home or i'd pretend like i never went oh yeah no i'm just not feeling great not going
to come so they were just like what the hell is going on like and jack the jungle yeah no like no way i was like the
life of the party in a way kind of thing i was up for doing everything and anything you could like
couldn't stop me type thing but take me back to the intervention you said your friends had like yesterday and sat you
down your brother had messaged you yeah yeah so i you know kind of explained it uh all
of them again i still kept it like pretty close friends and my manager because
she needed to understand i didn't want to have to keep lying basically i don't know i think because she's been in the industry i think she
probably knew what it was as well it's very common and that's why i realized when i spoke
to my friends because they were just like basically yeah like you know it's very like normal everyone like has it
because at the time i said i knew my brother had it before what's it just like anxiety like depression
like everything but i didn't i just didn't want to accept those things i didn't understand
i didn't i hadn't really done any research i didn't really understand when i spoke to my friends i then yeah understood what it was
and although everyone's is very different from different things and and it's caused by different things like different triggers or whatever
it's also like very much the same people deal with it in different ways of course but it is
it's like the same like feeling and overwhelming feeling and stuff so when they kind of explain that you know they've all had it and
my brother was like really good with it because i said he he'd had that anxiety like really bad he's probably still like
he still does i still do i don't you don't doesn't just disappear but you learn to to deal with it and yeah just having
that conversation it's like cliche as it sounds just talking to people about it made me feel
so much better like unexplainably better so uh and then yes and then there was
just like kind of a gap between of like nothing just kind of same old probably doing a bit more work
but at the same time still wasn't feeling great but i think it had kind of like calmed down a bit and i'd figured
out little ways to deal with it and then yeah sas
Deciding to get help
wanted me that was like what channel is that uh channel four channel four call you in there yeah yeah
i want jack to do you're up sas i hadn't done any tv since when you find out how do you feel
i was like terrified but i think i would have it anyway because like sas is a it's crazy
that is like the craziest show i mean correct me if i'm wrong but i'd probably say it's the hardest show there
is like it is the hardest show there is to do so i was just i remember thinking like why do i always get these like
really hard shows why can't i just go on like celeb juice or something like that so i'm gonna sit there for the
evening i was like okay what the hell am i going to do here because
i just know in the back of my head i'm thinking i'm saying yes all these things i'm just trying to do i'm like yes why not and
you know they explained it to me as you know they were pretty black and white about it like this want this to be
like his big tv come back and all of this and i knew that was going to be
um a massive part of my storyline i was like oh god because i know i'm going to say
yes to do this and i'm going to want to not do it i don't want to do it but you
can't turn down something like this can't turn down a show that big so obviously i've said yes and i'm going
through with it and then yeah kind of gets the point where like
my anxiety and everything and like my panic is like i mean the worse it's ever been i didn't
even want to leave my house and just yeah straight away my manager's like i think it's time to see
a therapist where was this in terms of the run-up to the show um where it got the worst it's ever been
i'd say like two months before the show started yes filmed in like november okay
it was like yeah pretty like september-ish it was like so bad so i was like yeah i think you're right
i probably i probably should i've never been to the therapist before so i was anxious about that in itself which was really weird
like speaking time i'm feeling like you wanna like feel like you're gonna want you want to
like die in this room because it's just so yeah i don't even know like what i was thinking at the time to be honest with
you but it was just horrible so yeah being therapist like three four times a
week doing all this just trying to like figure it out before on the show and then she's just like yeah it sounds
like you've got like ptsd basically and i was like what other when i hear that i just think of
like the army yeah pretty much i was like yeah i think that's like quite dramatic
i was like i don't even feel like qualified to be labels or something like that because
i'm not getting like shot at somewhere like yeah yeah how then she just yeah like explained it to
me and one of my like worst things was basically it made me feel like
physically ill like i always feel like i'd want to leave because it made me feel like i was like throw up or something like there and then i felt
like i was like holding it but it was like yeah really really bad like you can't imagine like how bad it was
and then the best thing that she did was she went this book it was called the idiot brain and it explains
how your body reacts to the feeling of like anxiety and like depression and let you know the whole fight or
flight type thing and it basically just completely broke it down as to why i feel everything i do
whilst it's happening and that like again like i said when i spoke to my friends it made me feel like oh just that one
thing yeah it was like the biggest way and that was it was the same kind of thing i was like now i understand why these things are
happening and it's not like what was the key thing you took from that book in terms of just like a basic principle it was
honestly this like the science behind it yeah it explained like the signals like your
brain sending out to like your stomach and stuff because it's like it's a you're in a sense of panic it's
like imagine you walk around you're about to get hit by a car and you had like loads of adrenaline type thing after just like that so it's
a massive sense of panic and your body wants to like get out of something get away from a
situation they use examples from like the caveman time so it's like your body is like sensing danger though there is none and
this is kind of a whole problem with it like nothing's really happening you're just scared of like nothing yeah you know
usually you do kind of get through it and you're it's like fine but past memories relating it to trauma situations right
yeah so just like yeah pretty much just like that's why it was like a ptsd thing for me because
i felt in a similar situation as when like the whole i'm a celeb thing
happened really i said at the time i didn't even know if it was that but when she kind of broke it down to me
when do you think it will start and it just made so much sense for it to be because of that like it was all around work in like certain situations that all
similar to to then because i'd kind of go to you know say an event i just
yeah you'd feel like i'm known as the kid you got kicked off mm-hmm i'm misled anywhere i'd go that that would always
you know people would always be kind of talking about it i honestly before then i probably would not have
been able to do this and like there's a high chance i'd have like cancelled last minute like last minute because i'd be like oh i can do it i can do it never
come to the time and i'll be like no way i can't even like get in the car and drive here but it was just yeah and it
would explain why yeah your body is literally feeling that way and it's just because it was like oh
it makes you feel incredibly nauseous and stuff because your body is like scared and tense in danger and things you need to escape a situation
so it like your bod like the last thing your body's worried about is like digesting something
so i always had the singles i was like i never wanted to eat when i was anxious yeah i would not be thinking about
eating i wouldn't even get hungry though yeah but i would just not eat anything like the whole day i lost like loads of weight from it as
well one of the most important quotes i i i read in the book lost connections was um
as a society we used to think that like mental health disorders like ptsd and anxiety depression were a consequence of
like something broken in you yeah but in fact everything you've described goes back ten thousand years to like
savannah and africa are lines running at me yeah i'm like i need my body to get ready for me yeah yeah and so there's there's nothing
the human body is working perfectly fine in fact the most more important question is like what's happened to you
and like cause yeah and that's and that's where that's where my perspective on mental health disorders shifted
because i didn't believe that um when i looked at the data and there's this huge rise in mental health disorders yeah
and i know that like human beings aren't evolving anymore we're not changing anymore so you think okay if there's a rise in
the the data what has changed to cause that and then you think okay well the only thing that's really fundamentally changed is the world we live in
we start looking at the world we live in and you say how how has that changed you say well you know
15 years ago the average american would say they had three people they could turn to in a time of crisis they now said they have zero
we're now living in these white walls between our loan tapping screens we're not speaking to friends and all of these factors which are
conducive with like positive mental health have now been slowly torn away i mean the lock down is a great example of like extreme and then there was a study which
i talked about in my book where if you get an animal and you put it in a cage and you take away um any uh companionship you take away
all other animals of its type and you take away the ability for it to exercise and you take away
anything that might give it stimulation and then you give it the choice of drinking heroin water or normal water
they all become drug addicts and uh if you if you reintroduce like a running wheel and another rat for it to be with
it doesn't it doesn't become a drug addict it doesn't choose the hair and water and so what you're describing is like the same as all the guests that have sat
here with me is there's there's this key moment which is caused trauma and that's um and i think that's really empowering for
people to know that yeah you know it's not it's something that's happened right and you can address it from that perspective
as opposed to just throwing drugs at it thinking that something's broken yeah but tell me about the therapy process because i've not had therapy
before but i've always i've always been intrigued by it at my company we had a therapist for all of our team members
yeah and i would definitely have therapy i think i probably should but what how was that process and did it
help um it was like it was strange it may it did make me feel a lot better like i said for me i think
this is just who i am i think some people love talking about things and just getting it off their chest and it helps them that way
for me it was just the understanding once i understood it and
then like i said i figured out ways to kind of deal with it as well i don't think it ever goes away if you just figure out ways to
to deal with it i think if i'd got an uber here i'd have probably actually been like more nervous i don't think i wouldn't cancel
but i'm not at that level but i would have still probably been a bit more like how come kind of i don't know i think so
you're not doing it for me i love being like distracted so i'd always say like like tiktok for instance is like the
perfect app for that i always found because it was like it's really quick and it's like funny and like it would always like kind of put
it was always just really funny kind of put me in a good mood it's like really quick so if i was in an uber i'd try and do something like that or watch some like
youtube videos and just keep my mind off kind of what i'm going to do and jack before wouldn't didn't have
that yet no way i'd have been honestly when my brother
would like talk about like his anxieties and like when he'd feel weird i wouldn't want to come do anything i'd like
be like what are you talking about right it was literally like just get over it
come on you'll be fine that was like the classic thing like oh come on you'll be fine like what could possibly go wrong but in his mind he's like
listing all the things that go wrong just you think of the worst case scenario pretty much so um yeah once i kind of understood it
a lot more and had my reasons
like which helped me kind of get over it a little bit i then did kind of stop seeing her this
was all very close like for sure the show i kind of stopped once the show started for instance um i haven't been
back since because i think like i will happily say that like at doing sas like saved me somehow it
gave me like a new lease of life um not like i said not
saying it's gone away by any means but i just a thing there of thinking i mean
if i can do this and this being at like six o'clock in the morning
jumping out of a helicopter backwards into literally like freezing cold water in the middle of
winter in scotland i can definitely go and do a podcast or something like that and that's kind of
like what i like lived by and i still think of it sometimes i'm like oh my god jack come on when i was like at my and at that point
i was honestly at my absolute worst like the night before as i got there i got to scotland
SAS: Who Dares Wins
and like the morning of i tried to like pull out they took again when we got there they took our phones off because we baked
that you know just can't we see everyone who's on the show so we can't text people oh guess who's in the show and then they like eat the stories
or whatever he doesn't go out until maybe i was like i kind of need like i can quit yeah i need my phone call my manager i'm
not doing it and the best thing that happened that they took my phone otherwise i would
have pulled out i guarantee it but um
they had like therapists on the show that i would like i'd spoken
quite a bit before and i was very open with them and they kind of knew i mean everyone going on they definitely
had their struggles and they had their their battles and i'm not saying mine's worse than than anyone but i was
definitely like very like vocal about mine and was said i'm not saying it's worth anyone else's
but i was like this is the worst it's ever been for me like this is the worst i've ever been so
prepare yourselves for me to be like a nightmare and yeah like i said i didn't not i like
people say like i didn't get a second to sleep then i thought i literally didn't i just sat there like seriously
like freaking freaking out and i was just like what the hell am i gonna do
and i knew he had to leave at like nine and like knocked my door like oh jack like you ready
i was not ready i was like at least i was like i felt like crying i was like so
emotional i was all over the place it was like really i'd never been like so bad it was really weird i felt like very uncontrollable
and i was like can i use your phone i think i need to speak to the like therapist guy i was on the phone tim for
about two hours i del i'd push back the whole first day of filming
so much but they were like like amazing they were honestly like so good because look realistically i
think they knew i wanted to do it i probably was gonna do it i was having a serious moment they also knew that my
mental health was in like a really bad place at the time they were amazingly understanding and kind of
patient with me and um yeah there was this kind of one one
woman there who was like he'd be the exec or like a producer maybe the exact producer but she was
like my go-to my go-to girl and she made me do it because i said i spoke
to the therapist for ages and i was still a bit like oh god he gave me that very good thing of like
you know one step at a time he's like get ready go downstairs see how you feel next step
you know you're ready when you get in the car and get to the location and see how you feel and like and it was
like that was like again there were like words of wisdom to me at that point so i was like i'm not gonna be able to do it so i'm just thinking to the end of
the show i'm like how the hell am i gonna do seven days like a month like no way yeah say he's like you know it's like one step at a
time like break it down and that helped me so much and then yeah i was just kind of with her and that is such
good advice i think for anybody that's listening that i mean pretty much in all facets of life whether you're trying to achieve
something great or you're trying to overcome fear yeah breaking it down into smaller manageable pieces
makes it absolutely yeah it was like a game changer for me like those simple yes but it just helps
you think in a different way so yeah i was just kind of talking to them talking down and i definitely i said like calm down i
was just like hey do you know what yeah obviously do it jack i didn't want to do it like these things
just the show's crazy i want to give it a go like you know that piece of me is still
in me like ah i wish i if it was more like oh i wish i still had it me to kind of do that was that right let's go
and and yeah just kind of got on with it had like very highs and lows in there
every time we finished the task i'd feel literally like on top of the world like everyone in there you know you just
accomplished something i never thought i'd be able to do especially like with how i was feeling
then when we're kind of going to a task that's when i'd have the thing of oh i'm gonna i want to pull out i want to
like leave and in the show you that's the kind of point you pull out when you've kind of reached your
your limit and for me definitely for me a bigger part although physically i mean it was just
hell like it was how i got like so hurt doing it like everywhere but for me it was definitely a way bigger mental battle and i think
probably everyone in there would say the same because you are thinking i don't need to
do this it doesn't matter if i get to the end or not it doesn't actually really make a difference to me
i really hit my limit about god it was like four days in i think it's like a seven day thing it was like the fourth day
mentally i was like drained but also i was like so physically hurt and had
like one injury that was like really annoying me but and i'm thinking yeah cool i'm gonna
get to tomorrow and see how i feel if it like still really hurts as i was at that point where i couldn't like
run it's more like a fast limp like and we got like halfway through that day
we just played a game called murderable which you can imagine it's really fun yeah which involves being like rugby
tackled by tony bellew and stuff like that so after that i was like i'm done
but the thing that like made me like a lot happy about it one i got further than i ever thought especially the days before it further than i
ever thought i'd got like i never thought in a million years when i feel like that i could be able to achieve those kind of things
and it really showed me like you know if you just commit it's gonna make me feel so much better like afterwards
if i stick through and just persevere and then at the same time i was like well i've
left after like completing something so it's kind of like a it was like a good sign off for me i didn't get something and be like ah no
thanks i'm gonna go so i kind of i was like look i'm just gonna do this one tick this off and then yeah
it's probably time to go because i can feel like when they're like die now like everything's in so much pain
and i was just like yeah i mean beyond exhausted so and you could be proud of yourself at that point honestly like i was so happy
with how far i got it was like uh you know kind of had to be there moment when you're going through all that to understand how hard it is to do
that for that long but like two people get together two people got to the end of the show
so i was like yeah i was so happy with how far i got and that really made me like feel like just so
much better and it kind of showed me like you know just physical exercise everything like that is so good for your like mental
health and so i carried on running after that and like training really hard because in the build up i was training like twice a day for like

terms of career in terms of your mental health in terms of your personal situation yeah like mental
health i feel pretty good like right now i definitely have my days like about a month ago i had like
a weird week i was like trying to help a friend who was going through it and they but they well who would just
finally start talking about it and didn't know what was going on and i was just explaining how it was with me
and it was like that was the first time i spoke about it in like quite a while so it just kind of made me it just brings it all to just yeah
brings it service it made me feel a bit like funny for a few days but like to be honest with you i think like i said a lot of my
problems were when i was going to things and trying to do something where i felt really like
uncomfortable kind of out of your comfort zone that's kind of a lockdown you just have to be at home a lot so
i do definitely feel like comfortable and i think it's been quite good for my mental health and now when i
have the days where i go out and i've got like you know a day of like work or something i've got to do loads of things i'm really happy
to kind of be out sure and stuff so it's kind of like yeah i think it's again are you nervous about coming here
you're kind of releasing i wasn't you know what i was nervous that i was gonna get nervous about coming
so when it came to i was like oh i don't want to get to the day and be like yeah i don't i i feel a bit like weird
yeah i feel like honestly completely fine like i said i'd have you've probably heard no yeah i
would have problems so i hear talking about lockdown i heard
Your relationship
you um you got a little bit of relationship over lockdown which is um yeah seems a lot of a relationship yeah
we were talking about this before we started recording yeah been with your girlfriend now eight months how's that going it's never easy it's going
incredibly well to have a lockdown relationship yeah it's definitely not like easy having a lockdown relationship
but we also don't know any anything else because we met like the beginning of
last year what because we were neighbors basically we were like our apartments doors opposite each other
and i moved in like the first week of march last year so that's kind of like how we met
and she had a dog so there was lots of dog walk dates basically excuse me was it was it difficult
dating when you were um really in your stride with youtube and
you had like i imagine you people were stopping you a lot yeah stuff like that and when you had the you know the stuff on tv
yeah i didn't really date then to be honest with you because i'd like there was like two things one i
had in my hand of like you know i'm just so like focused on what i'm doing right now and i
i didn't purposely not but i would i didn't put much effort into you know it wasn't really one of my priorities
whatsoever and i was just having you know i was enjoying i was like just living life i was having so much fun
yeah and like all of my friends were single as well so just i don't know just didn't happen whatsoever there was no need for me to do that but also my
brother got a girlfriend in his prime of like his his career and i think he'd you know be the first to say that it
i'm not saying this is for everyone at all but my experience it like kind of held him back not in terms of she held
him back but you know just having a girlfriend you have different priorities and different focuses and stuff they're focusing on
their life yeah so i just like didn't have any real intentions what's been the upside of having a partner
um because i'm a single guy so i'm like asking i want you to pitch it to me what's the yeah people think people think are you
saying like it's so much happier i feel i don't sound so like cringy but i just feel like so much
happier i look at the days of when you know being single and like wanting to like go
out and do all these things and like or like dating and stuff like i look at it now like oh my god
so much like effort in a way where it's now so like just fun and like relaxing it's very nice to feel for
everyone listening to this but that can't see him he's saying all this but he's shaking his head it's amazing definitely do it
but it's just like amazing being you know so comfortable with someone i think for me especially that was like a massive thing because
i've been so uncomfortable in so many situations with like where i was at to then meet
someone and and be in those positions where normally i would be uncomfortable sounds kind of like cringy
but having her there makes me feel like so much better without her even knowing it just being with someone and whatever
makes you feel you know so good and i've never had i've never i've actually never been in a relationship
really so this is kind of like my first relationship which i don't know if she likes or not really you know if she likes it yeah so
as in like the fact that it's my first relationship sometimes she's like you know i wish you'd maybe had a girlfriend before so
you'd know this or that and the other i think she also likes the fact that she's my first and why wouldn't someone
Why wouldn't someone want to be you
want to be you um i think the main one i'd probably say
is there's like a lot of pressure like but i'm the one putting that pressure on myself no one's putting
pressure on me but it's just a lot of like self-pressure like i'm
in control of like everything i'm i said it's a diary you're like ceo i'm like my own boss i'm in control of everything i
do i'm in control of all my finances like what comes in like what goes out it's all just
kind of on me so if i stop you know it all stops if i work my hardest then you know
hopefully it kind of pays off so it's just a lot of a lot of pressure in terms of you know
wanting to keep going and like also expand like taking like every opportunity you can get that's why
you know i went from youtube and i did radio and i was like i want to break that barrier to tv and then i started djing and
doing like music and going on tour and all these things it was like just grabbing every opportunity i can to kind of grow as much as i possibly
can but it's like exhausting it definitely takes a toll and sometimes you do need to kind of step
back but also like i said if i stop kind of everything stops so taking a step back is like
not possible yeah it's a bit of a risk that carpet was it carpentry yeah job you had when you were 16. just
sometimes you wish maybe i'm like yeah because you know my dad does fine for himself he's like three
kids and we've all turned out like fine and we've all done well for ourselves sometimes i feel like i would be so much happier at that same time i'm
like oh my god when i look back at some of the things i've done in my life i'm like that's amazing i'm like so proud of
myself for some of the things i've done in the moment it felt pretty cool but when i look back on it i'm like that was like
huge and you're still so young yeah i'm 20 just about yeah 26. taking all the pressure
Whats next?
off and i don't want to apply extra pressure here but when you look forward at your the next i don't know 20 years of your life
how in your mind do you see that kind of playing out i don't mean like i'm going to be doing this exact thing but like what are you looking for from life
um i think i'm looking like being completely honest with you it's kind of like probably looking more into like
businesses and like business and having like i said i've got my own like production company right now that's doing probably way better than i thought it
was going to be doing at this point which is good so like things like that just growing it as much as i can and
you know kind of the classic i want to be like a boss and across so many things not that
i'm not working but you know it's not like i've got a nine to five type thing so it's kind of like
like i was doing youtube because i i could kind of do whatever i wanted with my days but i knew i had to do likes kind of
things and and you know i'm still making like my money and everything like that and i think yeah you know look at i'm probably
not going to be 30 years old making like these kind of youtube videos anyway who knows
but might be a niche for that yeah yeah so it's like realistically i look at my life probably like
trying to go into into that kind of direction just building something else well i'm looking
forward to seeing what you do next i'm um i'm gonna be watching very very closely now that i
stalk you on social media so and i think like as i say you're like super young but you have such a wealth of experience
from everything you've been through and i don't think you know sometimes you don't realize how how valuable some of that experience has been until
until later in life and in fact i still think about my hardest ever moment starting a business as a young guy yeah as being my um
some of my most traumatic moments as being my most valuable because they like yeah yeah you have something that no one else has right yeah you know and you have
experiences thank you so much for coming today yourself riveting and um right
you've been so honest as well which was the whole point of this podcast at the end of the day because i also know that
you've helped a lot of people by walking us through your journey with mental health with with you know and with learning a bit more about it so
just want to say a huge thank you and um if you ever do start a podcast we'll do this again once yeah since i
can siphon it for your listeners but uh but yeah thank you so much thank you thank you
people ask me for book recommendations all the time and i finally got one for you it's a book called happy sexy
millionaire which is authored by me there's this crazy thing when you write a book because
you spend so much time pouring your heart and soul into it and everything you know and all of the revelations you've had in your life
and then there's this barrier which is that people have to buy the thing in order for them to get that thing that means so much to you i
wish that wasn't the case it's just the way the industry is and in order to get that distribution and to get it on shelves you need a publisher
so please please please if you can if you've ever liked anything i've ever produced this podcast my instagrams
anything i've ever said read this book there was no ghost writer i wrote every single word myself there's
some real surprises in there it's an honest sometimes hilarious incredibly vulnerable hopefully valuable
recount of my life my journey everything i've learned across across the way and really the answer to being fulfilled to being happy and to
achieving success it is the most important important thing i've ever created so i implore you to go

Intro
and one of the thoughts that continually gets me to the gym and continually makes me show up and work hard
is and if you're good at it if you're great at it then you might just be great at everything but for me that really is the
meaning of life
on this week's podcast we're going to do something very different something i've never done before but something that
you've requested time and time again this week i posted online asking you to ask me any question
about me my life my business whatever you want to ask me and i promised that in return i would
give very brutally honest answers my team went through all of the questions that were submitted and they went through and picked ones that they
thought were most interesting they've written them in my diary here so i'm going to start from the top and answer these questions with the
objective of giving you the most valuable honest advice that i possibly can so
without further ado i'm stephen bartlett and this is the diver ceo i hope nobody's listening
but if you are then please keep this to yourself
okay so the first question is what is the most important lesson that this pandemic has taught you
What is the most important lesson this pandemic has tough or re confirmed for you?
or reconfirmed for you and for me that is um it relates back to a podcast
i did at the start of the year and it's that uncertainty is not predictable but it's preparable and i don't actually think
that's a word but here's what i mean what i know for sure and this relates to everybody is that your life
is of course going to be full of a lot of joy and amazing things and breathtaking moments and rapturous moments of
of ecstasy right but it's also going to be riddled with moments of unexpected uncertainty and
chaos joy is much easier to handle you just kind of let go and go with it right the good times
not a lot of action or thought required but uncertainty and chaos require a real rigid set of principles and
for me those principles over the last 12 months have become acceptance optimism and action and these
three principles have a real linear connection to the outcome you're seeking without acceptance when bad things happen
there's no optimism without optimism there's no action and without action
there's often no victory or at least victory is delayed and hard times are elongated so when bad news visits
whether that's being unexpectedly fired from your job or jumped by your partner or evicted by your landlord or losing a loved one in the case of a
pandemic you have to do everything you can to stick to these principles despite the intense cloud of natural emotions that
will try to convince you and me otherwise and you know like i do a lot of sort of introspective thinking
for a living and even i am not immune from letting emotion
get the best of me in times of intense chaos i like no matter how much i've read or written in my diary or how many podcasts
i've done even i fall victim especially in the short term to all of those emotions and sometimes
to the the instructions those emotions give you which will lead you to um
to pretty dire outcomes so you know you get dumped by your partner you immediately think revenge right you get fired by your boss you think
um you know i'm gonna sue them right i fall for those traps too and i don't think i don't necessarily think it's the aim of all humans should
be to try and avoid those emotions and that thinking because i think it's quite impossible but it's to be better at the response right to
shorten the time that those emotions sit with you and to be better in your reaction and i want to clarify that acceptance when i
talk about acceptance it doesn't mean being emotionless it can often mean the exact opposite you have to accept how you're feeling except
what's happened and importantly retire from trying to change the unchangeable or from wallowing in regret and you have
to do everything you can to get yourself to a place of optimism i see that as your responsibility people won't like me saying that right
people typically especially in hard times don't like to delegate responsibility to themselves so as hard as it can be you have to find
and create hope for yourself and have faith just like everything else has in your life that this too shall pass and then you have to use
that optimism to drive you into action which is for me the third principle that i've learned over the last 12 months if your
partner's dumped you it's time to dust yourself off and get yourself into the gym to fight back and i don't mean fight
backers in bomb their house i mean fight back in a mental capacity to stop stalking
their instagram to triple down on your friendships and your meaningful relationships to stand
tall and weather the unavoidable emotional storm and have faith and acceptance sit by your side the
opposite of these principles of course is like denial is pessimism and is in action
and these are the principles of a baby gazelle that's decided to fall asleep
with its toes dipped into a crocodile-infested waters this is a decision to lose twice and when i say
l right i mean loss and when unexpected chaos happens like this pandemic which smashes our businesses and destroys our
social lives and apparently steals a year from from our youth the first l we take is involuntary
[ __ ] happened and you didn't choose it totally out of your control i get that but the fateful decision to choose
denial pessimism and inaction as our response is a voluntary second l what you're
choosing to increase the chances that bad times will become even worse times you can make the choice
not to lose twice the first l wasn't your choice the second l well that's the byproduct of of how you
choose to respond acceptance optimism and action
and i guess the second lesson i've learned this year is a lesson in the importance of prioritization you know this advice
of which people often given i've often given of protecting your time and saving your time really feels somewhat
incomplete to me now because it's like the first half of the sentence you've got to then ask yourself saving time to do what saving time just
to spend more of it doing the wrong things saving time to spend more of it being more productive just so you can get more
work done i guess better advice is to prioritize better if you told 19 year old stephen bartlett
just to save more time he probably would have said no to a couple of things and then just spent that saved time
working alone in his office all week and all weekend and that advice would therefore lead him to a less joyful more depressive
existence and if you told 19 year old stephen bartlett to prioritize better the first question
that comes to mind is what are my priorities and my long-term priorities as i think is the case for
all of us are ultimately linked to the things that make our life meaningful which are friends the joy of work our
relationships the satisfaction of pursuing our goals the challenge you know achieving greater
freedom knowledge the pursuit of knowledge health and fitness and i guess i would have reviewed the allocation of my time
through that lens i would have saved time only on the things that aren't connected to my macro priorities and reinvested it in
better places and this year because we've you know been forced to realize what matters
in many cases um i guess now i'm not trying to save time just for
the sake of spending it more on optimizing my productivity
i realize that that's an incomplete sentence and really the most important thing is just to prioritize all of my time better
and allocate it to those things that ultimately will matter the most okay so the next question in my diary is
How do i maximise my earning potential
how do i maximize my earning potential let me tell you a little bit of a story based on a friend of mine and his
company my friend has a business which is listed on the stock
exchange in germany one of the very small stock exchanges in germany and having spoken to banks and from my
own knowledge of how the stock market and the public markets work him and me both know that right now his
business is worth 1 billion dollars because of the stock exchange he's on if he moves his business
to the new york stock exchange the banks and everybody knows that the valuation will be four billion dollars it's the
exact same company the exact same team the exact same products the exact same mission
everything's exactly the same but because he's on the wrong stock market because he's on the wrong stock exchange
the value is 25 of what it would be if he just took that same business the same people in the same products the
same skills the same experiences and just moved it to a different stock market and i i reflect on this analogy
as a wider broader sort of life analogy because if i look at my career decisions over the last i'd
say 10 years i remember working in one call center in plymouth in devon where i was getting paid about four pounds per hour
and for whatever reason i decided to move to a different call center with the exact same skills
the exact same experience and i got paid 10 times while i was getting paid at that call center and this is what i've
started to notice in my own life is i've had this particular set of skills whether it's social media storytelling marketing brands whatever you want to
call it for the last i don't know maybe six seven years and as i've moved into different rooms
and different markets and different companies and different industries i've noticed that that exact same set of
skills is valued completely differently and this made me reflect with that story of my friend's
business in mind that one of the questions you have to to ask yourself sometimes in life isn't just
you know how do i improve my skills but it's like how do i maximize the earning potential for my skills and where are my skills
going to give me the greatest reward let me give you another analogy just to just to
cement the point my ex-girlfriend my ex-ex-girlfriend is a flight attendant and she currently
flies for emirates right and emirates pay they pay okay right a lot of lifestyle perks there but they
pay okay she's told me that she'll get paid up to ten times more if she manages to
get a job flying on private jets because of tips and things like that the same set of skills
ten times the return for the same set of skills if she can move her skills to a different theoretical stock exchange if
you get what i'm saying and this is just like one of the the principles i've learned about life over the really over the last year um because
skills i was paid you know x amount for a couple of years ago i'm getting paid
10 20 30 40 50 times for the same set of skills just because i found a
market where those skills are more in demand they're higher valued and they're probably more rare
and so that's something i think we can all ponder which is asking yourself where your skills will reap the greatest return okay the
Do you have imposter syndrome?
next question is do you have imposter syndrome have you ever had it and can you relate and then there's a little question underneath which is and how do i shake
this off here's the thing whenever somebody does something that's outside of their zone of comfort and
that they don't have a ton of experience in doing we all feel the same thing right we all feel that sort of
low-key inadequacy or that slight fear but the reaction that everybody feels and the way that we label that feeling
is completely different i actually think it's how you label that feeling that determines how you perform in that
scenario so some people will say okay this is an exciting challenge i'm going to learn i'm going to throw myself
at it i'm going to use that energy of that i'm feeling those nerves or whatever it might be to focus some people will say oh my god
and they'll implode and they'll try and retreat back into their zone of comfort right and so the response to that the feeling
is human the response to it is optional if you go through your life avoiding situations that give you that
feeling of imposter syndrome then i would bet everything that i have that you aren't going to reach your full
potential i genuinely believe the feeling of imposter syndrome is both healthy natural and a sign that you're putting
yourself in a position where you're there's pressure which will make you grow and i've literally i can't think of a
moment in my life if you look at any sort of two-year period in my life where i didn't feel out of my depth
however that feeling of being out of my depth never meant that i retracted from the challenge it meant the exact opposite it meant that i attacked the
challenge i put more hours in i focused on it that reaction is ultimately the reason why you can hear my voice now it's the
reason i have this podcast i very very unfondly remember the first day ever where i tried to make a video down
the lens of a camera in the microphone and oh my [ __ ] god was that [ __ ] show
my friend tells me we should make a youtube video it's about something political so i sit in his house he turns the cameras on puts a microphone on me
and i sit there and try and get just two minutes of spoken word out down this camera of the lens and i sit there for seven
hours so much so that at the start of this two minute video it's light outside and it's sunny it's like the morning by the end of this two-minute video if
you were to watch on youtube it's dark outside and you can see stars it took me that long right that long because i was sat there feeling like an
imposter people aren't gonna give a [ __ ] what i think i'm an idiot i'm not sat there sweating and ultimately it was my decision not to
let that sort of knock me back and to swerve that being in that uncomfortable situation ever again
that's taken me to this place today where i'm doing this podcast and there's all these people that listen to it we've got this youtube channel and all of
these wonderful things and that is the defining thing it's not about avoiding imposter syndrome that's a very human thing
it's learning the art of embracing it quick one starting from the minute the lockdown is lifted we're gonna start
bringing in some of our subscribers to watch how this podcast is produced behind the scenes means you get to meet the guests meet
myself and see how we put all of this together if you want that to be you all you've got to do hit the subscribe button
okay so next question is how do you do things you don't want to do i've had i've had this crosstalk in my
How do you do things you don't want to do?
mind a lot lately and i'll tell you why because i've committed myself to working out in the gym downstairs
every single day and i have been going every single day for many many months now i think the
first time i started going gym consistently was actually march last year when all of this craziness was uh thrusted upon us
but some days as i've talked about this podcast i know people get tired of me talking about the gym but it's just a place where you learn so much about
yourself and discipline and and your body and your brain and all of that so i always refer back to it but some
days i just can't be bothered i can't be bothered to go i can't be bothered to train hard when
i'm there and um in many ways that's kind of like synonymous of life there's so many things in life that i just don't
want to do and one of the thoughts that continually gets me to the gym and continually makes
me show up and work hard is this principle i live by which is comfortable
and easy are like really short-term friends but they're long-term enemies and here's what i mean by that
comfort in the short term makes me feel warm and fuzzy but then it might lead me to being obese and having arthritis and
having high blood pressure and having a heart attack in the long term so like comfort and easy i just view so anything that's comfortable and easy
like super comfortable and is you know inherently avoiding hard work or discomfort i kind of view
that that decision or that thing with skepticism i think you're trying to [ __ ] me in the long term aren't you and i genuinely cognitively have that
thought process sometimes when my brain flutters and flirts with the idea of oh just skip it steve you know
you don't really want to do that just you know get an early night and swerve that thing um i think that's going to stab me in the
back one day in 12 months time or 10 years time that decision to choose
comfortable and easy as my friends well they're going to become enemies and they're actually not on my side
if you're looking for growth my general principle is to choose the challenge i'm not
saying choose the thing that you [ __ ] hate i'm not saying choose the toxic thing that's going to destroy your mental health i'm saying if you're looking for growth
and you're looking to achieve the future that you you know you envisage in your mind your ambitions then you should choose the challenge and
and that's the thing that i continually come back to every time steve you know it hits 6 30 and i know i've got to go to go to the
gym in half an hour and i'm manically busy and everything in my head is saying make an excuse
no one will know go tomorrow just tell yourself you'll go tomorrow you'll do it another time procrastinate or when i get to the gym
and i don't really want to show up and i don't want to work hard the same little thoughts whisper in my brain but then i think maybe that's the enemy
is that has have those thoughts really got my long-term ambitions and my values in mind
they nearly always haven't and that goes back to the podcast i did with neil where he says that you know when we try
and procrastinate or we convince ourselves to do the things we don't want to do it's because of some kind of psychological discomfort because i know
that these weights are heavy and i know that it's uncomfortable and i know that i'm tired and those are if you are able to overcome
those moments where it's easier to quit those are your growth moments those are in fact the most valuable moments and this again comes to
another point which i always think which is the moments where i want to quit right the days that are the hardest to get
myself up and going are probably by definition the most valuable moments to overcome
because that's probably again thinking logically where most people decide to stop
so you know that's where the greatest returns are and i it sounds like fluffy [ __ ] in hindsight no i think
this i think i think that in the moment i think it before i go to the gym i think yeah this is this is the day when most
people wouldn't go you know after the week you've had right so hopefully that helps and
the conclusive point here is like you're connecting yourself to who you want to be in those moments you're reminding
yourself of the person you want to become and this you know i read this on twitter i think nine months ago but it stayed with me
ever since which is how would the person you want to become behave right now and if you ask yourself in those moments
how would the person i want to become behave right now what are the decisions the person i want to be
would be making um that's usually a good way to decide what the best answer is
right hope that helps okay so the next question is a very deep question it's what is the meaning
What is the meaning of life?
of life very good question something i've actually pondered a little bit over the last over the last year or so as i've i've
got more into elon musk's work and space and his motivations for wanting to
to understand meaning he actually says that when he was really really young he started pondering the meaning of life
and actually made him depressed and it wasn't until he read hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy that he found some meaning um and optimism but
to to answer that question myself i would say the meaning of life is to
create and live a meaningful life i know that sounds like a bit of a cop-out right but
in what you consider meaningful is totally subjective and nobody can tell you what that is or what it isn't
but i think you can spot it when you get that feeling inside yourself that your efforts are resulting
in progress or outcomes that feel deeply worthwhile and fulfilling to you
in any facet of your life whether it's raising your dog or whether it's your relationships or your work or whatever
it might be and some people find that sort of connection and meaning in building their businesses
in writing in hobbies or you know training their body through exercise or raising kids or practicing their
religion one of the most important things i've learned on this podcast from interviewing guests and asking them
about the toughest moments in their lives specifically guests that suffered with depression i remember we had dan murray
on the podcast who had lost his father and talked about how it wasn't until he did ayahuasca and saw
that the world was interconnected that he refound his meaning and we also had ben williams on the podcast who said he was suicidal and
considering taking his own life until he saw an advert to be a military commando and
went off on that journey to pursue his his intrinsic career ambition of becoming a commando
that he found meaning in his life and stability and also from writing my book there are some just crazy
mind-bending studies that i read about in the preparation for my book that totally changed my my thought
process on this one of them right is studying johanna hari's work and the work he's done to understand the
true causes of depression and anxiety and his work continually points to the fact that depression and these
depressive feelings and this sort of lack of orientation in life comes from people who have had something happen to
them often who have lost a sense of meaning through trauma in their life not what's wrong with them
not because of some sort of chemical imbalance in their brain the other really sort of example that i just can't shake that's in my book as
well is this study they call rat park very very simple they took a group of rats they put them
in cages and they took all meaning from their life literally just a white cage on their own and they gave them a choice do you want
to drink heroin water or do you want to drink normal water the rats that are stuck in a white cage
alone become drug addicts right then they have rat park which is this
rat utopia where there's you know female and male rats there's a little running machine where you can
exercise there's food there's a space to to roam around and to explore there's toys for stimulation and those
rats don't become drug addicts when they're offered either heroin or normal water they avoid the heroin
if you zoom out a little bit and apply the same thinking to humans the science says that over the last two
years the life expectancy had dropped between i think it's 2018 and 2019 because of opioid related deaths because
people are getting addicted to opioids and that's resulting in their death and and again that is because we have an
epidemic of meaninglessness of purposelessness um that's what my podcast has
taught me and that's what um that's what my research in my book has taught me as well commonly prescribed antidepressants do
work for some people i think it's important to to sort of caveat my points with that but adding additional meaning
and connection to your life does seem to be one of the most powerful antidotes for those feeling lost
depressed and unhappy and lacking that orientation and just to relate it to what we're going through now with this pandemic
you know a lot of my friends have been calling me and telling me that they're feeling down right they can't particularly describe
what exactly is causing them to feel down but over the last three months in particular as the uk has gone into this
i think third lockdown i've really grown concerned about some of my friends and the advice that i
continually give them centers around the point i've just made which is to find things that will give them meaning life before
pre-lockdown gave you meaning you you wake up in the morning you go to the office you've got colleagues and friends and then you
you know you go to the the club you go to what's your favorite football team player you go and see your mum and your dad your grandparents
life was full of meaning before now it's been pulled from you so now it becomes your responsibility if
you want to you know maintain those good feelings to go and get that meaning right to go and create that meaning in
your life you can't assume that it's just going to show up like it used to so we and this goes back to one of my points which is
when you really have to fight back you have to go and get it and you know i'll give you an example that relates to me personally
the weekends right so my team and me we work you know in this building through the week the weekends come around i have [ __ ]
nothing to do i'm a single guy i have nothing to do it's me and my dog right and he's not
a barrel of laughs to be honest he's very simple guy so he doesn't do an awful lot and so what
i've started to do on the weekends is to really take time to pursue some of my hobbies which i would never normally do i've
started to dj all the time i'm now learning to dj i do a dj lesson every single weekend via zoom
i'm reading books that i used to love reading philosophy books and i'm doing this actually not because i want to but
because i know i have to keep my life full of like intrinsic passions and meaning especially at a
time when so much of that has been robbed by this pandemic so that's the long way around the houses but for me that really is the meaning of life
to create a meaningful life and um as i say in these times it's more important than ever that you fight for that meaning
What do you miss about being poor that you'll never get back?
okay so the next question is a really really great question which is what is something you miss about being
poor that you think you'll never get back the stoic people used to talk about this
concept of hedonistic adaptation and the hedonistic treadmill and i'll give you an example that's really easy to
understand i remember at 23 years old when i took my first flight to thai i think it was 20 21 years old
to thailand with my business partner dom and i remember getting on that plane and just like because because i'd never really been on a plane before other than
when i was a baby coming over from africa i remember like being so in awe of the
fact that we were on this like metal ship that was flying across the ocean and they were like giving me snacks and free water and do i want to
coke and i'm sat there in the economy section just like oh my god right
totally like full of like joy and appreciation for everything and the principles of like hedonistic
adaptations say that once you've been exposed to a certain level of joy or a certain level of like i don't know gluttony or like you know
um material possessions your satisfaction starts to decay over time
and obviously as i got you know more and more money and i got on flights every week and then eventually i upgraded to business class and then like first class
and you know even got myself on a private jet a couple of times your appreciation for the small things
wanes the stoic people would take the good things out of their life as a practice just so that they would
appreciate them again and i think that's one of the things that i definitely miss i've got nice things all the time and
that is a blessing and a curse imagine some rich guy talking about he's sick of nice things but there's
there's truth to that like you you lose appreciation for for things that used to mean so much to you and when you look at
hedonistic adaptation in the hedonistic treadmill you now require even more to give you that same level of
thrill and joy and satisfaction that's a really sad thing it's kind of an unavoidable thing to some degree
but with all things in life you can really make a conscious effort to be grateful and to take moments not to let life pass
you by all these wonderful things pass you by so the other point is you know there's that phrase ignorance is bliss and it
totally applies to this question as well when i was 18 years old and i thought the meaning and
point of life was to buy fast cars and to have a million quid in the bank account and to pursue those kinds of things there
was some bliss to that i thought i had it figured out i thought i understood that the pursuit of greater
happiness was just more stuff more money and that was quite blissful i didn't have it now
at 18 i didn't have it so i thought okay that creates real meaning in my life all i have to do is get more money and
then my life will be more meaningful and you know full of joy and then upon getting the money i realize that that's
not the case and i i remember watching an interview by the founder of
spotify danielec where he says the exact same thing he's an insecure kid growing
up bit of a geek and then he gets all this money not from spotify but from the business before and he has this deep existential crisis
where he's like oh my god this wasn't it and he had to then go on the journey of
finding out exactly what mattered to him and i i'm still on that journey like i still this is why i talk so much about
meaning and purpose in this podcast because i'm still figuring out like where i should be prioritizing my time in order
to reap the greatest returns as it relates to fulfillment and i i think i didn't think about those things when i was 18 and i was broke
but getting what you aim for is the best way to find out if it's actually what you wanted
and i was this young kid chasing material things and and probably passion mistaking it for
happiness as i got closer to it it moved off into the distance like a like a mirage or something or a rainbow
we all know that guy who like you know has a two bedroom house um in a small area he's married to his
wife one kid two kids um looks forward to you know going to the pub of the weekends and supporting
his favorite team those individuals who live the most simple lives and who are happier with less
to me from my experience generally seem to be much more fulfilled than my friends that are successful
billionaires and my friends that are billionaires but also intellectuals and sort of like
low-key philosophers are the most [ __ ] right because they really have got pretty existential and ask
themselves what is the purpose of life that's what i mean by ignorance is bliss and my third point in answer to this
question relates to challenge when i was 18 years old starting out in business living in moss side in manchester
i had absolutely nothing i just dropped out of university and i'm basically stood at the bottom of this big
ambitious mountain that i've told myself i'm gonna climb and i've told myself i'm gonna accomplish
and i'm looking up at it excited terrified um but hopeful and yeah excited that's
that's the key feeling and then you climb the mountain right the mountain for me was like financial freedom it was
accomplishment maybe for my ego it was like recognition to some degree i have all of those things now
and so when you get to this point where you've accomplished many of your goals you have
to make a very conscious active effort to create new even bigger goals goals
that will match the same level of excitement and challenge that you had when you're 18 and it's not
easy because you don't become financially free twice unless you lose it all right so my goals have to be way bigger
to give me that same level of like hunger and uh grit and you know
determination that i need um to to to to stay stabilized and to be to be
happy and i guess it's a crazy thing to say but to some degree i miss like not being at the bottom i
miss not having those massive this just mount everest in front of me and this is what i've seen in you know
many of my friends who are entrepreneurs and even some of my idols is when they get to that point when when elon sold paypal or when
you know bill gates sold microsoft they then go and take on some of these tremendous you know philanthropic
challenges it's no surprise that every billionaire becomes this crazy massive philanthropist and tries to take on
some of the world's most existential problems right it's no surprise that elon is doing you know trying to save the planet and take us to a new one
because he will not be able to find a sense of fulfillment and happiness in doing another paypal he just won't
find it and in many respects this is why i think people who are tremendously ambitious have a bit of a curse i've spoken to a
lot of my friends that run businesses you are obsessive about progress and challenge and ambition and reaching the next milestone and i think
a lot of them would actually if they could just press a button and trade their life for a much simpler
life someone who doesn't wake up every single day and check their whatsapp for 30 different messages about their business on fire in
five different countries if they could press a button and live a simple life and be content in that life i think most
of them probably would many of them would if they wouldn't maybe they're twisted enough not to not to realize that the meaning of life is
to be happy so if i gave them a happiness button maybe some of the psychopaths would still opt for their current life
i've got one particular friend in mind who i won't name who sat me down about two years ago and
he's very very successful he's probably a billionaire by now and he confided in me that he wished his life
could be simpler he wished he didn't have the level of ambition he had he he told me this one story about going
around to someone's house and they're a very very normal family with not very much at all and they just sat there drinking tea and he said
i was sat there thinking i wish this was my life this is a billionaire with more sports cars than i've ever
seen in my entire life in one driveway wishing he had a simpler life but realizing that he is
infected with this virus which many of us have the ambitious the most ambitious amongst
us which stops you from being happy with out pursuit
and without climbing that mountain breaking news i have a new favorite
flavor of huel about a month and a half ago they sent me in the post
this white bottle with this sort of sharpie red pen on it that said top secret and i took it out i sipped it
probably shouldn't have because if people send you things in the post like that you probably shouldn't drink it as your first reaction you should confirm that they sent it but
i took it out i drank it and it tasted amazing and now i'm i'm
very happy to announce that my new favorite flavor of the hule ready to drink
slow release carbs 20 grams of protein vitamins minerals 27 essential vitamins 7 grams of fiber per bottle is banana
which has just gone live on cure and my friends know that i'm a massive hulu again so they've been messaging me
all this week saying steve how good is it is it good and i've been telling them this is my new favorite flavor which i think says a lot so barry is now number two
and the new banana flavor ready to drink huel is my number one so yeah give it a taste
it kind of tastes like banana milkshake but um banana milkshake isn't usually as nutritionally complete so that's win
win win try it fiverr fiverr.com i've talked about this a lot in this podcast and um i just wanted to give you
a bit of an update i've really really got into using fiverr over the last couple of weeks and i think
if i was to estimate i've now had six different tasks completed on fiverr in the last
four weeks i've had two website builds i've had two decks made from designers that are
What is the most valuable skill you've learnt and how does that serve you now?
all around the world one is in venezuela the other one is in iceland i've had one logo made and one
video made and to be honest i just wish i knew about fiverr sooner in my career because i think i would have been able to
accomplish more in a much more cost-effective way okay the next question i have here is what is
the most valuable skill you've learned and how does that serve you now um my mind bounced around to a few different things when i read that
question but it came back to this this this one answer which kind of summarizes all the other little points which is
sales and i genuinely believe sales however you kind of want to define that
is the single most important skill in the world i don't mean like selling rolexes out your coat or selling double glazing to a grandmother
on the phone i mean the art of being able to persuade other people to take an action right and this is a skill that you will deploy in
a nightclub when you meet someone you fancy with your teams when you're trying to build businesses with investors
every time you communicate in some respect if you're trying to achieve a certain outcome you are a salesman or
woman and the art of being a good salesperson is broken down into a bunch of different factors there's an understanding of you know having the
self-awareness to understand how you're coming across having the awareness to understand what the person
you're speaking to is after it's how you carry yourself it's your body language it's the way you speak
it's the energy you bring when you're talking it's all of these small things which are very hard to to train into somebody but
for without shadow of a doubt sales is the most important thing because it's the skill that i use every day the
most right and i want to answer the question like how did i learn how to sell things i've raised investment maybe 20 times maybe
more probably more if you consider some of the road shows i did when we took our company public one of the most important experiences i
had in my whole life was i started working in a call center in plymouth when i was 16 years old selling double glazing at
everest call center and then i did that job until i was about 18 and then moved to manchester dropped out of university and then my
next 10 to 12 jobs were all in call centers whether it's because of my voice
or because um because of my skills with selling i was just so good at that job and i genuinely believe that that tele
sales experience i've had and i genuinely would work in a telesales call center for three months make so much on the
bonuses that i'd quit this is why i've had 12 teddy sales jobs i'd quit i'd spend the next two months trying to build my
business i'd then go back to another call center make huge bonuses then i'd quit and i'd keep doing that
but i genuinely believe that that experience working in call centers where you're honing this particular
skill which is calling someone usually completely cold out of the blue and having to persuade them in less than a
minute to give you a chance or to buy immediately but to give you a chance to sell them something that they didn't need
we all [ __ ] hate tele sales people including me i just hang up immediately these days because i'm so time poor but if you got a chance to do one job in
order to improve your sales skills i would highly highly recommend you do either that or even better which i did again when i
was in plymouth door-to-door sales because that introduces sort of body language and other sort of more
physical communication skills which uh which are even more relevant to the world we live in today so
yeah sales is definitely the most important thing and i often say to people when they're when they tell me that they've got an
offer to take one of two jobs i'll often always prefer the sales role
especially if they're young and they need to develop in that area because i think it will yield the greatest returns over the long
term i think getting good at selling stuff when you're young will yield tremendous returns as a skill as you get older and
as i said at the start sales applies to everything everything
and if you're good at it if you're great at it then you might just be great at everything
or at least be able to convince people you are okay so the next question is what is my greatest weakness and when i
What is your greatest weakness?
first read this question um a bunch of different things came to mind in different sort of parts and areas of my life so
i'm just gonna share as many of them with you as i possibly can the first thing that comes to mind is i'm really bad at prioritizing
against the things that really matter to me and i know that will matter long term i've talked about this a lot in this
podcast i don't call my parents enough i don't see my family enough i probably don't give enough time in
person to like meaningful friendships and connections and those kinds of things and i know i'm completely totally convinced that those
things are really really important it's not that i don't understand the importance of them it's that like my work priorities always seem to be
just one you know one step higher on the to-do list my work has urgency to it there's no
urgency with calling my mom right and that's kind of one of the things i know is a weakness in myself that i that i continue to strive to
to be better at is trying to prioritize things that aren't urgent
but in the long term are really really important the next thing is in relationships i'm like really
self-centered i i just want to do what i want to do and i like i am generally like really unwilling to
compromise and that's an awful thing because relationships are all about compromise apparently so i've been told many times
um but i know it's a weakness of mine i am kind of like i kind of live the world in my own head and if i want to just get up
and go and dj or walk down the street or go in my room and just look at my laptop and watch youtube videos doing that is
quite hard when you're in a relationship and you've got someone else to consider you have to consider what they want and you know the things that they want to do
that day and and also in relationships generally i don't want to do much because nine to five like
throughout the week my brain is [ __ ] chaos so on the weekend i'm not really all up for doing much you know that's my down time
and that's become a real weakness of mine and it's made forming romantic relationships harder because on the weekend i don't want to get out of
bed and if i do i just want to do some i just want to do nothing or something very very simple but the
problem i have there is through monday to friday i've spent all my time on my work so saturday and sunday by definition like
logically have to be the time that i commit to you as my partner so this is why i i continually struggle in
relationships because monday to friday it's not about you and on the weekend it's about me it's
about me and my down time watching manchester united play and i have to i have to learn to compromise i'm sure a lot of people can
relate to that the last thing would be because i'm so mentally bombarded with a billion things
i have to do at all times over the years the one thing that i've definitely noticed in myself is i get
more and more arguably rude
and to the point which is like when at the start of my career i was very i had more time and there were less things like less tabs open in my brain
so i could take more time about how i respond to things and i could be a little bit more fluffy and soft and whatever but when
you have tons of urgent priorities your brain is so funny i was i was talking to a friend
about this this morning in fact and i was just giving some feedback to one of the teams i'm working with
at another company because the ceo had basically got in touch and requested that all comms become much
more streamlined because when we when the team were using extra words he basically to some degree gets you
know gets a little bit frustrated with that because we're trying to move fast as an organization and i totally related to that i noticed
myself getting annoyed when anything takes longer than it should and this is something that's really changed like totally changed in the last couple
of years so i guess the thing that i have to be aware of is that even in the situations where i'm just desperately trying to save time
is that i don't compromise on being a decent human being and i can't explain to you how hard this
is because we tend to have a philosophy for how we act and how we behave and that philosophy sits deep within us and
it whether it's a landlord showing me around a new apartment or a new office or whether it's an email or whether it's a phone call
the philosophy tends to be the same right and you it's hard to switch between different philosophies so i tend to treat very personal things
sometimes in my personal life whether it's a landlord showing me around an office with the same rapid urgency
or my mum having a conversation with me with the same rapid urgency that i might treat business things and i need to get
better at like switching between the context and behaving differently in each scenario and realizing that in some scenarios
the saving of the time is not more beneficial than just remaining a decent person and like engaging in the situation
it's hard and i say it's hard not just because of my own experiences but i've seen pretty much pretty much
i'd say over 70 of the highly successful people i know become so incredibly impatient that it
almost verges on looking like rudeness like they don't care about you um and like they are
not present when you're with them now this is a really hard point to explain but i think people who are incredibly busy will understand this
over the last couple of years i've noticed that i've got incredibly impatient with um any request i get and it's something
i've noticed not just in myself but in some of my friends who run very very big really really sort of ambitious global
businesses who are constantly bombarded with stuff they are some of the most like anti-social slightly rude people i've
met you just can't get 10 seconds of their attention and like just to give you context of what's going on in my head now
right now as i'm making this podcast i know that i'm missing this phone call with this pr firm i know that i've got this major ipo
coming up with this one company i know i've got this board meeting coming up with this company i know i've got this ipo coming up got this other
conversation about joining this board and this other ip coming up and i've got all these other personal things going on in my life and this you know i've got to record this podcast my
brain has just got all these tabs open so when my pa walks up to me and she goes hi steve how's your day going
you know shall i buy pablo some dog food it just it's just it's almost the only way i can describe it is the question is like an
irritant um and what you what i've got what learnt over the years is like
i have to understand that people don't understand and i have to try and respond on that
basis which sometimes especially when i'm like really tired can be a challenge um something i've
really tried hard to work on but i'm still like really not that great at is remembering to be like gracious and just
a decent person irrespective of what's going on in my head and treating people and being super polite and trying to be my best self
every single day in every interaction you know i i talked on this podcast once upon a time about the day i got on
a plane i sat in business class and i look up and it's that guy from man versus food and we were running at the time one of
the biggest food publishers in the world love food and so i messaged the love food team there was about 150 people that got this
message in the social chain chat at the time they said oh my god that guy from um man vs food is on the plane
and they all said okay go up to him and ask him this like famous social chain question we have which is what's your favorite sandwich long story short when you join social
channel you get asked the question what's your favorite sandwich so i jump up and i walk over to his seat in business class and i say
hey uh um i got quite boom shuts me down not right now like shouts in my face so i like slowly
tiptoe back to my seat in business class i'm like slouched down and then i have to message 150 people
saying oh by the way that guy we all really like is an [ __ ] um and he would have had no idea that he
was speaking to somebody who ran at the time the biggest food publisher in the world and had
hundreds of employees and at some you know some point in the future might have wanted to do some business with him or work with him but now thinks he's a
total [ __ ] and this for me that moment i'll always remember of as teaching me how important every
interaction is even the ones that don't seem that important um and i try and bear that in mind if
you've ever come and watched me speak anywhere in the world which i'm sure a lot of you have because i was a bit of a speaking hoe over the last couple of
years then you would have known that i never ever would leave a venue before everybody's got a chance to like
take a photo or meet me or ask me a question i would be the last one to leave my own talks um because i that's the way that i would
want someone to treat me someone that i followed and admired that's how i would want them to treat me and i'm scared of being an [ __ ]
um yeah and it's much easier to be an [ __ ] when you're
when you've achieved some level of success right powerful people find it the easiest to be an [ __ ]
they can therefore also probably do the most damage by being an [ __ ] but also get away with it a lot of the time
i believe in being a good person as much as i possibly can be and i'm like clearly imperfect in many many ways and i still
struggle with this but i'm doing my very best to be a good person um and to be kind and to you know
to never forget who i am and where i come from okay so the next question is i'm scared to post my business
I'm scared to post my business or myself online at risk of humiliation or failure
online at the risk of failure or humiliation do you have any advice this is a very
interesting thing that i don't think people talk about enough especially when they're starting out in business which is how do you overcome
the sort of public transition from just being steve to now being this entrepreneur who's running this business and raising money
and giving people advice and has has a podcast how do you like square that with especially in your friendships and your
personal circles with the person that they they knew first right and when we
started the business when we started social chain my business partner dom who's come on this podcast to talk about it was ridiculed by his friends privately
like you know those kind of jokes that people do where it's like a joke but it's also not a joke so he would post on his facebook page
saying we've just started social chain just about this business it's going really well or whatever he'd say and like five or ten of his best friends
in the world from his hometown would jump on there with these kind of snide jokey like patronizing
bantery comments uh but they were like inherently mean comments and i remember back in the day
continually jumping into his comment section and trying to defend him and i'd get some of my other friends to jump in there and just be a bit nicer
he was posting his achievements and being like ridiculed with like not funny kind of funny banter and for
me as i reflect on what that actually was and the psychology behind his friends and knowing his friendship group back
home i'll be completely honest i think his friends saw him changing and somewhat didn't like who he was
becoming because his success kind of alienated them and nobody this is just a principle of
psychology that i've actually written a little bit about in my book people are most envious of people
who they can relate to so if you're you know colleague at work or your friend or someone your age is achieving
huge amounts of success and they look like you and went to the same school and came from where you come from that
inadvertently shines a mirror on you it means you've got no excuse and that your you know
success or lack thereof is probably a consequence of your own actions and as humans we just don't like that thought
and so dom's my business partner dom's social circle back home many of them not all of them there was one or two key
exceptions we're trying to rein him in and saying you know you're one of us stay here don't become something that we
can't resonate with and if you find yourself in the scenario that dom did you basically have a really
simple choice to make it feels complicated and it feels like a bit of a minefield but it's not
the central question and the most important question you have to ask yourself is who do i want to be and what makes me
happy whether and this is a point you can extrapolate to any sort of area of your life even those outside of your career
who do i want to be and what makes me happy and decide what that is and pursue that thing anybody that you
lose in the pursuit of your happiness is probably not someone you needed or wanted in your life anyway they're
probably not someone that had your best interests which by definition are you being happy at heart
they're probably someone who was riddled with a little bit of jealousy who didn't want you to become everything you could become so that's the framework
in which you make your decision which is who do i want to be and what makes me happy pursue that and be open to losing people
who no longer resonate with you pursuing your happiness along the way and i distinctly remember
going through this myself which is facing ridicule and banter and little snide comments behind the scenes i remember a
day where i posted something on facebook like one of my quotes whatever it was or some of my content on my daily vlog and
a friend of a friend had made some snide little comment about like who the [ __ ] does steve think he is the friend had told me and it's those
moments where you can make that decision to like fall back in light line and conform and to avoid criticism
had i can you imagine my life if i'd done that if i'd let a couple of comments stop me from pursuing my my career and
producing all this content which gives me so much intrinsic joy and fulfillment can you imagine if i let the fear of a
few comments hold me back from my potential and the things that make me happy i'm so glad i didn't and in that
particular case where that guy was ridiculing me behind my back that same person four years
later um when he went through some troubles in his life and some mental health issues reached out to me
because he was in love with my podcast now and uh met me in a sushi bar in london and
just sat there and asked me advice because of something i'd said on the podcast that he initially ridiculed
and that kind of shows that that teaches me a lesson that you know even some of the people that ridicule you at the start you've kind of got to forgive whatever
it is in their nature that's making them try and hold you back but you've also got to understand that
it's not a you problem it's not your responsibility to control what people think of you in their head or the image that they've created of you in
their mind that's not your responsibility your central responsibility as a human being is to pursue
your happiness your truth and the things that give you the most intrinsic joy that's your responsibility and one of
the things i've come to learn about success generally in life is that it's the small seemingly invisible seemingly
insignificant decisions piling up over time that have the greatest impact on you it's not our big life choices it's the
small ones the ones that are easiest to do or not to do and it's the same with bending under
public pressure or criticism it's easy if you see a friend of a friend slagging you off just to stop doing that thing
if you allow these small seemingly insignificant comments just nudge you just one day at a time away
from the person you want to be and the person you want to become can you imagine how far you're going to be from that person in 10 years time
it doesn't bear to think about people ask me for book recommendations all the time
and i finally got one for you it's a book called happy sexy millionaire which is authored by me
there's this crazy thing when you write a book because you spend so much time pouring your heart and soul into it and
everything you know and all of the revelations you've had in your life and then there's this barrier which is
that people have to buy the thing in order for them to get that thing that means so much to you i wish that wasn't the case
it's just the way the industry is and in order to get that distribution and to get it on shelves you need a publisher so
please please please if you can if you've ever liked anything i've ever produced this podcast my instagrams anything i've ever said
read this book there was no ghostwriter i wrote every single word myself there's some real surprises in there it's an
honest sometimes hilarious incredibly vulnerable hopefully valuable recount of my life my
journey everything i've learned across across the way and really the answer to being fulfilled to being happy and to
achieving success it is the most important important thing i've ever created so i implore you to go
to amazon now or wherever you get your books and get that pre-order if you get that pre-order i'm going to put you into a
group with everybody that's pre-ordered it and i'm going to send you some exclusive stuff so the first things i'm going to do is a series of voice notes which i

Transcription:

Intro
one of the reasons i step back from social media was because i if something can manifest so physically that you're having a [ __ ]
seizure then you probably need to take this more seriously and that was you know like that was that was tough
and that for me is my happiness
grace beverly ceo founder of two multi-million dollar companies one's a fashion empire that's focused on
sustainability and one's a fitness empire comprising a mobile app a supplements business and gym equipment
she did all of that while studying and graduating from oxford university while growing her online channels to millions and millions
of followers while writing a book and while dealing with all of the things that every other gen z person has to deal with at the age
of 23 23 and on the surface it's easy to understand while looking in someone might love to have
grace's life but as you start to peel back the layers as we do in this conversation you begin to understand her obsessive attention to detail the
weight of her workload and the personal cost of her accomplishments and you see the impact that those things have had on
all parts of her life and it makes you reconsider despite all of this
she's persisted she stayed true to her values she's doubled down on the things she loves the most and she's cut out some of the things
that no longer serve her she's learned she's learned lessons that most of us would take a lifetime to learn
and she's 23. it blows my mind without further ado i'm stephen bartlett
and this is the driver ceo i hope nobody's listening but if you are then please keep this yourself
grace i started my business at 18 years old as well you um you faced a different set of
challenges not only have you started your business at an incredibly young age or at least you got into business at an incredibly young age you face a set of
challenges that are even alien to me in the sense that you are a woman in business um you are taking on various industries
that don't want to be taken on and that really are sort of incumbent monopolies in the space of fast fashion and fitness and those
things i guess my first question is why did you choose business and what gave you the
How did you have the confidence to pursue such an uncertain career
what gave you the confidence to pursue a career that's filled with so much uncertainty at such a
young age i think i think people often assume that the first part of it always
has to be a kind of i'm going to start this i'm going to do this and i think that mine absolutely wasn't that at all and i
think that that's what often makes me kind of question you know the amount of things that have had to fall into place for this to
happen and of course you know there's hard work in that but there's also so many other things that have had to go right um so for me you know as i kind of said
when i was 18 and working doing an internship at ibm that's kind of when i started and
i just started doing some i essentially started monetizing something that should be monetized so it's content i was giving away
for free and then i was going to do lots more of that and so i decided to monetize it via an ebook um and then you know the
next year i did more of that and then that's you know then it started picking up momentum i started doing different products and i think that
that's i guess often not seen in the way that business is represented it's kind of seen as like a
eureka moment then you go and do it then you put it into action then you fail once or twice and then you get it
and that it was far more gradual than that and i think that probably over the past you know so it's
probably been so it's been five years since that moment i'd say four years since the business it's ready that it is
now has um i guess was founded um and in that time probably the first two
years were incredibly gradual very much a kind of residual extra
income um rather than kind of this big like these are my goals
this is gonna happen within this time um so i guess in that it's been a
gradual process i think the confidence has gathered through that and a lot of the time i
haven't been confident enough to do that but have i guess just done it anyway so
you know when i was when i did kind of my second set of ebooks which was in my first year at university
that was literally because my student loan didn't come through like that was that was the only reason so as in i don't think it was necessarily a
confidence thing i think it was more okay like what are we gonna do in that situation um and then putting that together and
then being able to you know leverage a platform to be able to monetize that so and then from then
onwards obviously it's been very mindful it's been very kind of strategic
and that's how it's happened but i guess i guess the answer is that the confidence hasn't always been there and it hasn't always been a kind of i'm
going to take on this industry sure starting tala that that was um but but the rest of it
a lot of it has been gradual a lot of it has been this kind of more just a cumulative
making one decision at a time um which is i guess what i kind of try and
show as well so that people can know that it doesn't always need to be this one big decision and this one big business that's going
to be the biggest business in the world it can just be you know something you're just doing in that moment
the world has changed recently over the last 12 months because of the pandemic a lot of people have lost their jobs and so freelance websites and entrepreneurship
has now become more in focus as people are trying to find ways to give themselves a little bit more stability in their income
and when i speak to my friends that are you know your age 23 years old right 24 next week a week after sorry um or
who are younger 18 19 or even older um everybody seems to have a business idea yeah and i'm sure you're
bombarded with dms like this right everyone has a business idea um there seems to be this
barrier between the idea and taking the first step like making uh the
instagram page and is the the barrier between that is it confidence in your view what is it i think
it's probably specific to the situation the person the circumstance so
you know i was when i was at university if you know i think that there was
something that came together to make me do that but i was also at university in a place and in a time that i could
take i guess a a risky decision in terms of how i spend my time in terms of what i'm putting together i wasn't
i guess i wasn't doing a part-time job at the time that i could have put into that and so you know part of it is
circumstance in the way that people a lot of people don't necessarily have the
the backing to put behind it or it might be the the time they can put into it you know lots of people are
working three jobs just to make ends meet and therefore you know you might have an idea but actually being able to sacrifice the
time spent doing that isn't an option and i think but then i think a lot of the time as well i think it can be
confidence out of that circumstance it can be um or outside of that circumstance it can be you know
should i be doing this why should i be doing this and i think that a lot of the ideas that i've had you
know i'm sure you'll have the same like there'll be ideas that you have kind of the whole time and it's choosing the right ones and it's
choosing and it's being able to test it i think i'm sure if i tested out my first i guess what has turned into shreddy now
if i tested that out um you know even more gradually or if it hadn't worked or whatever
i don't know how tenacious i would have been in terms of actually making that happen and as i say it's been like an accumulation of that confidence and
actually testing things realizing their work and then replicating that so i think
i mean i think we can't necessarily blanket apply it to everyone and be like it's because of this it's because of this but i think that you know probably
the biggest the biggest factors will be circumstance confidence um and yeah i guess there are so many
things that can stop you but there are also so many things that can enable you to say okay well this is this is this i'm gonna i'm
gonna make it happen or i'm gonna take that leap or i'm gonna at least do the background work we'll do a survey to see if my product would be liked or
whatever it might be i think as well if people looking at you or myself that have achieved things in
business will see this very polished product right and they'll think well i'm so far from that so i'm i'm so far from being
capable of what that person has achieved but as you've described that which i think is so powerful and important for you it was
taking one step up a very very thousand stair staircase at a time and and as you say when we look at you
now on step 934 we think oh my god like you know you must you probably get this comment a lot right she's like you must be so proud of
yourself yeah which is like well it's been one step at a time so yeah you know and i think you can be proud of the steps along the way
but i also think that i look back at some not necessarily some products but you know some branding some
content some all of that and i look at it and i'm like it was crap like that is awful like as in i would
just scroll right past that or i wouldn't you know and of course things have changed people's like tastes have changed and
all of that that kind of goes into branding and product and all of that but there was something you know i've sold everything from
you know like t-shirts to notebooks to like whatever it would be it's not what the everything that's
accumulated now is the good things that have then been replicated it's not everything gets kind of replicated and
then you know you see all of the end products there have been some things that never ended up as an end product
because they were so [ __ ] in the first place that they were never you know they didn't deserve that extra time on them so i think you're completely right there
is this kind of and i i think it's also perpetuated by you know unknowingly often by people
like ourselves so you know like i i think i look at the stuff i share and i look at it and my god i'm so much more likely to share if
it's this or you know if this product worked out well and and subconsciously because there was an
end of that journey we don't necessarily say like oh this was the thing that actually went really wrong because you know it's embarrassing like
you don't want to share that you don't or you don't kind of think too because you don't think of the kind of like pride in the journey that's got to that
point um and so it i guess it all does you know you will just see the the good
things or you might see the bad things that are positioned in an inspirational way but it's still curated
but it's still what i guess is want to be seen and to
to my other point about being uh a woman in business that comes with a whole unique set of challenges you know i've heard you talk
about being underestimated not taken seriously before speak to me about some of those challenges that i wouldn't even
you know know about so i think first i always also think it is important to
preface this with the fact that yes i'm a woman in business i'm also white able-bodied i was privately educated i went dogs but
a kind of huge list of things that need to be
i guess contextualized which i've always thought is important and i think that i think that
it's you know i won't face half the challenges that a black woman would face in the same
position i think the challenges i do face are you know they are
kind of often and they have to be they have to be worked um through i guess and and that's been you
know a journey there have been you know people who have wanted to work for the businesses
who clearly won't accept the fact that you know this i'm not the face of it like i am
acting ceo and you know i do do x y and z and there have also been you know it's
been the same with partnerships it's been the same with you know i think people people have a certain perception that's definitely
warped and increased and perpetuated by online presence and the fact that i don't just
share my work and um and i think that you know it does come down to it does
come down to these preconceptions and i know as well since i've started realizing this i have preconceptions as well you know we'll
say like it's about a woman who's high up who you hear about and you're like oh god
they're doing really well like why don't i have that and i think you know i often think like oh well you know apparently they're really hard to
work with or like they're like whatever and we all have these own kind of like our own like internalized
sexist whatever it might be preconceptions in terms of these things as well and
i think that it often comes for women who are successful you look at them you either think you probably think one of two things you
either think or maybe one of three things you think wow amazing must be superwoman or you think wow
amazing but like oh i've never seen a partner or like children like do you think they're happy in their
personal lives or you think wow but they're kind of like either they
haven't actually done it they've just been put at the front of it or they're like a [ __ ] or really you
know really [ __ ] or like a tyrant or whatever it is and like that is and i think that when i look at that i'm
like actually that's probably the way i see some people you know that's probably the way that is in some ways for you know for
for me and my conceptions and i think that it's it's just it's it's what it's it's what it's become and it's actually
obviously got better in some ways you know it's got hugely better since probably like the 1950s and whatever
but there's still a long way to go in that respect when i knew that we were going to be having this conversation i i looked into
How does it feel being discredited for what you've done?
the general sentiment around your brand and you've got a huge hugely engaged wonderful community of
people um you've got this you know this true like i'd call it a fan base or supporters that understand you and they
get you probably because they followed you for a long time and they followed your vlogs and they like know who you are right and then
as is the case with pretty much every um successful person i've seen there's
also the antithesis of that there's the opposite there's people who as you said we will try and highlight reasons why
you maybe don't deserve to be where you are you don't deserve credit this is something that pretty most of the guests i face um i've sat
with have faced to some degree it's it's not easy to take right because
um i know right i come from a slightly different background but i know that irrespective of background
you have to work hard really really [ __ ] hard be honest with me
how does that feel i think that i think it's an important discussion to have first and foremost i
think that and i think i'll be the first to say that and i think a lot of you know i spend a lot of time in the book for example
contextualizing success because i think it's very important especially when you know
you're presented three people on your instagram feed with in the same square and one of them you
make from school one of them's you like your mum and one of them's beyonce and it's kind of like this
democratization of the news feed that makes everything look the same and you don't see the teams you don't see the privilege
you don't see all of the above and i think that it's a very important conversation to have so to be perfectly honest i'd be rather
people have that conversation and maybe write off my success based on that
i think that i think also aside from that i do think that you know a lot of the people who the people who do follow me and have
followed me for a long time know my work ethic and they know that i work hard and they know that you know often that's been an unhealthy amount you know
i use work as a coping mechanism so it's been through the worst times of my life that's what i know i can do
and that's what i throw myself into and i think that i'd rather that conversation be had and
me be able to know in myself why i've been successful and how i've worked and i think that i think that that's
you know i guess first and foremost that's important and that's how i'm able to i guess push through and be able to do
what i do is because i know why it is i also know that there have been things that have helped me
and then you know i guess that doesn't matter i guess the important thing is that we're able to
have the conversations and able to like i'm able to know as well in myself i know that's a very mature
position to take i've got to be honest it's a very mature position to take but i i'm skeptical as to whether it's always
been as easy to take as that and you've you know so talk to me about the process yeah i mean i think that any justified
criticism or you know might be justified it might be unjustified criticism is hard to take
i don't i think you can have a mature standpoint towards something and equally you're still going to feel
like a punch in the stomach of course and that's and that's fine and i think that one of the things that i wouldn't wish
you know when i think for my children that i wouldn't necessarily want them to be in is i wouldn't want them to be
in a higher profile position when they're younger um and because i you know i talk about i have this whole chapter in
the book which is essentially a i guess probably like the most honest i've been in a long time because
it's you know as i've said it's a there's no instant feedback loop there's i can write this and not hear about back from it for you know like a
year and it's me talking about how actually essentially i feel like a lot of i became known at a time where
my self-confidence was at its worst and therefore i was able to i guess rather than feeling that lack of
confidence with confidence and self-worth i filled it with validation and therefore when i decided to take a step
back from social media because i decided that wasn't what i wanted to do kind of first and foremost as my job
that kind of bandage was ripped off because it didn't exist and that's when i realized that you know
these things are the things that we need to be able to deal with and we need to be able to i guess cobble together to be able to
you know no matter whether this person thinks x y and z about yourself how much does that matter if it does
matter and if you do think it's wrong are you going to do something about it and can you still get on with
your day essentially and i think that there are people who are amazing who i see on social media
who i wouldn't give a single criticism to that i can think of that i'm sure get the exact
same thing and there are people who have been to hell and back and get the exact same thing and there are people who actually have
done you know have lucked out and get the exact same thing and in the grand scheme of things i don't think it
necessarily matters i think what matters is that you know in yourself and you also know that if there's
something you need to change then you can change that like if you want to if i guess sometimes when
something like other things you know like hit a nerve or whatever like do you need to change that do you need to address that do you need to do better um so i
think that that's that's kind of how i tackle it but of course no there's not like a something in me where i you know get a
message that says you look ugly and i'm like thank you
that's not an initial reaction but i think that you have to be you have to be rational when we're not
designed to be taking this much feedback and criticism or even if it's not criticism if someone
like i say the whole time oh i don't like that color i don't like like clothing or like
whatever it might be to the designer that might like rip them to shreds or whatever it's not mean
it's an opinion and we're not designed to be able to take that in so i think that there has to be a sort of rationalization on a human
part or on your like if you are in that position you have a duty to yourself to learn how to deal with that or to remove
yourself from the situation otherwise it's just untenable i guess um you've got you know two businesses
Sacrifice of business
two key businesses and um when you run a business when you're young irrespective of age you undergo a couple of things real like
unexpected chaos at any given moment then also a tremendous amount of sacrifice i actually want to start on the sacrifice piece because i don't think
people as you said earlier get to fully see the full picture of sacrifice and cost um both personal
and professional whatever so talk to me about some of the sacrifice that even you didn't expect
before you got into business and before your business grew um i think that at the same time as i
kind of benefited hugely from the you know having money at university
for example i also went to university expecting one thing and then actually spent it essentially
getting up at x hour working on university stuff because i never ever ever wanted to give them an excuse to
think that i wasn't concentrating fully on my university and then working all the way essentially
way into the night to get the other stuff done and i also you know that comes with being high profile that comes with all
of these things so i guess one of those things was very much like there was the time and the life experience and all of that
that because things took off quickly at one stage even if it wasn't like
it wasn't that the businesses took off you know the businesses have done much more over the past year and a half or whatever when i haven't been at uni
but at that point you know the the high profileness all of that that came with i guess
different to what i was expecting um and um or not what i was expecting i wasn't expecting it at all and therefore there
was kind of i guess you know something that i really did want for myself i didn't get but i also
got um you know a lot more in another way for yourself well i just wanted the
university experience really and i think that i was so once this took off i'm a very determined person and i
i get i get a vision and i'll work for it day and night and i think that i
actually got to i think in that instance you it's kind of like a fork in the road and
you decide okay well i'm taking this one and i'm going to concentrate on this i'm going to grow the businesses and all of
that and then i think as well i saw the deadline for that as my end of university because if i had to
if it wasn't as big as i wanted it to be by that time or if it wasn't you know whatever it might be i was
gonna choose i was gonna go into a normal career um and i think that um so
i was so dedicated to making that happen rather than you know i wanted to grow up too quickly essentially i'm
23 like i you know i'm and i think that a lot of that has been i guess in terms of people's whether
when it's people who meet you their kind of perception of you or whatever it might be and so i think that was
something where it was a choice i'd make again and again but it was i guess a sacrifice that i wasn't
expecting to make and i guess that comes with everything that comes with you know relationships with friends
with time in general with you know time to yourself time to whatever i think
having a business in a way and i'm sure some people will disagree but i'm having a business in a way is like
having a baby and you can't just you can't just like up and do whatever
you can't you can't say no when a crisis comes in at 1am you can't like that is what it is you get all the other
benefits with those conditions and so i think that you know that's kind of a constant one like you can't
you can't say oh i'm gonna quit this and go and do this for two years because especially when you've got x amount of
people working for you you've got all of their salaries you've got all of their pensions you've got you know like it's it's a huge responsibility stops
with you right yeah and and and that's you know it's it's it's an important one do you sometimes i
reflect on uh the business journey and just how like obsessive it is and all consuming it is
and i think it's a bit of a disease i'm like why did i choose this to like it's almost like masochistic
yeah like obviously it's got the most amazing benefits but it is also like i remember what i remember my friend i can't remember
i think i really we'd agreed to just just lock down things we'd agreed to
watch a movie on a sunday night and then the sink came up and i was just like you know what i'm gonna like i'm gonna
do this i'm just gonna work harder so it's just gonna be easier for this week and it was like tiny sacrifice and my housemate turned
around to me and she was like what is the point of were you working this hard for this many years if you can't watch a movie on a sunday night
and i was like yeah like as in like you're not wrong like i'm still gonna do
it but like you know you're not wrong like it's what is the answer to that question though so say
because i've muddled over this as well if i'm working obsessively every day at what point does is enough yeah i think that it all comes
with what you want and i think that you know i've i've listened to you before and i've listened to you kind of saying that you know there came a point that you
realized that it wasn't about money so like what was it about and i think for me there's the kind of
aspect of it's it's for the businesses and i have these really clear dreams for the
businesses that result in dreams for me as well sure but i think that that is
i think i'll come to a you know if i decide to sell a business or whatever i'll come to that road there where i'm
like okay what is it for now and i think that knowing myself anyway
i know pre-business post-business i'm sure i am like that so
whether it's this or whether it's something else or you know and i hope i can channel that into something else at some point that
doesn't require every inch of your being and i know i'm like that so it's kind of
like yeah sure it might be for nothing but it's i'm gonna do it anyway like there doesn't need to
be reasoning behind the fact that this is how i am i have always been
i've always yeah i've always been like this i've always been kind of like i'm gonna make this happen like whether
that's kind of through like coordinating all the babysitting jobs that you got in one night and allocating them out to your friends
and stuff or you know like taking essentially like any job ever that like that i could
then you know that's all that's what i'm like so i kind of know that where did that come from though i
i think probably a few things i know that everyone in my family is a very
hard worker and that is very it's kind of almost like an like an
anxiety to do well even though like my parents were
not pushy at all i think people assume you know especially if you go to oxford or like whatever but the least
pushy people ever i think that actually it all i kind of was discussing this with my
sister the other day was like where does it come from it doesn't come from our parents like it comes from them clearly because they had
it in themselves but you know like they both my parents had careers when i was growing up i
lived with my mum just me my mum and we had a tenant who lived in um my mom's house
and my mum was working pretty much all the time incredibly like i respect her so much for it
because i also never grew up thinking like oh it's weird for a woman to have a career and have four
children and like whatever she just you know she worked all the time and um and she loved it she
loved it and she gave her like everything to it and so i i think i spent a lot of i spent a lot
of time kind of in that situation knowing that i also wanted to love what i do and i
think there is this mislead like perception that you know like if you love what you do you'll never work a day in your life blah blah blah
but i also think that there is this like it's a flow state isn't it like you have something that matches your
challenge and your skill level and you get more fulfillment than you'll get from anything
and i think i was so i used to say i remember saying like i i think it was like when i was like 15
16 and i would take like work experience from anyone every single holiday
and every single school holiday and i remember my teachers saying that you should probably choose one of the avenues and
then you can do like more within that or something and i remember just saying to them like i'm so terrified that i'll be stuck in
something that i hate and it was like a constant like and i don't think it's necessarily good i
don't think it was necessarily healthy i was constantly so terrified that you know the same was for university the same was for whatever
like i didn't get into oxford the first time i applied i i i and i went again like i literally that
same day i went online and i found out what i could do for a year that would earn myself some money to be able to not be
i guess studying that year and went to um and applied for the ibm future scheme
which is the one they do for gap year students that that literal same day
and then applied again the next year and like as in i was i'm very like that it's
very set on kind of one thing and if that thing then doesn't work i either want to do it again like it's
really clear to me i either want to do it again or i'm like that wasn't right and then i move on but i know that i'm
very straight out and very like i will not stop until like yeah you
get it right what's the uh actual the business and the chaos in the segment can is there one day in your business
career over the last couple of years which was your worst day um i mean or your toughest challenge
i think my toughest challenge in general was there was this stupid stupid time that
i'm constantly praised for that was the worst decision i've ever made in my life which was that i was
coming up to my university finals i was launching a business to i think it
was a month before my university finals yeah i was launching a business beginning of may the 7th may if i'm right um
and i started i finished my finals on the 6th of june now that meant that 40 000 words were
due and five three-hour exams within the space of two weeks and i also wanted to launch my business
and i also wanted to do well at university i'd been working with that for three years um but i'd persuaded people as well i'd
be persuaded people to spend money on this launch i'd persuaded people to you know so i was going to do it right people were like you're amazing like
this is so great like how can you do this and i'm like you are like it's not wise
it's not smart like it's not like this isn't a competition for how many boxes you can take within a small space of
time that is like a fast track towards burnout and either something going incredibly wrong
or whatever and i think that that you know like as i've said work was always a coping mechanism for me so it's always kind of like well if when if we
have to do it now or we like run out of money before launch and we're doing it now and i don't care like i can work x y and z and i actually have like
a whole like chapter in a book where i'm essentially talking about like that was the time that i felt most validated in being a
hard worker and i felt like because i was i was in the library at 3am and i was also
on the phone with the suppliers at you know 7 a.m the next morning and all of x y and z and people could
see it and i was living it i was like hustling the hustle and that was when i was like wow
like this is it like i am the hard worker like with capital h w and like this is
me and i think that that is like that kind of like sums it all up in
the way that that was a huge challenge also an incredibly unwise challenge at the time
and yet why did that feel like the time i was doing it right so that's actually that's a lot of what spurred on essentially why i was writing
the book because it was kind of like how can that be the epitome of hard work when that is
also the epitome of not being productive like that's like completely unproductive um and
not useful for anyone you're not gonna be nice with the people you deal with at the time you have a higher chance of actually
like messing things up and all of that and yet why was that the one time that i felt like truly validated for what i was doing and
you were broadcasting that and i was broadcasting that and there'll be people i'm sure who see me now who are like
she you know did this and that and like yeah sure i work really hard i really do but there are some things that
it's kind of like i addressed that and like as i said to you while i was writing the book there were so many things that i noticed i was like i'm the
problem here as well i perpetuate this how can i criticize a culture of the hustle culture that i
benefit from at the same time how can i do that and i think that i think that that's
what made me you know that's why i say that this book was such like a soul-searching process for me because i was like
you know what is that why is that like is that because i need the validation is that because we all need the validation now because hard work has
become so unobtainable because it has to be doing this job that job like everything in between also being
amazing at self-care also doing like x y and z and i think that that's when i was kind of like okay this is a challenge
but it's not only a challenge it was a silly thing to do so it's not even like a you know there are things you have to do
there are crises you have to deal with and all of that that will be a challenge and will also be incredibly rewarding and all of that and
most of them are but i think there are other things that you look at and you're like yep this was a challenge and it also didn't have to happen let's not do that
again as you guys know i'm a massive fan of hill i've been consuming the products for about four years now and you know
that i attribute much of my health and fitness goals that i've achieved over the last 12 months to
heal more recently i've started having the hot and savory bags of fuel and as someone that really
loves to have the ready to drink cure it's actually been really nice to find a product that is a meal but still gives me all of the protein
and the nutrients and the minerals and the fibers that i need for my diet so i'm now on the hot and savory journey
join me if you want to my favorite flavor is the thai green curry flavor i like to add loads and loads and loads
loads of cake and pepper to it because i really i'm from africa and i really like spice so give it a shot you mentioned burnout
Your mental health
yeah um and i remember reading a quote in a in a piece that you know an interview that you did where you talked about
mental health generally and how you know you'd reflected that maybe you weren't representing mental health in the right
way i think you said um you were giving advice but it didn't apply to yourself in terms of like talking and being open about it
i want to know long way back i've just been digging through every two and a half years yeah i just wanted to get a flavor for
everything oh yeah no i appreciate home it everything but talk to me about your mental health and the journey
you've been on with your mental health since you were you know 18. um well as i've said i think probably
a one of the reasons that i think i you know in that in that pose to give
context i guess i said that i am one of the biggest advocates for people talking about their mental health
we have mental health days like within our the company like you know you can take days off and you
can literally just take a duba day and it could be you know because of your mental health whatever it might be and i'm the biggest
advocate for that and talking about it and everything and then as soon as it came to me no
like that was not it's not the same case like i'm not going to talk about it i'm not going to
deal with it and it actually got to a point that i was having seizures essentially um from
something really horrible that i went to that was through that was essentially ended up giving me ptsd
that presented in seizures and obviously i was having symptoms up to the point of the seizures but i only took it
seriously when it was a physical symptom like when it came to the point that i was like okay
like i'm being hospitalized now like this is not ideal at all and that was the thing that made me slow down and that was the thing that
maybe or not even slowed down i didn't even think i necessarily hugely so down after that but it was kind of like okay this is real and this is just as
like if something can manifest so physically that you're having a [ __ ] seizure
then you probably need to take this more seriously and that was you know like that was that was tough that was right before my third year at university
that that started and um everything up until then like i've been a i think i have this like really
toxic mental health attitude within myself that doesn't prioritize it that isn't
kind of that kind of sees it as weakness even though that's the last thing that i'd
see you know in any of my friends who suffer from depression or anxiety or like whatever it might be
and it's completely different it's like we don't get the same treatment like
i'll give you no i'll understand that and i'll see that and i won't do that and i'm sure there are lots of people who are the exact same
you're not being compassionate to yourself exactly and i think that that's another reason why i really needed to like look inside myself and be able to
evaluate that and be able to look at like why like why is that the case like why do you feel so
undeserving of the justification for like you know having bad mental health at one
time and i've been lucky that you know apart from this which was a result of specific trauma
i've generally been you know i've had generally good mental health and i've you know been
able to deal with like i guess you know like i think a lot of the way that mental
health is presented is really damaging in that you know people do i've had friends who have kind of said like
oh yeah but you know i don't want to take meds from my depression or whatever and
everyone has different views on it but it's kind of being like well any other chemical imbalance in your brain you would because you'd say
like hey i need this to offset this or i need insulin to offset this or whatever and yet it's like a it's a thing it's
like a you know what's what's she called like mrs trunchbull you know from matilda that you like have in your
brain that's like you do not like get this or like you do not like deserve to have that compassion or whatever it
might be so i think like i've had a and i think i'm what's so strange is that i don't know about you but i'm able to talk
about mental health really openly and i literally had so i thought it was really important for me to
um i think as a business owner i think it's probably important for all i mean i think it's important for everyone but for business owners i think
it's important for everyone to get therapy because you're not meant to go through that much chaos
all the time like you're not meant to have three messages a day that could kill your business and yet you do and you're like and then
you're like the next like 15 minutes later you're like so what's that like your fight you get you get like programmed to
get up again like second nature and then you never deal with things so i kind of
i kind of decided i was like i'm gonna get like i'm just gonna have it once a week and it's just gonna be literally like an offload
and i sat in it for kind of like two months and i was like i'm like i haven't cried yet and i'm a
crier so i'm clearly talking about my mental health as if i'm doing an interview and if i'm like
you know just able to talk about it like yeah like i think it's important and like this is and it's like this is everything that's
okay to talk about this is everything that's not and i won't address that and i think that that's something for me
to i guess to deal with and i think that the important thing is as an owner of a business that
has people within it and then you know and as someone with a platform and all of that all of those things make it really
important for me to treat mental health properly both for myself and for other people
but i don't think i do but you are setting a really remark you know what you said there about being a business owner and it's important for
you to get therapy one of the other points that i think of good that you'll be doing by doing that is you're setting a precedence for all of your employees
that even me as the boss you know and that creates a safe space for other people in my business it was the same so we met
we made mental health therapy opt out yeah i saw that yeah so like and it meant that the men who were hiding in
the back that didn't wanted to be tough guys whatever you know i was going and i told the doctors the business my fat co-founder to go as well and that
week my co-founder dom said he got um something like 11 messages from men in the business that had been suffering
from mental health but just had never spoken about it and he became like the de facto male therapist in our company for that reason
what i wanted to go back to on is the point you know you talked about this build up that you had which
culminated in you being hospitalized with your mental health um i had i had a guest on the podcast a
couple a couple of weeks ago and she was uh she's a kayaker and she something something changed in her life and it
meant and she wasn't listening to her body and ultimately she ended up getting
chronic fatigue syndrome where she went from being a kayaker that could kayak for two hours to not being able to lift up her hands
and she said there were these warning signs in my life that i just ignored until my body went listen if you're not gonna
listen to me then we're shutting down and it sounded very similar to what you were saying so my question is what are those what were those warning signs that
you were in some respects by the sounds of it ignoring yeah i won't talk about specifically from from that perspective i do think
it's important to talk about in terms of burnout as a whole so when we i think the same thing
applies to kind of like the way that this kind of productivity
like rat race comes across now is that you essentially need to be working as
fast as you possibly can it's not productivity at all it's working i guess if you look at productivity like the definition
is that you get the most amount done in the least amount of time but that has fine like that taken as one
and then that's multiplied so you're getting the most amount done in the least amount of time so that you can do the most amount in the least amount of time
again rather than being able to just you know do that and move on and find that's good like we should be you know we should be efficient we should be
effective all of these things are important but i think that you know it's also the equivalent of
expecting someone like that or a marathon runner ultra marathon runner to sprint for the whole marathon like
it's ineffective they're not gonna win they're also probably gonna get injured
you know there's nothing beneficial about it and we see it from a physical perspective and we completely ignore it from
a mental perspective or from a work perspective and i think that that's why it's so
important to talk about especially you and me people who are essentially will be seen in some way
as like what hard work looks like that results in success or whatever it might be the
acknowledgement that working hard does not mean working all the time and like having it all does not mean
like doing it all and all of these various different things that actually are important to
look at from ourselves as well because like as i said like i realized that actually probably i was perpetuating a lot more
than i meant to and that was why i then ended up needing to perpetuate things because you know i constantly wanted to show people
that i was actually working hard which actually all it gave off was this is how what hard work looks like and
therefore there's you know it's probably stopping a whole generation of people who actually want to do something but
see something you know i'm not that type of person i actually don't get up in the morning and want to read like some disgustingly
boring like non-fiction book and like but actually being able to acknowledge that and find
some middle ground and find some realization that it doesn't all like it's not going to be the same for
you as it is for someone else and the same goes for hard work um and i think for for me you know
i now and i think largely because of having written this book i now see when i'm lagging i now see
when i need a rest i now see you know i'm able to construct a working
week that essentially you know is able i'm able to be ceo at both companies and i'm able to
do all my work and i'm able to do my own work too that isn't just responsive to other people's work
and then i think you know and i'm able to culminate that in a way that is i guess
a livable way of me working and there have been times where it's not that there's been times where it's you know like hell to leather and doing
everything possible but that's a needs must amount of time that is not representative of what hard work looks like and then being able to recognize that
within myself and say like that's okay like you're not weak because you have to sleep like you're not weak because you
have to you know like sit back sometimes or your creativity just isn't coming out
you're just like a human or not even like even machines can't do that like if you had a machine like working like it
would go into override or if it was set on the wrong thing or if it was you know like doing too many things at once it would go into override so like we
don't it's not even that we don't realize we're humans we don't realize like limits at all we just have no boundaries yeah and i think that's
that's what's important there's been a there's been a big shift i think over the last i'd say two years
there's been a huge conversation around burnout right and it's gotten to the point i did a post about the day but it's gotten to a point where
it i actually feel bad talking about working hard and i played around with
that idea because um on one hand you can be deceitful in the sense that you say like i i work 24 hours a day and i never sleep
and on the other hand you can be really deceitful and saying listen uh hard work doesn't matter self-care and like yeah yeah yeah
sit back and put on a face mask yeah like i don't want to lie to you i still work really hard but obviously there's
nuance and balance and sometimes i don't have good days yeah yeah but i don't know anyone that's
really successful that doesn't work hard i don't know any athlete 100 percent i think what i even realized
that was after i kind of went through all of this like self-discovery and writing the think pieces and all of that
and then i sat down to write the productivity method and i was like i feel like gordon ramsay telling someone he's like
an idiot sandwich like i literally feel like i'm being that harsh just because i'm telling you
that actually if you want to get that done you've got to get it done and like i think that's why the whole reason i repositioned it rather than
you know it's not just because as soon as you're that then you're equally as harmful in the perpetuation
of like self-care culture that now has these knee-jerk reactions that's either like
it's like a cult and it's like this wellness thing or it's like a waste of time there's like a middle
ground like that is important for everyone but it doesn't just need to be kind of like you know like face masks
and everything it can be it it has to be like part of all of it so yeah
you might work till 3am from 6am every night for a month
i would argue that that's not that possible beyond that point like it might be and you might be an incredibly hard worker and you know like
and i perceive myself to be but you still at the end of it all you still
need rest and yes you're completely right there's no glory and no kind of benefit in also
perpetuating the completely the other side you know sometimes self-care is the most
productive thing you can do but also sometimes productivity is an act of self-care like
you need to it's self-care to look at that project that you've been putting off for three weeks for the 50th time and
actually get it done that's self-care like that isn't it doesn't have to be you know this that or the other it
doesn't need to be compartmentalized into like you know some forms of work or self-care some forms of self-care are
like what you know like it goes both ways and i think that that's what's important i think it's rather than choosing one or the other
it's just real it's like being realistic and being you know you don't always need to be like disarmingly like i've had a bad day
today because i also feel in the same way like i can't be asked to do that the whole time like i don't like when i've had a bad day i
don't instantly think like ah i will get the reward from being vulnerable by sharing this on social media like that's not my instant reaction
but at the same time there is an importance and i do think that people like us also have a duty to be
able to share both sides even if it's that being like you know like i was up till 11 last night writing a crisis plan for
something like you know like you you constantly have these things and it's like and then like so there's just so many
different types of i guess there are so many different angles to it and as long as there's kind of a more
realistic thing as long as you don't feel weak to say that you sleep or whatever and you also don't feel
like you're being like really mean to say like you have to work hard to do well
both of those things are wrong so like there must be a middle ground and that the the left side you speak you
speak so i'm just calling it the left just because it was the left i raised my left hand when i described it i'm not saying it's the left
but it is it's like um i've always considered myself to be
more left than i am anything else but um i felt somewhat alienated by this kind
of lack of personal responsibility blame someone else um pessimism culture that's
emerging from that side and i in some respects it's someone that's been a social media for about almost 10 years i understand the
algorithms will create echo chambers and they'll reinforce things and you'll and they're actually polarizing us to be the right and more
on the right and the left on the left and my point here is that um i like to be a bit more nuanced so i
don't think binary solutions to complex um problems ever make sense left you know rich poor black white
um left right whatever it is and i post posted something about um personal
responsibility and being grateful and things you can do if you're feeling bad and there was a lot of people that said
i was and i actually take this to compliment they said i was toxic positive and there's this whole new this whole phrase not being too positive
being so positive that it makes people feel bad and i don't give a [ __ ] right like if we
also think we have toxic things within ourselves and that's like it's toxic but also like you can tell me i'm
toxically positive and i like if so for example like i might be the same in that i know that you know
i'm not i would consider myself probably like a realist like i wouldn't consider myself like a constant optimist but i also know that
like my coping mechanism for anything going wrong is to make something else go right so if that needs me to work hard if that
needs me to push completely into work for 40 days and 40 nights but like i'll do it
but i think that you know i think cor you know being able to label
something as something doesn't necessarily mean that it's bad i think sure if
someone thinks that toxic positivity then fine a i don't think that necessarily needs to
be kind of you know like nothing is going to be nuanced enough on social media for you to understand unless it's like a 2000 word
think piece but i also think that like these things exist like we all know some of these like i know that i have
bad coping mechanisms in some way i know that i don't need anyone else to tell me or if they do like it's fine but it doesn't
like there's no benefit here like you're still gonna think that way and therefore if you're sharing more of your thoughts
it's still gonna be like that you might be toxically positive but it's that's you know that's you and that's what you're also gonna
say and like that would also be you would also be lying to then say okay well i'm gonna make this more realist
and so i'm gonna do x y and z and i'm gonna put that out there and then there are going to be more people who say the other side so it's
like you can either spend your life like swinging back and forth between like what people perceive to be right and
you're never going to get everyone because obviously as you say it's completely polarized but or you can
it kind of be like yeah you might not like this i just my whole stance is like i've read a lot of stuff about
psychology studied psychology for a little while i i've had my life experience and if you follow me you're here to get that stuff
and you don't have to agree you don't even have to like it and there's loads of other and i think i just really destroyer today there's loads of places you can get like fluffy you know face masks so the answer
to everything stuff it's just not here because of my lived experience and i understand i have a you know a bias
because i'm an individual that's had an individual experience when i was stalking you online grace i found it really hard to find a boyfriend
Relationships as a young successful woman
i was i was looking a lot like i was like i was i found like i was like [ __ ] we'll try google images google images
like these are just friends and then i was like yeah i mean i don't think anyone will find a boyfriend probably until i'm maybe
married with kids but i mean as in there's not good there won't be one yeah yeah i'm not looking for it's not
there's a boyfriend there because i read some stuff about you meeting this guy when you're like 15 and then you oh no no there's not a boyfriend there oh there's
not a boyfriend there's not a boyfriend but there's never going to be a boy from
yeah being young being successful being a woman i know where
this is going yeah so maybe i don't have to ask the question i'm just saying like i asked this question a lot of guests because
probably because i've struggled myself right so being young you're a successful woman in business
a lot of guys quite just going to be honest would be quite intimidated right you don't have to answer that but
they would i'm one of them i'll tell you i'm not speaking for myself i'm speaking from some insecure friends that i have
that would feel intimidated by their their their partner who is a woman being successful that's just
some men are insecure enough to find that emasculating yeah talk to me about the difficulties of
having romantic relationships when you are young you are successful you are a woman um
i'd say it's not necessarily what i'm concentrated on first and foremost and
just just from like you know i want to do lots of things before i concentrate on
that um i also think that one of the things that i i guess i found because like what you're saying is
true um but i think what i find comforting in that is also the fact that like i don't
want to be with someone who finds that masculinity so i think it's quite a good um it's quite a good kind of whittle
down yeah because yeah if you find it emasculated like that you don't
any other thing that people might not like about someone you don't want to be with someone who doesn't you know like my work is the biggest
part of me and that's really sad it's not but like it's a huge part of my life and
it will be and i would never want to be with someone who thought that was any sort of like great um and so
it doesn't necessarily i mean maybe it will trouble me down the line but currently it's kind of like yes i
completely agree i think people do find it intimidating and emasculating
i also think that that's kind of you know as i say that doesn't necessarily change anything
because it's actually not you know i would have no interest in being with someone who
can be emasculated by that so and at this point in your life do you foresee in the future at some point you wanting
to be with a partner yes yeah yeah i mean i think i think naturally i think a lot a lot of people
talk i'd say probably the large yeah yeah and i think that it's important especially with women not to presume
because i've made that mistake you know yeah no i mean i've i you know i couldn't have like one friend who i think of her
i know she she knows that she doesn't want to like ever have like a life partner like she doesn't it doesn't make sense to her
which i think is completely i i think makes sense you know like but i think that absolutely at some point
and um but i'm in no rush i mean i'm very young when that day comes yes um what are the
the difficulties you see in the current way that you live your life and forming a relationship with whoever
this person this lucky person might be um i say the first problem is probably going to be closet space
i think no i think in general why is grace difficult today and why
probably yes you should probably ask a few people um no i mean i think that i'm an incredibly
loving person and i'm incredibly dedicated to the people i love and
that currently is filled by amazing friends and family and people i'm lucky to have
in my life and i think that that will you know at some point as i say like that will
absolutely hopefully be filled by you know that type of position but i i think that the difficulties would
probably just you know be about around understanding
that work is as important as it is to me and i think that you know like i've had relationships in the past and that is
you know like that does it does become a problem and i also think that
you know then you can't necessarily combat that by having someone who's the same otherwise you're never gonna see each other like i think
i probably you know would want someone who has the same values in that way but there has to be like a kind of middle ground or there has to be then
you know some sort of way in which you will see each other once every 15 years or something um but no i think i think the troubles
will be around work and they won't be around emasculation because as i say that wouldn't be
you know then there's no space for that um but i think you know in the same way as i'm able to be
a great friend and family member and you know all of that now it's
to me it's an extension of that to me it won't be you know any different i know in my qualities you know i probably
probably the part of the reason why that's not what i want now is because i also know that i care a lot about that so you know if i
am in that situation i will give a lot to that and currently i don't have a lot to give to that so you know i think it's a
prioritization for me and currently that's not a priority yeah how has running business
How has being a successful person changed you?
and the way that people have treated you in business especially being a young entrepreneur i reflect on this in my own life
changed you as a friend as a person you know your
patience your snappiness your tolerance i think i'm a lot more
i think there's a part of it that's actually quite interesting that i've been thinking more about recently where if you're in business and you call the
shots how does that develop in friendship so i i've actually talked about that
recently i don't think i've you know i've had to grow in confidence to say especially to
for example men who have far more experience than me and are technically you know working for me like there's
been a point where it's kind of like can i say like that this is not right or like whatever and i've developed that but i think you
know i think i've now developed that well and i don't think i have a problem with that now and therefore i think that you know
there's going to be part of that where you then like how does that switch off automatically the second you step
through your door and you're with your family or your friends or your housemates or whatever and i think that that's probably
something that i'll you know i'm very grateful that i think someone once asked me like how do you stay like
grounded and down to earth and i think that that i don't go for the types of friends
that obviously my friends like bring me up and they're my biggest fans but there is no smoke being blown anywhere
they will be the first person to also say you know and that's what i value like i don't want to be
in a superior position in friendship in family relations in whatever it is i
will never be with the friends and family that i have and i think that that's so important and i think that that can absolutely
affect people and i think that you know i've seen people then surround themselves only with people in their position or only
with whatever and i think that you know one of the most valuable things i have is that a lot of my friends are
in entry-level jobs and i'm able to see from their point of view what's the most frustrating thing about their workplace
and not feeling valued or whatever and i'm allowed i can make sure that i try like my best to make sure that never
happens for people within mine and i think that so you can get those you know you get so many benefits from having
different people around you primarily like no one is kind of there yeah as we say what about when the
bill comes oh well first of all i'll be pleased to hear that my friends like to go to a
very cheap place okay which i also like i'm i i love a you know nice dinner and a nice like whatever but
you will not i mean you you'll find me buying a bottle in the club if it's one of my friend's birthdays or like whatever you know like
i love treating my friends i love taking them on holiday like i love you know but it's you can tell when that's
someone who's there for that i also have the large majority of my friends have been around me for a long time and um i think
i i generally trust myself to be a good judge of character i've got it wrong before um you know i've had things where i've
kind of like taken people on trips left right and center and then you can tell that like that was the aim
um but like in general actually you know i have amazing people around me and like i think we i'm
i like to consider myself a generous person and i want to you know do things like like yeah sometimes i will just be like
i'll just get this or like whatever it might be and and i'm in a position to do that and i think especially if
you know there'll be a friend who's been asking for a workplace for a raise for three years and it hasn't
even gone up with inflation and that's kind of like oh and it's not the it's not compensating
for that but it's being like you need to be able to be grounded enough and like
whatever to be able to still be a friend to people who are in you know either a very different situation or like whatever it might be
and i think that i never want to lose that so yeah i'll buy nice things for people and i'll do that just
as i would for any like anyone like my sisters or whatever if they need something but it's
not i think i'll tell instantly and maybe not maybe i'm being walked all over by everyone but i'm happy so
no i mean we find ourselves in the same position largely right and i think the interesting point is you've been successful and the people
that you love you want to share that you know you want to have good times and good experiences with but being realistic mathematically they won't be able to
have those experiences unless you create them right and so that creates a bit of an issue for you
because you want to you know have good times with your friends but you know that you know that you're you're gonna you're
gonna have to create that situation whether it's a holiday and it's not a problem for you because you love these people and
they're good people but it can sometimes create yeah of course and there's a i think also like the important thing from
because i know people who talk about that problem but also they love the flex so it's like okay if
you're complaining that you're always the one paying for the bill and you're also the same person saying for three weekends in a row let's go to nobu or
even one weekend like it's [ __ ] expensive like you know like you're gonna like that generates a certain type of thing
and i think that you know that's not necessarily their fault then but i also think that there's
a you know if you want to be doing that all the time and you're the only person person in that position in your friend
group then you're you know there's a certain thing that's demanded of you but i think like at the same time that you can be a good friend and be like
very generous and like like i understand that i'm incredibly fortunate to be in my position and i want to get
them nice christmas presents like whatever it might be and take people on holiday like if you know i want to go or whatever it
might be but um i think yeah largely yeah it's a
difficult it's not a difficult position to be in like an incredibly fortunate position to be in but there are there are things that come with it and i think
that you know thankfully i haven't been i guess like harmed by that too much and i you know
intend to i don't want that to make me a bad person and i don't know it sounds like you're keeping the right people around you that's probably the
most important thing right people that will tell you when you're stepping out of line oh trust me yeah exactly tell me the first person to be like this comes
across awfully crazy thank you so much
you guys will hear me mention a service called fiverr quite a lot especially if you follow me on linkedin and instagram and this has been another week where
i've really relied on fiverr to help me and to help our business extend our capacity this week we're having a newsletter
website launching called mentalwealth.com which is being developed on fiverr we're also using a freelancer we found on fiverr to
cut the edits for this podcast promo that will go on my social channels and this is really the beauty of fiverr
even when i was a ceo of a company with 700 employees or even now when i don't have a company and we have a much
smaller team there are still moments where we need to extend our capacity usually because of you know we've got a
sprint or a project to do in a cost-effective way thank you to them for sponsoring my podcast and if you want to check out
fiverr there's a link in the description below that's fiverrwith2rs.com
ceo we've talked a little bit before we go on on we started recording about working culture and how working culture has
Your take on working culture
changed and how the pandemic has shifted things to being you know um working from home what do you what's your take on working culture
and how teams should operate and how your teams operate and stuff so i've been reading a lot about this recently actually um general things you
know like rework work rules like all of those types of books talking about working culture and
i think that the main point of interest for me that i've kind of been exploring obviously
has been the idea of working culture but how we internalize it and how our lack of boundaries within this generation has
meant that we're have no boundaries between work or not work so it's kind of you can be working anywhere and everywhere so when you're
not you've kind of internalized this idea that when you're not working everywhere and anywhere it's the equivalent of like being in an office and taking a nap like
just because you're living your life and i think that that to me is the most that stands out as the most problematic
kind of side of working culture within our generation i also think that that is that is coupled with you know like
companies like google for example who are seen to have really good working culture because they
support their employees they you know unlimited holiday all of that some of that is also a thinly veiled way of making people work more because they
don't have to do their laundry they don't have to cook their lunch they don't have to um you know they're not going to take any of that holiday if they're given
unlimited but they do feel valued so they work harder you know and i think that it's really complex and i think that it's not
necessarily like i definitely couldn't deconstruct it as a whole and i probably perpetuate it in some ways but i think that
it's important that we look at it more and more now these boundaries are absolutely gone especially you know i started
having some of these thoughts and feelings when i started working from home before we progressed to having an office
um and i kind of was thinking like why am i working more than i ever have and producing
less than i ever have and also my mental health is on the floor yeah yeah and i think that then when kind of there was the office exodus
going at the kind of pandemic um and then people kind of saying the same thing and all of that and i was like oh good
and i'm like why am i feeling happy you know the fact that everyone else is struggling too and it was you know it's a lack of
boundaries we have awful boundaries surrounding work surrounding success surrounding all of this
and it's part of a generation that i guess bulldozes boundaries in a kind of progressive sense but it
ends up meaning that we actually don't know where we stand we don't know what is good for us and i guess we
are constantly on the hustle train being told to like do more think more achieve
more like xyz without ever questioning whether it serves us because that's what
we've been put on like if you're a hard worker you have to go in that like kind of way and i talk a lot in the book
as well about like the i guess the kind of contradiction between the
progressing values of like a four-day work week and you know amazing you know places
like um nordic countries that have amazing work rules and all of that and at the same time like at literally
the exact same time and often by the same you know people the same kind of um examination of it
we also have this idea that you kind of need to work all the time it's like how are we progressing in these two completely
different directions and we don't necessarily know which one is right and then if we're going down to the full day work week is that because
it makes us more productive so technically it's actually to make us like work more or produce more or whatever it might be and so
i guess it's it's all just very complex and i think that there's not enough examination around it
in the mainstream i guess like you should be able to if you're in the financial position too and you want to and everything like you
should technically be able to take your work down to four days a week or whatever and that
seems like the most ludicrous suggestion ever because you know you could always be producing more you could always be doing
this you could always well then you should side hustle and that three day weekend you get and like x y and z and so i think it is i think
it's damaging and i think that yeah as i said and there's something funny here well you know because we're talking about
ideas that we would probably never live ourselves yeah like you're not gonna oh no three days off for a [ __ ] weekend and
i'd love to yeah would you because you're gonna go insane
but yeah um but i but yeah no i think it's completely true and i think that part of this has been
me being like okay this is really unhealthy this is actually problematic this is xyz and yet and you are the embodiment
of all of this trying to figure out but that's important and i think social media discourages that type of thought because you have to be on the defensive
you have to say like yeah this is a bad idea and this is a bad idea and yet i do both of them you you have to either acknowledge it's
a bad idea or not acknowledge it's a bad idea and just do it you can't have this like cognitive
dissonance of thinking one thing and like doing another because yeah like sure that's a bad thing in some ways but also like
you have to accept the fact that you don't always think what you're doing is a good idea or you don't you know you know something's good in
theory but don't do it or whatever and i think social media completely bulldozes that opportunity because you have to like stand firm you
have to stand your ground you have to and i found myself actually getting quite one of the reasons i stepped back
from social media was because i felt like i was justifying myself constantly not to not outwardly
to myself because i was like i need to you know but like if i agree with this why do i do this and like all of that
and i think that i had to be like this is causing so much like i'm going into overdrive because i don't know how to
deal with the fact that i have multiple thoughts at once because social media makes you linear it makes you yeah it makes that like
lack of nuance like your thing like it's the mo and so i think that the
i think that's kind of okay where i realized that like we just can't discuss anything like you have to choose your
camp you have to choose your like whatever you um when i first came across you it was a couple years ago it was actually on twitter and i think
well i don't know i followed you you followed me let's just go with you followed me because it makes me look better um and i went on your profile and i
remember going down and thinking here we have an influencer who actually like stands for something and that was my only like real sort of
uh that was my first sort of take on you another couple years passed by whatever and i i wondered as i was you know going
through some of the tweets more recently that you know people just talking nonsense whatever i i wondered you know there's a cost to that there's
a real cost to standing for something because then it's much easier just to stand for nothing because then
i can't attack you for anything right because you don't you know but when you decide that you want to stand for something whether it's sustainability
or whether it's certain values you then are interrogated for perfection yeah and one human step out of line we've got
you yeah no absolutely i think the same's in everyday life but it's magnified to a point you know in the same way i remember when i i went
vegan like three years ago now and i um my friend said that my friend
the reason i went vegan was because my friend was ill at the time and she couldn't eat any dairy products and she was upset about it and we were um we
were actually going traveling together and so i said i would do it with her and we were like let's just try it like it'll be fun and i was like
[ __ ] i really do not want to give this up um but we did it and then we actually stuck to it and i was kind of like i
actually like this it works really well for me um and um i and she was saying how hard her
friends were taking it and how like they were just like you know be like ha you just ate that that actually
apparently has like this and it's like it's the same it's just magnified and i think that i think that part of its projection
we don't like to acknowledge that we think one thing and sometimes do another in ourselves but we love to pick it up
on other people and i think part of it's just as we say it's the binary of social media it's the lack of
kind of you know it's the fact that that is going to happen and i do you know you
find yourself doing things the whole time where you're like oh yeah we shouldn't have done that or like whatever
and i think social media amplifies that to the point that it's so much more of a big deal than it needs
to be sometimes it doesn't need to be a big thing like i'll stand by the fact that you know cancer culture fine like in a lot of
ways not great in some ways like there are some areas yeah really shouldn't be said or whatever um
but i think that there's also like an aspect of that that's kind of you know we live our lives constantly
thinking one thing and doing another like cognitive dissonance like we you know like you know you should be better for
the planet and yet you still buy fast fashion or you still like eat meat every day or like whatever it might be
it's how we operate and i think that that isn't allowed on social media i don't think that's like a then like a
complaint i think it's more like a that's how social media is and therefore if you're using it in that way there
kind of needs to be an acknowledgement of the fact that that's just like i know that and i know where i go
wrong and i know you know like where i'd like to do better and that's for me to deal with so you know and so i think
that that's something that we see across our lives and it's just hugely magnified when you made this decision to step back
from social media i know you hadn't posted on youtube either for about 11 months i have all my dates was there
By stepping back from social media did you let the negativity win?
a part of you that thought you would let this
negativity of social media win i don't i think any time i've thought
that i've realized that it's completely untrue because i've realized it later so when i step back from youtube that was
about that was a you know a bit after all the things i've talked about that like i was
going through and it wasn't right for me and i just decided not to do it and i think
that also part of that was a business decision it's a like lost to income in the kind
of short term but everything i've done for the past three years has been towards longevity it hasn't been about the short term
because i've been able you know at the beginning i accumulated enough to be able to make that change and to be able to say okay well i want to
i want in two years time if i want to to be able to disappear so you know that's i think
rather than i don't think anything has to be a defeat like sure it could be some people
couldn't consider it that for themselves like great that's fine then we both win because i realized
and once again i talk about it like i talk about kind of like the thought process behind it
in my book and i realized that kind of that was actually not you know i had this choice to
be full time influence so i guess with my businesses in the background and i also had the choice to lean in and
really make these businesses something and make them you know like much bigger and have the potential of
you know growing them huge maybe selling one one day like whatever it might be and i think that i decided as well but
actually what made me happy in the actual work itself was the head down get it done even like the crisis
management the working with the team until three am the building of brands all of that that like i was so young and
still am that i hadn't even started my career like sure i had but i like everyone i guess anyone at
any time can do three years of something then decide to go to business school then decide to stop and do writing or like whatever it
might be that was my change that was me being like actually what do i like in the day-to-day
it's not you know whatever like there was a lot of stuff that i was doing that i did love
but i a i saw what was happening down the line i saw that it was really hard to maintain that after a certain
amount of time and as i said i've always had this kind of constant anxiety that i'm going to end up doing and something i don't want to do
which has made me be probably quite proactive and actually being like actually no i'm gonna do x y and z to make this
not happen and i think that you know sure like there was part of
you know there will be parts of it where it's like oh and also even better than that it means i won't get the negativity but i also
loved the sense of community i loved you know at that time actually i didn't get much negativity at all like
and i don't think you do necessarily when it's kind of like just a sharing of your life like people loved especially the fact that i was at uni for three years so i was
showing a really realistic like i'm still just gonna be in my one room home um like you know doing another
essay like it's not that exciting and people loved that it was i think because you know once the channel grows it often gets unrelatable
which you know people have different arguments about that but like for three years mine had to stay relatable because i was
still within that same room writing more essays and i think that i absolutely loved that
like i loved that and i will cherish that as part of my career that i really did love
i think i know that what i'm doing now is what i'm meant to be doing i also think i'm really good at it
and i think that i feel fulfilled like i i genuinely feel fulfilled um most if not every day what are you so
what are you what are you doing now in terms of your your focus and your um
i guess the question that i wanted to ask to that point is what are you as it relates to your
businesses like i think about the same question for myself what is the bit that you're really good at and that you think you know what
What area of business are you best at?
that's the piece that where i consider myself to be irreplaceable so i guess the more i you know as a ceo
or a founder who's moving into another or whatever it might be like you you step back to work on the business
rather than in the business right so the more i step back i think the more you then realize what you're really good at because those are the things that you
keep having to jump back into and you keep realizing that like yeah i could get this person to do it and i could delegate it entirely which you
know you try and do and then it keeps coming back and it's not quite right and for me that's marketing and branding
that's like the you know the thing and that is i also think that a lot of
successful businesses are you know founder-led businesses
are the ones where i was talking to a friend about it the other day actually are the ones where the um founder is
product and brand and they still have that involvement whether it's just at vision and their briefing at the beginning of a process
or whatever it might be that is where the concentration is because that is what the brand is and we are in a generation where
brand is everything and so the you know the house of cbs the like what
you know the yeah they're all they're all their brand and and beyond brand their
brand bleeding through to product and so you know it's good that that's my concentration as well because you know
that's definitely paid off but i also think that that's the things again and again that when i was having
the discipline to step back and to actually you know do what i should be doing which is not being in
the execution all the time being in the lead and being in the vision those were the ones where i realized i
was like okay i have to be in this in some way sure even if that's you know as i say writing a brief at the beginning of the
process or mentoring that person through the first few times or being at the end of the approval process
whatever it might be those are the things that i nothing will go live without that going through
me not at every stage at all but there are stages whether that's the beginning the end both
whatever it might be it sounds remarkably similar to many of the founders especially young
founders that i've spoken to who have that realization like ben who's been on this podcast as well from jim shark um even like huell julian who runs hum
where at some point i'm speaking more about ben here you have and to be fair myself as well because at social change i wasn't doing
process finance yeah legal all that nonsense i was doing brand marketing
um we have that realization that um that is your strong point it's also the bit that you love and all the other things
the process the business stuff those were systems that were created long ago and that there are tons of very you know
better people than you to handle those things and it becomes a case of where will my investment of my time um return the most
for the business and i don't think people have that conversation enough because i think young founders sometimes feel like they have to be able to do
everything right i think that is the materialization of this hustle culture i think a lot of that
led it's the kind of like idea of so i talk about this thing called like announcement culture which i thought was
a thing but then i actually looked it up and isn't anywhere so i kind of like defined it within the book about the essentially the idea that
you know success is valued as more within this generation once it's announceable so it's not the
underlying stuff even if that was doing more it is everything that is announceable labelable all of the above so
it also comes on a micro level within our everyday like we like to tick thing we like to see the things ticked off
like we like to you know we'd probably rather see 10 things ticked off our to-do list than have actually made some real
thinking progress in a concept that like whatever because that's the way it's you know you feel more
productive you feel like you've done more and i think that that's also an area where where
founders people on social media who within businesses whatever they need to be seen to be doing everything to be validated and i don't
think that's a personal problem i think i've had it 100 i think i still have it at certain points but you know
it's a validation through being told you're legitimate because you do things and like i'm not
gonna lie i don't know half of the [ __ ] that goes on in our finance meetings and i will sit there and i will look at
it and i look at you know and it's like that's great and i need to be over it and i need to have that understanding and i'll ask the questions
but i also think that the second i let that fear of illegitimacy by not doing
everything leave that was the second that i was able to actually be a leader because i was able to realize that
actually what if if i'm better than everyone at their specific things then we've got a
business that is as big as one person like as it goes like you should hire people that are better than you
at their specific disciplines so like even if you're like if you're micromanaging if you're being like a bottleneck if you're like
whatever it might be you are automatically causing
a problem or not even necessarily causing a problem it might work that you know like it might go to plan but
you are restricting that growth that potential that magnitude of the business
because you are and it's for your ego it is not for anything other than your ego even if that's an innocent thing even
you know as i say i still do it i'm sure at points even if that's you know like you want to be said to be on this project that did
really well and i think that as a founder you have to get to a point where
that ego of course it's like a validation thing and it's coping mechanism and you'd like to think that you always do the best for your business
but especially when we're looked at online and when you know we need to be seen that we're involved in this that and the other
because otherwise people think you know like especially someone who i'm sure lots of people think i'm just the face of the business whatever so like maybe i
need to prove that i do x y instead but the second i stopped doing that was the second i
as i say was actually able to do my job remarkable when i was 18 19 20 starting the business because i
was young i'm gonna be honest i definitely feared hiring really experienced people because i thought well how am i gonna manage them
and are they gonna and they're gonna figure out that i'm not that experienced and it's gonna be difficult and so i look at
the first 10 highs i did and they're all like kids yeah i'm like why did i hire 10 kids and then i get to a point where i'm like 21
22 and i start social chain and i hire some really experienced people then they go on to higher loads
of because the person the people because they know yeah they know what their teams need to look like i always say in our companies i'm like the most important people are
the people you have hiring all the other people right absolutely and that my life became 99.9 easier when we got better people in
and i i fell back and stopped letting my ego or my insecurities run the show and the other thing which i wasn't
expecting is it actually makes you look so much better when your business works
like i i think the thing is that like you've got to ask yourself yeah would you like the business to have
the glory or would you like you to have the glory and like then realize that if the business has the glory you still have
the glory but you just have to wait a bit like you just have to not need to be validated every day by
the fact that you were involved on that project that did well or the fact that you signed that off i don't need to sign something off if
the team is made of people who are better than me and like fine actually i'm sure there are people who are far better than me within branding but it's my brand
so like you know like still that's going to be that's going to be like put in a certain direction but i think you're completely right i
mean i actually hired you know in my final year of uni i actually had three students
working for me or one student and two fresh grads and they were great like they were fantastic and to like and
i think they're you know amazing one of them still working within tala now and i think that i think that that
actually was my only option at the time like oh i couldn't afford to hire you know like any more than that and it was people who i put them through like so many tasks
and i was like i need you to be the right person because i'm about to launch business and do my finals at the same time so i'm going to
be outsourcing and i always say actually a lot of the reason for my success was also the fact that i was forced to
outsource so early based on the fact that i was at university and oxford had always been my dream as i say i
applied twice like i was not going to let it go i thought i deserved to be there and i proved when i was there that i did
and i think that that i was so committed to getting to the end of that getting what i deserved and you know and
being proud of myself even though that wasn't necessarily my dream anymore that was my like childhood dream i was so convinced
that that was gonna happen that i had to outsource immediately essentially like and who was that first key senior hire
that came into your business and how did it feel when you you know you saw the salary and you thought [ __ ] yeah so
so salary wise those those are more recent those are much more recent those are within the part actually probably right
before i finished uni there was someone who we hired and i was like but i actually
managed to get someone else to hire them so so to work on essentially what would be my
account um so the but even then i was kind of looking at that and i was like you know like that
regardless of who's hiring affects the p l so like you know what and but then more recently there have been
you know we've been hiring ahead of product from sweaty betty you know like all of these like the people
it's but also like those are the ones where i have to like hype myself up during the interview because i'm like you graduated from my university 20
years ago yeah
it all ties in as well because as soon as you realize that you don't need to be that person you also realize that they're not
wanting you to be that person they want to come in and do their expertise they don't want you to be like oh i just
want to check over this because i'm the founder or i'm the ceo they yeah they just want to do their job
and the better they do their job the better you do their job the better you do the job the better they do their job it like it's all cyclical but it's like
ego and validation and legitimacy that ties together to make this kind of big old like cauldron
of like this is probably ineffective but i have to be not even validated i don't think it's
vapid like i don't think it's like you know i don't think it's necessarily ego in a bad way i think it comes from
like the fact that all of us have some insecurity that needs to be you know especially if you start a business young and especially if you
feel like oh like wow i'm in this position like you have to be you either you're like incredibly
confident somehow and like completely full of yourself but i genuinely believe that most of us have some insecurities about
yeah and so like it's all tied in i don't necessarily don't think it's bad thing i don't think it makes you a bad person as i said i have a lot
but i think you have to recognize it and i think that's the first thing i'd say to i actually had a fellow founder messaged me like two days
ago and she was like i just wanted to tell you what you told me about a year ago saying um like everything you know she
was at the stage where i was like you need to be hiring people and she's like but it's expensive and i was like i know but they will pay for
themselves because like if you you know like even not even necessarily the right people like even if it's admin even if it's
like whatever you should be doing the things that only you should you can do whether you're self-employed whether you're like
whatever it might be and you know like my my like i grew up like my dad was self-employed like all
of these things and i think you see you're like there are so many different ways of working and i
was thinking because i've seen people do things one way like i need to prove myself and i need to do that
proving myself is more effective if i have a team of amazing people and that's been like one of my biggest
biggest lessons i asked you then what your you know what you were really good at within the business you talked about branding and
marketing so i'm going to ask you the opposite question as the boss as um grace beverly the ceo
What area of business are you bad at?
um what are you really bad at big silence
kevin i think i think there's probably like we're going to bring in her pa now
i think there are probably a lot of things i think i think there's definitely i think one of my things is
the thing we've been talking about getting involved where i don't need to be involved i think that's probably you know and i think i have an anxiety
around that that actually you know there have been times where i haven't got involved where i probably should have because i was getting too confident with
my moving away and then it just wasn't right and the product didn't shift enough or whatever it might have been
and so i think probably what that's one of my main things and also only recently have i realized how much
confidence i have to have in people and i think it was actually based on talking about how shitty some of
google's rules are actually in work rules um the book about google working culture um he says that
like one of the most important things at google is that they encourage and empower everyone to be like their own
founder so like if they're on a project like they should be founder of that project and they should feel empowered to also like look at me and be like no like
this is not how it and like and i think that that stood with me so much because i was like you know what like the next day i emailed someone who
was you know hiring someone within their team and they were like should we get them on this or this and i was like you decide
like you you know you decide we know the end goal any way we get there i'm happy with you
decide instantly so that you know like because people also want to be empowered with that and
also people often you know do much better when they're given their responsibility and so i think that some of that what
we've just been talking about is probably one of my biggest weaknesses because i'm so terrified that
something will go wrong and obviously as the you know success as many fathers and like all of
the you know all of that like you have to take responsibility when it goes wrong it doesn't matter whether it wasn't you whatever it might be
i mean something goes wrong right yeah with your brand mm-hmm grace beverly mm-hmm is the one that
they 100 hold responsible so in turn over but also something goes right for true but in turn over here says
something responds to a dm yeah whatever you've got to almost justify that even if not even
justify it but it apologized and it's happened it's happened multiple times and i think that how do you not then go to
the intern and say because i i i think if it was enough for
me to do that i think it'd be much more gracious for me to just probably get rid of them as in essentially to say like
this is not the right place because it also you know there's a par there's an element of that that's not understanding the brand that's not understanding who
we are or ethos or whatever and if it's that far out of line and it's like okay well this is a mismatch here then
but i think that so my two options then e both of them involve like you know
being gracious in some way and one of that is fixing it if i genuinely believe that it was an honest mistake
and it came across wrong or like whatever it might be then fine and i will work with them to deal with it and i don't believe
you know maybe someone will disagree but i don't believe i have ever ever ever gone to someone and be like how dare you you've sacrificed this good
like like you know you've done all of that because also they do the work every single day to make the company great and yeah it's
frustrating like trust me like i don't see that and think like it's fine because last week they did a nice post or like whatever
but like there is still an element of it that's like frustrated and that's like feels like you've taken 10 secs back and
is terrified that you're about to be cancelled or like whatever it might be but there's either a decision then to
decide it's a mismatch or to decide it's still a match and it was an honest mistake neither of those involve like ripping
someone to shreds so how do you do sometimes though when you do get like emotion and business
it's your baby it's it's sometimes you know anger or i don't know frustrations they
do manifest themselves in business in some ways like i'd be lying if i said that i didn't have days where i was frustrated and people knew
i try not to be as much as i can i try and remain a little bit calm especially when it's most chaotic yeah especially in offices i think that's
particularly like we have the luxury now i'm like no you can't see me like as in you know i think
i i often like i think probably the near our
office the like cafes they know me well because i will go in there i will take myself i will exit
because i don't i think in life and in business i don't believe in i don't think i necessarily
react in that way naturally um and i think to my detriment sometimes because you know sometimes you do need to just
say you know this is absolutely not right or whatever but i think it's the same thing as i kind of talked about before like you
know i'd rather work out the best way to deal with it there have been times where i've picked up the phone and i've been like what the [ __ ] has gone wrong
like why would you do that like this makes absolutely no sense like this is you know you should know better like all of that and
they are first of all they are very few and far between i'm not saying that i don't say that to my housemates i'm like how [ __ ] damn
i don't understand why he would do that like he knows that's not the case but i would i don't i don't i mean you
might disagree i don't think i i don't think i really like i'm not looking at her she also is paid to say no um
but i genuinely i genuinely i'm not a she's the same way as a text
i think i'm the same in relationships friendships like everything i am a walk out of the rumor and come
back in half an hour and at that point i'll leave the shout or i'll you know but i'm not instantly kind of in that moment
which is why i sometimes also find social media hard because i don't want to react in the moment and social media warrants an
instant reaction because that's the only way that you're being true to yourself or like whatever it might be like i often will think something you
know when you're angry and you think something you're so angry about it and then half an hour later i won't be or i'll think it's different or i'll
think someone didn't mean that or whatever it might be and so i try and even though social media doesn't necessarily
allow for that amount of kind of like discussion i do try and like you know just yeah and that's kind of in
general how i deal with things i go and spend some time by myself and if anyone talks to me
if you are to become the person you want to become what does that person look like in terms
of values the way they conduct themselves react to things um i think for me it's a lot of
repositioning i as i said like i think that i grew up on social media at a time where i was
particularly low and therefore like a lot of that was made up with validation therefore like i think one of my main aims
and one of my main like work what i've been working towards for the past you know year or so has been that kind of
self-validation and that self-worth and i think that that through and through you know unfaltering
self-worth is i don't know whether it's even like a reality like i think
people have faltering views of themselves just like they do every other person you can love someone absolutely unconditionally
you can think in one moment like yeah like you know why did they do that or like i think that's a terrible trait
about them or whatever and i think the important thing is being able to bounce back from that into the original
position or being able to consider that and still have that worth or love or whatever and
i think so i think to become the person who i want to be i think it's you know i'm
quite you know happy with where i am now and i think there are like i know what i need to improve in
terms of like and i think a lot of it comes down to my own confidence and my own um like assurance
in myself in order not to project that elsewhere so yeah like in general i think that's
probably one of my main main things being completely honest i don't think it involves like money or like growth in any other
way i think the first thing that i know that i need to improve on is that how how does one go about improving
their self-validation i would love to know
but i think in general it's just like an it's an understanding of yourself it's an understanding that you're going to [ __ ] up it's an understanding that you're going to
think one thing and do another and i think that part of that as i say put that was part
of the reason you know i did move away from social media because it was like i can't have all these people telling me one thing even if it's
a great thing because it doesn't allow you to be like completely in touch with yourself and know those differences
yeah exactly like even if it's the people blowing smoke up your ass like you then can't get that from yourself
because you're constantly like clouded by that if it's people hating it's the same thing so i think that like i'm don't i don't
necessarily know i think all it can be is being in touch with yourself and understanding that you are
going to do things wrong i think i'm very harsh on myself in the way that i don't like doing things wrong and
i work very hard not to do things wrong and so when i do it you know it hits me
hard and i think that part of that is learning that does it hit you hard yeah i think i think in general it
really does and i think that i yeah yeah i think that that's kind of one of the things that
you have to then develop that kind of self-love and all of that to be able to say um okay
great well like you know but i'm i'm as i've said got this like miss trunchbull living in my head who
just wants one thing and one thing only and it constantly changes and it's constantly more and
i think that's an important thing to address two things the first one is instagram you kept instagram
Instagram
yes why i like instagram in general i think that you
know i think one of the one of the sad things that i found about kind of
pivoting was that i loved what i got from things like youtube in
terms of like the community as i say that like i loved being able to share that and i
was at this really weird point where i loved sharing my life but i also didn't like sharing my life because i like you know
and it was you know there were bad things and good things about everything but it was like the highs were really high and the lows were really low
and so it's kind of like toxic in that way and i think that instagram
instagram and twitter probably both can be used in a way where you i try and use it more as like
a you know i post way more than like a regular non instagram non public eye whatever person
would post but i don't use it as a platform for anything other than just
social media like if that if that makes any sense at all it's kind of you know it's pretty much
my only platform and i just you know i post as on when i want i don't need to post i don't need to come across a certain
way because i don't need to do stories at all one day you know like whereas yeah and probably the most widely there was a
report out that said instagram is probably the worst platform for mental health well you can see why visuals filtered visuals
unrealistic compounds i think i think i think i also thought that no matter what i didn't like or what i wanted to pivot
to i also owed it to myself to be able to celebrate my success in some ways and i think that you know that however many messages i get from
people saying you know i know you've moved off other platforms but please don't agree delete
instagram because you know xyz like whatever it might be like everyone has their people who really
don't necessarily really need them but really really benefit from them and i think that i also
saw a lack of representation for women in the business space who also shout
about it and i think there's a reason for it like i wouldn't encourage a woman to shout about it not from a moral perspective but because you will
be ripped to shreds and because people will have preconceptions that are different from successful men and you know whether
that's showing material things or like whatever it might be it's perceived as differently and therefore like but i did think in
that way that not only do i want to be able to do that i also think that you know i think i'd
like to do it also to make sure you know to be able to be in that landscape and i think that i kind of
owed it to myself also to be able to celebrate that even if i was moving away from that being my job i didn't post in
any way the same as i posted when that was my job um i post very differently but
you know it's i love it you've got any sort of big regrets in your life that you've uh that might help others
Any big regrets?
avoid making those same mistakes um i think i mean i mean i think
my it's it's the kind of same timing thing again it's once again it's just anything to do with allowing other
people's perception allowing focus on other people's perception of you over your focus on
your perception of yourself um but i don't think i'm not really like a
as i've said much to my detriment and to my success i've you know i don't necessarily
concentrate on don't maybe it's that toxic positivity thing you said or whatever i don't necessarily concentrate on
those downfalls like i feel like everything that's gone wrong like we're not not getting into oxford
the first time or whatever that led to me having a really great corporate job and i was able to make some money and i was able to you know like work in econ for a
bit you know like all of those things and i think that i'm very like
my pick yourself back up attitude is bad in some ways but the way it's good is also allowing
you to not have many regrets because you always make something out of a bad thing and therefore it's really hard to look back and say that was [ __ ] because
fine even if it didn't lead to what you thought it would like i had for example i had my absolute dream job lined up for
april and it got cancelled because of the pandemic and you know i
like was very lucky to be in an industry that was largely unaffected in fact in some ways did really well
and i was so devastated about that um and like maybe it will happen maybe
it won't but like you know i think that that was something that couldn't be a regret couldn't be whatever
but i also know that at this point i've moved so much away from social media in that time that that
probably would have put me on a like blasted me in a way that actually maybe i wouldn't have been able to deal
with and i think that you know kind of the world works in like mysterious ways and like maybe that wasn't right and maybe i
wouldn't say yes if i got that opportunity again and i think that that actually just
yeah i i guess maybe it is a toxic positivity maybe it is like maybe i should be you know i don't allow myself
to be sad about those things when i maybe should be or i should address them but i think part of that means that when i i'm asked about my
regrets i have kind of very little that's good i mean regrets that come with their their upsides right and the value in the
lessons that they teach you so it's hard and i don't think it's bad to have regrets i think acknowledging your regrets is
really important to be able to move forward um maybe i'd block them out i bet you can't wait for people to to
Worries about your book
get your book right yes it's a real labor of love right yeah i mean i'm terrified at the same time
um and i'm sure there will be some people i think i think well i think you it's the same as a business if you pull that much love and your soul into
something if people hate it they essentially hate you like that's never nice it doesn't matter whether you're a bad nurse or whatever like it's not something you want
and i think that i think also as i say there's a lot that i've put in there that i probably wouldn't have talked
about online because it's there's delayed feedback there's you know i don't need to hear what someone said
thinks about that in that moment and so i you know i'm excited i'm terrified um
but you know and it's also very different like it's different from what i've been doing it's not entirely about business it's
not entirely about you know xyz it's it's different like it's essentially another pivot in one way
and i think that you know i'm excited and equally like you know i think about
it some like some for some reason last night was one of the nights that i had kind of like constantly waking up i was like what if people don't like this bit
and like what are people you know and i think that that's not something you control control and like
i think the only way to guarantee not having that would be to write a blank book which i don't have much interest in and is that those worries because i'm
because i'll be honest i don't have those worries yeah and i've spoken to other authors that you know when i talked about them being
excited about the book coming out they also didn't express those worries so i'm wondering where those have come maybe it's because i'm conditioned to
having a constant feedback loop of you know whether on the businesses whether on my socials whatever it might be
um or maybe it's because i'm more insecure about those feedback things like maybe it is
but i think that it's also i care a lot
so you know i care a lot about it i care a lot about my well-being i care a lot about you know i
and i feel like some of that you know is acknowledged that it's not necessarily even the right thing like i want to be able
to write my truth and to write what i genuinely believe in and for someone to say i don't believe in that and it's kind of cool
back to the battle we were just talking about there so yeah you said you wanted to be less sort of connected to people's feedback well i
write in the book i write you know at the same time like there's
i don't i don't obviously it's completely irrational to want to be liked by everyone and i don't
want to be liked by everyone but i think in the same way everyone who is in the public eye and sees something [ __ ] or
whatever it might be you know as in it's just you know it's a natural reaction like
you know yeah so i think but i'm very very excited and i think that the reaction so far to you know the
concept to the excerpts to everything has been amazing and so i think that i should
probably just be more excited about it and um yeah you're a you're a
How do you battle with all your ideas
very um inspired entrepreneur i noticed this when i was going through your sort of your history over the last
four years you've started several businesses you've had several ideas within those businesses and you seem like a constant stream of
ideas right i imagine that's also a problem yes my early investors told me they said they
kept hitting me with this whip and saying steve stop [ __ ] emailing us with a new idea all the time how have you made how have you been able
to distinguish between what's an idea worth pursuing and what's that because you could you know when you get a little bit of resource and you have
teams of people you could at any time be the ceo that's walking in every day and saying we're gonna do we're gonna do this a new thing
that can be unhelpful i'm still guilty of it yeah no and i'm sure i am um i'm sure i am how do you decide what
to what yeah i think i i think i use our audience a lot i think that one of the
real benefits of having a you know i'm gen z so having a gen z led brand for
your gym yeah i'm the first year of gen z um and i think one of the benefits
is like everyone's constantly like how do we market to gen z how do we do all of this and i'm definitely not like
gen z like don't ask me to do a tick tock dance but like i um i think that in that way i feed off
our audience a lot like i know i'm not the most experienced at branding that doesn't mean i'm not the best at branding for our brand
that means i'm not the most experienced so how can i use that in experience how can i leverage off people you know how can i can i can just
ask people sometimes like i can just say like would you be interested in this and i like used to be like no because they can only see it the final thing
and then sometimes people have said like yes yeah and then i've been like actually no but i think it's instinct i think some of it's instinct i think the more you
know your brand the more you really like know your brand and i think that lots of the time you
know it's an equal problem when other people have ideas and you're like
no but i want you to have more ideas like and i think that you know it's just a constant learning process and i'm sure
i've had i have had ideas that have gone you know that just haven't gone as well as they should have and i think that that's
constant thing i think in in fashion especially like you're going to have like a certain amount of things that
don't sell as well as they should like whatever it might be and that's just a constant reality so i don't think it's necessarily about
always picking out the best ideas i think it's about picking out the right number of ideas usually fewer
and executing them well and as we look forward to your future i'm sure there's plenty more ideas to
come is there anything in the pipeline that one might be able to know about well actually because because i've
started two businesses the one question kind of press everything always asks is like what's
next what's the next business and there just really isn't gonna be one
for but i think currently i am so maxed out
i think because i have two businesses here but i also have my personal brand sure so you know the book is a business
you know and that's a lot if you think of the amount of days in the week yeah so you're thinking like
five days i'm really strict on weekends so i hate to tell the hustle culture crew but i take weekends and i'm
strict on them um and so five days a week split between technically three
businesses that's already a lot of time blocking to establish what you spend your time on
and where and bearing in mind that about you know fifty percent of this or not 50
40 of the stuff i do will also be unexpected so i think that as i've said the
kind of ethos i have about constantly constantly pushing on and doing more more more
is actually detrimental when it comes to doing things well and so i think that you know yeah i
i've had ideas and nearly started multiple businesses and that this time at one point i even wanted to do like a
mini essentially influencer vc of some form and like but actually i
want to prove to myself and i think i have and i think i can continue to do so i want to prove that i
can do these well and i can have patience and it's not about more more more
because i think some of that comes from the fact that you know when things settle it's really easy to push for more when it's just at a settling
state and i constantly you know why can't i push for more within those businesses like each yeah exactly and growth and wider more
breadth and everything and i think that that's part of my plan so it might not be new businesses but
huge projects sometimes within a business sometimes take just as much as a new business and i think that yeah sure probably if
my businesses were taken away from me tomorrow i'd probably have an excellent you know like another one the next day and that's
how i'm programmed and i'm thankful for that because you know that's definitely part of the reason why i've got to where i am but i also think that
it's been a big lesson for me to learn that more is not always more yes that's the lesson that i also
learned and i then started becoming a bit of a preacher to my friends who would brag about having five businesses
and me saying one good one is much more that's the thing i would almost people as i've said people would say
about the end of uni when i was doing you know like all of these things and i think i recognized
probably too late but at some point i recognized that it wasn't about that and therefore i kind of was almost
embarrassed when people were like she's got 72 businesses yeah because i'd be like yeah you know i'd rather have one that was doing
really well i'm currently concentrating on two doing really well and a third one which is my personal brand which is you just yeah yeah
and then you know and that one will be the key to longevity for the rest of my career but so will
these two if they're done right because you don't need longevity you know if that happens and so i think i'm lucky to be in a position
where i have many different potential paths and the most productive
thing i can do in that moment is decide on the path and stick to it and i think it's fickle and i think that i can be fickle
in like a hard work you know like diligent way because i just want to do more and quicker and like all of that but
actually the toughest thing i can do is just stand still and do it right and where where does this end then for
your businesses in your view where do you how because when we're entrepreneurs we kind of forecast you know five years time i'll sell this or i'll do this or whatever
i'll step away what's your thinking with your businesses i think it depends i think that like for example i often
i'll have a view i'll say like okay well i'll maybe aim to sell this one in two years and then this one i'll keep
on like and i'll you know do that forever um and i think that then it changes then
like the other one starts to get really exciting and really profitable and you're like well maybe i'll keep this
one for longer so i think that like i've got used to the fact that that's not you know
there's probably not i've probably got used to the fact that actually there'll be a point where rather than
saying okay in two years i'm going to do this it'll be like [ __ ] i'm done like i'm done and
therefore and that's too late but i know it will be like that because i know i will push it to you know like the end or whatever it might be
but i'm i'm open i'm very open to it i think also i'm very much at the beginning of this
like shreddy four years old tyler not even two years old yet and i think that i'd be doing myself a
disservice to kind of be it's exactly what i would do jump to the next when can i sell it when can i get
all of this but especially because when you have a business you kind of programmed to assume that by the time you've done this
you're officially like you're no longer an entrepreneur you know you like sold a business for x
or whatever and it is a success point it's a huge you know it's a huge accolade and i think that
for me i it's just about constantly keeping in touch with myself and what i want what i want for the businesses as well
because i'm sure there'll be a point where i'm like i can't do that yeah like you know this needs x amount of funding or this actually needs to be
acquired or whatever it will be don't think it'll be soon but there might be a point you know and there probably will be a point that that happens or
where you know we've grown hugely recently i have a terrifying thought of like what if it gets too corporate at
one stage and then you know it's not a joy for me anymore and at that point yeah like i can like very much consider that
um so i think it's very much like an open consideration constantly for me and i think that the best thing i can do again is just
not yeah exactly have you managed to achieve balance in your life
well this is the sort of whole point of the book i guess but um
um i think i think i'm doing well at the moment i think i wasn't doing well this time a year ago
i think that i um i'm probably doing well you know because
for example like as i've talked about like i'm not in a relationship so maybe like that would throw it all off or whatever it might be i think at the moment i'm doing it well
and probably too much of a focus on work but that's what balance looks like to me at
the moment it's not 50 50 it's not like a tipping set of scales it's like sure this is what's added up oh yeah i'm
definitely happy i think i'm i think i'm particularly happy at the moment because i feel like i'm somehow simultaneously living my
early 20s life whilst also being you know being in this amazing position and that for me that was the main thing
i wanted because i just was you know this more more more thing was like you don't need to be acting like you're
40. like you you know and so i've really tried to maintain that even though it's strange for me to be in my position
and living with three of my friends in my house or whatever it might be like i feel like i'm having that and i feel like that's
that was a real you know that was a big thing for me and i'm you know happy that it doesn't
necessarily have to be that i'm in like some sick high rise apartment by myself with like exposed or whatever
um and that for me is my happiness thank you uh it's been wonderful
speaking to you i find you so inspiring and you know people have said to me as i've like gone through my journey that i'm like a wise head on shoulders
whatever but you like really really are oh thank you well you are no but you like really are like you're 20 23 i remember when i was 23 i was still
largely uh an idiot and you you you seem to have figured out no i know but it's like the
level of i'd say self-awareness right and i can see as you're speaking in the way that you answer questions
you're also really you're really trying to appreciate nuance that's something it took me a long time to do right so i thought the world was
the way i saw it if you don't work hard then you are inferior yeah right and then but i can see you're being very considered in how you speak
and appreciating nuance and i think that's the trait of someone that's that's a bit had their life accelerated in the public eye or through you know
pressure of running businesses but just someone that has very wise um head on their shoulders and you're inspiring as hell
thank you and you're a lovely human being so i want to thank you for coming here today and giving me your time and um when when can we buy your
book april i know we can pre-order now 14th
15th thank you lexi yeah i know mine is march so yeah but
you can pre-order now 20 something oh yeah well pre-order pre-orders dom when is my book now
25th of march we'll cut it so it looks like we've got it right first time i'll pull up you can pre-order both now
maybe so many people will pre-order the same ones that you know when amazon assigns like a specific bundle people who yeah yeah exactly they're
like you can get these two together for this i think that's the aim from this do go and check it out because i've
i know how much you put into it personally and sometimes i sit down with people and i know they had some ghosts right i create the whole thing but speaking to
you on and off camera i know how much you've poured into it and when when people do that i think they create really remarkable pieces of work and unique thoughts so
thanks again for coming on you're a really really special person and i'm honored to have you here thanks thank
you

intro
why am i at this point and how the hell has someone died under my watch you can't even go and
kill yourself you can't even go hurt yourself you're [ __ ] useless and i'm beneath the surface and you can hear the thumps
overhead like and i turned around and looked at vice and he went [ __ ] run
now [Music]
wow this is the most gripping inspiring twisting conversation i've
ever had on this podcast ever if you're squeamish i'm gonna have to ask you to prepare
but even if you are i'm begging you to follow this story my guest grew up in a broken home one
plagued with domestic violence with abuse with heartbreak and he moved to five six seven different schools as he
stumbled through his childhood trying to find his way trying to find out who he was and then stumbled through
his adolescence looking for purpose in life and he was met with rejection with pain with confusion with barriers
and as he spiraled into daily drug abuse into addiction and into purposelessness a job that he
hoped would give him that sense of purpose ended in a manslaughter case and this tragedy only caused him to spiral
further and as he reached the depths of his despair he made that decision one day
that he was going to leave his house go for a drive and end his life for whatever reason
and thankfully he didn't go through with it and by fate or luck or faith or whatever you want to call it whatever
you believe a short youtube advert that popped up one day out of the blue would be the catalyst for him to pull himself out of
his darkest most desperate moment to give up drugs to overcome his mental challenges to brush himself off
and to pursue his childhood dreams he went from suicidal drug addict to elite commando
developing what he calls the commando mindset a mindset and a set of values that you can learn
but his story doesn't stop there his time as a commando is riddled with graphic violence with
heartbreak with being injured by the taliban while at war he'll describe the moments after he was
blown up and turning around and seeing his friends laying there behind him in pieces and losing some of those friends being
discharged from the military because of his injury grappling with ptsd finding comfort in alcohol and addiction again
getting himself in trouble with the law finding himself in court facing four years in prison and then
rebuilding himself once again launching an incredible coaching company and working with elite performers
harry kane gareth southgate and the whole england team before they went off to the world cup and then the pandemic comes and his
coaching business collapses but in typical ben williams fashion adversity doesn't dictate his outcome
thanks to the values ingrained in his commando mindset he bounces back to launch an incredible
tech company what a wild emotional gripping ride you're about to go on honestly congratulations for
choosing to listen to this episode without further ado i'm stephen bartlett and this is the dire of a ceo
i hope nobody is listening but if you are then please keep this to yourself
[Music]
ben from doing this podcast over the last couple of years one of the things that i've been reminded of and an idea that's been
Your Childhood
reinforced in my mind is how important all of our childhoods are
in influencing what we then become and i studied childhood psychology between the age of like 16 and 18
and it blew my mind to understand especially in those early years how that sort of fundamentally shapes
who we then become as adults and it's and it's in some respects often quite
hard to shake right um you know that old adage of not being able to teach a new dog new tricks because we're so we learn
most of our behaviors when we're young so my first question for you is tell me about your childhood
tell me about that experience how did that shape you yeah my um my parents had quite a rough
divorce when i was around i think six seven years old um
and i never speak about that divorce i never go into detail never talk about what it was but it wasn't nice
and we sort of didn't see dad for a while and then the mortgage wasn't paid and
mom had to take everything on and we had to move and we went from this lovely house
to a very small house on a sort of council estate and i think at that age i didn't
really see it too much i just it was part of the journey it was part of the process i didn't
recognize her problems i didn't recognize what was happening it was just our dad's gone we're probably young
enough to just get on with this and it's funny because my kids are the age now
and i think about what are they processing now what they're going through how they seeing this what do they see every angle like
um and then i think as i got a little bit older and i began to understand their separation a bit more
and how it was not a clean break it i felt like i was a young child who
almost wanted to protect his mum i had my younger brother that i thought i wanted to
or knew i wanted to look after and protect and then she found a boyfriend who
wasn't a father figure and i hope you wouldn't mind me saying that as well he was just there in the background so when you said
it wasn't a clean break [Music] you mean there was domestic violence issues or there was
it was uh it was an aggravated separation that's pretty much as far as
i'll go on it um but we witness things we witness things and i think that stays
with you quite clearly in your mind as you move through and when we go
and move and transition into this kind of new phase of our life in a new house with a new man in the house who wasn't really
acting up as dad it was probably the most problematic area to be
mum's dad and mum um and you can actually fall out with mum
because she's trying to be dad and vice versa as well and i have
probably the closest relationship in my entire family is with my mum because i recognise everything she's been through
and she's an extremely resilient lady who's got herself to where she is
today but it is true and i'm listening to your podcast and
looking back on my own journey you see every single little thing begins to affect you i think later down the line rather than what
you're going through at that moment it's all about that process and i don't think that processing happens very well when you're a child
as i just said it's kind of next phase next phase next phase you know then all of a sudden six seven schools later
um and you don't fit in and you know i'm not the broken wing story if you don't if you come to school and
you don't know anyone you're the kid they're gonna pick on so that was part of the experience and
then then you find your feet a little bit in the system like my sort of final school
that was kind of my make or break moment and i think i went more towards break
you said that when you're young you don't really know what things mean so you're kind of experiencing them but you're not like consciously processing
them yeah but they are still sitting with you and having an impact on your world view then they're telling you what a
relationship looks like and what a relationship with you know your siblings or someone else or authority looks like for example but you
don't have that time to process it and i think as is the case in my life i like didn't process a lot of this stuff until i was
like 29 or like 28 or whatever yeah um and i guess that's the same for you right it just feels normal
i think if you've not experienced anything before what you then go through feels normal um well this must be reality this must
be how we do things and then you just kind of crack on and i think actually it was during my
military career and then been sort of immersed in what that throws at you that i kind of
describe it as like almost the eddie stabard lorry that you're just putting things in along the way every now and then you just stop and put
things in and then you're just traveling at high speed and then something will happen and you bang the brakes on and then everything comes
flying forward and that's what i kind of found over the sort of my mid-20s
was why am i thinking of this again why is this coming back what's this all about and trying to work out a way of beginning to
process what i should have processed years ago talks about six or seven schools um so
you you were expelled or you were moving no we moved a lot all right yeah we moved a lot so we moved
from guildford and then up to beds area and went to some schools in bucks and it was just house to house
so we moved from school to school which is difficult for a kid and i found
i found myself leaning more towards listening to certain music types such as heavy metal
very heavy metal actually and dressing with it and i think back then you know early
naughties is oh there's there's a kid in the corner with the black nail varnish on the spiky hair and the dog color and he's new
let's throw exit him oh wow um so i suppose maybe i didn't help myself
as well but that was just it was a real strange one because that's what i was into that's
i still like that stuff now um yeah i felt like i wasn't accepted for
liking what i liked you know that's how i kind of didn't fit in for a while at school
and is that is that a coping mechanism was was the music a coping mechanism was was being different in school or
whatever it's some form of a coping mechanism because heavy heavy metal is pretty emotional
sometimes i think it is uh i think it does become a coping mechanism
[Music] i but i found it was the start of things it was the start of escape
and it started with metal and then it moved to more sinister things such as drugs and at one
age so i started smoking weed around 12. um um
you know i tried weed before i tried cigarette weed got me with people i always wanted
to be with or thought i always wanted to be with and all of a sudden i was smoking with the cool kids and oh this
is all right you know i'm finally fitting in but it's only because you're all using weed and you're all focusing on
this one thing that your togetherness is your little unit um
but then yeah i think drugs took a little bit more of a hold of me than i expected it to
and it was weed for several years and it just got more and more weed until i started to progress into my late
teens where i start to pick up on other things which is when it all gets a bit cloudier
going into the clouds what age did you did you start experimenting or using other drugs so
i think just to give you even more of an insight of what i was thinking is i think because
what happened between my parents and then not really having a father figure when we moved
i actually began this sort of hatred towards males um i just didn't like him i just
it seemed like it was the guys at school who would pick and then i didn't have father figure and it was am i the male who where is the male here
and i just began this almost sort of disliking to to males when i started at
school i started to have anger management around 16 and then i i was going to ditch
everything at school i wanted to join the marines and leave and my mum
god bless her was no you've got to stay on the path you're on do you relate do your a-levels and then move on and
then if you fancy doing it do it then and that then left me quite bitter because i was like i want to go and do this this is my destiny i'm going to go
and join the military and that sort of no from her was that moment where i was like
well [ __ ] you i want to do what i want but i still stayed in school and it was like what's the next best
option i don't know why becoming a bouncer suddenly becomes the next best option
but i wanted to fit in and i wanted to live a more macho alpha male lifestyle and i
thought that was going to throw myself in the deep end and become a bouncer and so i managed to get my sia license
so prepped for my sie license which is the badge you got to have as a bouncer when i was about 17 and a half the
moment i turned 18 i was on the door and very quickly learned what the real world was all
about and it didn't go very smoothly for me in the first instance whatsoever
so to try and skip my almost youthful growth i started
injecting steroids i started on started taking steroids
orally and then moved on to injecting and then bulked up and got angrier and a bit more difficult
to be around you talked about wanting to be a bouncer because it would make you feel like an alpha male or
The desire to be an alpha male
whatever um and it would make you feel and why why did i'm really like intrigued by that
i thought where did the desire come from to be considered an alpha male
whether in your own mind or to external to other people so i think part of it is the fitting in is
why can't you fit in around that time you know lock stock was
quite old but snatch and certain other films were out which they were quite they're almost in the
limelight it seemed like that way a life seemed to be normal uh not normal but what you should aspire
to be like uh aspirational the aspirational like gangster um and i watched a bit too much of that
you know i read lenny mclean's book and roy shaw's book and thought oh you've got to be hard to fit in in this world
but i take to take you that moment where as basically mum said no you're not joining in the marines until you're 18
or at least do your a-levels when we did sort of begin to have every fortnight weekend
with dad again the marines museum is somewhere where he used to take us
we also went to the parachute regiment and uh to the imperial war museum here used to just take us around these
military museums for some reason i remember being a young sort of nine-year-old in inata or as well
looking at these pictures of these really incredible people i thought
because this is what inspired me i thought i want to be a marine and you know as back as sort of nine years old
10 years old and then when it's kind of many years later when you suddenly almost pluck up the courage to be like let's do this
it's a no it turns you quite bitter and quite angry and why not this is what
i've always wanted to do and it and it does feel like that someone suddenly puts a blocker in the way of what you've always wanted to do
your sense of purpose yeah that can that can make you um think in rather negative ways and i
that for me was when it was what else can i do this is it this out is it this alpha male
thing you know that's is that what a marine is is what's the closest to that then and where can i fit in and that's kind
of what led me to the path of i'll go where everyone seems to respect
you know i'm not going to sneak into the nightclubs like we used to do by putting our socks over our trainers at 17 to get in
i'm going to work on it and those kids that have always taken the mick those kids that have always thrown the
odd thing at me are going to respect me and there i was 18 years old on the door
two questions the first is what did your dad do professionally and
was your desire to be macho in any way influenced by
um wanting to also be accepted by him at all
i would want to say yes but i think i'll say no i
i don't know where it came from um i don't know where it came from and
my second point was there is a stigma in society that bounces have power complexes and what you've
described there sounds like a power complex yeah and it's this thinking that
mum was dad and there was no other male in the house apart from her boyfriend who didn't really
really be dad to us so do i need to be dad do i need to be the alpha here and the the older i got and the more i
was on the on the door and the bigger i was getting um
and i was working five nights a week you know this was my full-time job and you were getting feedback and validation from
yeah women yeah and you know you get into the you get into the fights you
you get better at it you get more switched onto it you get more aggressive with it and all of a sudden that validation
comes in you think yeah well maybe this is my purpose maybe i am supposed to be here um
and you don't see the animal you're becoming even at that age you can be 20 years on
a door or you can you can do it within a couple of years if you start doing it every night and becoming
almost laser focused on being there for the violence you're you're an animal it's like the
frog in the frying pan gradually being yeah cooked it doesn't really it's a good way of putting it yeah i i it's
particularly intriguing to me i've actually never talked about this but one of the people closest to me in the world followed almost an identical path and they went
through school i i think in my view lacking validation probably in the top four people closest to me in
my life lacking this validation they then started using steroids at 18 17 18 years
old i found the steroids in their drawer and then they went and became a bouncer and they were doing it for
they told me for the attention from girls on one hand but then also because i think it did something for their self-esteem and this person is
the single smartest person i know in the world but being getting that validation from being a tough guy on a door
and injecting steroids and going to the gym and eventually he even started doing some fighting like ufc fighting stuff i think was um filling a hole in your
story though the i read about an incident when you were a bouncer that kind of changed everything for you
yeah i remember um we had a neighbor a little irish lady she's lovely she's
still with us she's still with us and uh i think she knew the underworld better than i did from where she was from
and i remember saying she said to me she literally sat me down she not when she found out i was joining
i was gonna work on the door um she came and knocked on the house and sat me down no one was in as well and
she was like you don't know what you're getting yourself into i was like i do know and strangely as a young male
and you may have experienced this yourself when someone says you can't do something or you don't know what you're doing you're very quickly like i know exactly
what i'm doing i've watched all the films i've read all the books i know how to do a some sort of kick i'll be fine and she's
An incident that changed my life forever
like you don't know what you're getting yourself into okay so she was right
um there was an incident which happened uh at one of the nightclubs in milton
keynes where it was around 3 am and i was leaving
the venue as literally i was signing off at 3 and the rest of the team of signing off at 3 30.
and i was literally about to hand my radio in and there was just like this massive
screen down the range and we had a door team i think of around 15. it was a big night club and it was
still pretty packed for this time and yeah there was just this sort of scream down the radio
and then you heard black black and that was like so you had code red which was like it's
kicked off code black is like we've lost control and you just kept hearing black black down the down the mic
and i was with a friend of mine uh another one of the doormen and we were literally like what should
we do and just chuck the radios and run to where it was and we ran down the fire exit
it's in the escape builder i don't know if you know the escape building in milton keynes it's like it's just like a maze you go through one exit and you're
just in a maze of concrete tunnels and we were running down the stairs and then sort of round
the corner and as we were running towards coming in the back of this part of the nightclub the doors just
bomb burst open and everyone just fell through it was like a dam of bouncers and people scrapping
and it was just carnage there was just people fighting all over the place who couldn't even work out what was going on
um and then i recognized this massive guy who early that evening had just been a
pain and he gave me a massive kiss on the lips and everything and like ruffled my hair when i had some um and was really
patronizing towards me and and just he put me in my place that's what he was doing
and they were fighting and it was inevitable they were going to kick off on this evening and they did and i just remember seeing
like his arm dangling as they were trying to force him to the ground there was about three of the other lads on them big guys
and then there was brother and then two of the people fighting in this this area of the team i just grabbed his
arm and he was just like flailing me around and we i was just slapping into the wall and then back on
and then we all hit the floor and there was this almost like crunch sound but no one
thought anything of it because he just he went almost even stronger and i just had this arm
i was lying there thinking this is he's really trying to get up here this is going to get out of control and you
could hear his brother screaming down the corridor who's a big lad himself um and we're probably
on the floor probably about a minute trying to subdue him you know calm down calm down
um and his face was facing back across me and it was just staring at the wall and
then i noticed some sort of pulling underneath his head and uh it just didn't look right the blood
itself was not a nosebleed it was purpley and i just said said to one of the lads
was like i don't [ __ ] think he's well and everyone literally just
massive breath came off him and he was still lying there didn't get up and then one of the bouncers was a
fireman and i was like roll him over and then began trying to resuscitate him but to no veil
and he'd passed away there and there on spot remember standing there watching it all unfold
suddenly going from this big alpha male we're here to fight to
what the [ __ ] has just happened and then they closed the club and they nicked everyone and then we
were on man or charged for about a year as they tried to determine what happened
um he'd lost his life you know as a man had come into a nightclub
whether he was a pain or not had lost his life and worse than that uh five kids had lost her dad
through an act of violence through actually no one's fault he fell and the way everyone landed on
him unfortunately broke a bone in his neck which caused him to go away and it was um it
was put down as an accidental death there was no malice in it there's guys trying to defend themselves and and
the court recognized that and i'm glad of that as well because things like that don't always get
recognized and people all do get in trouble for defending themselves
um but for me it was a serious point in my life where i thought wow we're not in deep here
we're [ __ ] way past deep um which became quite a hard thing to
deal with and then you lose your job and by that point i was already using cocaine and
steroids and you're trying to keep up this addiction and all of a sudden becomes an escape
and then you can't afford the steroids you see yourself get skinnier and it's what do i need to do i just i'll just do
more i just need more coke but cokes are expensive and smoking more and more weed and i just became extremely lost you
know i was uh i was cleaning school toilets at one point because
that was the only job i could get was to be a cleaner and for me i felt like i was very much
lying on rock bottom you lose your sense of purpose at that
point right like you lose your sense of orientation and this i've you know in writing my book and doing tons of studying over the last
two years i've really grown to understand the importance of especially men having a sense of purpose
and orientation and as i did some reading about why the life expectancy has dropped over the
last two years in the uk and the us i think i've mentioned this before the data suggests that it's because of
opioid addiction and then you say why are people getting more addicted to opioids and the data suggests because men
specifically are losing their sense of purpose and i think jordan peterson's the one that says there's a purposelessness epidemic
sweeping the world which is why the life expectancy has started to decline and it sounds exactly like that when i
when i read that in your story and as you've said it then sounds like one of the the worst things that can happen to someone
a man or a woman is they lose their sense of as i say in my book their sense of like
chaos because that chaos and that having stuff to strive for and aim for seems to be our act our stability
um how bad did it get for you at that time in terms of drug use and and um your mindset
so i've written about it quite openly in my book um i was using it on tuesday mornings
you know in my mom's spare bedroom using coke right um and it got really bad
it got really bad to sort daily use always that was it that was all that the
focus of the day did like get cleaning work done or or if i wasn't doing that just like oh soon my
mate i literally had two mates which i did it with and i'd just wait for him to finish work and then we'd go and pick up and
then we go and see my course until midnight just sat there just looking at the stars
thinking it's a chill sesh really just [ __ ] wasting my time um and it was on one of those very
lonely days where i just sort of thought i don't even know who i am and actually
i have a girlfriend at the time who's now my wife you want to meet a resilient woman my
wife has put up with me for so many years i've got a lovely family
and yet here i am sat with like half pulled blinds [ __ ] everywhere in my room no purpose
don't know where i'm going in life taking drugs why like i'm from a nice
background why am i at this point and how the hell has someone died under my watch how's this even happened
and for me that kind of was a moment of obviously give up
so i took the i took the courser which i shared with my brother and i just went for a drive and i had it
in my head this sort of ambition that i was just going to go and drive off something or drive into something or
go and do something stupid and uh try and escape what i thought was
this internal pain it never happened it never prevailed i never
did it i actually ended up back at home after losing track of time sat there
feeling sorry for myself oh you can't even do that you can't even go and kill yourself you can't even go hurt yourself
you're all [ __ ] useless um which lo and behold is when i
sort of flicked on youtube the old clunky version
and that advert appeared and i thought i don't know if it's fate i don't know if this is some sort of
sign from above as the advert for the royal marines
yeah and it just came up it was an old advert and it was just there just appeared as
part one of the videos that i should watch and it was a young lad and i reckon he
must have been about the age i was at the time i sort of 1920 i think it was at a time
My turning point - joining the Royal Marines
still quite loose on my time into that one and he goes he's going through the endurance course which is one of the commando
tests and one of the four commando tests and the endurance course is a two mile bogs tunnels
um just just just a muddy hell that's the kind of way of crazy muddy
hell yeah and then a four mile run back to camp and to get to that point you have to have done the 32 weeks of training
and that's the first test and i remember watching it and and he's running through wood wood
breeze on where it is would be common he's running the stops and said would you stop here
and then it goes again and it goes through the tunnel would you stop here and then they have this obstacle in there called the sheep dip and the sheep
dip's about three meters long and it's fully submerged and you have no control what happens is
um someone will put you under they'll force you through and then someone else is the other side and they have to pull you out you can't swim you just go
through like a torpedo and it's a bit dramatic but this kid goes under the water and gets his trousers stuck
on some jagged bit of metal and he's like hanging out for breath and then it's going it freezes would you
stop here and then it freezes again and it does it again does it like two or three times and then it says if yes don't even
bother filling out the form and then the next cut scene is him with his green beret
at night on uh a speedboat offshore raiding craft just going along
no music just this weird sort of tone it was like and then it goes 99.99
need not apply and that for me took me back to that young child in the royal marines
museum in portsmouth who was looking at the pictures of old guys of moustaches in the falklands and
the early iraq's people who had become something and i thought what else have i got to
lose what else have i got to lose here than to just go and do it
and that week was a turning point so you applied yeah i can tell how much
that particular video influenced you because you can describe it i mean it must have been decades
right since you said yeah and you can describe it in such graphic detail i still watch it now oh really i still watch it now only because it just
it reminds me of that sort of transition in my life that courage you know i always thought that i
had a lot of courage i think a lot of men do they what is courage to us what what is courage and it
was something that i thought i could establish or find on the door or
in like a violent world and be that alpha male where actually courage now i look back
over my years i look back and think courage was the ability to go downstairs you know after sitting there for hours
shall i shine shall i not i'm going mom you know you said no thinking of doing
it and she went thank [ __ ] for that because i've done my a levels and i think she'd
grown tired of me yeah yeah and i was like what and it was like this just acknowledgement like yes
please go and do that because we can see what's happening here and you're ruining your life and you're only just about
realizing it and i was like last to the party and realizing i was the one ruining my life
and the other hard part was you know my girlfriend had been with some for some time [Music]
who had been through all of this up to this point i'm now leaving her to go on this journey
and become a royal marine and i think that was for me the hardest part to build that courage up and say
can i go and do this and she was like yeah i support you with whatever you want to go and do
and that was it it was literally i described in my book like a couple of days later i literally just threw i had a pack of
coke in the house and just threw it in the um in the toilet and flushed it and didn't flush
i was like that was dramatic because i thought
admittedly i kept smoking weed for a little bit because it was my progression off everything
but uh you know the steroids were done partly because i couldn't afford it but
you immediately begin to learn about what being fit means i remember this moment i am i didn't i
didn't really have too much physical training kit i just had the odd sort of football shirt and horrible jogging bottoms lying around
and it was uh i don't know if you've seen it i think it's sean penn run run fat boy run
at the moment when he he steps out the doorway for his first training run for his marathon and he's all overweight
and he's like stretching off in his really crap yeah and i uh
i felt like that guy and i stood at the doorway of my house i was like i'm gonna go for a run over the rest of your life
yeah but it was this it was like the weather we have now it was just this hit of fresh air and running and the
endorphins and the exercise feeling like it was purifying me i thought
this is what it feels like this is is this what success feels like is this what progression feels like is this what
it feels like and that was that week alone of just feeling myself getting slightly fitter
and healthier you know simple things like tidying up my room i was making myself homemade meals like
lasagnas and pastas because it was carby and it felt like that was the right thing to do um and then i began to to start the
application process and yeah it's about a year's process of fitness tests
medicals well psychometric tests and stuff like that
and then you go down and you do this three-day course before you start training you have to go and do a potential royal marines course
which is what i can only describe as a three-day bee sting where they just make you cry for three days and see who
survives it and um i got food poisoning the night before oh [ __ ]
yeah i literally threw the eye of a needle and out the mouth and i was like i'm in a [ __ ] state a real [ __ ] state like a corpse in my
bedroom and uh i remember my mum's saying again she's like why don't you get and see if
they'll move it like in that mumsy way yeah let's ask the marines if they'll move it mum i just thought
i've just got to go and i went down and i was last on every test but i managed to scrape the times but i
couldn't put my hand up and be like feel poorly like two three days into becoming a royal marine it wouldn't have
gone down well um but i passed and that for me was just
this incredible moment of i've just managed to kick my
bad drug addict habits i think i've overcome some sort of suicidal tendencies here
to now be passing a course that's going to give me the ticket to begin training with one of the
world's most elite and respected regiments and that i didn't need anyone else
around me for that one to say well done or that validation that was a look in the mirror and go nice one how did it feel when you got
that like was it a letter or an email or it's uh it was literally there on the spot you know you do the last day of the
three-day course and then they go hey you passed or they go you [ __ ] you failed off you go
and i had this letter which said uh which said uh you passed you you'll hear from your careers officers soon
you also get given this t-shirt i cringe when i think about it now but this t-shirt says potential royal
marines commander on the back yeah and when i see people wearing them now i'm like
and uh i put this t-shirt on and i was on the train just like hold it and it was freezing and i'm traveling through
i actually came back through london because i was living in milton keynes at the time and so i was on the tube just like that
no coat on just a t-shirt yeah but i was so proud of it and i trained in that t-shirt every day
and uh and then yeah i got my letter in the post saying you'll be starting on this date uh get yourself ready this is
your kit list this is what you're gonna need and that date came round but your mum was proud right yeah
yeah she was really proud i think my girlfriend was a bit confused and a bit oh there he goes off
on a journey what happens to me now um which is why i work so hard now so which i'll come on to later but you
know being stood i've been sat on that train um for day one of training
and going from milton keynes and i went up to birmingham and then i caught the birmingham all the way down to exeter
i remember looking at people on the train behind sort of newspapers and that those glum sort of mp3 playing faces
with the listening to their music looking out the window and sort of cheap suits and
you know tapping away on laptops and i thought i wonder if these people are happy i wonder if these people are
on the journey i'm about to go on and that train ride in itself was extremely
fulfilling and then the royal marines training center's got its own train line which is super scary to turn
up to and then uh yeah i pulled up sort of five hours later and there's the first instructor awaiting
you and you you walk through the gates you're carrying all your kit quite bewildered but i remember thinking
i've arrived it's crazy that you went from being i almost have this vision in my head of this young man who was
looking around for for something and finding nothing in terms of his purpose and then obviously going within himself
and using you know cocaine and other substances to try and take to try and escape and then suddenly
it's like this north star just becomes illuminated in the distance and it's this sense of orientation and direction and purpose
for your life and um and that seems to be what you know changed changed everything
obviously it takes a ton of resolve because you know the way you've described it sounded i've got to be honest even
though you had these challenges along the way between like the moment when you decided you saw that youtube video to when you
actually showed up at the training camp but it's tough for a lot of people to um
to even see the north star and then pursue it and especially when they're holding the baggage of like addiction and i
find that pretty miraculous i'm like a lot of people wouldn't be able to do even that part going from addiction and suicidal ideation to
putting on those shorts and going for that run i feel like that's that's the biggest mountain to climb right like yeah
that was uh i think that was part of the rush for me was actually just arriving at the camp
and i'd watched a documentary by chris terrell um commando on the front line and it
followed a troop through commando training which was quite it wasn't an old grainy one it was you
know a year or so before i was going to go there and i just obsessively watched this
and at the time afghan had just kicked off as well and so they were getting combat footage of
what is happening out there right now mix of this training and and i remember watching this thinking i'm going to be there soon i'm going to
be there i'm going to be there and it took you know that's a year's worth of sort of preparation and then i remember
standing in the foundation block which is where you spend your first two weeks with 60 guys i've never met before all
of us have shaved heads or just look bewildered and a little bit worried about what's next and i remember looking around thinking
this is the room they filmed that first episode in i'm in it wow and you do think like what
legends have walked through here what heroes have come through everyone comes through that door over there
and i think even that itself was a real moment of pride like i really enjoyed the first few weeks of training
and then it got quite hard to realize that all right yeah it's quite a long course and this is going to
take a lot of resolve as you say but um you know those even those initial first
few days of just excitement and looking around and just being surrounded by excellence you know
the values have written on the wall your corporals your troop sergeant your captain they wear the green barrier of
pride and they're stood there immaculately dressed i'm gonna become you one day i'm
How to find that purpose
and we're having this conversation today but something happened uh in my life yesterday in fact so this is
i think why i'm really dwelling on this point of like how you go from the youtube video to putting on that
pretty ugly gear that you found and then going for the runners i've got a very good friend of mine who
i know what miami saying this because we talk about it openly um who is going through tough times at
the moment he sounds very very similar to the guy that you described who was having those negative thoughts and was
looking for purpose in life and i'm almost searching for the advice to give him i think that's why i'm asking you the question
because he is that guy that sat in his car looking up at the sky wondering what's the point in living
what is it that takes you from that place to putting the shorts on and saying do you know what i'm going to do something for me for
once i'm going to help myself no one else is going to get me out of this situation but me that bit there feels like the hardest
mountain to climb i guess for you it was that sense of purpose and prestige and that was
you know this had been your childhood dream or like there's also this quote i sometimes ponder on which is change happens when
the pain of staying the same becomes greater than the pain of making a change like when life becomes sucks so much
that would ease it would be it would suck less to go and be beasted yeah yeah
you've got to want something that's what i looking back out having learned
everything along the way it was the desire to want something
what is it i want um and it wasn't the validation of being a tough guy at
all it was to be part of my dream you know and you think back to that nine-year-old he'd almost made his mind
up on the spot there that he's going to join the marines and that kind of got taken away and then i took it away from myself anyway
and i think almost further away it gets it becomes less tangible so when the
incident of the nightclub happens and you find yourself becoming wrapped around the wrong axle completely
you think it's getting further away i'm losing control i haven't got it i'm losing that thing i want to that that finally that day of
something that reminds you to go remember what you want to go
[ __ ] it i'm going to go and do it and you know what i found i know a lot of people like this i still have a few of them my close
friendship group um and i've worked with a lot of people like this as well
where it's actually the courage to go and do it somewhere in your friend's head he'll be
thinking something that i wanna he may look at you yeah but you're successful it's easy for
you to say it look how well you're living the dream [ __ ] you you can't give me advice and you're like oh dude come on switch
on in there somewhere is something he wants in there somewhere it's a desire
in there is a child who had an ambition for doing something
and the older we get what i found with my experience it it feels like it gets slightly further away and that gap gets bigger
and all of a sudden you've got to take a bigger step or a bigger leap but if you have that ability to go no i
do have the courage with it that that gap closes and it takes steps it takes baby steps and people think it's overnight you know
you may have found this oh you're an overnight success that's like 10 years worth of hard work you know messi says it took 15 years to
become an overnight success that's because deep down in the shadows those people which
are fighting every day the addiction the difficulty the desire to go out in the piss with our friends in the normal
world to do the drugs to eat unhealthy food whatever it is is is that fight right there to go yes
or no should i follow the easy option or should i follow the hard option and sometimes the hard option isn't the
challenge sometimes the hard options the courage you have to build within yourself to take the steps you know that
um is there anything that i could have said to you when you were in that point in your life when you were doing the drugs and having
suicidal ideation if i was your friend is there anything that i could have said to you that would have helped you get out of it
because as friends and family members we're always trying to change you know help right and i sometimes doubt the power of
a mate turn into you and being like pull your [ __ ] together you know
it it strangely happened to me so uh i won't mention his name because he's
doing sneaky beaky things these days but there's a close friend of mine what's sneaky beaky you know appearing
from curtains working for special forces okay fine and things like that right not perfect no no no no no no
yeah can't do that one again no he's not perfect that's why i won't mention his name
a friend of mine was within this lifestyle i was with him and um he decided to join the marines
and he got out of what we were embroiled in and i i remember ringing him like what's
it like what's like you know sort of inquisitive about it and he just said
come and do it and for me that was like this guiding light it was
someone within my life who actually had come away from what we'd all been doing and plucked up the courage to go and do
it and it wasn't some millionaire entrepreneur it wasn't my mum it wasn't my dad
it wasn't a really senior marine it was a friend who was probably about 15 weeks ahead of
me on the process who's not even made it himself and is still going through the hardest parts of training to say
come and do it come and give it a go you've got this and that was almost that not validation but that
boost to be like yeah all right because that's a relatable role model yeah he's just like
you yeah it's someone i know it but it's so real it's so hang on he was with us 15 weeks ago i
know him i bring him and i'm like wow okay i'm gonna i'm gonna follow in your way
which in turn becomes quite uh intimidating because you're sort of social groups looking at it going well
the marines is really hard to get in now two of them are there one of them's guaranteed to fail aren't they shortly
and i'm looking at him going wow he's stronger and tougher than i am is it me and that sort of creeps in every now and
then but it was that role model to have seen i was as you were saying that i was thinking that people will now look at
you after being in the marines for you know almost 10 years 10 years 10 years they'll see that that marine a
decade in they'll see ben and they'll think oh god i can't i can't do that he's you know like he's a big
strong man he's disciplined he's got this mindset like there'll be a kid sat in his bedroom glancing at that youtube video
of the you know the marines advert i think and then looking over at ben and thinking oh no i'm not i'm not ben he's all polished
and it's funny that it sometimes takes a relatable role model to be the bridge where you go do you know what there's a
guy that's halfway through the journey who i know and i'm like him and he's not special or smart or whatever or rich
and that can that's the the bridge that i'm gonna use to get in there myself it's one of the things when i do the podcast and when i talk about my story i
always want to let people know that the guy you see now that can talk and that can do this business stuff and no social media
was like an idiot who like got kicked out of school can't spell still can't do maths well
it's just like you but as you say maybe the defining thing was courage and that
courage came from just a delusional belief that i could this is what i talk this is why i wanted to write my book
commando mindset because i wanted to um get people thinking
that a commando mindset is a particular way of thinking within our world you know to have a hundred percent of the
command of mind say you have to become a commander you have to go through the process and join up um but everyone has to get themselves to
the gate and i become quite interested in to get into the gate part to start and who doesn't get to the gate
you know the biggest critics never stand on the start line with you they're always the ones in the stand given at the beginning aren't they it's
those on the start line who get to the gate now i got to the gate and i was really proud of getting to the
gate you know how cringe-worthy but potential royal marines commando yes at least i'm a potential royal
marines commander instead of a potential civilian which i don't want to be for now i want to go and live and
enjoy the world in different parts of it um some you wouldn't go to holiday on but um i
wanted to go and see it and that that for me was a really interesting point and you know
fast forward many years later i managed to get the prestigious job of going back to the commander training center as an
instructor and get to see those people get to the start line and see them go on their journey and
listen to their stories you know you're a bit of a tough guy over them at times but listen to their stories and hear them say that they had drug
problems and this happened within their family and or this person lived on the street for this long
but now you're in my world and i'm going to try and take you from what you were and turn you into
something that we need you to be but you have the ability to be as well
and that process seeing them go from civilian to commando and that's really empowering
because i get to stand there on the last day of training when they finally do it and you can finally call them mate
when uh you know it's a bit hard up to that point it's like good effort mate and you have a beer of
them and you tell them a little bit about your story they go whoa i thought you were like
this sort of thing yeah untouchable [ __ ] just yeah yeah yeah that's it yeah yeah pretty much
but instead they realize you're a human what is the commander mindset are there principles to it what's the philosophy you know you talk about it
What the commando mindset?
being something that we can all sort of reflect on in our own lives we can all have that command in mindset i
guess in the home or in work what other what is the commanding mindset and well we have an ethos that was the sort
of thing that first jumped out at me when i got there and we have values and the values is
pretty much what makes us courage courage determination excellence self-discipline integrity
cheerfulness and humility and um these words they're very human words
aren't they they're very you could put that in almost any walk of life and i think people can acknowledge it and go
courage yeah excellence i have a bit of that integrity is the biggest one we say integrity in the marines is your
virginity you can only lose it once and so when you have that way of thinking and you have that ethos amongst
your peer group and your leadership group um you know most of the time what's coming
out of people's mouths is true and that whether that's moral courage to say we're the same rank
and you've got stop swearing nests and you've got to take your hands out your pocket and you know let's set an example for
people who are below us um to even you know being able to say that to a senior commander
like oh should we have rounds in our pockets right now sir but it's this ethos within us that enables a
particular way of thinking and it's when you're in the most extreme circumstances when
bullets are coming at you i remember my first ever combat engagement
i was we're in a quite a large patrol of 12 and we've been on the we'd flown into an
area in the green zone and told the taliban are here you're just gonna have to go and find them which is like finding a needle in the
haystack sometimes and we were on the ground for about four hours and we always take an interpreter with
us and they have a radio that intercepts taliban frequencies so they can actually hear what the taliban are saying
and it was the first time i think i heard the taliban as well you hear these voices and it's quite squiggly over the net you
can't really hear it properly but you just think that's our foes that's
oh [ __ ] they can see us as well where are they and they said uh we can see and we can see them
they're heading towards the melon now they're heading towards the melons was their code word for um ied improvised explosive device a
homemade bomb so the taliban is saying across the radio that they can see you they're talking to one another saying
they can see us and that we're heading towards the bomb they've planted and you start thinking well maybe
they're trying to egg us on maybe it's not real we went into this farmer's compound and we stayed in there for about half an
hour to gain our breath and have some water and then they came back on so they've gone in person they said his name as well
they've gone in his compound we'll pay him a visit later we'll get him on the way out so you're
looking at the poor farmer thinking you're getting a knock on the door like you don't need but also
we're in the safety of this small compound that we're gonna step out back into the open soon and they're gonna they're gonna see
us and we stepped out the open [Music] and straight away we can see him again
we can see him again and you again you kind of are they trying to pull our bluff because they
know we can hear them they know they know we listen to them um you kind of take it sometimes with a pinch of
salt but you have to take it seriously but then we had assets in the sky which was a drone
saying that it can see fighting males coming towards us all carrying weapons and then moving down this street and
that was like okay this is actually real and we hadn't been hit by this point in the tour
and this was about to get very very real and your whole everything changes you know the
adrenaline's quite the adrenaline's high but it's controlled you've got control and you think i know
how to deal with this stay focused and we came up to a ditch which
there was it's almost like a t-junction ditch where one met another and then to cross it it was probably
about four foot deep and then you had to pull one another out of it and you get onto a track and then there
was a wall and the track sort of went left and right from us and about three of us got out the ditch
got onto the track and then just a hail of bullets came flying down the track and they all spat off the wall and off
the floor and off the trees around us and what you're taught to do when you're shot at
you're taught to do something called rtr which is return fire whether that's from the hip shoulder whatever just spray in
a direction take cover return accurate fire rtr
i nose dived into the ditch don't blame you yeah like quickly as
well and just completely flopped into the water my kit's probably wearing about 100
pounds so i've just gone straight to the bottom of the ditch and i'm beneath the surface and you can hear the thumps overhead like
a split second you're underwater split second but it's long enough to go ah that
wasn't the right thing to do that i've just done everything against what i do in training and what i've been
taught to do you panicked right yeah massively like oh [ __ ] someone's shooting us what do we do jump in the ditch that seems
like the cleverest thing to do and jumped in ditch and i remember this thought coming through my head
going oh you [ __ ] up big time there get out the ditch and i in that second came up out of the
water and noticed everyone had done the same thing so i was like right mark dodged that one
um and the way we were looking was down the track so everyone sort of looking across each other down down the ditch and down the track and
there was one person still on on the track returning fire on his own stood up
literally you couldn't make it up it was it looked like that sort of call of duty image where he's just firing away on the
track and it was our commander vicey um
and he just looked over all of us in the ditch and went check your [ __ ] flashes
and that is this internal system which just goes like that because your flashes are
what you wear on your shoulder and it says the words raw marines commando and everything those three
words mean is related to the ethos related to our values related to those 32 weeks
training related to every person that's died for those flashes and we're all hiding and he doesn't need
to say get out the ditch come on on the track or anything like that he just screams check your [ __ ]
flashes and that's your reminder to go oh i need to switch on and be a marine here
as opposed to hide cowardly in the ditch and then we go out and you get into the fight
and that's what the mindset the mindset isn't necessarily just down to skill and ability it's that ability to tap into what
you're programmed to do what your dna is what your value system is have courage have excellence have determination all
these things that were just words up to that point have true meaning for you to get into the
fight whether you lose your life in the moment or not you're there to do a job and that's what it looks like
and those values as you describe them go back through that list again courage one of them was joyful not just
cheerfulness in the face of adversity why is that so important that's the one that struck me the most i was like that sounds like smiling
if you uh if you don't laugh at it or laugh at you and i i can't i've lost count the amount
of times where i've been soaked in mud i'm absolutely hanging out and you know
a domino's pizza and being at home and going miss and you look over to the right and all you can see through this
this muddy face is his teeth someone else looking back at you and you just go
and you giggle and you know this is [ __ ] isn't it yeah let's get on with it because if you don't laugh at situations
that get tough it is going to laugh at you and the moment it starts to laugh at you you're going to begin to suffer now it's
not in the case of when people lose lives you're stood over there going ah having a giggle but it is those moments
of extreme warfare where rounds are pinging off the wall in front of you and you look at one another and go [ __ ] you know that was close wasn't it
and you have the ability to laugh at situations maybe other people wouldn't laugh at cheerfulness in the face of adversity is
is what we all need i've been saying it to people all last year and this year you know this is [ __ ] what we're going through
but if you don't smile in some way or another and find that sort of courage to have a bit of morale within yourself it's going to laugh at
you that's where your mental health starts to take a knock that's where you start to have that
sort of negative downward spiral and that was something i never had before the marines the ability to laugh at difficulty
and the marines encourages it out of you what the other words again so cheerfulness
courage determination determination excellence talk to me about excellence why that's
so important because i know from the i've got to be honest i i feel like i've watched every
documentary ever on like the sas and the marines and um the other special forces across
different countries i i got so obsessed you know when i was younger and one of the things that you see in
training is this obsession with the the soup you know your uniform being clean and your gun being clean and
things being in order and it seems like from my outside perspective they're like training excellence and organization into you is
that is that why they use the word excellence in your flashes um you can never achieve perfection
everyone looks at the military as in they're perfect everything's shiny everything's ironed everything's clean
but it's not perfect if you if you think you've got perfection you've hit arrogance or you've let your standards
down because excellence is that ability to continuously keep striving
towards something um my corporate training said if you do not put 0.1 better every day at least you're
heading in the right direction and his way of looking at that was you could have the worst day ever you could fail every test
but if you do something extra that day that just boosts that 0.1 at least you're making a little bit of a
more positive impact on that day than maybe yesterday you can always strive and that word excellence
is is embellished in that it's a it's the ability to say i can never achieve perfection
but as long as i strive to do my best effort that's what excellence really means that the the ability to strive to put in your
maximum effort on everything you do you could be the slowest guy in the troop and not be able to keep up with everyone
but if you are hanging out i always just said to my recruits i don't want to see you just giving me
the face for the sake of it i want to see your face that you are fully inserted in the locker then i know you're giving me the best
effort because they're striving for excellence they're striving to just be the best they can be
do we do enough of that we do in the military and that perfection doesn't exist you
can't aim for perfection you have to aim for something a little bit more tangible you have to aim for something that
does exist and what does exist is the ability to keep doing it at a high standard how do you
Why âits taking part that countsâ doesnât work
in our culture at the moment there's a narrative emerging which is like at least you did your bet you know there's a kind of a fluffy soft
so you hate it i can see it in your face yes it's kind of like fluffy soft it's okay that you're not that good at least you know take rest well you
know good is a good good is fine which is kind of infiltrating our culture in a very pc almost in my opinion toxic way if i post
this on instagram as i've said before i'll get like cancelled because people that sense of like doing less
than your best and being negative seems to be comforting for people in a way that keeps their
self-esteem and ego smothered with cotton wool so that they don't have to take personal
responsibility i can see you're very pissed off good go ahead
yeah this podcast is over um my lad took part in so i have a boy
zach he's seven and i have layla who's three going on 18. and uh he won a race
in sports day and i was like the marine dad on the edge and they're like godzilla you got this and he's flying
down and he's miles ahead of everyone else it's like yes and he crosses the line i'm like
yeah and he comes running over and he's got this massive grin on his face and he's got a big sticker
winner and there's another sticker next to it participator and uh i looked it and
instantly in my head i tweaked and i thought rip it off okay good are they handing out them ones are they
and um he went i won hold on when he's over over the moon and my wife and i were like well mate
it's amazing and uh he went why did everyone else get sticker
and he was pissed off and i was like and i could i can almost hear the parents around me
i could hear their ears turn towards me like oh how's this parent gonna approach this one
and i did think in my head i was like shall i go down there well it's good that everyone had to go and everyone took part
and then this kind of the stoic commander went [ __ ] that i went listen here no one else should
have got another badge right you're the one who earned that that's the reason you've got that winner's badge don't worry about that
participation meter what i want you to always strive just do your best every time and you can win the race like you
did today don't worry about everyone else and he was like yeah but why do and it kind of the conversation went off in child
language sure um but why do they get a sticker though dad and like kind of looking around again at the
parents i don't know i've not worked this one
out yeah but i did i wanted to let him know that that there was that parent in me there's almost those two voices to go
go along with it because other people are listening and this is now the new cultural thing to do of just praise
effort and sorry praise taking part over anything else or let my son you know one of the
marines values his integrity i'll let him know what i truly think of it i don't agree that they're handing
out those stickers mate you won you won the race and you deserve that one make sure you do that every time
and he likes that people will listen to that and they'll think some people might think oh you're toxic that's yeah those yeah pushy parents and
you're training your kid to you know he'll end up like michael jackson changing the color risk or whatever like but if we look at the importance of
purpose and forward motion and orientation i think that removing accomplishment
removing north stars and just saying nothing's an all-star and everything's a north star is actually really really dangerous
because then if we don't have things to strive for if there's no winner if there's no accomplishment if there's no
mountaintops then again we lose our orientation and that for me is where people get depressed and have opioid addictions and then they end up
killing themselves or you know whatever else it's also it's also maintaining a
standard for not what i expect of my child i want him to put the effort in if if he
doesn't want to put the effort in he won't put the effort in um and he will either go through a
process in life like i did or he won't and he may look at my life lessons and others around him and go we're not going
to do that i'm going to do this i run a business you've run a business if your staff
or employees sorry turned up i'm like i'm just here to you know get paid and nine to five
hit five and i'll go home you know that turning up attitude what what does that do for the culture of
that business you know you have too many of those people within your environment your business is a car crash waiting to happen
you know it is the people within it or your friendship group your friendship group oh just you know see what happened i'll just turn up
you know the just turning up attitude is what we're encouraging when we say well done everyone for taking part in this
race today you know i i personally think you you reward the top two
and and the one who's putting in maximum effort who came in last give him or her something as well you know well done that's a good effort
we had um another cake yeah yeah i didn't want to say you said it before
um i don't care about being canceled at this point yeah you're not cancelled my episode
but it's it is that it's if if we almost reward this participation
now that's all you get rewarded as the winner gets as much as the loser gets and everyone in between gets rewarded
this participation we are encouraging this just turn up just all you have to do is just turn up
and you get praise you win you know it's what simon sinek talks about this kind of entitlement where does it come from
well you just turn up you know you get everything everyone else gets anyway no like
you and i people who've had to work hard fight hard the reason the green beret is
so well respected is because it's so [ __ ] hard to achieve the moment they drop the standard
you know it's not going to be the value that it is at the moment maybe that will happen maybe society
will push it through i know training was very different to when i actually took recruits through training you know i
have seen that difference in culture society is having an impact on that we
are rewarding people for just turning up simply just turning up and that to me is
it's not we're not breeding this michael jordan attitude we just want you
to come and give your best effort the excellence turn up and strive don't just turn up and tick boxes that's
a big thing that i took away from the military is do not tick boxes you know you can get your report we were always
encouraged with our reports to be way better on it you know don't just you know well done you've done everything
you need to do in these couple of months it's good after you've done all this and this that's what we look for it's funny
because people just her state of mind and the kind of soft fluffy cultural
narrative that's kind of breaking through especially on like social media i think is designed to try and protect
your mental health but i think that the argument we're saying is it it actually has the adverse effect because it takes away that sense of like
striving and accomplishment which is so clearly important for people to live fulfilled lives and uh it goes back to
the point i made about you know chaos being stability and stability being chaos if if even in my industry there was no
competition there was no podium there was no nothing to aim for my life would descend
into some form of like probably some form of depression because i would have no there would be a purpose
and although you know the mountaintop or the podium actually isn't the moment of purpose the journey is like the
striving the training the whatever it's important to have it there um and i i'm glad we had that conversation
because i think a lot of people don't melons you mentioned the word melons earlier on
the taliban talking about they planted their melons so i heard that it was in fact one of those melons one of those ieds
that took you out of the military yeah it was the catalyst for sort of end of my career
um i've got something really exciting to share with you last week as many of you might have seen
in the press it was announced that i would be joining the board of huel and for you guys that
know me well and know how much i drink you all and how much it's been a key part of my life and running my business and staying healthy
will know why this is exciting to me because it's a product that i absolutely love and the reason why they sponsored the podcast in the first place was because
when i knew that i was going to be bringing it back and investing in the you know the the production of the podcast and the team i wanted a partner
who i could talk about authentically without having to [ __ ] you and heal is that partner so i reached
out to huell and said listen i'm starting my podcast um up again and i'd love you to be the sponsor of it and so as i've got closer
and closer to julian some of you all know he actually came onto this podcast and he will be coming back on in the future um we realized that there was a lot
professionally we could do together and upon leaving social chain i got a ton of offers to join boards to
join companies to be an advisor a consultant you can imagine what my inbox looked like immediately after the announcement and i said no to
everything i'm a firm believer in rejecting good and the whole doubt for grey and when julian had the
conversation with me i said yes to joining hughes board in less than a
second i knew what he was gonna end the sentence with so i said yes before he ended it and um i've started working with the
team now on products on their comms on the wider business on the brand everything and it's amazing i absolutely love it so
what started as a little podcast sponsorship what started as a conversation with a remarkable entrepreneur and julian has now become a
more formalized relationship and i'm a board member of huel and i think it's important to be honest with you about that because
when you hear me talking about it now you know that i'm actually in the building so yeah just wanted to share that with all of you back to the podcast
you mentioned the word melons earlier on the taliban talking about they planted their melons i heard that it was in fact
The thing that ended my time in the Military
one of those melons one of those ieds that took you out of the military yeah i was the catalyst for sort of end
of my career um yeah we we were deployed on an operation around
three or four weeks before the end of this particular tour in 2011 um
and yeah it was called the hornets nest it was just an area i've heard that before yeah it's not
it's not nice when your commanders say you're heading into the hornet's nest and when they follow that up with we're
going to go and hit the nest okay all right good luck i'll see you okay postcards
now um but it it the idea was to go in and disrupt the taliban an area they
thought they were untouchable within and we knew it was going to be heavily contested and they had the civilians
on hand there they they had it all and it was really deep in the green zone as well which i think this is sort of
end of august beginning of september so the crops are at seven eight foot um the tree lines are sort of every
hundred meters and the trees are very high it's just a really difficult place to operate in it's like a jungle in the desert and
then we landed on the americans gave us a lift in the morning dropped onto target
and within about four or five hours we'd had um five guys taken out the game already
by a grenade which came into the compound and just detonated at their feet taken out of the game yeah so injured
and put back on stretchers and put straight back on the helicopters um we then took
attack well we started to receive an attack from three different angles um so they were firing us from the
bearings right north west and south um and there were firings from two different angles from a distance to
distract us from an attack which was coming in from this third angle which was to sneak up to the gate
and try and get into the compound so we were sort of really trying to fend off and and this
came sort of every half an hour it would just pick up and then it'd drop off and move scrapping all day it got to the point
that if you weren't on the roof fighting you were trying to get your head down to get some sleep and then ready yourself
to go up and things would explode and you'd wait wait for a scream or wait for something
and then the firearm has started going oh everyone's alright just carry on it was just the most surreal situation
um and we ended up fighting with the enemy pretty much all day that day and then we needed to push patrol out in
the morning and that morning that morning just had this weird feeling about it you know the day before
five guys had been blown up by a grenade you know covered in frag um we'd had some injured civilians come
in it was just just quite a chaotic day the taliban had got right up close to the gates and we've managed to push them
back and kill a few and it just kind of leaves you the feeling the next day thinking oh we've
got another six days of this seven day operation another six days of this um you know
that first day we were there it got that bad that mortifier was getting called in over us landing literally 50 meters in front of
the compound to stop them advancing on our position and that's frightening that's you know you're close to that sort of hand-hand
combat and um the next day i remember waking up thinking i didn't have a great night's
sleep you don't really get good night's sleep out there and this really weird thing happened i i was sort
of messing around with the some ornaments which were on a shelf you know just like being a nosy sort of
brit having a look around this compound and i ended up flicking this sort of like weird dish thing it had a
car battery like just a half a car battery in it and i poured it and it had all the acid in it and it
leaked onto my head and then onto my face and then onto my body i was like oh my god i've got battery acid on me and i even
said to myself i was a bad omen for the day isn't it um and there was just these like weird
tiny little events that happened and i think they only seem weird now because i look back and like because there was
an incident and um one of uh one of the marines uh darlow luke
he um we usually rotate on patrol so on one patrol he would go at the
front or second from the front because of the weapons we carried um i carried a light machine gun which
is um you know it's between the we have two machine guns we have the gpmg and then
we have the lmg and the lmg's slightly smaller and i had the lmg and so you go that second person to
cover the first person who's a rifleman who is literally with a metal detector looking for the bombs so
you're there on their shoulder and you work as a pair and it was actually my turn to go in the
middle of the patrol and it was luke's turn to go up to the front and
neither position really is any skin off your nose i was like doing a swap today and he's like now stay where i am i'll
go jordan up the front and we came out the compound and literally straight away
into a ditch and then into a cornfield and we kind of navigated our way through the cornfield and the idea was to get up
to this village was which is probably about 200 meters from our sort of um base i suppose you could call
it an occupied compound um and we just wanted to get in there and talk to some of the locals and
see what the problem is with the taliban and where they are and see what intelligence we can get out of them and i i was a jordan at the front and with
us was a dog handler and we had the dog handler because they sniffed the bombs and we came to the edge of the cornfield
and there was just no one around call it atmospherics so positive atmospheric
women and children out in the streets farmers in the fields you know normal life pattern of life happening
there was no one nothing like literally you had the tumbleweed going down the street
um and i looked over my shoulder and you could feel it we call it spidey senses it's when you know your skin and your hair so it starts to
stand up on your neck and you could just sense it after yesterday's fighting
no villagers around they're here the taliban are here it's just where are they um i looked over my shoulder and vicey
was behind me my commander it was just like yeah push up the track let's go and we came out onto the track and began
walking up towards where we needed to be very slow pace you know you're checking for these bombs in the ground
and a tractor appeared in front of us probably about 20 minutes 20 meters to our front
and this this farmer just looked at us and he must have just seen load of marines suddenly stood there in
the street and just we were like thresh you know stop and he just like
floored the tractor as much as he could it kind of just chugged off and he disappeared and it just it just all felt a bit weird
and we got nearer to this um we literally come up to this crossroads and myself jordan the dog handle were on
top of the crossroads now or just just slightly just before jordan was on it and i was just slightly back from it
and these two guys walked around the corner dressed in full black trainers on which is a massive indicator
for taliban they used to wear trainers where most of the people just wore flip-flops and these trainers for obvious reasons getting around quicker
and they would just stood there as you are to me in front of us and it was like [ __ ] out and
you couldn't do anything like they're not armed they just stood there looking at you and they're as wide-eyed as you are and
you think this is taliban and then they just bolted literally just ran straight from us as we're like stop
stop and they ran to our right behind us a short wall but into the
field and you could hear him like traveling through the field like the snapping of the corn and everything and why the [ __ ] are
they just running to the field why didn't they run down the track or just stop and all this is starting to go in your head and i turned around and looked at
vice and he went [ __ ] run now and we'd start to run and we'd we must have taken two three steps and
the wall next to us just obliterated and this this plume just
covered us all like i've never heard anything that loud i've been around a few loud things
but it was so close and i remember this something hit me in the back of the head
um which my helmet must have deflected and then something went through my leg and i just felt like this almighty pain
in my leg and but i was still stood there and i don't mean that heroically like shrugged off a bomb it was just a shock
of it everything just went through you all the rubble um all the um frag
fragmentations to the shards of metal just just went through your bags helmet everything and the pain in my leg was enough for me
to like scream out in agony and then drop to the floor and the way i dropped
i actually ended up sitting on my foot so my injured leg had come back under me and i had this right leg
out to the front i smile because it was mildly amusing when i look back on it
but all this you know your ears are ringing you can't hear it you just hear that sort of muffled sudden sound um
you can smell the core diet you can smell horrible things you know when you come
to terms with what happens next i remember looking down thinking oh it's [ __ ] me and i was screaming i've lost
my leg i've lost my leg because i just i was concussed i had the pain here i
couldn't see it there's lots of smoke and dust everywhere and [ __ ] i've lost my leg i had this moment sat literally must be 30 seconds
long sat there on the floor thinking [ __ ] i've lost my [ __ ] leg where is it for a start um and then it was like this weird
sensation of like my foot trying to come back round underneath me and it and then i was like oh [ __ ] sat on it i'm sat on my foot
i sat on my foot and i did look down and there was blood all down my legs but my foot was there my leg was there it
was all intact and you check other bits which are quite required for a man and i was like all
right it's all there and you do have those really surreal moments it's a real thing where people check themselves
and i was like [ __ ] but then it real then you realize you're on patrol and there's other people on that patrol
and there's 12 of us out on the ground right now and that thing which just happened was very very close
and it was almost at the moment i turned around that the the orange dusty smoke was clear in that
everyone was lying on the floor uh three of which were just out cold completely
and it was just this stark realization like [ __ ] we've been hit hard there and the
wall had this little small wall which obviously the device was hid behind you know you quite quick quickly know
what's happened as they've planted a device behind the wall which is facing the path
and they've run into the field at the end of a wire and just connected the battery and it's detonated on our patrol and
what it is is called directional fragmentation so it sprays across the patrol instead of coming up from under the ground
and everyone had been hit everyone and behind me was my corporal vicey out
blood coming from his neck blood everywhere kit weapons clothes just ripped to pieces
and you just think [ __ ] and there's no one else around like it's just you guys on the track and most of them are lying
unconscious on the floor and i started thinking i thought to myself i've got to get to vicey
so i started crawling i was in utter agony as well i just knew i had to get to him and as i
was getting nearer i could see that he'd been struck in the neck and it was doing as you would see on casualty
coming out at an angle and you'd i've been in these moments before i've been around people
which lost legs have been there for people which have been injured but there was people left and right
you know there was your team were there on this occasion everyone's just [ __ ] out cold and as i was just getting to visey a
marine came sprinting up the track from right at the bottom and just jumped onto his neck like with
his knee literally jumped onto his neck and just lent into him and he started shouting at me going get your [ __ ]
kit out now get your kit out and so i started fiddling around for my medical care and what we were trying to
get out was this thing called hemclot which is like um it's like a bandage
but it's uh it basically you stuff it into a wound and it expands um and i needed to get my henclot out
but you have to throw it's like this technique that you take out throw it over your shoulder so it doesn't get caught in the dust
and you have to keep it over your back so you can then put it in but you're not packing all the [ __ ] in around them
and uh he's like get your [ __ ] head glow out now and he's now obviously removed his knee from his
neck and he's got his fingers in the wound and he's trying to hold on and so i remember looking at her thinking he's
trying to hold on to his artery there and he's trying to pinch his artery going stop [ __ ] looking start putting it in there i was trying to do it and he grabbed it
off me went i'll do it hold that and then you're there like [ __ ] now i'm holding it literally
pinching it together going don't go don't go don't go and then the medic came up from the back and barged me out of the way and
start started treating him on the spot um and all i could do was just hold his hand and was just like pray for your
kids stay few kids stay with us stay with us and i just sort of 45 minutes flashed by
and we were on the helicopters and we're back at kambastian and they were going through triage and
i don't know miraculously they're still with us today um vice lost his leg in that moment as
well which is unfortunate darlow who i was meant to swap with took fragmentation through the temple
and is now disabled because of it but he's still with us and uh it's still great fun to be around
still marine at heart definitely and a few other lads taking it in the throat
all over their bodies and you kind of we meet up every now and then you know not so much now but we meet up we call it
the bangiversary and you look at these kind of reprobates which are still just got scars all over
them and you share the stories and you take the piss out of one another and vice always says to me he's like you
were crying when i was dying when you know i was like yeah [ __ ] was but it's
it's a part of that journey you know and it was a real intense moment but um
we signed the dotted lines we put ourselves in that position and um that's what happens in war at some
point you decide that you can leave or you would discharge medically or yeah it was um
i was discharged because of my hearing and it was something i'd hid from that day i knew my hearing had been affected but
the way the sort of hearing tests work in the military you can kind of blag it you press it every three seconds and it'll
it'll look roughly like you can hear it and i could never hear properly in my left ear and they changed the test uh several
years later and i got caught out trying to blag it and the doctor was like what are you doing
hearing test yeah stop doing the three second rule all right do it properly and did it
properly and then it was like you can't hear any left ear can you i was like i can hear something then let's have a chat and yeah we
sort of that was the ball rolling between being elite military to leaving the forces
not easy to leave as they say life change is very different yeah have something to aim for that's
what i decided this moment they told me i think i'd been up threw enough stuff up to that point to go okay this is what happens now
adversity strikes you've got to work out how to get through it um i i had a
i had this ability to coach people like that's what i did with my young marines and then when i worked with the
rehabilitation troops as well i thought i could do something outside here and
fortunately as i was sort of in my year of discharged gareth southgate brought his motley crew
down to meet us at the commando training center and i got to meet some pretty cool characters within the england football team before they went to the
Falling back into my old ways
world cup and that's where i realized that no this commander mindset thing can actually be transitioned and help people way away
from the military how do i do this but between that gap of leaving and you know starting your next sort of
chapter i was reading that you had you suffered with ptsd and you were you know because it would be
conceivable that someone would then fall back into the old patterns right like losing your purpose again and
then like losing your sense of orientation and was that a i think i had that
relapse or i know i had that relapse actually not long after afghanistan and i think
this sort of trauma you go through the way you may handle it
and what you've seen and all these things it's it's hard to get your head around is
really hard especially when you come home so quickly it's like bang explosion you're back in the uk i remember being at um
the queen elizabeth hospital up in birmingham and it had been 36 hours since we
triggered well since the taliban triggered the device on us you know literally two days ago we're fighting them
coming up to our doorway and then i was sending this sort of crisp white sheet bed white sheet bed looking
out over birmingham and my mum came in you know this woman who i admire so much and i didn't want to
speak to her i was like i don't want to speak to you i want to speak to you i want to speak to you i don't speak to anyone leave me alone because
i was still an afghan and i genuinely think even to this day
a part of me still stayed there and i could never get my head around it so when i when i
you know rehabbed and i was fit and i could go back to the unit i would drink a fight
i ended up getting court-martialed and i was suddenly spiraling back towards
that bend before the royal marines you know using that violent way of being and taking a
substance to sort of numb the pain which in this case was drink and again it was this ah back at square
one done this career all right just i've just fought for my country and now i've got to go and stand in
front of the judge which ironically was over an incident now i was defending someone else for when someone pulled a
knife out you know it was just it kind of felt like really i'm actually trying to do something good here and i'm
getting punished for it but that's uh maybe the naive way of looking at it but it it was
a difficult moment i had to begin to process what happened in afghan and it's it was just another moment of processing
as we keep almost coming back to is how we process stuff and afghan was tough you know we lost people
we we lost lives we lost people lost limbs a lot of people lost limbs there was this constant
battle in your head because of the ied threat you can never see him so you would walk out on the ground and think i wonder
where i'm gonna put my foot today and that that's like seven hours long every day that that has its toll on you like
constantly looking like that everywhere you go i remember when my then fiance we moved
into the flat together i was really mad at her for the way she stacked the bean cupboards i was like
what the [ __ ] aren't they facing the same way for and she was like why are you being like this they need to because then when you go to
say because you've got nothing for that because they just [ __ ] do it and now that's me
still like packing my kit regimently at the end of my bed what if we get attacked we need to be good to go
um and it's it's so hard to they call it decompression it's so hard
to decompress from that and you feel so pent and i remember coming back thinking
no one respects us like it seemed like the civilian world didn't care the london riots were happening
you know i can't even get it right on our own shores let alone trying to help other people out and you just felt forgotten and it wasn't you who felt forgotten you
felt the lives had been forgotten and everything which isn't the case you you know i meet so many people now it's like
wow that's amazing to me thank you so much for what you've done for the country and you get to this humble point now we're like yeah
thanks i signed the dotted line i'm so pleased you appreciate it um but back then it was this kind of
bitterness of why don't you care i've just done this why don't you care
and it took me about a year to get through that and i i look back now and think i think that's actually quite natural
for a lot of the marines that they went through and soldiers and then i got that turning point of
picking up my leadership courses to then go and work with recruits and that was it for me i was like even though i was dodging and
weaving the hearing tests i get to invest something back now and i get to
make the next breed of marines come through and that became your new sense of purpose right that was yeah and it's such a
valuable thing for me to do um we ended up moving the fam well my wife moved down pregnant we had zach
down there we made a life and i really felt like it was just it was
just brilliant to be part of their journey and see them progress and that's what the purpose became it was seeing people go from a to b
and being part of their journey to say i believe in you you need to believe in yourself and you
see them progress and even that comes to the england football teams like you can do this if you put your mind to
it and they got that close very close let's talk about that then so where is gareth southgate and you ending
up sort of working with the england football team just before they went off to uh russia yeah russia yeah yeah um
Working with the England football team
[Music] they came they came down to get a taste of our world that's how i was literally put
and the idea that they would come down and be immersed in some activities that we do they do some
of our assault courses but they'd also be introduced to the mindset that's what gareth wanted to do
most and he wanted to introduce them to our values again that was a really important part of their whole trip was
to know what courage looks like what does excellence looks like self-discipline humility integrity all
those words and um it was it was very surreal
you know i felt like a giddy kid most the time you know knowing that they're in the buses they're almost at the
training era we were we were up in one of the woods that we trained in and there was
me and four other corporals five other corporals and our sergeant and you could see the bus turning up and
we were like oh they're coming literally like we were like that like then you had a tough guy yeah that was it yeah troop sergeant was like when
they come over that wall don't forget like you gotta put it all on though boys all right yeah roger no worries taff laughing and
then harry kane appeared first and we were like like staring him down and then i just
remember tafar sergeant just went why are you staring at kane and just started bellowing at
him and get on your kit then and then we all jumped in oh god then south gate start moving
and um it was brilliant you've thrown that for a little while but actually they're there to understand
you and that's not actually who we are um i was you know surreal moment one o'clock in the morning drinking
or sharing a cup of tea with harry over a little fire talking about uh what it's like to score
in front of 80 000 people what's it like to wheel away and you turned into a fanboy yeah
massively and even when i was asking i was like ah don't ask the question but you know what he answered it in a way
that it wasn't to the fans it wasn't to the press he genuinely answered it which i've you
could hear it was like there's nothing like it you know the way you just the way you just expressed it
and so you can see him staring at the floor a bit as he's saying it as he's thinking about those moments yeah he's visualizing and so yeah that
was amazing and but then he asks you is like you know what's warfare like um
and again that sort of stumps you a little bit like wow the england captain's just asked me what it's like in afghan
you have this conversation it was just so normal it got that normal that i started moaning to him about
holiday prices because i just paid for the family to go to lanzarote on an all-inclusive and i was like and
then and in holiday prices through the roof at the moment i just paid three grand today
and then i'm thinking he's just got that from dubai he's probably just done all these things but he was so humble with it and it was
a really genuine organic conversation and we found that with a lot of the guys and girls which came you know they
bought the whole set up with them kit man to gary southgate and everyone in between
and they just wanted to see our world and see what values mean when you're going through different things you know when you're in
the mud and water it's very easy to be in that position and feel like oh this is [ __ ] but when someone's going
this is what courage looks like this is what this looks like this was what this looks like you know
it helps frame it in a different way and it helps show you what your ability is what you can do what what that meaning
of that word is and that was something that we kind of encouraged them to take to the world cup
and i think they did i think they did and there's been a lot of press around it as
well so yeah they did well would have been awesome i i've read one of your uh
your podcast all your interviews whatever where you said um had they beaten i think it was croatia
wasn't it you were set to go on pierce morgan's show the next day and explain yeah exactly how you how you helped them get
there but then they lost we had a focus literally yeah so i'm cheering going come on england
we're made after this come on yeah yeah yeah it's a hard time um but it didn't happen
but hey you know later i think it was january 19 i went and did the keynote for gareth at
the football writers awards at the savoy and i did mention and and i know a lot of people phrased it
but there was an element of pride to be part of that journey and say you know they didn't bring the
trophy home but they definitely bought football home and i think it's really unfortunate that we didn't have it this year you know
that oh gosh they were last year so much whatever it's meant to be last year wasn't it
2020 it was yeah some wasn't yeah yeah it's almost 20 20 euros yeah so but it i thought i thought it brought
the nation a little bit closer personally you the other thing i was intrigued by was i read this i think it's a
r a um sort of strategy per se which um you've adopted to help you deal with
Your ARA strategy
difficult situations could you could you explain that a little bit yeah so
ara was almost kind of made up on the spot when i was trying to think of some things to deliver to people
and and i've written ara's quite a focus within my book because we all encounter adversity we all
encounter challenge and one of the biggest things i've noticed with myself and then when you look at it objectively
with other people when people encounter adversity there's almost that fight flight or freeze mode people go
into there's oh i'm going to take this on or i'm going to bail out and hide in the ditch or i'm just going to stand there
and there's a lot of research around most of us actually freeze we just don't know what to do um
and for me going through a lot of experiences you know where i really go back to is
when we lost our first person in battle d we lost eno and we lost dina within five minutes of the 24 hour operation we
literally ran off the back of the helicopters at sort of 4 30 in the morning we were going to take a village
and helicopters went trooper crossing the ditch to get into the village stepped on an ied
blew him up and he was gone um and he died there and then on the spot
and two of the other guys were injured severely with him as well and you just i've used it a lot within football i call it three nil down within one minute
and it's that moment of wow we're on the ropes already we've
only just started this thing we're on the ropes how do we deal with it what do we do and i remember you know these
incredible emotions go through you when someone gets killed you know you feel anger you feel rage you feel you want to cry
you do you want to just take a knee and look at the floor and go i can't believe he's dead let's mourn it right now
but you've got 16 17 quite hungry taliban on the other side of the wall who want to kill you as well
and the worst thing you can ever do is is go into a village or an area such as that
emotionally charged if you go in emotionally charged you're going to make cataclysmic errors
that could be that you're so sad or overwhelmed that you're not concentrating you miss that person in
the corner they then take you or someone else out or you go in there angry and when you go and they're angry
you make serious mistakes and you don't have to look far and oppressed to see that happened and that happened on our
tour um and that emotion gets in the way of dealing with the situation and what i
like to more frame as thinking with clarity it's so hard to think with clarity during adversity and that's
why i spent quite a bit of time thinking well what is a quick framework we can just jump to what have i used
an ara simply stands for accept remove adapt the moment something happens then
on the spot it's happened and then it's instantly gone so someone dying on the spot
in combat is there's nothing you can do about it there's nothing you can do about it the most
effective thing you can do is be it your highest standard strive for excellence get up on that roof and do what you need
to do to the people which have hurt your comrade that's that's that's how you should be posting it what is still
the strategic operational part of what we're doing here and
the the accept part is very difficult for a lot of people to do it's very and i still struggle with it
now myself but actually having that little framework to go alright okay this isn't good how do i
accept the situation has happened or happening how can i process it and without dwelling on blame or exactly
or you know or bitterness is there another one like say your business is shut down because of
kovid you're angry at boris johnson you're angry at everybody and you dwell on that so that's the first hurdle is as you say
accepting which is tough tough but it's a mindset you know
this isn't for me this is not something we should shy away from you know the moment say it's tough does that then allow people
to go well i'm not doing it then just i'll just turn up sympathy can sometimes show up as well too much sympathy maybe
a victimhood the except is it's happened what is the next move what is the next thing i need to do
um we lost almost all of our work with our business last year we we were working in talks and coaching
and doing workshops overnight gone like i could have sat there which i did for about half a day going
oh what the [ __ ] where's that all gone but you can't how long do you sit there
doing that for before you just start to take a spiral down or where do you actually go right what can i actually do with this where
can i make a decision we could become so emotionally wrapped
up in covert as well the pandemic alone like i've i've expressed a hell of a lot of empathy and
sympathy to everyone i work with saying this is probably one of the toughest things we've all been through collectively in a long time we're
literally playing stuck in the mud for real you know we're grounded and it
does become quite an emotional place doesn't it people losing jobs things going wrong but part of ara is this remove emotion
is not becoming emotionless like not asking you to be motionless it's for me in combat it happens you've got
to deal with it then and then remove the emotion get the anger and the sadness out the way do you know what we'll do we'll deal with that later no we've got to deal
with that correctly as well this is where some people make the mistake of bottling up i'm going to come back to that later but
i need to get on with my job and that part is that adapt part okay how do we adapt to this situation how do
we adapt to loss of life there what was his role not who is he as a human what was his role
what do we need to do to fill that role for now while we're here um i was telling you about that time
when we were having to use mortar fire as almost a curtain as the taliban metroid commerce on that
final operation the person calling in that mortifier was vice my commander
and he's not a mortiman he is not trained on the radio to do that the day before when we lost those five
guys who were by a grenade one of them was the mortiment and he was the one who needs to call that stuff in we didn't have him
you have to learn to adapt and we could sit around and say oh we've lost our morton and we're [ __ ] now
or we can go right he's gone let's not cloud our judgment let's think with some clarity and get
the emotion out the way okay how do we adapt to this situation and i've had so many people which is really
genuinely humbling because i kind of didn't make it up i just wanted to put a little bit of an acronym on what i
use and give it to other people and i have so many people get in touch saying ara because it's a simple process
maybe in the morning you know when you stub your toe stub your toes like the quickest like ah you just want to go band's eye on the
table don't you but you just go stop i've stubbed my toe yeah yeah it does hurt yeah i need to be a little bit
less emotional with this table and now i need to adapt to the fact that my toes facing in different directions
so we all look at the table now but it is it is something you know something just happens and you
have to be able to go all right that's happened how do i remove the unwanted emotion i call it
unwanted emotion what's the bit that's going to get in your way if you're making the right decision the anger the um
the sadness whatever's there and then you have to adapt i always think that the first l you take and when i say l i
mean loss the first l you take is often involuntary nothing you could do whatever the second
l you take is often voluntary so like the pandemic happens wasn't your fault we get that
but then you dwell on it so much and you refuse to adapt and you you become a victim of circumstance you
become bitter and blaming and you don't adapt as you say which was your choice
and that leads to another l which is your business goes bankrupt and so i always think like the first i always say that's like you don't have to
take the l twice the first l is you know involuntary the second one is your choice and that's i think the similar sentiment to the
importance of like getting rid of that unwanted emotion focusing on the task at hand finding that calm
within your within the chaos and being proactive and as you said as the sort of military values
being cheerful because that is uh optimism is a very important uh emotion to experience in times of
real chaos you have to believe that there is a way out um and that's super interesting i i i
was reading through your story as well more recently i read about i think you touched on this earlier
this joy that you've now found in running during the pandemic yeah yeah tell me about that i don't like it
The joy of running
as well do i just say well i started training in march as well and i've been training all year so i thought that was really interesting
you mentioned earlier that getting out and feeling the air and the endorphins and yeah i um i was never a great runner in
the marines not really no i was more the one who'd put the big backpack on and just be able to plod on um
your son could give you some tips yeah that's who i train with now um i just i i really
i like the idea of just it sounds so forrest gump but just running there's i have no
reason to run i i think during the pandemic i found it a nice bit of an escape you know we're locked inside all the
time uh you're on zoom call after zoom called the kids are downstairs and
um you just need that moment to yourself and and i just love being out there running i just it's interesting my business
partner and um his wife asked me the other week she's like why why do you run
i don't know you know it got me pondering so i think maybe i'm a little bit better prepped to answer your
question um but it was i use this word escape loosely because i
think i've used the word i i've escaped before in the past through
drink and drugs and the more sinister things escape now is actually just to be of
myself for a while and i find that and and you would have found this on your own business journey
is it's so full on all the time it's just someone wants you for something your phone pings or
you know i'm i use social media i don't have the biggest following but i use social media because it's part of
what i have to do you know promoting a book and things like that i don't really want to be on it i actually kind of like my reserve
lifestyle but i have to give you something to show you what i do um which i was listening to i think as
jake talked about on your podcast this morning it was really interesting it put my ears about thinking about it
but running is i don't have my social media on when i run i'll if i need to i'll record a video to
be like oh i'm not running um and post maybe sometimes but i just like being out i like feeling a bit of
the pain in the shins and in the feet and i like running further than other people do not for time
but that idea of what my corporal said to me in training 0.1 better every day i i really enjoy
just striving for that excellence and i have found since leaving the military it's really difficult to feel like
you're constantly striving for excellence it seems like there's more challenges there than there is
success to be honest it's like one thing after the other i've done this within the business are we oh that's good oh
something else come along which is difficult to deal with now isn't it brilliant um but for me being out running is that
ability to escape i live in a wonderful part in the southwest you you know that area very well up onto
dartmoor up onto the southwest coast um you just just incredible places to be
and take the dog out running and i actually found in probably the last year or so
it's an incredible space to think and i run back and i actually pick my post pace up at the
end because i cannot forget that yeah you're not running back home through the door and you're like what about this with this yeah that might
work but it's um it's just a place to be free you know and i'm not real
a gym bunny i don't really i go to the gym i kind of walk around it look at a few things do the odd pull up and then
go home i love being out on the road and i love being out on the muddy trails as well
slipping around getting wet getting muddy it's just fulfilling isn't it i think
when i was in the military that was all the time and now it's not when i left when i when i got binned from the military
my last final day i came home i laid on the floor and it sounds i say that about social
media i don't really like using it but there's this this is almost like tradition in the modern military now that when you leave you post like your
favorite pictures of your career and then a post um and you acknowledge the lads and then
and then you post it out and i was writing my post and i was picking the photos and i was blubbing i was just like
crying on the floor but to myself and i'd kept it in for so long i didn't think i was going to do this and then i
was just in utter tears because it was this just this excitement that i was going onto this new phase of
my life but also that's it now i'm never going to do that again and that made me who i am today
i lied on the floor and i think part of the tears was i'm never going to go mountain training again i'm never going to go
out to the states and go in the mojave desert again i'm never i'm never going to go to afghan again i know it's difficult as it was it's an
adventure and then crying crying crying and my wife kicked my foot which she's actually literally hoovering next to me
she's like you're going to get up but i was like oh we had this little moment together and i kind of like gave it all on the
plate and then i went and booked marathon to sarbs yeah of course you did
because i thought i've got to have something i've got to have a challenge which will uh fulfill that
so now you're running this business looping what is lupin doing you i'm guessing you've really felt the
Your business
pain of running a business and starting a business because it's a startup right during the pandemic what
is lupine doing and how's that process been so what will help me explain lupin even
more is probably stepping back into the marines for the first time when i put my hand up and said i don't think i'm that well at the
moment i think there's something that might be wrong i'm bottling it up for so long you know come back from operations
keeping it all inside guilt you know two ieds which went off behind me injured people and you carry that with
you and so you feel like you can't talk out and there's a stigma of don't talk just keep walking forward and i remember
that moment of thinking everyone around me looks really strong and tough and they just seem to be shrugging it off they're like yeah we
did after i'm crack on come on then that's and i'm inside i'm like ah i don't feel too good at the moment
and it things happen and as i said i got in trouble and things didn't go to plan and then
finally i put my hand up to one of the lads and said i think i've got issues here
and he went yeah same here i have as well what you've been seeing and what you've been hearing and it was like
whoa just instantly like you're not you're not alone and you feel this as well and like having this big conversation
a couple of beers doesn't always help but a couple of beers for us at that moment was like are you do you feel weak and all these
things and um that forever has stuck with me you know marines
one of our values is integrity and integrity means to be able to go i don't feel too good today it doesn't
mean you don't go into your job but if you have an awareness of how i'm feeling you know maybe you can back me a bit more
or you can help me a bit more and that's going to come back i'll help you out which was where it began with how can we
show it better and that's all it was was let's make lupin something that just asks someone in the
morning how they are they respond on the platform they already use so slack teams integration
it records that data pushes it through to the dashboard you then log into your dashboard you see
your graph of how you've been recently compared to last week as well and then
you get to see the close people within your team as well not the organization you can see every team in the organization if you want to but you only
get to see the people within your team and even within our own workforce and also
with our alpha and beta testing people are reaching out to other people because they see their amber
and it's i did one this morning one of our teams amber straight on the phone you're right yeah
i just had a long night with the kids last night i'm okay i just need a coffee but all she wanted was that question of
all good yeah and it's yeah i'm okay and then on the odd occasion we get no i'm not feeling too good today
take today off them and that person is going to be more productive next week we can't bend over for it we know that
in the business world people have to be in stress states we have to be under high pressure other times we don't but it's how more transparent can we be
and i think what the pandemic's actually showing us is we can embrace this sounds amazing and
i even know someone ran an organization with many hundreds of people um being able to see sort of an early
warning sign yeah for situations developing call it the pulse is that what you call it yeah it would have been super
super valuable you think about it from a business perspective you stand a chance of losing good people because you weren't aware that they were
potentially on a bit of a downward spiral in terms of morale yeah and uh losing good people cost you a ton
of money sounds amazing and it sounds like a very long way from afghanistan
do you know what i mean going into tech because tech is a beast in itself it's a whole nother i've worked in tech in san francisco and
stuff and it's a whole nother language and culture and philosophy and stuff so to go from
you know your early years to to bouncer to afghanistan to you know helping the
england team to now working in tech is one hell of a journey in a short amount of time so incredibly impressive
you've lived many lives in your in the one that you've experienced and i actually was thinking
as you're telling the stories today how honored i am that someone like you listens to my podcast i was like i think
i need to listen to your [ __ ] podcast you're i hit a low moment last year when we dropped investment
and we took these overheads like we went from like what was it three so about six grand a
month overhead to suddenly thousands and thousands of pounds because we've got a team in an office
and we're looking at our reserves going outside two months worth then we got four months and we were getting no after no
afternoon because everyone just shut up didn't they no one wanted to invest because protecting your money and i listened to
yours and dan murray certains to just take inspiration
i don't know this world well enough and you guys do and i was listening to it going done it they've done it they can do it i
can do it right okay and low [ __ ] moments crying into my wife's arms going why have i done this i've put the house
at risk kids at risk this is [ __ ] it's better to be worth it but i want to make it happen i want to see
a change out there i want to see a change in business i want to see your businesses be more open
it's not about raising the money it's about fighting to raise that money so i can make that happen and we raised the money seven days
before missing payroll we raised half a million just over half a million and it's listening to your
stories it's listening to others was the moment for me where i'm like just keep going just i listened to the ones this
morning i was thinking about this struggle that you guys were talking about and i was like sometimes struggle's good yeah it gets
you to dig deep and sits in the trenches and i've been in the trenches and we've now been through the trenches
and yeah it's inspiring you know when i got the nod last week i was like huh
that's a massive compliment i i think i you know i've learned a ton from speaking to you today um i know you produce content yourself
you've got your book which is awesome um so i just wanted to say thank you because it's been one hell of a
conversation and i think this when i reflect on it this is really the reason why i started this podcast was to hear these
stories and and the just the diversity in struggle and overcoming and persisting
and purpose and reinventing yourself is the reason this podcast exists and you exemplify all of
that so thank you so much for your time today ben and you you know you said it was a
um a high moment for you to come on this podcast but i feel that um going the opposite way and i really
really mean that i really mean that because you're an incredibly impressive guy thank you
people ask me for book recommendations all the time and i finally got one for you it's a book called happy sexy
millionaire which is authored by me um i spent the last almost two years in jungles around the
world in costa rica and indonesia in solitude writing this book it's the most
important thing i've ever created and there's this crazy thing when you write a book because
you spend so much time pouring your heart and soul into it and everything you know and all of the revelations you've had in your life
and then there's this barrier which is that people have to buy the thing in order for them to get that thing that
means so much to you i wish that wasn't the case it's just the way the industry is and in order to get that distribution and to
get it on shelves you need a publisher so please please please if you can if you've ever liked anything i've
ever produced this podcast my instagrams anything i've ever said read this book there was no ghost writer
i wrote every single word myself there's some real surprises in there it's an honest sometimes hilarious
incredibly vulnerable hopefully valuable recount of my life my journey everything i've learned across across
the way and really the answer to being fulfilled to being happy and to achieving success
it is the most important important thing i've ever created so i implore you to go to amazon now or wherever you get your
books and get that pre-order and everybody that pre-orders the book because pre-orders in this crazy publishing
industry count as way more than just a normal sale if you get that pre-order i'm gonna put you into a group with
everybody that's pre-ordered it and i'm gonna send you some exclusive stuff so the first things i'm gonna do is a series of voice notes which i think are
um are gonna be pretty powerful i'm gonna give you access to some tickets which nobody else will have and i'm gonna do everything i can to
thank you for for giving me that sort of nine quid of your money or whatever it is happy sexy millionaire you can pre-order
it everywhere now and if you do get that pre-order please do dm me because i'd love to thank you myself

that's not going to happen and i think it you showed that little boy inside was just like ruined by it sorry it's still quite
emotional [Music]
what an amazing story what a cruel amazing twisting career
my next guest has one of the most fascinating journeys through business and through life that i think i've ever heard she spent
her life surrounded by a couple of people that that i actually consider to be inspirations of mine one of them is
sir david brailsford who's been the sort of elite performance coach and cycling coach for team sky which went on to win more than
they were ever expected to win he's the i guess the author of this this marginal gains thinking which
changed how business and sports teams function the other person she was surrounded by throughout her career is
steve peters who a lot of you will know from the book he authored the paradox which redefines
from a psychiatrist's point of view how our mind works and where our behavior comes from and the other male figure in her life
that's important for the story you're about to hear is her brother david miller who was this incredibly
sort of highly regarded cyclist british cyclist who had this cruel twist to his career
where he got involved in the doping scandal which really left a stain on british cycling as we know it
Your Brother
and david miller recounts the story of him being sat in this this cafe shop with david brailsford and
being tapped on the shoulder by three men wearing suits who would then raid his house and find syringes and that was
one of the key moments in british sporting history where i think in many respects things have never been the same and we always view
our elite performers with an element of skepticism but this is fran's story and fran's story is one of tenacity it's
one of success it's one of jumping off cliffs and figuring out how to build your skydiver
as you fall her story is inspiring it's peculiar she went from starting her own business
to spending i think 12 years that team sky worked her way up to the very very top and when it became team ineos she became
the ceo leading a predominantly male dominated industry and then out the blue
in the middle of a pandemic when retail was on its ass she decided that she was going to change lanes and
become the ceo of bell staff which is a brand that has been struggling that's been making losses and then was then
kicked up the rear end by covid she's brave she is unusual she's inspiring
she's tough she describes herself or at least she respects the idea of being a difficult
woman something we'll talk about so without further ado i'm stephen butler and this is the dire of a ceo
i hope nobody is listening but if you are then please keep this to yourself
[Music]
fran i i've done a lot of stalking of your your history your past your professional career and uh i was stalking your
twitter feed the other day and i saw a quote that you'd um you'd written i guess in in honor of your brother um david
who is a a world renowned professional incredibly accomplished cyclist and the quote said following a boy who loved it
so much he got absorbed into the fabric of it and has spent a lifetime carrying the weight of the cruelty wonder brilliance and
tragedy it would bring him um is ultimately what got you into the world of cycling
i was slightly taken aback by some of those words cruelty wonder brilliance and tragedy
can you explain why you chose those words oh it's a big opening question um
yeah i mean listen my brother was was unease a very talented guy he was we were so when we
were about 10 and 12 my parents got divorced my dad went to live in hong kong and my mom stayed in the uk i stayed with my mum my
brother went with my dad and so when we were like kids we'd cross in the air so he'd come home from hong
kong i'd go out to he'd come home i'd go out and he had nothing to do when he was here because we'd moved so we had no
he had no friends around so my mom entered him into a cycling club um and he'd go and he'd do the time
trials he was super good at it by the literally from like 15 to 19 he'd gone from never really riding a road
bike to being like courted by nine of the biggest teams in the sport and he got signed very young by a big
french team and they kind of made all these promises to my mum about it and he was obviously you know he was a kid he was
desperate to win the tour de france and to go and fulfill his dreams and he totally fell in love with the sport and he was completely enamored by it and in
the space of five years he'd gone from this excited talented you know
brilliant kid to this damaged incredibly sad deep deeply deeply shamed
young man and it was like how has a sport done that like how is this is
it it's a game right like sports a game it's entertainment how is that something that's fundamentally to entertain people
basically ruined him like taking him down to the core of who he was and it just and then he built himself back up and
he's you know he's gone on to do incredible things but it was just a the sport has had this unbelievable
impact on my life on my brother's life on my life on everything the decisions i've made and
everything else i guess that's why i chose those words give me some detail on you talked about
the sport bringing him down to his core and ruining him what caused that
ah so he went into the sport in 1998 he turned pro which for any of your
listeners who know anything about cycling was the festina year so it was the year of the big fastina scandal where they raided all the hotel
rooms and the guys all kind of protested and sat down on the road and only a few of the sort of teams were
able to finish because so many guys got pulled out of the race and it was it was the dawning of the epo
era so it was the era where they discovered effectively athletes and coaches had discovered
that you could use epo in the same way they used build to use altitude training to perform to increase physical performance um and it
was just a transformative drug it was they couldn't detect it they couldn't test for it and they brought in
some interventions like a hematocrit test so if your hematocrit went over 450 you'd be pulled out of racing but it was
a it was a health check it wasn't a doping check and it was rife basically so when he this young sort of
dreaming kid went into the sport he he genuinely thought you could do it clean you wouldn't ever have to cheat i don't
even think he really knew that much about doping at that point in his life and pretty quickly he realized that
actually most the guys at the very top were doping that the doping was endemic
that the expectation was you were dope that that was what you would need to do if you wanted to be a
professional and you wanted to be any good and he resisted it for a really long time like he he was a time trialer which
is you know race against the clock basically only racing yourself and so he really stuck to his time trialling
because he was like i can do that like with the technology with aerodynamics with focus on my training it's a shorter
period of time there's less requirement to kind of be as cardiovascularly supreme as the
guys who are trying to win the tour are um and so he did very very well time trialling went to his first tour de france and won yellow
like day one um and but but what was happening was behind the scenes
this sort of erosion of his belief that he would be able to do it clean his his recognition that actually if he if
he really wanted to take it seriously and try and win the tour he was going to have to cheat the people around him that the kind of
network and the framework around him was people who weren't looking out for him
weren't thinking what's best for him weren't trying to work out how to make help him fulfill his potential they were trying to work out
how to get him good enough to make enough money to win you know for them as a business he was a commodity in their business um
and i'd like i haven't actually ever told this story but francois mcgrane who owned coffee's which is like a
company that basically does telephone loans i don't know what they do now probably you know online loans but um he had he
met my mum so when we had all these teams that were sort of courting david he met with my mum and he promised her
that he would look after him like promise looked looked her in the eyes and said i'll look after him and and yet
he did nothing like he he built a team that was allowed to just get on with it he sort of closed
his eyes to it and actually when the big investigation into cofferdie started it was francois mcgrane who effectively
called out my brother he was like i think moncuti is probably clean but david miller i wouldn't put my hand on my heart for
him and it was like you [ __ ] do you know i mean like yeah and you and he he's 24 years old
like what he's the only exposure he's had the professional support is your team
so if that's what's happened it's your team and p don't get me wrong david absolutely has to take responsibility
for his decisions in that but i for one know that when i was like 19 to 25 i wasn't making the best
decisions i've made in my life and i had some influential people around me who had they told me to do things or
if and it's that insidious thing isn't it it's a bit like kind of i was listening to a book the other day
about um decision making and you know how if you look at like nazi germany and people say oh they were just following orders
and there was this big study done apparently where they put people in a room and they told them like there's going to be some there's
going to be a student in there it's a study i can't really anything with my gran or someone who did the study and you're going to press this button
don't worry because to shock them and the shock's going to get bigger and bigger and bigger and it's like and
65 of the people would have pressed the button that would have effectively killed the person in the other room and it's like what and that's the human
condition right so this idea that we that we would make a better decision or we'd make a better choice or that we'd do it differently
people seem to impose that on guys who decide to cheat in sport or decide to make these like well how dare you make that decision it's
like if you were in an environment in a culture where that becomes the norm where that becomes what people do
this idea that you're going to be the one person who and don't get me wrong i know there are other people who do that and fair play to them that isn't that's
impressive you know that you've been brought up in a certain way to enable you to make those decisions but david was he was fragile he was
impressionable he was a dreamer he was doing something he'd always wanted to do he was passionate and desperate
desperate desperate to to be a success and i think he just got taken down the wrong path
you know and you do you feel like you went through that with him as a close family
um i'm trying to understand the impact i had on you being the sister and i know you you guys are very close yeah i mean the
impact it had on me was i was he never he never came to he went to my mum and told her that he was dating and
and they they they sort of she just said well just stop just come home like don't
worry about actually you know sort of at the very beginning he said there's a lot of drugs and my mom was like well just come home go to art
school don't worry about it it's just cycling um and yet he stayed and he persisted and then i think when he
was in 2001 when he eventually made the decision to kind of cross the line as it were he he had he
spoke to my mom i think in that period and she was just like you you know you have you have to stop you have to come home
and he was like no i want to do you know i want i want to be successful i want to go on this journey he never had that conversation with me
all i ever saw was the kind of it was like an erosion of him do you know me it's like i could tell something was going on i wasn't an idih i mean
it's like he's probably he's probably cheating but he we had all been indoctrinated into it
as well it was like well that's kind of you turn a blind eye you kind of think well you know he's
he's doing really well he's you know on the cover of all the magazines he seems happy-ish and it was only when he he'd
come home in the off-season and he'd come come and stay with me and my mates living in london
and he would he would drink so heavily that you'd be like okay this isn't normal you're a professional athlete and he would the
the depressions he'd sink into and the self-loathing that he that would come out and it's like in vino veritas you
know that kind of this and i'd be like what on earth is going on here and then eventually it kind of you i
realized what was happening and i kind of felt responsible for never stepping in and saying something and never being
like you don't need to do this i was just like well you know if you're happy and you're enjoying it and you're doing well
who am i to judge kind of thing um so i think as a family it kind of bonded and pulled us apart
like we kind of we all turn a blind eye to it i think we've all got our demons to deal with from that perspective um my dad
i think was had a very different view of it all my brother and my dad sort of you know have have an ongoing difficult
relationship my mum and my brother are very close i'm very close to my dad and my mum but you know so as a family we've kind of it it's
definitely created divisions because everyone had a different view of it and then in terms of the impact on me
i went into cycling i ran my own cycling agency i was working in the cycling industry i totally rode the coattails of
my brother's success and i was like [ __ ] okay now it's all gonna come crashing like he got arrested and
put in prison and you know i was like oh god this is not ideal and i literally remember speaking to him
afterwards and he'd just come out of you know 48 hours in custody and he was
like and i remember it being like a week and a half before the tour and he said to me don't worry france um they're still
gonna let me ride the tour you know you're like oh it still makes me want to cry because it's like david they're not gonna let you ride at all
that's not gonna happen and i think it you show that little boy inside it was just like ruined by it
sorry it's still quite emotional but yeah so it just it just impacted everything it impacted all my decisions because at that point i was
then like [ __ ] now i've got to go into the office the next day and i've got to stand in the velodrome events and
i'm david i'm not david miller's sister the kind of glory front cover of the magazine i'm that i'm
the sister of this shamed cheating lying horrible human
being who no one likes anymore and who has disgraced british cycling and is is a
you know he he's like a complete social pariah and i'm like oh [ __ ] okay now i've still got to go and do my job and did you feel
that you felt your judgment and yeah massively people would re and it was in the days of forums you know like
my forums were a really big deal and i'd be like okay i'm just going to have a little bit of a look on a forum and see
what people are saying and i'd see people i work with commenting you know people who were at the velodrome who were like
doing the timing at my events or and they all you know literally like people wishing him dead
but you know it was just like it wasn't cool and yeah i really felt i felt it for him i didn't i wasn't embarrassed because i
was like you know it is what it is he's made a set of decisions he's paying the price for it
um but it was at that point sort of about six months after that i was like okay i probably can't represent him anymore
because if i have to have another conversation with a journalist an ignorant journalist about
this kind of binary right or wrong conversation where you're like this is not how life works i'm gonna end up punching someone
in the face so i should probably stop doing that speaking of punching people in the face
no um i had it just that felt like a good turn towards one of the things that i
âBeing a difficult womanâ
saw you share online which was this article about being a difficult woman
and the importance of um dispelling this sort of like niceness
aura that women typically um are associated with in business that i think the article was suggesting holds
them back how important has that been especially you know
when you were dealing in an industry which is pretty much full of men and you got to the very very top as the ceo of
ineos how important was it to be willing to punch people in the face being a little bit difficult at times
as is such an interesting question because that whole being a difficult woman i think is the older i've gotten the
more i've kind of explored feminism and explored kind of the sort of female condition the human
condition it's like women are judged very differently for for behaviors that in men would be seen
as completely normal so you know there's a sort of famous kind of meme that's the sort of you know
men are assertive women are chippy you know men are confident women are arrogant you know it's like
the same behavior gets viewed very differently to a very different lens i've never filtered myself it's not been
anyone who's ever met me knows that i don't really come with a filter and i think it's really really important
that young women recognize that they don't have to apply a filter you don't have to be the quiet one in the room you don't have to
i remember reading um cheryl sandberg's book about lean in and it was like um you know when young women will come
into a meet room and they won't sit at the table like they physically won't sit at the table they'll sit back at the sides and i was like [ __ ] off who does that
and then i'd go to meetings and i'd be like i've noticed that like the 19 20 21 year old younger women in the
room they'd wait for the guys to sit down they'd be like what the [ __ ] are people why are people doing that
and it you just until you realize it's happening you don't realize it's happening and so yeah i've always felt quite
strongly that you just need to be yourself be confident be willing to get get told you're a [ __ ] get told you're and don't
get wrong when i was younger i was actually a bit of a [ __ ] i probably i probably didn't um measure that
behavior i was a bit like well it's just who i am and everyone needs to suck that up and actually you still have to be polite and have
manners and you still have to recognize that being aggressive is actually just sometimes being aggressive it's not being assertive
and that balance i think i've learned as i've got older but i think it's yeah i think women are judged totally
differently for behaviors that men would be absolutely it would it would almost be uh sort of
respected in a man for certain behaviors and in women it's it's reviled there'll be there'll be young women listening to
this and they'll be thinking you know i'd love to be like that fran and i'd love to be a bit more you know assertive and
etc etc but i just you know it's just not who i am and so kind of the question that popped into my mind was where did that you know some
might see it as confidence but it's like a confidence in being your true self right where did that do you know where that came from in you was it
you know is there experience is it something happening in the household is that your mother was taught you that behavior your father
yeah i think it's probably half nature half nurture like i think i i you know my mum tells a story about
when i was little and i said you know i'd just literally go off and speak to people like she she'd be sat at
you know the bar you know on a holiday and she'd want to know what's going on with a couple over there she'd be like francis go and ask them what they're
doing you might be like okay and off i'd go and chat to them so i think i've always been very innately confident and that doesn't
that's never gone away um but equally i think i've been very lucky i've been very
blessed i've worked with people and in and around people where i've been allowed to be myself i've been allowed
to kind of grow up and make mistakes and fail and be a bit of an idiot and get told you're being a bit of an idiot and
not not have that be a judgement upon me and limit me um and i think it's really interesting
that kind of you know being assertive or being being your true self has become a bigger and bigger thing that people talk about
and actually being your true self doesn't mean you have to be assertive and confident it means you have to be your true self and for a lot of people that is a bit
more insecure or a bit more and that's fine but you can bring that to the table you can be an emotional person you can be
lack a bit of self-esteem and just be honest about that so for me i think it's just partially how i was brought up but more
the people i have been surrounded by on the journey of my life and career i've been incredibly blessed that they
have allowed me to make a lot of mistakes and correct and
course correct me as i've gone on that that point about being assertive and being direct and
being open and honest you know what um i was actually chatting yesterday about one of the how i've changed over the last 10 years
from like the kid at 18 to the kid at 28. and the the key thing i said to my team is like the big change that i've seen on
myself is i'm way more direct yeah and i'm not sure why i'm doing that i'm like i don't know whether it's because i've got so many things to
do that i'm trying to save time at all times um i'm way more honest with my feedback
and there's this sort of fine line between being an [ __ ] and being honest and direct and trying to be time efficient and like realizing
that sometimes your feedback or the way you say things might hurt people's feelings but that's secondary to what
we're doing here um how have you toed that line i imagine from what you've said it's more
difficult as a woman to to because people will you know they'll they'll determine the same behavior to be a really negative thing
but how do you toe the line between being like direct and firm which is so important in my opinion
when you're dealing with teams and especially if you're dealing with teams of uh you know high testosterone testosterone
men how do you toe that line and and also i guess the more important question for me is do you agree
that it's an important trait to have okay so have you read a book called radical camber
it's up there on my bookshelf somewhere but i've not read it yet okay so yes i do think being honest is important
i think being a [ __ ] to people is not acceptable and so i think i i think honestly can get veiled
sorry being a [ __ ] can get failed by i'm being honest right like well i'm just being honest and it's
feedback and you should take it it's like one of the sort of best lessons i've ever been taught
and one of the most influential people in my life by a mile is steve peters um he's a forensic psychiatrist yeah and
he always says like you have to be compassionate like even if you're telling someone they're
losing their job or you know if you're having to give someone really honest be compassionate be be sensitive to the
fact that you're going to get a better response from someone if you're just nice to them you know you can say some really really shitty
things to people and it get a horrible response or you can say shitty things but get a really positive response back
because you do it in a different way so i think it's really crucial to be honest it's really crucial to be authentic
but that doesn't mean you get a license to be a [ __ ] and have you is there a place
for aggression and anger and being annoyed in business in your view
no not not ever uh well you can you can feel those things but i don't
think you can inflict those things on other people no i don't think that's acceptable it's um it's remarkable how many of the world's
most sort of admired leaders when you read their biographies and stuff you find out how much of a [ __ ] they are like steve
jobs was a good example where i was told you know from a friend that they basically had to put him in his own
building and warn people that worked in that building that you know the way steve was and elon musk in his biography is
is very very similar but uh the reason i asked you about radical canada is when i read it it made a lot of sense to
me about about people like that so that she basically describes this quadrant where effectively you've got
how much you care about people and how sort of willing and honest you're able to be and so if you're very
very honest but you don't care about them at all then you you're basically an arrogant [ __ ] and if you really really care
about them but you're really really honest then you're radically candid but if you really really care about them and you're
not honest then you're kind of it's almost like a malignant empathy do you know me it's like i'm going to be really nice to you
but because i'm not going to be honest with you you're not going to develop and so that for the first time and she said in a business
it's better it's way better as much as it's counterintuitive to be the arrogant [ __ ] because
actually the feedback is what's important so if people are getting the feedback and they're being told the truth they are like
some people might be able to handle it but the people who can handle it will develop and get better it's worse to be empathetic and not be
honest than it is to be an arrogant [ __ ] and i was like oh that's why there's so many arrogant [ __ ] in the world
because actually it does work like on the and genius you know it forgives a lot right when
people are geniuses they can behave very differently and they get away with it because they're geniuses and
there is merit in that and i think if people are very very very honest with you and give you brutal feedback
as long as you're like able to take it on board you'll get better but if someone's lying to you and saying
you're doing a great job stephen don't worry about it it's absolutely fine because they don't want to hurt your feelings you're never going to develop
that's true you you switched from working over to bell staff um quite relatively
This idea of labels
recently um and i was reading i think i was listening to one of the the podcasts you've done and you talked about how
you'd worked in cycling pretty much your whole life it was your pretty much your everything in terms of your professional experience um i've
also recently quit my job and uh how does it feel uh everything you feel everything right you feel
you know it's bittersweet you feel excited on one hand you're unsure about the future but i trust myself enough to know that i'll figure it out because i
always have um but yeah all feelings um i guess my question for you is and the bit that i found particularly
interesting is people will do a thing for ten years for five years whatever and then they'll tell
themselves that they are that thing they'll like give themselves the label i work in cycling i'm a cycling person
yeah it seems to be incredibly difficult especially if they've been in that industry for a long time to then
take on a different label you're now working in fashion and it comes with a whole new set of challenges completely outside of your
comfort zone to some extent in some ways how did you make that switch how did it feel tell tell me all about
it um it's again i'm going to reference steve peters but i remember because i was
so wedded to my job in cycling like i lived and breathed it i loved it i cared deeply about the people
it like had this it was so wrapped up in my identity but i hadn't necessarily got a huge amount of
satisfaction out of the job over the last two or three years for a whole host of reasons nothing to do with the team just personal
development wise and every time i spoke to steve you'd be like well then why don't you just leave i'd be like because i don't know who i am if i leave
the cycling team do i mean and that was a much longer conversation than that but what effectively i was saying
was i don't know who i am if i'm not that and he he said over and over again
you will be whoever you go on to be that's not going to change you are still there
you're letting this thing influence all these views about yourself you're letting it influence what you
your value your worth your you know your sort of substance your contribution to life like
you're letting it's a job it's like it's a job and i was like you don't get it you don't understand it's more important
than that and you know what when i got asked to go and do bell stuff and i left and it broke my heart like i
cried my eyes out and i started a bell staff and i i sat feel awful saying this but within
48 hours i was like oh my god i love it here and i love the people here and this is brilliant i'm so excited and actually
it is just the job that was just the job and yes i miss it and yes it was incredible and yes i
loved the people and i still love the people but it's just the job it's not my family it's not who i am
it's not my identity it's just a part of my life and i'll be eternally grateful for having done it but now i've
got a new challenge and i was like i'm really pleased i did it when i did because everyone i think
had been saying to me for a long time you know once you leave you'll be like oh i should have done this five years ago and i don't feel like that at all i feel
you know i did that for the right amount of time i loved it i've banked it moving on to something else
and it's that point there about thinking that that job was your identity that i think really like holds people down yeah um because you're right jobs are
they're fat friends they're community they are purpose yeah as you say they're your identity um
and that's dangerous like that's dangerous you know because actually they're not they're not they're not your
identity and no matter how much you love it no matter how passionate you are about it if you
it then this would be the lesson i would sort of give to myself the sort of it doesn't matter it's a job you're
being paid to do it it's a job and and i would have railed against that even a year ago
like no it isn't it's more important than that and you know as soon as you as soon as i left i was like yesterday
and my brother always you say to me your team aren't your family your team aren't your family and i never really understood what you meant because i thought well they are my family
like you know what i mean i love them they are my family and they leave you like oh no what he means is your family are there forever your family are
wedded and you can't un-pick your family they they're something that's whereas when you leave a job
you take away the memories you take away the happy times to take away the good stuff but you're the fabric of who you are doesn't change
and that's what i try and do i just finished writing my book on there's a chapter on this idea of labels and me trying to resist these labels
to make sure that i continue on my journey of challenge and keep myself you know stimulated and i don't get to
you know a certain age and feel like i'm having a midlife crisis because i don't know who i am and i can't leave and i don't have any skills
um and to really sort of realize that the label i have is me it's like steven i'm a guy with a
bunch of skills and experiences and i can apply these skills and experiences to a bunch of different challenges i'm not social media ceo you know what i
mean yeah and that i find really liberating so i quit i started djing we're doing this pokemon this theatrical play i'm
just trying to do all of the things that i think i shouldn't be able to do right but speak to me about the challenge so
The move away from cycling
you you decide to take this job at bell staff and it is a big challenge it's it's widely reported that bell's
staff has been it's had you know struggled across the years it was recent it was acquired and i think 2017.
it was making losses then and the losses of i think narrowed over the last couple of years to some extent but it's a big challenge right
a big challenge it would have been much easier to take a different job so first and foremost i didn't take it i
was i literally had a conversation with my chairman ineos um about you know maybe maybe over the next
couple of years i want to think about moving on and doing something different and when we when dave b comes back from the tour this was in september so when he
comes back from the tour at the end of the season i think i'd like to sit down and have a chat with my chairman and my boss dave
about my future that was the sum total of my conversation and literally a week later i got a call saying jim would like you to be the ceo
of old stuff and you know with the best one in the world when jim ratcliffe asks you to do something you don't kind of go
let me have a think about that and i just thought okay well what an opportunity and and i went for it
but i didn't i wasn't looking to change i wasn't i hadn't like planned to move on so that was in some ways whilst it was
quite traumatic sort of three or four weeks of because i literally i got phoned like on the 16th of september and i was enrolled
on the first of october wow so it was like yeah like two weeks of just why did you want to have the conversation though when they've
got back because i wanted to so i wanted to i'd sort of been thinking like i said about the conversation with steve about kind of
i'm not sure if i'm happy doing this job anymore and i'm not sure if i'm fulfilled i've kind of reached the point sort of
middle of last year where i was thinking you know what i do need to start thinking about my future
in my life and my career and i don't know whether that's always going to be in cycling and i don't know whether the ceo of the cycling team
is 100 y1 so i wanted to speak to my chairman first to kind of sound him out
and then when dave gets back from racing i don't want to interfere with the racing have a conversation about my future so i
just literally put it on the rate the radar of the german i'd probably be a little bit out of frustration for myself as well but like
i want to feel like i'm moving this on because otherwise i'm going to sit and not do anything with it do you know what i mean i'm going to
did you feel stagnant yeah in the role is that the main the crux of what you're getting at what was the person if i can relate uh i think
i felt so i had done what was effectively 20 years in pro
cycling it would like you say it was all i knew it's all i'd done i know everybody in it pretty much you
know i've been in and around it my whole life i'm david miller's little sister it's like you know part of my dna we got
we and i loved being part of team sky like we did that for 10 years and it was i sort of always say cup in the middle
like blue blue and i absolutely loved it and then when skye said they were out at the end of 2018 i was like right i'm
done i'm out of here i'm not going to do this anymore so i went straight to baby i was like it's been amazing i've loved it but i'm
gonna once the team stops being sky i'm gonna go and he was like okay cool
i don't think he believed me he was like okay cool and then we he said to me look would you help at
least find a new sponsor let's see if we can find a new sponsor he's a bugger like that so i was like okay i'll try
and help you find a new sponsor and then i'll move on and then you know february comes 2019
you know he's he meets jim jim decides that he wants to acquire the team you know
he jim's arguably one of the most successful businessman in the world we went and met with him and talked
about you know the design of the kit and everything else and i was like i'm gonna get sucked into it um and then and then one of the other
senior managers in the team decided to leave and go and work for another team and debbie was like would you stay you can be ceo
which was what i really wanted to be it's a massive opportunity and i was like okay i'll stay
and i think that was the point of the decision there that i was like you know this is a big career decision
to me that i'm staying again i told on my mates i was going to leave i was like you know this is it this time this time i'm going they're like
okay um and so i stayed at ineos and then we worked on
the one five nine project so elliott kip togues up to our marathon and dave obviously was the project lead
on it all he was the ceo my boss um but he very sadly got prostate cancer in that period so he was off doing the
tour de france then he had to go and have surgery and so i took on like a deputy ceo role kind of delivering the sort of vision
that he'd come up with and he structured all the performance team but then i was doing the delivery of the event everything from kind of working with the
london marathon team to supporting the performance guys to doing all the engagement piece and everything else
and i loved it as i felt like i was working 18 hours a day for like
what was about five six weeks in the build up to the first of all the test event and then through into the actual
event and i just loved it totally different totally new challenge new people different approach fresh it
was i was like i was on literally cloud nine i couldn't have loved it more and i was working so hard like i was
literally crippled by it but i loved it and i came out the other side of it not so much just because
we've done it obviously i mean that was incredible but it just really made me realize that i was just going through the motions in
in the cycling job i was just i was ticking over i was really comfortable i was good at it i loved it i was happy
i liked the people but i wasn't growing i wasn't developing i wasn't learning new stuff and i wasn't kind of and i'd
been going at a million miles an hour you know sort of in the team like on all these stuff where i was
helping other people develop and helping other people achieve their potential and helping other people kind of
you know rescue their reputations or enhance their and i was a bit like what do i want to
be doing like why am i i'm not none of this has been about me and even actually cycling is a little bit about david you know what i mean i
was on kind of this journey to sort of save young british talent from going through what david went through and it's
like actually what do i want to do maybe i want to do something different
and that just planted a seed really and i think i probably went this way to the gym and you know if i'm honest i went because i
thought i want to go and do something different i'm ready i'm ready to move on i'm ready to do something that's not this anymore
and it was all it was almost like a kind of involuntary i think everything else about me was like just stay because it's
comfortable and it's easy and you get good money and it's you know nothing's gonna nothing but that's gonna happen
but my like soul was like you've got to you've got to go and do something else now and it was literally like in the space
of two weeks it was like boom i'm i'm out of here so it was that see it almost identical to me in the sense of something niggling
at you and then for me there was like a trigger moment where i was like i was like sent an email
yeah yeah yeah and then you just send it and then but that idea of being able to throw yourself into uncertainty it's
like throwing yourself off a cliff when you were like cushy in the house on the side of the cliff and you was like oh my god i'm gonna jump
and you're throwing yourself off into the unknown in in the hope that so you'll build your glider as you
fall and then land somewhere better and a lot of people can't do that like most people can't do that
how do you how did you feel though about because because i found it really traumatic like i kind of i felt like oh first of
all i felt quite out it was like i'm out of control of this now i literally said goodbye to my team who i'd worked with for 10 years and
got on a train woke up the next day and went into bell stuff and like hi i'm your new ceo and i and that the trauma of kind of all
of it it felt i had to move out my house i had to go and do say goodbye to people do have a different email had the same email my
whole life like all that kind of stuff it just doesn't shouldn't be that important but felt really significant
how did you feel did you find it traumatic or not so i i'd already i'd quit business when i that i was my baby as
well when i was i started business 18 quit that one when i was 21 so i'd been through it once before so when i earlier when i said the key thing
for me was trusting myself i've done this before i know the feelings i know that i don't know what my future holds
but when i did that when i was 21 it led to this even bigger business that was 200 times bigger and 200 times more
successful so that was that's been this guiding thing in my life like i dropped out of university after one lecture and it worked out
so when you have those case studies you think you know what i have no idea what the future holds but i'll back myself to figure it out
now and um that's because i've done it like three times before so i imagine the next time in the future if
ever that you decide to jump ship and build stuff or whatever you'll have that case study or that evidence in yourself that you've
been yeah and that that i think will calm you a little bit the first time i quit i was all kinds of emotions and worrying
and not sure what i was now and all those things but slightly easier the third time i'm a bit
of a prolific quitter i think it's a really underrated skill yeah people talk a lot about starting as if it's the be all and then and end all
of success but quitting is the thing you do right before right you start something new so yeah yeah i've been a heel fan for a long time as
you obviously know by now but in the last six months i've got a real opportunity to get to know the people to get to know the ceo of huel
which is james to get to know the founder which is julian the teams that agonize over the ingredients that go into these amazing
recipes and i can honestly say with my hand on my heart my appreciation and admiration for huel and its people
has multiplied by a factor of 10 because and this is these singularities not only are they nice people
but because i've seen firsthand how much they are non-negotiable about the values of fuel they will not
compromise they will not compromise on the the goodness of the ingredients that goes into the products the amount of
proteins and minerals and these things regardless if they can't get to where they want to get to with the products
they will cancel the product i've tasted products and they said we've not managed to make it this we've not delivered on our promise of
veganism we've not added enough fiber so we're canceling it and that sort of non-negotiable set of values
has made me realize that they have my back when i choose you i was reading about this winning

behaviors role you took on which is a very curious title yes it is what was your remit as the
head of winning behaviors that team ineos so it was it was when it was team sky okay um same time um
so basically 2010 we first started racing we started the team and he was begun the journey of starting the team
in 2008 off the back of the beijing games started racing in 2010 we were [ __ ] like
embarrassingly [ __ ] and we've been like smoking mirrors and like you know we're kind of we had the big bus and we had all the money and we
were sponsored by sky and it's like oh we're going to be amazing and we were rubbish
so we totally reset everything and dave beats be fair to him he's like a master of okay we're going this way it's
not working we're going somewhere else but he's he's incredible assay and so he totally shifted the way that we're going to run
the team we took a totally different approach we started to be very successful in 2011 we'd obviously set the objective when we
announced the team that we were going to try and win the tour de france with a clean british rider in five years and that was in start
2010. bradley won the tour in 2012. so within the space of two years three years effectively we've done it
the following year chris froome won it and we had gone from being this team that was like
on a mission like heads down arses up and we were going like there was nothing was going to stop us we were full-on
and so when people sign up to that you know people are signing contracts in 2010 with a team that doesn't exist that has never raced on the road before
that comes from a track background that's full of brits who aren't historically that famous for road cycling they were
they were signing a kind of you know they were they were adventurers right they were like these bold ambitious this is a bit batshit crazy but we'll do it
when people were signing contracts at the end of 2013 they were signing with a team that had won the tour de france twice that was
arguably the most dominant team in the sport that had gone on you know sort of achieved this inc these incredible feats and they had a
different expectation of what they were joining to what we were and we suddenly realized that actually
if we were serious about continuing and continuing to be successful codifying what
got us where we were was going to be crucial and we'd also seen for those of you listeners who are
cycling fans we'd had the bradley wiggins and chris rooms kind of divide so brad had obviously come first in 2012 but freemiu had come second
bradley didn't even bradley never rode the tour again so bradley didn't ride in 2013 from he did and he went on to win and he
started to see this divide in a team where it's like well i'm team bradley or i'm team freeman is like no check your paycheck your team sky and
that that kind of actually who are we what do we stand for what do we expect from people what do we need to be able to do to be
the best in the world of this needed codifying and it needed it needed a way of a sort of charter almost to tell people this is
how you're going to have to do this and really it was about eradicating losing behavior it was about saying to people
bitching backstabbing saying you're team through me or your team brad or you know criticizing people behind their back or
whatever that's not acceptable but you being head of losing behavior would have been [ __ ] so we called it [Music]
so it was all about creating a set of behaviors for the organization
that enabled us to say to people this is what it means to put this jersey on this is what it means to be a part of
this team it's not just about you know the glory and the winning this is hard graft this is
you know it it was arguably the hardest thing i've ever done you know working in that environment it's it is unrelenting it is i mean it's
brilliant and it's amazing and incredibly good fun but it's hard hard work
and you've got to go all in you know this isn't this isn't for the faint-hearted and so the whole winning behavior thing
was about creating an environment where we could give people the parameters that we expected them to live by but also ensure that they felt
supported safe able to deliver their very best in an environment that is actually very
high pressure so that was my job effectively helping dave create the behaviors in the first instance with the whole team
and then helping keep them alive within the business what were some of those you mentioned a couple of them there about not being a backstabber and
understanding the importance of hard work what were some of the other um let's just focus on losing behaviors
some of the some of the traits or some of the threats to success that you'd see in the team
i'm thinking this from an organizational standpoint as like yeah that's worked in business so we separated them into five different
areas we had self team um communication continuous improvement
and uh what was the other one oh it's gone anyway so quickly how
quickly you move on right um but the the so they were t itself was all about identifying your own
managing your own emotions being in control of your own emotions so a losing behavior of that would be losing your [ __ ] you know being
aggressive and arrogant with people not being able to recognize when you were too emotional to be in a high performance environment we have this
the whole chimp model you know steve's philosophy around that is there's nothing wrong with being emotional there's nothing wrong with having a
chimp but you have to know when to get out the room if that's what's going on don't bring your emotion into an environment
where you're expecting people to perform at their very best so that kind of management itself absolutely critical
and then team was all about the impact that you have as a team member you know i think people kind
of think teams this kind of static thing that you create a great team and that's it it's like as you all know having won six
very successful businesses teams like these organic ever-changing you know you could bring one person in and have a
massive impact on the team you take one person out it can ruin a team do you know me so they're sort of
the dynamics of a team and your role within that are crucial so you know not wearing a team kit you know
wearing a slightly different trainer you know um criticizing the team not buying into the sort of collective
opinion not sort of dave b has this really big thing about he'll listen he'll seek counsel from everyone he'll listen to everyone's
opinion he wants to get to collective opinion he wants to get to a collective view of what the right direction is but
ultimately if we can't get there he'll make the call and then you've all got to be on the bus non-negotiable if you sit in a meeting
room and you agree with something and you say yeah okay whilst i don't agree with it i buy in you know what i mean i've given you my
point of view you've said it's not the way we're going to go but i buy in and then you walk out the room and
you're like i don't know if i can buy that that is that is the one of the worst losing behaviors you can have
because it's insidious and it it goes around you know a whole organization can be destroyed by a is like a virus
so things like that fascinating i am you don't do a lot of public speaking right you used to haven't done
it for a while now actually yeah but like white collar crime i think sometimes but yeah so i i sort of i used to love doing it like i
really did used to love doing it but i've also i feel like the bit that i talked about which is some of the stuff i've just
said i feel like that's a bit of my past now and i want to build a new build a new
path for myself before i figure out telling people about it if that makes sense yeah so i don't want to take talks on social
media anymore if i can help it to be honest for the same reasons yeah i mean you talked a lot about dave as well so david brailsford um
Key qualities to success
and very fondly i think a lot of your tweets from my stalking were were centered around him and things that
he was doing yeah what are some of the the key qualities of of him that have made him so successful
and his mindset or you know oh big question i mean him and steve peters
are the two most influential men in my life without a shadow of a doubt um you know they they are symbiotic
because they are i think if dave hadn't had steve he maybe wouldn't be who he is and i think his steve hadn't met dave he
maybe would be a slightly different version of himself so they they complement each other brilliantly dave is
is a brilliant man manager he's he's incredibly visionary he's very brave you know you said the
thing about jumping off a cliff and hoping you get your gliders you put dave's like the king of that dave's like we're gonna go we're gonna
go and achieve that and everyone's like [ __ ] off and he's like come on let's go and he and people are like okay because
he's so he's so bold with it he's so confident with it that he and he's an incredible leader that people would
literally i mean i would have followed that man off the edge of a cliff and i think that he has that quality in him you know he's unrelenting
you know anyone who's working he's difficult you know like all geniuses are he's a he's a tricky guy
he's why um how maybe is a better question in all kinds of ways you know he's very
i think i've spoken about it on other interviews i've done he can be very um he can be very particular he's very
detail-oriented he's he wants to know all the facts before he makes a decision he'll he'll go out he'll like go after
something for age ages and you're like oh my god makes a decision i'll get on with it and then he'll make a decision that's
totally off to the other side and you're like oh so doesn't make sense yeah or it's or
it's brilliantly genius because you think oh all that work that you were doing and the decision i would have made and just got on with it and made the decision
would have taken us that way and that would have been the wrong way and it's and it's that kind of you all the way through my career with him
he would do that and i'd be like it's just he's just clever like that you know he's he's
ferocious appetite for learning he unrelenting work ethic you know expects incredible sets
incredibly high standards and expects people to meet them and all people can right no absolutely
and he'd and you know we openly say that it's not all people can there's nothing wrong with not being able to meet them
you've got to be compassionately ruthless you know that's what he always says which is basically if you're not if you're not you set a standard and if
people can't meet them then they're not in the right organization and it's best there it's a bit like the arrogant [ __ ] it's
better to be honest with them and say you know what this isn't for you than to kind of allow them to keep
failing i think that can be very cruel to people you know if they're in an environment they're constantly trying to be better but they just can't do it that's yeah you talked a lot
about when we were talking about winning behaviors about this important about high work ethic and you've expressed that dave has a
relentless work ethic as well um you you've probably observed how this narrative around hard work has become
somewhat toxic over the last couple of years and now i i you know almost feel bad sometimes when i'm
what i'm saying that i don't know how i would have been successful in what i've done if i hadn't have worked hard in fact i
don't really know anybody that's really successful in their discipline or their sport or whatever that doesn't work
hard so i know we're not trying to give anyone depression and anxiety by saying that
you know they have to be a hustle porn star they won't be happy but i still can't get to the point where i
will tell anybody that hard work doesn't matter yeah it really really matters to me and it's
i can't imagine and you know what i was in the gym last night and i was thinking sometimes words
really mess people up right so this i like when people say work they think of me on like a in a factory like
or in like like i don't know in a mine hammering some rock all day but i was thinking because i enjoy my work so much imagine if i just changed
the words of my hard pleasure yeah you know what i mean yeah yeah can you have too much of hard pleasure
um it's interesting as you were asking me the question i think that my respect because i actually i similarly read something that you'd
written about you you feel a bit of you feel a bit bad that you sort of
hear heroes the kind of i'm working yeah they're kind of 18 hours a day and i'm going out
about it yeah bragged about it yeah and and i sort of think i get it i get why people feel like that
and i think there's a difference between being exceptionally busy and working all the hours god gives and
thrashing yourself and all those sorts of things and working really hard with purpose
they're very different you know what i mean and when you're working really hard with purpose and you're passionate about what you're
doing and you love the people you're working with and you're enjoying the the sort of striving for the achievement
there's no shame in that that that's for me that's absolutely part of motivated ambitious people that's what
you want them to feel and people used to know what's something in the work life balance there isn't a
work-life balance my work is my life and i make no i make no sort of excuse for that
i love it i'm passionate about it i enjoy it i have it's hard pleasure you know it's
brilliant and i like the challenge of it and like you know i chose not to have kids i don't have a partner it's it's
the passion point of my life is my work and that's right but that doesn't mean i need to be you know not going out and seeing my
mates it doesn't mean i need to be up until midnight tapping out emails you know i mean i can still i take days off
i you know i live a normal life but i work really really hard i've i've also struggled in the
Relationships & Work
relationship department yeah and surprisingly never you know been that good at relationships i've never been able to
hold a relationship down um i can't really see how it happens necessarily i hear you talk to me about that part of
i was gonna call it sacrifice but when it's somewhat intentional yeah when you're aware of it it's hard to call it sacrifice just doesn't
motivate me i know that sounds awful i'm not motivated to have somebody in my life i'm not motivated to be like
i want a partner i want that companionship you know we when i arrived we were chatting about how this
environment that we're all living in actually i i love being on my own i i'm very happy in my own company i'm very passionate
about what i do and i think that fulfills the space that maybe other people
have other that have other passions for right and so yeah it's never been a it's never been a goal of mine i've never dreamt of the
white wedding i've never wanted to and there's never a bit of me that sits at home and thinks i wish i had someone to sit and watch television ever
that doesn't doesn't even cross my mind and my mates are always like do you not get lonely or do you not worry and i'm like
no i feel like i should because it would make you all feel better but and you know about five or six years
ago because everyone was on at me all the time i'd like did a bit of dating did some internet you know use some apps everything else i
was like this why am i doing this i'm doing this because society wants me to do this i'm doing this because my mates want me to do this this is [ __ ] uh
if it's right if it's right it'll come if it's not it won't did you did you date at all throughout the last
i guess decade did you here and there but it's like kill me you know kill me now you know
that kind of small talk oh god it's like my idea of hell on earth going and meeting a stranger
having small talk slightly awkward with kind of one end game do you know what i mean and it's like
and i'll know within two minutes of that end game's happening and then i'm like i don't really need this bulldog for an hour and a half yeah we don't
need to dress this up so yeah no i just yeah it just never yeah i did a little
bit but it's not it's i'm not looking for that and i think if i'm looking if i if i wanted if i wanted to get married if i wanted to get into a
relationship i could and i'm not i'm not adverse to it but i'm just not out seeking it and i i think you get what you look for
right yeah so other sacrifice um i don't think it's a sacrifice by the way yeah generally i need it no i i
do you know what the reason why when i was younger i wouldn't have thought it was a sacrifice and then i started reading all this stuff about
the importance of like you know 18 19 and 20 even 24 year old steve would have thought you know i don't need to [ __ ]
anybody and i can just i'll be fine i'm a lone wolf yeah and then i fully went for the whole recluse
thing like wholeheartedly and i was broke so i had no choice anyway
so i was broke and i was just not this renegade that was determined to build build businesses and then i started reading some stuff
and it talked about the importance of like meaningful connections and relationships and i realized that i didn't really have those and if i was going to become wildly
successful then it would just be me and my louis vuitton bag set up inside of my house and i and then and then i
started to change my perspective and thought steve you know what you need to create a little bit more openness or balance towards that stuff
so i tried a little bit more but that doesn't i see i see i have incredibly meaningful
relationships and incredible connections i have my friend i have like five or six friends who are
my world i mean i'm incredibly close to them they are they're kids they're you know my god children i feel very very connected i
don't feel isolated in any way i don't feel like i'm missing out or sort of not having to and i actively
participate in the lives of my friends kids and in my friends lives and i think that that's my connection that's my tribe you
know i mean they and you know i would go to war for them and it's it i just don't think that that added bit
of a companion for me right now you know i'm not saying not forever but i'm not sure that bit for me is
something that i need and i think that it's that there's a difference there because i do agree with you i think you should absolutely have to have
connection the human condition is to feel connected to feel part of something to to feel you know sort of the that you'll
have a purpose within your community and i think having your own community and having your own tribe is crucial
i don't think that needs to be through companionship with one other human being there's a pressure that you talked about
the societal pressure you know and i've got to be honest right i'm going to be completely honest because i would be really dishonest if i didn't
say this i have been guilty of when i have a friend who is struggling
in that department feeling like i need to help them because again that's my own world if you
pressed upon them i'm thinking well in order but in order for me to be happy i would need that so i need to make sure you have that thing right
that pressure especially for women is intense post 30 and it causes a ton of anxiety i see
it in my direct messages from strangers um not easy well it's interesting though so
when i'm 42 now and the pressure drops away because i think you get to the point where people think it's rude to ask if you're going
to have kids because they're like can you still have kids okay right fine you get to that age right but but certainly all through my
30s when you're going to settle down do you not want to have children and i and i feel very very lucky
that i feel the way i do i've never really had a biological clock that's ticked ever and i've never felt the need for
companionship of one other person like i said my tribe is very important to me but
and i think that's potentially biological so i think i'm lucky i don't because i do i have friends who
you know they would they're desperate to meet someone they're desperate to have children they're desperate to move on to that bit of their life and
i've just never felt like that so it and i feel very lucky because of that because i think if i'd have felt like that my whole life would be very
different does nurture play a role in that because i know it did for me yeah my my parents were toxic for each other
like watching my mom scream at my dad for seven hours a day every my mom's like this african nigerian woman and that the this
decibel she's able to achieve is like gold medal worthy she is unbelievable at shouting right and she can do this
amazingly high energetic scream for seven hours a day without flinching and i watched that as a kid growing up
my dad sat there this passive english man who didn't say a word ever and this african woman just
just torturing him with this loud sound and me thinking like the lesson i
learned was relationships are prison and for this is the lesson i like for a man
you are trapped and it's torture so any time when i was young like 16 a girl would like me and i'd
chase her and i'd try and get her on the playground whatever minute she said she liked me deep feeling inside of me of like escape
quick so i would like come up with all these reasons why girls that i just spent the last year pursuing
why we were not right and we couldn't be together and she needed to leave me alone and i i didn't notice that until i was
like 25 and then i started to work on that part okay but nurture does that play a role do you think in your
views on relationships or men or whatever or women or whatever i think it probably plays a role in my view of
having kids because my mum was adopted so my mum literally didn't know who her mom and dad was she
was kind of picked out of an orphanage by my grandparents um and never hadn't until she had david
and i had never met anyone who looked like her you know like we all you know connect to our families because we've got families
similar features whatever she'd never had that and so my mum loves my brother and i with a kind of
wonderfully oppressive kind of dominate and it's you know she she just loves us
with everything that she's got because we're we're for a whole host of reasons but also i think because we're the only physical
you know sort of biological connection she's ever had and that love always used to scare me a little bit
you know not from her but i used to think like i've got dogs and i worry about my dogs and i've got
like nine god children i've got two nephews and a niece and the minute they get on a plane or they go i'm panicking like what if the plane
crashes what if they die what if it's like i can't handle it and i'm like jesus if i'd have had my own kids
that would i wouldn't have been able to handle the that amount of love i know that sounds ridiculous but i
think that always played quite a big part for me that i was like the responsibility of it the constantly
having to worry about it the constant all of my female friends who have kids
they live in a state of almost permanent anxiety because they worry about their kids all the time in a in a love way you know it's like
that wrong love you have for a puppy um but and i don't think i ever i've
never felt that i wanted that in my life i never thought that i needed it and i never felt that i wanted it i always felt quite like
no i'm good i've got the right amount of love going on in my life i don't want that additional
responsibility and burden in many ways of having something that is always ever present and and would
cause me i think quite a lot of anxiety is that in part because you have so much
responsibility and naturally honestly worry that comes from your other love in life which is
your career yeah for sure yeah because that's the way i feel it's like a kid as well i really have yeah yeah and it's why i don't think i need a
companion because i already have i get so fulfilled from my job i get so
i get so much from that and so much from kind of working in and around people and having that kind of
i've got the community of my friends and the community of my work and i think those those two things i find very fulfilling
so the idea of having a companion or children or anything else in the mix of that didn't really ever appeal to me in
interest i mean i was i was engaged to be married when my brother got uh served his band say 2004. and i've
been with the guy for like i don't know seven years and i remember like moving into our how we bought a house
together in shepherd's bush and we moved into the house and i remember like vividly putting the key in the door
turning the lock and thinking i don't want this like i don't want this i loved him to bits he was an amazing guy but i was
like i don't want this kind of i don't want to be in a normal life with a normal husband and a
house and kids and i just didn't want it i wanted something different i've got a tattoo that says a lifeless ordinary i just wanted to just do it
differently and i don't know where that came from but i've had it my whole life that kind of i just don't
i just didn't feel the need to conform to society's kind of pillars overcame you go to university
and then you're going to get a job and then you're going to meet a guy and then you're going to get married then you're going to have kids i was always like not interested
any idea why no and i'm fascinated by it because i feel very blessed because of it because it's like i say i think it's it
given me a freedom that a lot of people don't have had you wanted it had you wanted that
you know you know the typical life that society says people have to live and followed all the timelines and
milestones do you think you would have been able to achieve as much as you have i was in my head my ego was going i
would have been amazing at it i'd have been like a boss um no because
i don't think you can i don't i you know i'm i'm a feminist i'm a you know i'm absolutely passionate about equality i'm
passionate about women's ability you know women can do anything that men can do and should have the opportunity to do that but i equally don't think it's possible
to have it all i really don't i don't think you can have and i know there are women who do and perhaps off to them i think it's
incredible you read about these women in the city who've got like five kids and they're ceos and it's like
fair play to you but i couldn't do that because i would feel constantly compromising and i don't like compromise
and you're obsessive a little bit in terms of your focus i don't like compromising i yeah i
probably am obsessive makes it sound a bit like it's it's i'm not in control of it i'm in control i'm aware of what i'm doing
but it's a bit like i so i'm we were talking about having a peloton and you know i kind of feel if i'm going to go all in
on my fitness and my health and get lean and everything from my 40th i got like down to 65 kilos i was like a boss
and i was like all over it but then i was a bit like crap i've got to do my job as well and i sort of feel like i'm i'm not great at doing
having two or three focuses i can i can go at one thing and be brilliant at it but if i start
adding in layers of complexity like i can stay on top of my health i can stay on top of my fitness
but i can't if once i start going down there right i'm gonna get super lean i find it hard to manage my work do you
know what i mean so i don't know there's obsession or whether it's just my opinion i'm myopic sure yeah if people were to you know people they
How to be successful like you
read about you online and they say you've been the ceo of this amazing sports team you ran your own agency before that
you're now the ceo of bell's staff a lot of people especially young women are going to think that's exactly what i
want to do they're going to think that's amazing there's always a disclaimer that comes with all of these things what is the
disclaimer in terms of the cost of the success you've achieved what are the things that you know if i'm
you you would turn to me as a as a young aspiring ambitious person and say by the way before you follow in my
footsteps here's what you need to know you know i wouldn't have fun because i think yeah i really wouldn't
i i feel exceptionally blessed i feel really i love what i do i've loved the journey
i've been on like all the mistakes i've made and like i said at the beginning you know i've been very very lucky to be allowed
to make all kinds of mistakes and then not follow me around it's like i've been kind of
carried and supported and encouraged to to fail and to try and to do stuff that other
people just wouldn't have got the chance to do so i'd be like no go for it like don't don't
worry about it like don't worry about [ __ ] up don't worry about making mistakes let's get on with it what would you tell me though that i had
to have in terms of my qualities would you say okay well if you're going to follow my footsteps then you're going to need a little bit of this and a little
bit of that it's so hard isn't it stephen because you can't follow in someone's footsteps
that's true it's impossible and that's the thing i think that people you know i would say you can't you can
have your own footsteps and you can go into your own thing and jesus if someone says to me at 25 this is the career path you're going to
follow i've been like there's just no way there's no way i could tell someone how they're going to do that because it's bonkers i explain to people some you
know people like oh you know tell me a bit about your background and i i hear myself saying it i'm like that's
bonkers so i don't you can follow in someone else's footsteps but i do think it's like a bit like the beginning i was like you
know just be yourself you know be nice to people be approachable
take the opportunities when they're given to you recognize that sometimes things are scary and you're going to have to do it scared
and actually change is sometimes the best thing that can happen to you and you know all those things that you read
in cliche memes on instagram they're pretty much true you know what i mean it is it's and you've just got to
take that approach in life because you're not going to get another one but it's not easy fran it's the stress
of your job it must be pretty intense you're running now um a big company that's you know in the
process of like sort of turning themselves around and kind of reinventing themselves to some degree and i know the stuff that you have to
deal with because i've dealt with it yeah but i'm not curing cancer but it's i feel like a lot of it's relative
right still big problems are big problems for relative to the challenge you're facing so like that's i guess tell me about
that perspective though because a lot of people would be like oh my god that's a tough you know you're in a tough job and there's problems everything i'm so
lucky steven that's the thing i think you're like i'm so someone you know an incredibly successful
man bought a business three years ago and has said to me it's not working very well i i really like what i've seen you do in
the two years i've been exposed to you could you go and run it for me it's like yes yeah i'll go and do that
what a great opportunity and i'm and i'm just it's i just feel very lucky and yeah they're big challenges and you
know brexit at the moment's bonkers and all our shops are shut because i've covered and i'm having to meet and work with new people but
you know i wouldn't change it for the world i think it's i think i'm i think if you can and this is where steve peters has been so powerful
because he's like it it's a bit about it not defining you you just just try your best dude and that was you
know what uh jim ratcliff actually text me i text and say thank you very much for the opportunity we're not friends we don't like hang out
thank you so much for the opportunity this is incredible because i hadn't spoken to him about it at all it was all via sort of you know determined in the business and he just
he just replied and said fran the only thing i can ask you to do is your best and you know when you're like
the freedom of that the the op and that's what dave b has always been like he's like you can just do your best friend you can't there's nothing more
you can do in life and i think if you release yourself of expectations and what's the standard you've got this
don't get me wrong i did not feel like this for the last 10 15 years this has been in the last probably two years
that i started to realize you know what what is the worst that's gonna happen like what's the worst case scenario here
bellstar folds let's say or when i was in the cycling team we didn't win the biggest bite race
or you know whatever as long as no one's dying as long as nothing's you know that as long as people are okay
the people are okay i'm kind of i'm kind of all right with it you know it's
just there's life and one of the things i mean i completely i completely understand i tend to believe that anything caring
about anything beyond your best is like anxiety and worry and useless yeah it's like that mark twain quote isn't it it's like there's a men they'll
spend their whole lives worrying about stuff that's never actually going to happen and isn't it that's what worry is because you're worrying about something it hasn't even happened yet or that sort
of um there's a brilliant renee brown podcast where she talks about foreboding joy
and it's this idea that you something really exciting is happening but all you're thinking about is [ __ ]
what if it goes wrong so rather than enjoying the joy of it the kind of you know she
uses the example that she's on the plane to go to her first oprah appearance and she's like i spent the entire plane journey
there worrying the plane was going to crash then i spent the whole car journey there wearing that i was going to make a mistake on the show or say something
stupid then i spent the whole time in the green room worrying i was wearing the wrong outfit and at no point did i stop and think i'm
going on oprah this is amazing and it's that isn't it it's like i think you can burden yourself with all this
responsibility and all these kind of negatives and actually it's like we just
want an opportunity why don't you try and flip it try and see the world in a bit more of a positive light and i feel like that
that's something i'm really working on for myself because i just think like i say we only get one of them you get this one opportunity i've been very
lucky there's nothing in my life touchwood that has caused real trauma or you know that i feel that
i would go back and change and i think when you're halfway through that's not a bad place to be
Belstaff
you took the job uh in the middle of the midst of covered yeah it was october the 1st first started october
the 1st that's brave in retail i know i'm crazy that's well
yeah yeah brave no but being positive being optimistic about it you're coming into this business and it's um i mean it's been smashed in all
directions by all things um what's your what's your what's your what's your approach what's your strategy what are you thinking
i mean at the moment well the first three months in the business i just wanted to get to know everyone there so i did one to one to everyone
i think it's really easy to kind of go into business with preconceptions of what's gone wrong and what what you'd fix and i tried i spoke to all the kind
of mentors i've worked with over the years and said like what would you and they all gave me the same advice which was
speak to people listen don't make any rash decisions you know wait get up get a proper plan but give
it you know the kind of 100 days piece and initially i was like i don't need to do that and actually you
just really do you know so i've just spent just trying to understand how it went and the other thing is understand the industry you know like i
literally knew nothing about the other than i buy clothes i didn't know anything about fashion so so yeah so and now my plan is i you
know as is always my ambition i want to do the best possible job of it i believe in bell staff as a brand um i
think it's an incredible brand with an incredible history i think the product is amazing i think the design team have been doing a
brilliant job over the last three years getting the product to a place that's really true to who we are as a company
um and i and i would really love to take it to profitability and beyond you know i really i really believe that it's
possible to do that and i think you know we're lucky to have the backing of jim and ineos to support us through what is going to
be quite a significant period of transition and change but then i think we build the foundations for growth and go from there and retail's changed a lot
yeah totally you know thinking about the high street and how you know in e-commerce and the
internet now like there's anyways we saw debenhams being bought by boohoo and it's also just
bought topman and some of the other arcadia brands it's a moment of transition that's been
accelerated by this pandemic what's your thinking about the changes with in retail i mean god
i'm so early to it you know but i mean i think like anything it's just i think it's
accelerated what was happening anyway right like the high streets were were dying people were moving online
i think the rapidity of that change has just been you know it accelerated massively so
people's behavior around how they're shopping was was on the cusp of quite significant change i think
that change has flipped massively so you know people are much much happier shopping online even like an older
generation who historically wouldn't have been i do fundamentally believe when we all start opening up again people are really
going to want to go shopping you know and i think people are going to this idea that people aren't going to go to the shops i'm not sure i buy it because i think it's
like yeah you want to get out let's go and do stuff even you might want to stephen
there's always hope isn't that you know i see shopping is not actually for the purpose of shopping i see it as an
experience and i see the internet as a place where if i almost the utility and shopping is like a
thing to do right yeah so i do i do wonder if retail will will seize hold of that part and have the
experience experience yeah exactly i think that it's going to have to because i don't think it's ever going to be there to be making money
so i think it's going to be about adding on the experience of the brand for people particularly for our brand you know we we can create an experience and a story
and a narrative that other brands maybe can't you have a 96 years old so yeah we've got all of that heritage
that i think we can speak to so i think i definitely think that experiential piece will be quite a big play over the next few years this
Are you scared of dying?
is a morbid question but i like to ask it sometimes i think sometimes are you scared of dying
no no are you no i was when i was religious up
until about 18 years old and then once i realized that i was going to the same place that i came from which was nothingness and peace
it was quite a liberating feeling and i thought death was actually i would dare i say not a good thing but
um not something to be scared of interestingly i had to uh when would it have been so
three three years ago i crashed my bike and landed on my head and i got like i mean for some reason
whenever i crashed my back i landed either my face or my head and i landed on my head towards your brains it's just
i wish and um our team doctor at the time was like because i'd got a bit of concussion he was like i think you
should go and get a brain scan he's very over cautious so i went and got an mri and mike they've made my mum come up because
i don't have her husband so after that that's the one downside actually to being single is that whenever you have
to have like somebody come and look after you it's like mum i'm 42 years old but please could you come and stay at my house um so my mum
had to come up because of the concussion i wasn't allowed to go home on my own and i got this phone call from a brain
surgeon who had been given my mr they looked at my mri and they'd found all these patches in my
brain and he was like there's these we've found is are you he rang me and he's like are you with someone and i was like
yeah and he's like oh we've got yeah and he's like we've got a [ __ ] just tell me bedside manner he's
improving um and he said um we've got your brain scans we've gone through them and they're
we're seeing changes in your brain and you know when you're like but i've never had an mri so how can you
how can you have how are there changes anyway long story short i've got all of these unusual patterns
in my brain like patches that could be they were like they could be potentially the starts of tumors they could be
just your i know right they could until you went through excuse me rude i had to go and like so i went with
my best mate actually and go meet the brain surgeon he talked us through it and i mean she it was one of those hilarious and
horrible situations all at the same time because he was sort of going through because she she works the nhs and she's
like what could what else could it be if it's not team as well could it be and he's like well you know have you ever been like a very heavy
drug user and we're both like no and she was like yeah she was like this week lizzy we don't need to go into
this he means heroin she's like oh yeah no no we've never done heroin um and so and she was asking all these questions
and so basically i had about a year period where they weren't sure what it was they still aren't i still have them
and it's symptom-based so they're like we could do biopsies and see what it is and i'm like nah you're all right um or or if i ever
develop symptoms which would be you know sort of electric pulsing or anything like that and i think that period is
quite good for me because it and it's probably where a lot of the positivity in there actually doing what you only get one chance thing came from
because i i was a bit like [ __ ] if i have tumors kept growing in my brain
that's quite intense and what does that mean for my life like what would i change like what would i do
differently and i genuinely i remember being sat in my living room having everyone had gone home by this
point and i sort of had had my first proper other ski it's like a two-hour mri which is quite intense
and i was like you know i wouldn't change anything i would carry on living my life the way i live it now i wouldn't change anything i would i
would probably go deeper and harder in some of the things that i really enjoy because i like my job and seeing my mates i
would keep spending the money the way i spend it i literally wouldn't change anything and i was like and it felt it literally felt quite freeing it was like
great this is this is good because i think a lot of people would get that kind of diagnosis and be like right [ __ ] what do
i need to do differently and i didn't have anything that i thought no i wanted i don't want to change but interestingly my
my job has now changed and i think deep down the reason i had the chairman conversation the reason i was willing to
say yes to this opportunity at bellstaff is had i maybe not had that incident and had all of that
associated thinking and sort of bit of deep deep sort of soul-searching i maybe wouldn't i maybe
would have said no it's right i'll stay at cycling but i just thought you know what [ __ ] it let's go and give it a try
what an absolute blessing that is to know to know that you wouldn't change anything i think i am i have this sand timer
is it behind me somewhere is it there it's usually sat behind me but the reason i have a sand timer in my
house is because it's that sort of visual it's the only way you can really see time at some point i realized that um i was
getting older and that you don't notice and that you can fall into the trap of thinking and as i think most people do that will just
like live forever yeah and it's not until you realize that life is finite you have those those moments that you realize that you
know like at some point i'm gonna die and seeing my time pouring away is that reminder of like is this
important and am i making the right decisions am i living true to myself um and i wrote a little article about
that called deathbed thinking which pretty much says the same thing which is that giving you that perspective of from your deathbed potentially you know
what what really matters remarkable um i mean i'm so i'm so
inspired by your story and every time i sit down with someone um who's become a success in their
career or their you know step issue i i it feels like there's similar themes but so so different in so many ways
What does the future hold for you
what what does the future hold for you do you think do you know any ideas you're going to end up world
domination right no exactly no i would believe you if you said that that's the funny thing i took that
seriously i don't know what the future holds and i don't really mind like i don't mind i sort of as long as
as long as my family and friends are healthy and happy and as long as you know actually that's all that
matters as long as my friends and family are happy and healthy and then i'm pretty cool with whatever the world throws at
me i'm i'm sure it will be a laugh it'll be fun everyone else seems to need a plan no that's that's five year plan three
year plan don't get me wrong i used to have five year plans but they're all hilarious when i go back and look at my five year plans i'm like oh i love how
ambitious i was like where's that yacht
i think when i was a kid i was very i remember actually when i set my agency up my best mate and i set it up together and we got a coach
and we were about 22 23 and the coach was like right go off into separate rooms and write out where
you want to be in 10 years time and then come back in and read them to each other and we were best mates like we lived together for like three or four
years set a business up together he was dating my best friend we came back in and he and we had them base right like written
on a piece of paper like holding from each other and he was like right i want to be running a successful business earning a
good salary i want to be living in a nice house with a wife and three children um and i want to be healthy and happy
and i was like oh [ __ ] you've done it you're listening i want a yacht and a chair i want to have loads of
money yeah i was literally i had this like really materialistic list about wanting to be like successful
in a global sensation and have all this money and all this cold 23 22 23
did you have stuff growing up material stuff yeah we were quite not i mean when mike was my dad my dad was in the
raf so to begin with you know middle class but then when he left to go to hong kong he went into civil aviation
in kind of the glory of the expats so definitely very very lucky and i got you know business class travel everywhere yeah so
it was pretty next level yeah it's incredible that you've wanted it for you it's so bad but now i wouldn't i
wouldn't want that list now but it was just it was that really interesting like oh okay we want totally different things
and i i didn't have partner i didn't have kids i didn't have a nice house anywhere i was like i wanted the i wanted the universe you
know i mean i want to go over there and do something massive well you've smashed it fran and i'm sure you've you've been paid well along the
way for that um money the money becomes irrelevant though right the money is not the money is just a great tool for
helping my friends and family for doing cool stuff with people so having experiences
i spend all the money i earn doing stuff with the people i love
give me an example uh took my sister-in-law to dubai for her 40th birthday with my best mate we stayed on
the palm with an amazing time i've sort of took my brothers back to hong
kong for his 40th i take my friends on holidays i yeah i just
go and do stuff with the people i love experiences i spend my money on experiences going and doing stuff seeing stuff but always with the people i love
and none of my mates can afford to go to the hotels i go to so i was like well i'll just pay because i don't want to stay in a rugby
showtime so i can relate well listen thank you so
much for all of your time today it's been truly fascinating and even you know researching your background and your mindset has been um really really inspiring and
energizing for me and i can relate to so many elements and the other other elements i'm just amazed and impressed by so thank you for
your time i know you're incredibly busy person so it feels like an additional honor for you to have said yes to come and chat to me today
um and where can people find you i guess just you know these days it's pretty easy you just google someone's name but yeah i don't do i i have a private
instagram and i do i'm on twitter but i don't really use it very often so and i'm rubbish with linkedin well if they want to speak
to enough i'm sure they'll find me they'll find me yeah and thank you so much for inviting me it's been fascinating i've really enjoyed talking
to you thank you thanks people ask me for book recommendations
all the time and i finally got one for you it's a book called happy sexy millionaire
which is authored by me i spent the last almost two years in jungles around the
world in costa rica and indonesia in solitude writing this book it's the most important thing i've ever
created and there's this crazy thing when you write a book because you spend so much time pouring your
heart and soul into it and everything you know and all of the revelations you've had in your life and then there's this barrier which is
that people have to buy the thing in order for them to get that thing that means so much to you i wish that wasn't the case
it's just the way the industry is and in order to get that distribution and to get it on shelves you need a publisher so
please please please if you can if you've ever liked anything i've ever produced this podcast my instagrams
anything i've ever said read this book there was no ghostwriter i wrote every single word myself there's
some real surprises in there it's an honest sometimes hilarious incredibly vulnerable hopefully valuable recount of my life my
journey everything i've learned across across the way and really the answer to being fulfilled to being happy and to
achieving success it is the most important important thing i've ever created so i implore you to go
to amazon now or wherever you get your books and get that pre-order and everybody that pre-orders the book because pre-orders
in this crazy publishing industry count as way more than just a normal sale if you get that pre-order i'm going to
put you into a group with everybody that's pre-ordered it and i'm going to send you some exclusive stuff so the first things i'm going to
do is a series of voice notes which i think are um are going to be pretty powerful i'm going to give you access to some tickets
which nobody else will have and i'm going to do everything i can to thank you for for giving me that sort of nine quid of your money whatever it is
happy sexy millionaire you can pre-order it everywhere now and if you do get that pre-order please do dm me because i'd
love to thank you myself

you

Transcription:

Intro
you were the vp of twitter obviously donald trump has just been booted off twitter permanently what do
you think about that there's a 70 year long study out of yale university looking at what
the the secret of longevity and happiness is and the secret of longevity and happiness is
work the thing we spend the majority of our lives doing today's guest is an expert on exactly
that how can you be an expert on work bruce daisley spent the last
five to ten years studying what makes work joyous what makes it miserable how we
get burnt out and what matters the most when it comes to work he's been named one of the most influential londoners in the uk has been
named as one of the most influential britons in the united kingdom bruce daisley's book the joy of work became the best
selling business hardback book in 2019 he has his own podcast so he's one hell of a talker as well
and as the world has transitioned over the last 10 months to this zoom-centric remote working lifestyle i think now is a great time to ask
ourselves the question what makes work enjoyable how can we get the most out of work how do we avoid
burnout and how do we maximize our motivation bruce has the answers so without further ado my name is
stephen butler and this is the director ceo i hope nobody's listening but if you are
then please keep this to yourself
bruce you were you wrote a i feel like that's an understatement you wrote a smash hit book about
work called the joy of work and i've seen this book absolutely everywhere it's been an absolute phenomenon
so you know considering the fact that the world has fundamentally shifted over the last nine ten months because of this pandemic
and the way we work has changed so much i wanted to get your view of this remote
Your take on this new remote working culture?
working zoom um sort of working culture that has now been forced upon us just before i let
you answer i'm gonna give a little sentence around around my take on it i hate it um and
when when in march when we were forced out as a ceo for business to tell my employees that we're gonna be working from home
and we have this amazing office which gives us all this community um i know that about 50 of my workforce
liked the idea but i 100 hate it for a number of reasons what's your take
so i think at the outset i shared some of your reservations brony brown talks about this thing which
is collective effervescence and it's a it's a good way she's she's coined to turn for something you see
quite a lot in social science that even the introverts amongst us actually quite like being around people
in in some scenarios and we get far more of our energy from the tribe
were in and the people were surrounded with then would probably admit and so when it first happened
look the defining thing about work for me is laughing every day i if i laugh every day and i you know in
the organizations i've been in they've been at times incredibly stressful we've had
you know at times when i was at twitter there was just for good reason there was like big headlines
demanding stressful scenarios but either the sort of the dark humor
that you find in those moments or the moments of levity that you can just get if you're around people that
you trust soldiers talk about this or firefighters talk about this you know you can find human and i used to love that so the idea of
shifting to a world where somehow we're plugging into the matrix and we were losing
that camaraderie that kinship that we get from being around other people i wasn't
necessarily the the biggest advocate of it i think what's clear though
is that we've fundamentally moved into a different world and some of those preconceptions that we might have had
might have been partly ill-judged so so so working through those things that the number one thing we know uh 91 of
people say they want to continue working in some capacity when you look at the numbers of that
people say broadly say they want to work at home three or four days a week so there's
some firms saying we're going to let people work one day a week or two days a week at home people workers want to work more than
that so there's going to be some degree of of balance and we're going to achieve an equilibrium
so that's the demand side of it and in fact when you look at all age groups young or old there is a slight
difference so younger workers have said that they were they're happy at home but they they it's
close to how happy they were in the office and we can partly understand that a lot of young workers don't have
home offices they don't have nice desks they're sitting on their bed or they're sitting on the table that
sits at the end of their bed so they're working in slightly different scenarios but even they report they're more
productive and happier than than that they were in a big open plan office so that's the first thing older workers are
significantly happier if you've got a bit of space it seems to correlate with you feeling really happy
so broadly all of the evidence suggests actually the experience of it has been at least
unbalanced positive so then you look at the the other side and i guess it's firms
and it's really growing evidence that firms are recognizing that something has fundamentally changed
bloomberg did something interesting the business people they did an analysis of all the earnings calls so all these transcripts of like
big bosses reporting to shareholders what they think is going to happen and
bloomberg say that already about one in eight firms are talking about making their offices smaller the ft did something
where they said about half of british firms are already talking about their offices being smaller so
whether it's that demand side or whether it's that supply side almost certainly we're going into something that's going
to look and feel a bit different to what we were used to before if you had to guess um i i completely
resonate with that i think even for our organization we realized how much money i'll be honest how much
money we could save by not having an office because it's not just the rent it's the the cleaning the electricity it's the
food in the cupboards you know the maintenance of a what was a 20 000 square foot office in manchester
uh and you you stripped back those costs and you know it was that you were forced to realize that it is possible for there to be another
way and i think at first we were we were skeptical that our business could run in
completely remotely then we realized it could and then we moved into phase three which was like okay but what have we lost now and it
was it was it was definitely a phase three thing because in phase two we're like oh everything's fine in phase three we're like now we've got
a problem because we've lost the uh the sense of community that our
company was giving to our employees and for a company like ours community was a huge part of our our
value-add you know we are the sterile stereotypical like millennial office with like the slides and the ballpark
and the freedom and um and a real sense of strong community where pretty much everyone lives together
and so in phase three of this sort of this sort of mental journey what we saw and i actually resigned just
after in about september time what we saw was a bit of an exodus of our employees because now
they're sad at home they're looking at their to-do lists and that they're now thinking the
remuneration or the value i'm getting from this job is this amount of money and i'm doing
these set of tasks so now i think i can get more money down the street at that place that
has no working culture whilst i'm still going to be sad at home and it will be a similar set of tasks
and it was it was astonishing it was astonishing how many people um are being completely honest because i
have no reason not to be honest we almost never lost good people the month just before and after i left
we we lost our the largest number of employees we've ever lost by a fault factor of 10.
yeah and it's fascinating so let's look into that because you're exactly you spot on these the big themes that
are emerging now firstly how can you make people feel like the part of something when the old way they felt part of something
was the energy they had when they're around people right you know there is some buzz and and it's not an
exaggeration i've chatted to some of the world's leading experts and they say good workplaces do have a buzz
to them they have almost like this tangible energy um and i think that's one of the challenges we've got
now if you've got a situation where people on video calls back to back and you know it might be not with the
big boss it might be with clients they're dealing with or it might be with customers they've got to keep happy
but if there aren't back-to-back meetings with those people then they can just feel well look that's
going to be exactly the same wherever i go we're not going to have the same energy and there's far more evidence that
when people feel part of something bigger than themselves it's transformational so i've been i'm
writing something about resilience at the moment a book about resilience and what you discover is that actually
what you hear about resilience is that people tell you all these myths about resilience that it's this individual
strength or it's this it's this trait that we can do develop and what you discover about resilience
is it's normally a collective thing it's because you feel part of a resilient community you
feel like you've got the strength of others to draw upon you feel like you can tap into something one person in some of
the research i was reading said you can't be a resilient on your own and there's so much truth in that
now what does that mean for the way we're working right now well if you've got someone in a bed seat or a studio flat or a flat
chair and they're sitting on their own all day and they feel lonely it's almost certain that those reserves
of resilience are being tapped and you know there's one thing that psychologists talk about all the time it's this notion
of of affect it's sort of it's a fancy way of saying mood it's a psychologist a way of saying
mood and what you discover about affect is that the the mood we're in is really
influential on a lot of the things on our experience of life and the uh creativity and our sense of
collaboration so scientists talk about positive affect and negative affect and positive affect best way i can sort
of frame uh positive affect it it suggests that like the mood we're in transforms some of the decisions we make
and the best way i can frame that is that when you're a kid growing up whether your main carer is a grandparent or a
parent or a a guardian but you knew from the age of four or five you knew that it was a good time to ask
for something and a bad time to ask for something you knew based on the mood that your carer was in that there was a good time
to ask for something a bad time but affect the mood we're in affects uh decisions well the situation we're all going
through right now is not positive affect it's a negative affect loads of people are feeling burnt out
average person during lockdown has been working about an extra 45 minutes a day that's on the back of the average
working day has gone up by two hours in the last 10 years so people are finding themselves in this
lonely unaffiliated disconnected sense of exhaustive burnout so it's no
wonder people are quitting their jobs because they just don't feel like the good version of them that they used to feel like you know the contrast as well
so this idea of contrast where you can remember how your job used to be and if your job used to be a 10 and now
because it's because a central part of what made it a 10 say the community or the culture in the office or you know that sense of camaraderie
or that sense that you know you were a group of people working together towards a goal now you're kind of sat in your bedside on your own on the
end of your bed doing a to-do list um if your company was a 10 because of that culture and it's now dropped down to a
six something in my mind makes me think that those companies will actually hurt more
versus the companies that were like an eight before and an hour a six um and that's part of what i think with
with our company social chain because culture was such a big thing that people must be thinking oh my god what the hell is this
um being sat alone and we try i think you know i can't speak to the company now because i'm no longer there but i know there was ample efforts with all
as with all companies to do these like zoom bingo things and that lasted a month before everyone got sick to death of that but you mentioned
What causes burn out?
the word burn out there uh a very popular phrase a topic of much mystique as well i think um i saw
your ted talk about the topic of burnout and i saw your your thoughts there i guess my my question is what causes burnout
in your view yeah there was a really interesting there was a a really interesting book that just came
out last year and it was based on a a successful article that had sort of blown up on
buzzfeed by a woman called an helen peterson and she talked about she the premise of her article really
good article worth searching for is the the millennials of the burnout generation you remember that one i think
maybe you showed it right there's all these matchy matches and what she said is she said and she'd encountered it as a journalist
she's thinking i'm feeling something i wonder if i could capture it and she was thinking is there such thing as errand paralysis
so what she means by that is that she was getting to the end of like these productive working days
and then she would get back to her flat and she would she would open a bill or she had she had something she needed
to do and she just didn't have the energy this high performing really successful person didn't have the
energy to get those things done and so she was thinking in her head is this some sort of weird
um this sort of duality that you can be really accomplished at one set of things but you can't
others she started looking into it and she realized it's not that you're avoiding one thing
you're just exhausted and her lesson was that any time we teach we treat our energy as infinite that's
when burn out comes and it we so often do it we we treat the idea that we can work
all the time and the best examples i can give you are the ones where we actually check in on ourselves so i i
used to find myself day job working at twitter worked on twitter for eight years i used to
uh when i was especially guilty of this i used to have back-to-back meetings on monday what's the consequence of back-to-back
meetings your inbox is is exploding it's it's absolutely overloaded and so i used to get home on a monday
night get myself a cup of tea deal with all my domestic responsibilities and i would sit there
and work and do emails for about four hours and just try and catch up with what i was doing
and i quite often i would check myself and about nine o'clock i'd be spending as much time changing
the music as i would doing emails or one long email that's like a two-pager who sends these emails these
criminals sending long emails but i'd find myself reading this you know that feeling where you read it
i'll just read that again and then read it again and what you discovered there's this science for this it's called ego depletion
and the people who look into this say that our brains are sort of far more finite far more limited than we
might imagine our brains are far closer if you want a metaphor for it our brains are far closer to the batteries on our
phone than the infinite broadband that we we normally deal with so your brain's sort of got a certain
amount of charge in it and when you use it and so the way you'll you'll witness this is maybe you walk into
a situation and someone asks you a question at the end of a long day or whatever and you're like hang on can you just
just give me a minute just give me a minute or someone asks you something really complicated just as you're about
to oh okay hang on can we just give and effectively our brains are sort of far more finite
once you recognize that you start thinking okay i wonder if that should influence the way i think about
doing my job and and of course burnout is one of the things where we don't treat our energy as finite it is
it is uh finite but we don't treat it like that and the end result is then we just feel like we're running on empty
we're running on vapors and so when you look into it the world health organization uh recognize burnout as a real
phenomenon and they say that burnout is is all about when our energy feels spent when we feel
emotionally exhausted they talk about this other thing called depersonalization where when you're really burnt out you don't
necessarily construe other people as full and
empathetic individuals but sometimes you're a bit sort of dismissive of other people or you're a
bit reductive of their motives or you start seeing people around you as an annoyance so in the old days if you ever
found that the person you sat next to their chewing or their tapping was driving you crazy that can be a little
bit of an exam example of deep personalization so it's a real phenomenon it's uh i think to my mind it makes you
rethink the way you work so if you knew okay the most i can do every day
is eight productive hours of work and you can you know there are evidence to suggest you can do more than that but if you
started treating it like that and said maybe actually if i'm honest it's not a really high intensity productive hours
but maybe it's five or six really good hours and then you know other stuff is dealing with email or dealing with
with phone calls it i suspect it would change the way you made decisions and you see evidence of this barack
obama used to have someone who followed him round who uh barack obama never chose his
lunch in eight years because this person just made all his decisions for him and you see albert einstein said something
similar einstein used to wear that same outfit every day and uh it was because he knew when he
got to his lab when he got to the the place he was making uh decisions he knew that if he went there and he
hadn't cluttered his brain with all these little micro decisions he was he just felt a bit more
imaginative inventive creative so we see evidence of it in other people's behavior but normally when it
comes to us we don't treat our brains like that we don't treat it like something we need to protect
our energy to protect we we tend to treat our energy as infinite but that's why burnout comes just
does the type of work you know you talk there about eight hours or five hours or whatever it might be does the type of work you're doing and
the amount of intrinsic motivation you have or joy you get from it impact your
likelihood of being burnt out yeah because like because that's what i that's what i suspected in my life
because the people that i've seen that get burnt out and this is all anecdotal and there's no scientific evidence really to
support these these assertions but people that i've seen get burnt out the most typically typically especially during
the lockdown working alone often often freelance um often doing a repetitive task
usually doing things that aren't that enjoyable and i had a friend actually come here and sit on the sofa which i've talked about i think in the last few podcasts
and he basically told me that he was feeling a bit burnt out um and uh he was struggling to get out of bed
and go and do the go and do his work in the morning he's a he's a freelance freelancer working on his own in his house he used
to work within teams during pre pandemic and i i was saying to him like think about the things that make your
work enjoyable and what other you know what are the things about work that are intrinsically and
motivating to you all those things have gone right now so now you're just left with waking up alone sitting in front of a
computer and maybe because your intrinsic motivations or the intrinsic joy of your work has been stripped maybe
you're now um encountering burnout i think that resonates with me as well to some degree like if i've ever got close to feeling
unmotivated or quote unquote burnt out it was when i was doing things alone pre-social chain
on my own just for money well there's a couple of things there so two things so like this i think is
all related to resilience so there's two things there the first thing is that the evidence we have is that when we feel an absence of
control we do we generally feel more burnt out so let's think of examples and the research on this some of the best research on
this is about nurses so very timely for the moment we're in right now when nurses choose to work extra hours or you might
have known friends when you were doing jobs before your career where you know i used to work in fast food and some of
those dudes used to work 14 hour shifts and you're like wow where did they get the energy but they were electing to do
it and the evidence we have is that when people choose to do those things it often impacts them less they they
feel like they've got control over it so you know i these guys who used to work with burger king king at me with me and they were doing 100
hour weeks but because they were choosing to do it because it was really important for them to afford a car to do things
they were what you discover is that when you're electing to do it does seem to give you some degree of
protection so control is a really important part the more control we feel over our lives so why might you
now be feeling burnt out because imagine if your company has you on 40 hours of zoom calls a week or your
inbox is always full or you've got a difficult person you have to deal with a client relationship who's phoning you
all the time you might be feeling the absence of control or your your friend who's the the freelancer might be feeling like i'm
just i'm not in control of things but there's a couple of other really important parts and they're about our identity and about
the the sense of community and you get really good evidence of how
when we feel part of something bigger than us and feeling that connection being around people is a really important part of
that it tends to enrich us it tends to to protect us and you see really good
evidence of this you see when people go to hospital if they have like a heart operation or
they have something serious when they come out of hospital the people who reported that they were
part of groups before their chance of survival their chance of avoiding depression
is massively higher than those who live in isolation and look that's the
experiment we're going through right now that you might have wonderful friends that are at the end of a zoom line or a
messenger link or a whatsapp but if you're not around them and to some extent some of the energy we get
from them is dissipating and i think that's the challenge that a lot of us are in right now it's just a very lonely existence we've
got now all of the things that we found nourishing enriching life-affirming a
lot of them have been taken away from us now the challenge go on i was just gonna say i was gonna say um
actually there's a lady that sat in your in your chair yesterday anna hemmings and she's an 11 time or
11 time world gold medal world champion amazing olympian etc etc and she was
speaking to the fact that at one point in her career when she's when she she was training in london to be a kayaker so she's like an
eleven-time world champion kayaker right and then at one point in her career they decided that they wanted her to go to the olympics so she had to
learn sprint kayaking right the coach was in florida so they took her away from her team in london and she had to basically train
on her own via using an email that her her coach in florida was selling her
and after doing that for a couple of months she got chronic fatigue syndrome wow so she was out for two years she said
she couldn't lift her hands and shampoo her and the thing that brought her back was the realization
that taking away her from her team as someone who was a bit of an extrovert and got her energy
from people had um set off a bunch of alarm bells in her body so the the reason that she managed to
recover and come back and win more world titles after two years of literally having this chronic fatigue
syndrome was by realizing that and putting her back with her teams and changing her training which is wow
what a metaphor for what we're going through right and it shows how the mind is so intrinsically connected to the body yeah
people don't think that loneliness or removing you from your tribe
can disable your body yeah or your energy but although there's remarkable amounts of evidence on that so there's a
woman in the u.s called julianne holt lunchtime who's done like a colossal survey
and she appropriates she says loneliness is the equivalent of smoking 15 cigarettes a day
and so you know it has this big impact on us and loneliness is as bigger than obesity in terms of the
health impact it has on you and that's what we're going through right now and for all of these things that we've tried to sort of create these
artificial intel alternatives zoom quizzes and all manner and things like that they just don't
have the same connection of feeling surrounded with someone there's
some evidence as soon as you start looking into these things it's extraordinary what an impact people have on each other
so these one piece of evidence i went up to to oxford to meet the woman who did this research and she took groups of rowers
similar to to the kayaker took groups of roads first and there are oxford university roads you've seen them the colossal
the monsters and she she put the first group individually on rowing machines second group she said okay i want you to
be on a a made-up boat you know you're going to sit on your rowing machines but you've got to be in stroke with each other
and she wanted to see firstly what was the different experience what she noticed was that the firstly
they did about the same exercise it wasn't like someone worked harder than others but she measured the
endorphin levels you do that by uh you put these arm cuffs on people you sort of you subject them to pain and then you
see how much pain they can take and the endorphin levels of the people who'd rode together was twice as high
as the people who'd rode alone and you know you see this with choirs people who sing inquired you know you
can grab strangers off the street get them to sing some abba songs together and you say to them at the end
of it how do you feel they say i feel utterly elated now that's not because singing our songs on its own does it it's
because when you feel some connection with other people even strangers it seems to be
transformational it seems to sort of elevate our mood and all of that has been stripped from us
so you know if you've got i guess you can try to do some approximations of it but all of that has been stripped from
us and i think that's why it's it's inevitable that we are feeling
flat energy-less we it doesn't feel the same right now how do we fix that though and this is i think it's going back to
the start of the conversation why i hate it i hate the lack of connection i hate the lack of community i think are you an extrovert would you
say oh god i really don't know i think on one hand i'm a massive introvert yeah i i i'm people know me i don't like to
do i don't like small talk i like to sit alone for weeks on end i like i went off to the jungle for four weeks in september alone
went off to the costa rican jungle alone so i like that although i have this kind of like you know public speaking and social media brand
so i actually don't know although a lot of introverts like that ability to switch on the public speaking side and
but i think actually the more you look into the introvert extrovert thing it's sort of a compartmentalization that doesn't
necess the vast majority of people sit somewhere and sure exactly i'm the same as you um no but
these uh i i think look the point you raise is there's no easy substitute but there is some evidence i saw an
amazing piece of research and it looked at couples who lived distance relationships
so you know in the uk distance relationship means you're half an hour an hour's drive from someone in the us it means you're like a three
hour flight so they did a piece of research 40 000 couples living distant relationships
and they wanted to know so these were unmarried so they wanted to know the ones who made it through a year what what was the thing that made it through
a year and this was research was done three or four years ago so it's not from a different era of technology but the ones who stayed with each other
for the long term phoned each other every day and you know when they they were asked what you talked about
they said oh we just talked about trivial things so i think so many of us have got into
this frame of mind of thinking well i liked her a photo and i sent a
quick whatsapp saying what i sent a voice note horrific use of technology but they said
but you know we think somehow we've serviced the relationship by doing these things
and actually when you come down to it and maybe future generations will be different but it's it's often quite analog it's
that sense of feeling seen and appreciated so i suspect face time might work the same way
but so many of us are sort of are overwhelmed with these performative zoom calls right now where he's sitting there
with like a celebrity squares a blanky blank uh array of faces in front of you i know
and i wonder if it's that sense of being seen and being heard that probably connects and cuts through a bit more
yeah i think so yeah i just think work is just so much more than the work right i think
especially in the world in the world we live in at the moment where we're getting lonelier as a society i was looking at the stats when i was
writing my book about you know the the when they ask americans for example how many people they can turn to at a time of crisis it
used to be three people a couple of decades ago now they're like medium answer is zero yeah and um i think it was theresa may
that appointed a head of loneliness where loneliness are for the uk and i've seen the stats so i think work is one of the few sort of
i don't know institutions where it still binds us together um and we're not between four white walls tapping glass to order food and
alone speaking to our nan through a piece of glass so it's a shame that that that community that part of community's
gone but anyway moving on creativity something you've talked about at length and
What kills and causes creativity
um for me i've i've always believed that i'm least creative in the office i've always thought
i'm more creative in the gym and in the shower than i am when i'm when i'm sat in a boardroom with a bunch of people
and i know this is something you've spoken about so i wanted to get your take on where we're most creative what kills and causes creativity
yeah i mean look firstly i would all i ever feel in all of these situations is that i feel like i'm a
a vessel that's passing on other people's knowledge so i've found myself being consumed with all these things and
interested in their learning so look let me tell you um what i've i've discovered that
neuroscience is really intriguing the most compelling thing about neuroscience is when you look into it uh neuroscientists used to work on
experimenting on animals you know i'm not i'm not keen on that i was like i was
you know in a protest group about animal experimentation when i was younger um and they used to look at brain
injuries so that used to be the main way that neuroscience worked and it's only the last 20 years that brain scans have had any degree of
sophistication but what they've discovered in like the time that they've had brain scanners is some of the things that they presumed
about the way our brain works aren't necessarily right so let me give you one example but they used to put
people in these brand new brain scanners and they would watch what their their brains did they give them a puzzle they
give them a rubik's cube their brains would light up in these sort of different places and then they'd notice what happened
when people stopped playing on the puzzle and their brains would light up in sort of
loads of places as well and so it was it was baffling what's going on right now they'd say to these people they say oh right sorry i
was a million miles away i was daydreaming so okay right that's interesting your brain's lightened up when you're when you're not
thinking about something when you sort of switched off and so the way that neuroscientists categorize this broadly they say
these three systems of cognition first one is like when you're doing that rubik's cube or
when you're typing an email it's called the executive attention network so it's the main thing you're focusing on
and then you'll know while your executive attention network is watching netflix or while you're writing an email you can
also be aware of like the room you're in that's called the salience network and the third one the third
so there's three of these systems the third one is that one when you're daydreaming the one where you're a
million miles away the one when you're in the shower which is called the default network
but what we discover is that people generally report having their best creative ideas not
when they're frowning into their laptop screen but when they're in these default mode uh situations so you might have it in
the old days if you're on a train somewhere or on a plane somewhere loads of people i've got a friend who says she has all
her best ideas staring out the windows of planes yeah and so you know if that was you then this year has been
an uncreative year but um my favorite example of it is a really famous screenwriter
called aaron sawkin he's written the west wing he wrote there was a um there was a film he had
on netflix just before christmas called the chicago seven he's written all these big things very famous for zingy dialogue so he
wrote the social network film things like that sort of you know um really sort of really what's
better than a million a billion like he's written all these zingy lines and he's realized that uh he has all his best
ideas exactly like you in the shower he said he had he told hollywood reporter magazine he had a shower
installed in the corner of his office and he has eight showers a day and he was asked by them
he was asked by them hang on is this like some weird ocd thing he said not at all i find that
when i you know so i'll be sitting there thinking of something trying to come up with an idea but it's
only when i disengage my brain to something comes to me an idea comes to me and so
what you described is exactly what a lot of these people whose job is to be creative
have recognized and as soon as you know that you start thinking wow okay i need to think differently
about being creative because creativity can then be when i'm sitting at my desk i'm
sort of taking all this inspiration in stimulation ideas but then it's about disengaging
going for a walk going for a cycle ride going to to do a workout might be the moment where the idea hits
you and i don't think necessarily we think about that enough you know if you go back to this idea
that your brain is a bit like your phone battery then some of those moments that effectively can recharge your battery
can be the moments where creativity hits you and inspiration hits you so i think sort of rethinking the way
that we treat a productive week of work of you know these blocks of work
but then moments where you know it might be your personal is you go for a walk every lunch time
that can be far more creative and productive than you might imagine well how do we make our work environments more conducive with
creativity then is there a way or do we just resign to the fact that that's not going to be the best place for our creativity and if we're going to
reach our creative potential it's probably going to be away from the office i think it's about recognizing there's a
yin yang there's a balance of work and and imagination
so i i always loved the example of um charles dickens charles dickens obviously um like
incredibly productive i think he wrote 15 novels 200 short stories he edited a weekly
magazine about a mile from here you know sort of incredibly productive we didn't work afternoons
and so charles dickens would sit down at his desk at eight in the morning he'd write for about four or five hours and then he'd go and walk and he'd walk
10 10 miles every afternoon and that was like him lost in his thoughts you know
striding through east london probably sort of imagination popping when he sat down the next day he had
loads of ideas and i think some of us have eliminated that
sort of the brain fermenting ideas we've eliminated that a bit so
you know it might be that your way to do this yourself is just to make sure you just got some down time
or you've just got some time where you know you put music on but you turn podcasts off or you just
you try and get a bit more balance in how you're uh using your energy so let's conclude
this point about work and creativity say that i today made you the ceo of a company that had
100 employees um and you could design from scratch the the working environment how often people
worked and some of the sort of key sort of principles and foundations of that working environment what kind of
things would be important to you based on all you know so let's look into what happened in lockdown the first part of lockdown most
people reported that their engagement went up and why did their engagement went up their engagement went up because they
were solving problems like we'd never worked like this before everyone was you know the first moment
you're getting on a zoom call or a google hangout or you're getting on these things there's like you know even though you're in this
crazy situation there's a degree of excitement fight or flight almost right and and so what do we know about that we
know that people felt that they were involved in firstly a bit of team collaboration but secondly they were
helping solve problems and so you know the whole organizations computer sales
have gone through the roof whole organizations that had no laptop computers so they had to arm their teams with kit
and so people felt really engaged by the fact that they back to what we talked about earlier had some control they had a a bit of
influence so number one thing that we discover is the more that people feel that they can have an
impact in their job and it might be something similar simple they're they're just responsible for a
couple of things themselves the more that they feel that they've got some agency some control themselves
they feel motivated in their jobs when do we feel unmotivated in our jobs when our boss tells us what to do but we
don't get any input into it we don't necessarily think it's the best thing to do we're doing
repetitive things that don't feel very rewarding so the best thing that any of us can do think well how can i make
teams feel small and teams feel like they've got a shared sense of accomplishment and pride in what they're
doing so that's what i would be saying what you discover is 100 is a really nice size actually any time a
company goes over 100 what your discovery is you lose a bit of some of that
camaraderie you better almost there's a few organizations that do this when you go over 100 split it into two
teams because your that sort of cohesion you get works really well when we
we've got a familiarity with each other and what happens is when you go over that you start losing it
and you think we want we want it to feel like it used to feel it's never going to feel like that humans don't work like that so
far better to say you know we've got two teams that love each other but we're we're working on separate goals so
keeping things small is really critical and there's lots of evidence of the smaller you can keep things you
almost get the economies of engagement compared to the economies of scale that when people feel they're part of
something that they're having an input into their engagement is higher they they they work more effectively
so i would say that would be the defining part making people feel like they've got things that they're responsible for
and generally all of those things encourage active engagement what you find when you
look into some of the stats they're terrifying so and when you globally there's an organization gallop to this workforce
survey opinion poll company and they they do this workforce survey and they say that globally
13 of people are engaged in their jobs when they look into it what i mean by
that is that these there's almost as many people there's about 22 of people who
would actively disengage their jobs so by actively disengaged they kind of hate their organization and
they want to bring the downfall of their organization so anytime you meet some someone on the tuber in the street they're almost twice
as likely to want to destroy their company as make it succeed but then the vast
majority of everyone else over 50 percent of people are just disengaged they're not actively
disengaged they're just passively disengaged so work for most of us is something is something that sort of
feels arduous we don't necessarily enjoy we don't necessarily value the decisions and you'll know as
someone who's run a company where culture was the defining thing you'll know that when you get it right
it can be this superpower where you know you're on high octane fuel compared to you know
the energy can feel low otherwise and so just getting those things right generally is far more about
people feeling a personal connection with the people that are around feeling like they're contributing something these things play a really big
part we talked a lot about the joy of work obviously the i guess the antithesis of the joy of work is the misery of work
and at some point when work feels miserable um people are faced with this quite um this quite confounding question which
is how do i know when to quit and we talk that we know i think there's so much written about how to start and when to start and
starting being the thing but obviously the thing that comes before starting usually is knowing the right moment to
quit people don't quit sometimes and they spend many decades in a miserable job and
you know then their fear of quitting almost becomes stronger because they're getting more comfortable and more entrenched so i wanted i've not seen you talk about
anything about quitting before but i just wondered if you had a take on when the right moment to quit a job was or i know it's an incredibly personal
nuanced thing but people i can i was thinking then i was thinking what are some of the things people
really want to know right now one of them i'm sure is like i hate my job i don't have control my boss is an
do i quit i'm gonna tell you a secret for the past five years while building
social chain into a 700 person global social media powerhouse i've been using a service that i've never really
mentioned some of you might know that service it's called fiverr f-i-v-e-r-r
it's my little secret if i've ever had a project where i've needed affordable skilled freelancers to help me whether
it's building a social media application that made my company three million pounds or just a video i needed editing or
help making a logo or making a website i've used fiverr now that my secret's out the bag here's
what i'm gonna do for you if there's a freelance service you need or a project you need help with a logo a website a voice over a video you need
made anything at all go to fiverr.com ceo i'll put the link in the description
that's fiverr.com ceo message me the service you want from the
website and every single week i'll personally send you the credit to your fiverr account so that you can get that project
done thank you to fiverr for the sponsorship and for supporting entrepreneurs and freelancers around the world i'm looking forward to all of your
messages i've been working my way through these huel nutrition bars this week um as you
know i love the ready to drink cure flavors but you will have also got these salted caramel bars
and i'm a big salted caramel nut which i've been having and if you're if you're someone that does like to chew
not just drink your food then i really highly recommend the salted caramel flavor there's also another flavor called the raspberry white chocolate
flavor which i've been very addicted to over the last couple of weeks but again just like huel it's nutritionally complete
you get all of your your proteins you get essential fats you get it's gluten-free as well
and you get 26 vitamins and minerals from these bars
tastes amazing and i'm a big salted caramel fan give it a go if you do send me a screenshot on instagram or
twitter or linkedin and let me know what you think again as someone that skips meals this is an absolute lifesaver
How do I know when to quit?
i was thinking what are some of the things people really want to know right now one of them i'm sure is like i hate my job i don't have control my
boss is an do i quit yeah look you know big
questions you probably could tell us more than that um yeah i think you know the uh the
critical thing about that is is probably checking in with yourself and asking you know do i feel any sense
of reward by my from my job obviously it's not a great time for anyone right now to
be debating doing something that makes them economically precarious
that so you don't necessarily want to risk something that is going to put you in a difficult situation but i
think you know evaluating our jobs generally when you look into the research when you say to people have you had a good days
a good day at work it generally comes down to whether people feel pride in their organization
and whether they feel like they've made meaningful progress in something they've been working on so meaningful progress actually can be
difficult right now if your job feels like you're the expert in emailing and
video calls you sometimes feel like you've made no progress for weeks you haven't done anything for weeks and also if your
organization is struggling this is a really interesting phenomenon because some organizations pre-covered were in
uh were growing so naturally when you're an employee in those organizations you're dragged up with it you're giving
promotions and pay rises and there's the cash to fund that now organizations are in decline or a lot of
them are hanging on and so you're not getting a promotion your pay's been frozen you might have be on a pay cut
you might be furloughed and it feels like suddenly you've gone into decline in your career because the organization
you're in is in decline um and i think that also causes a lot of people to start to think
well you know i might my whole life up until this point has been about progress and climbing the ladder why am
i going down the ladder yeah i didn't do anything different or wrong you know it's a really interesting philosophical thing about that because
the whole idea of the career at korea is the invention of the last 40 years you know
uh ancestors uh grandparents our great-grandparents never had the idea of a career where i
was going to be accomplishing something and developing and changing you know the job you were going to be
doing next year was the job you were doing last year well done and the job that your kids were going to do was going to be the job that you did
and the the this idea and it brings with it a degree of insecurity this idea that we will be on this
developmental path is a construct look and it's a construct that suits the economic system we live in because it
makes us all we strive to be accomplishing more than we did last year and to be earning
more than we did last year but it's a construct for the last few years whether it's the origin of
happiness i'm not 100 sure if i was going to put two things alongside some of the things that you've talked about
that sense of feeling part of something feeling connected to other people i think is a more robust route to
happiness than feeling like i'm on a career trajectory even though that can the the illusion of
that can be incredibly powerful it's interesting because you know with there's this thing called like gold medal depression where like michael
Childhood trauma in the elite
phelps he set these set these tarts one thing i kind of investigated in my book is the idea that
we think stability we think chaos we think we live in chaos and and in search of stability but the
moment we find stability i.e completed goals and um you know roof over our heads and
everything's normal we actually descend into chaos so in fact we're meant to keep this is a
philosophical idea i guess but we're meant to keep our lives in forward motion in that chaos because when you look at people that have
achieved all their goals and they have nothing left to accomplish they so often fall into some kind of depression and lack of purpose and
meaning i think jordan peterson talks about it i know benjamin said a lot about it that you know much of um i was looking at the
stats around life expectancy in the uk and the us and over the last two years it's declined for the first time ever
but and they say when they say why is that they say because the opioid crisis and say why is there an opioid crisis and they say well because
there's a lack of meaning and so i i began to realize that in my own life i think i'm meant to keep myself
my goals way out in front of me almost unattainable um and keep myself striving and i've even
seen it in my person which i've talked about a little bit on this podcast the days where someone came along and said here's 50 million will buy a company or we're
going to go to the stock market you're going to be a millionaire were the most confusing days of my life because i immediately didn't know what
my point was anymore i wonder what there's something really fascinating so there's a there's a study of
olympic medalist a british study really fascinating piece of work it's called the great british medalist study and um it was commissioned by the
british olympic association so they wanted to know what was the what was the creation of a
champion and they did this fascinating thing they did they gathered 20 what they called super elite athletes so
these are athletes you'll know them all of them are household names they don't name them in the study but it's people like kelly holmes it's people
like the big iconic names and uh these were people that every time they went to
a championship they would win gold or they would win they would be right in contention then
they took a second group and they called these elite athletes super elite elite and these were people who went to championships
but kinda didn't meddle or if they meddled they meddled third biggest difference between them these
ones had all received significant childhood trauma the elite ones the super early best ones had achieved
significant childhood trauma let's start counting the cases so kelly holmes she was bullied at
school she was the only child of mixed race ethnicity in her village she said she
experienced continual racism tom daley his father died when he was
training yeah um you know you look at countless examples of these things the andy murray was you know greatest
british tennis player maybe greatest british sports person he was at the dumb lane shooting the only mass
shooting in british history so all of these people have experienced significant childhood trauma and what happens is they tend to direct
their energy based on what we know they direct like they're fortunate there was a coincidence that they were
gifted supreme talent and what you discover is childhood trauma normally correlates with addiction
so if you know if it correlates with anything it correlates with obsessive behavior but both of them have
something in common you're trying to fill that void and so these people are fortunate that they've been gifted with this
super elite talent that they can fill the void with striving for something and the people who ends up at addicts
with the same challenge don't but they're still striving to fill that void and so there is something in you know
it's it's almost inevitable that these people who are striving for the elite uh accomplishment hoping to fill this
this hole that sits inside them of course when they get there they realize it was all an illusion it's like a mirage in the desert but you know there
is something in what you say i mean i've got i just i mean completely like i think when i i sit here and speak to people
that are tremendously successful and the one thing that i've seen in common with all of them actually think i said it to joe wicks when he was sat
here two weeks ago was they all seemed to have some real severe childhood trauma that no one else has experienced
and even in my i said to joe i said you know my i've got a friend who's a billionaire he's not happy but he has had this deep
obsession since he was a kid because of some things that happened with his father and his father making him feel
that he just wasn't enough or he wasn't adequate enough which has made him obsessive about success to the point where it's
unhealthy um and he's got there now he's a billionaire but he's not happy at all he's he's you know he's tremendously
unfulfilled the same with eddie han i went and eddie holmes on this podcast a couple of weeks ago as well
and he he is the most relentlessly obsessed person i've met um just non-stop eat to the point where
he'll say to his kids like he'll he'll tell his wife and kids that they are second priority to his box to being a boxing promoter
you ask him where that's come from he said you know my dad my dad always made me feel like i wasn't enough it's really interesting though because
it depends i'm intrigued then how these people pay it forward because andre agassi
supreme tennis player great tennis player married to the greatest the up there equal greatest tennis players
for all time uh he's married steffi graf and um and he says that his dad bullied him constantly
like his dad was never happy he's the only place his dad who was a persian iranian cab driver could
afford to own a tennis court was in las vegas so they moved to las vegas and his dad bullied him into becoming a tennis
player and andre agassi fantastic autobiography wrote about how much he hates tennis
hates it with every single bit every fiber in his body and he says i will never do to my kids
what my dad did to me and so it's like this really interesting origin of success is the thing that propels you
this driving force that propels these people who just keep going relentlessly is it
something missing rather than something extra and i think that's the interesting conundrum
i don't think it's predictable and this is the thing because i think you think okay well if someone has trauma they're going to become successful or
they're going to become an addict or if someone has a upbringing that lacked empathy from
their parents then they'll become an or a serial killer but in the case of joe wicks he was he talked about how he had you know he
looked at the doors in his house and they all had fist holes in them his dad was an addict his mom had these problems and
and he is the single most empathetic person i've ever met you know when they announce the third lockdown he does a livestream crying his
eyes up because not because of him he's fine he's saying i can i'm feeling the pain of people losing their jobs right now
and you think well if your dad was you know you grew up in a home full of domestic abuse right and violence
how can you become the most empathetic person that i've ever encountered genuinely genuinely empathetic this guy
like i've never seen you know um i you know because everyone says about you know pee with joe
and they all like send him the memes every time there's a lock down of him like putting his shoes back on or whatever but the guy gets really down really really really
down because he knows that other people are hurting never seen anything like it however here's my question so we talked
The Trump Twitter ban
about childhoods um making people very interesting there's one guy in particular who is
notoriously had a very um interesting childhood which made him a certain way
donald trump and his father um you know the story of donald trump and his father being you know um
you were the vp of e-m-e-a of twitter um obviously donald trump has
just been booted off twitter permanently what do you think about that but also i wanted to ask you where if you were jack
dorsey in that at that time would you have made the same decision
number one it's so incredibly hard and i think the i mean i always felt lucky i worked
four years at youtube before twitter and the time that i worked at youtube
there was a lot of um mass shootings and there's always mass shootings in the u.s
but there's a lot of mass shootings and the phenomenon at the time was that a lot of the mass shootings
it was being discovered that the people had youtube channels and so i remember sitting in a meeting with lawyers in the
san bruno headquarters of youtube watching them debate what the the right moral thing
to do was in these fascinating to watch things that were being invented challenges that no one had conceived of
five years before now you've got these things and so you're watching all these things going on
and um and so you know when twitter was invented when twitter was invented it was a way
15 years ago it was a way to text all of your mates at once and so there was a short code and it was
a way it was it took like your msn messenger status and it sent it to text messages that was
the idea before everyone had internet connection on their phone so that it feels like a different lifetime now
but just an illustration to be 15 years on from that debating whether you d platform the most
powerful most well-known is he the most famous person in the world maybe the most famous person in the world to
de-platform that person is such a journey to be on and i know the people
i mean i know jack i know uh the the other person who made the decision and i know that they don't make any of
those decisions lightly you know it's like it's really uh weighs on them but to my mind
it was a singular situation where firstly i saw some people on social media saying um saying that this was an illustration
that the employees of tech firms were woke and it's just really interesting equivalents because six people died
in that event and if you watch back all the footage of what led to it then it
it doesn't take a huge leap of logic to say i can see why that created that so six
people died and i think it was at the end of a long period where increasing numbers
of the tweets by the president and the people associated were being labeled with this isn't true
and you you do reach a point where a lot of critics were saying where does your responsibility kick in
here do you have no responsibility for what your platform is being used for i
think knowing the people concerned that that was the last thing they wanted to be to be in the position where
they were making a decision angela merkel has come out saying she's she feels uncomfortable with it
and i can definitely imagine that everyone in twitter felt uncomfortable with it it was one of
those difficult things everywhere you went for the whole trump presidency people would say um
what are you doing why are you not taking this down and of course you know the first thing you've got to say is irrespective of anyone's opinion and
that's the only way you can look at this that this is an elected leader of a country and so you know irrespective of anything
else for a private company to be saying that we we take an opinion which transcends
uh the election result is a really uncomfortable one so i know that it would have been a
really careful decision i think a really deliberate decision jack's been on podcasts and any places
uh i'm joe rogan talking about he believes that bands shouldn't be forever so who's to say that you know there
wouldn't be a root back on these things but i do know that the decision was probably made
carefully reluctantly i think i think it's the right decision i think is the right decision and i think the
timing of it was probably right i i would be you know it felt
it felt at the moment it took place it felt like the intensity of dialogue
and the toxicity of dialogue was reaching such a stage that you know six people already dead
it's just like this could get this can escalate even further and i have to say since it's happened it does feel to me
like a bit of the stress in the room has gone someone said something uh about i think
president-elect biden said um the you know a natural order of things you don't think about your leaders
every day you kind of know they're there you've got context that they have an awareness but you know this
sense of peril where you're thinking about your leader and what might happen every day just contributes to bad mental health
it's not a healthy place for us to live in so you know i would guess that there would always be a route back
for people even if they've had a permanent ban jack said that but i i do think it was
the right decision i i am i'm really not sure i think
i consider myself as someone that's on the left i guess to some degree or maybe left to center left but
um i it does make me feel a little bit uncomfortable because you're right it sets a bit of a presence for the future
in terms of how we deal with um opinions we don't like things that might
be considered to be inciting violence would you have done in this case i think i think i would have um
suspended his account um temporarily like the facebook approach
yes i think that was i think that was probably a better approach all things considered um i think because trump is a very
unique very powerful individual i would have also had someone i'm not sure if this happened but someone from
twitter contact his team and really have a dialogue about it and lay out that we can't allow our platform
to be a place where we're like denying the election results and therefore inciting you know these kinds
of things and basically do and i would have used this suspension period i think to have that conversation
uh um but yeah but i think with the removal is it sets a bit of a strange presence and i did wonder before this moment you
know social media is very left it's a very it's a very like a liberal place
i think if you were to just look at social media you would think that the labor party you're always going to win typically as well because
you think i think so because i think that's more a reflection of who you follow because
you know i definitely think there's plenty of pockets of people who are huge brexit supporters who clearly i
mean the numbers say that there's more of them yeah but it's just i think the brexit and the conservative
narrative is less akin to like the virtue signaling that you're rewarded for on social media
so if i say uh child a lunch boxes for all right everyone's eager but if i was to i
i would prob i might even lose my job or be canceled or be criticized if i said oh no we don't need to fun give as much
money to the nhs or something so just seems like the liberal the sort of left talking points are a little bit more
acceptable on social media and the right ones might make you lose your job or get you cancelled or you know what i mean i
think it's about tonality rather than uh perspective i mean look you know absolutely it's not going to play well
if you're in the market for likes to say that i think we need a tighter fiscal policy
and you know and less benefits for people he's going to play differently i wouldn't necessarily agree
that the platforms have a specific bias though i think you know
of course it's my echo chamber yeah generally you know i've witnessed plenty of strong
opinion on both sides likely as it was my job to try and
ensure there was a a degree of good conversation in those things and i i've probably not seen that
because i've only seen my own little echo chamber and i'm young i'm you know i'm surrounded by very left
uh people in my organization and stuff so i probably surrounded myself with that narrative a bit more but i just i've always felt that um
Where does social media go from here?
where does social media go from here i mean it's it feels like it's a really pivotal moment we've got this big case with
facebook at the moment in the us where they're trying to you know considering breaking up facebook and we've got trump being banned from
twitter we've got parlor being pulled from the app store and amazon web services um it feels like we're in a bit of a i
don't know maybe we've always been in this constant debate of what social media is and where the lines are but
what what are some of the big changes you see coming to look i think it's pretty clear that regulations
coming in some in some capacity uh i think to be honest i think
most of the big organizations would welcome it when it comes to choosing to de-platform people whether they're the
president or whether they're troublemakers having some rules that are agreed by an independent
authority would be welcome for most of those platforms i think you know it's really uncomfortable when
organizations are losing sleep being on the inside is really uncomfortable when you're losing sleep about
should we be doing this can we be doing this how do we account for doing this uh jack daughter did a series of tweets
a couple of nights ago trying to he's formidable i think trying to demystify how decisions are
made so no win almost everyone who reads it will be critical of it but you know he's trying to say look
this is how we reach that decision um i think there'll be degree of regulation i think that's probably a
good thing i suspect some of the big groups will be broken up and you know facebook and google i think
will probably be broken up and the question will be whether they are willing to embrace that and do it
and all of the shareholders and all of the users and all the people who work there benefit or if they resist it and you know the
lessons of microsoft bill gates and steve balmer will say we lost 10 years of our company
because we spent 10 years resisting uh regulation resisting control had they
just given up to that they'd probably microsoft's in a good place again i think biggest company in the world again
but you know they uh they would have been in a better place to to avoid those things so um i think regulations probably coming i
think it's probably a good thing do you think they're gonna break up facebook yeah you think they will yeah in the next five years
really so you think they'll force facebook to sell whatsapp or instagram or something yeah
or both yeah or both yeah really almost certainly i would guess youtube will be sold from google as well
really yeah blimey that's crazy better go somewhere is it better for a
consumer so number one if you own any of those shares every time that these breakups
uh the all of the value of the firms is worth more than the constituent parts so from shareholder point of view it's a
really good idea to pick the right moment but break yourself up and um and it's good from a consumer point
of view i often sit there big youtube consumer if you're a youtube consumer you said go
going hang on this used to be like the big daddy of video they've missed tick tock they've missed
twitch they've missed like all of these big opportunities that youtube was
right in the box seat for they've missed all of them why because big firms generally are slow and don't innovate
and so it's better for everyone if you've got people experimenting doing new things and you
know if you've got a layer of regulation over the top of that saying these degrees of norms of
behavior that you expect it's it's much better for everyone and it's really exciting i think
in the case of facebook mark mark would respond to that and say we've got 10 years or 15 years whatever it is now of
experience moderating terrorist content and you know really you know horrific types of content we've
built ai systems which are the best in the world and we're removing you know we're spotting 90 of posts before they're reported and
this has taken us you know decades and billions of dollars of investment to get to this point if you take instagram and put it in the hands
of an i don't know an adobe they don't have that experience they don't have that um data that they don't have the ai systems and
so it's not going to help for um missing misinformation and it's a misdirection though isn't it i mean
that specifically if someone is saying we have learned we've developed machine learning that can do these
things that sounds like a marketable product that sounds like something that shouldn't be the point of difference
that shouldn't be your differentiator that you've got better capacity to deal with those things but rather that should
be something that some entrepreneur avails to other firms and i think you know sometimes we can
get locked into an idea of thinking oh the narrative that we're being given is the right one here
but rather more than thinking actually if someone could put a layer of safety over the internet
that used that machine learning to spot things that were really heinous that that used that learning to make sure
that no one had a bad experience wow pinterest could use that linkedin could use that
tic toc could use that it should be something that everyone could plug into their products and then you
immediately start saying wow there could be gaps in the market for new products here maybe there's a version of twitter that's mega safe
maybe there's a version of instagram that just has a different aspect to it
so you know my view would be absolutely we've learned these things but the notion that somehow
that safety of experience should be a proprietary benefit rather than something that is afforded
to everyone is just i think a a a bit of deception and a bit of
misdirection the other talking point mark zuckerberg would rebuttal you basically because i've looked at his arguments for
not breaking up facebook he says well what have we got a monopoly in we're not as big as imessage in
messaging we're not as big as this platform for uh he and he rattles through the platforms and says what what are we
bigger what are we the monopoly on and um he says there's tons of competition we've got tick tock
our heels pinterest twitter you know uh google you know these platforms so he says you know
where is the monopoly here um and i have found that kind of compelling i know again it's a bit of a
misdirection but i i can't tell you what he's the what what facebook have the monopoly on
yeah well firstly monopolies don't have to be more than 70 i think you know i think by the rules
for monopoly in the uk it's like more than 20 30 percent of a market so you know so so to be monopolistic you
don't have to be dominant but you know when you've got three of the top five apps you start questioning whether there is a
degree of undue influence look i've got no dog in the fight um my view personally is that
i i suspect these firms will be broken up and the question then becomes do you serve your employees better
do you serve the people who use your apps better do you serve the the state of society better
by just going with that and saying let's do it but let's do it joyfully get on with it and i suspect
personally i think you know some of these organizations are going to be presented with the the challenge some of them will go
okay i'll break we'll break ourselves up and others will say actually we're going to uh we're going to position with this and
just the less than microsoft is you lose 10 years of your life by resisting talk a lot about the joy of
Whats next for you to keep joy in your work?
work we've talked a lot about you know your past experiences at youtube and twitter what is next for you when you're
thinking about what's going to give you joy from work in the future what are you thinking about um i'm writing a book
about resilience uh are you able to tell us the title yeah i mean it's the title is a big ongoing discussion okay i'm not at
that stage um which is just about all about the things we've talked about how resilience is actually a collective thing rather than
an individual thing um i've really enjoyed sort of doing things like that i i i'm doing a couple of things on
climate change so i worked with an organization last year yeah yeah so i'm working with alcohol's
climate reality now but um i did something with an organization last year that's trying to reduce our plastic
footprint and you know so so there's a few things like that and i really enjoy those things because they
i think they're non-linear i think you know what success looks like is really hard to judge
and it's all about trying to achieve things so i did something through october where i presented into
about 100 70 different companies i presented climate change into 70 different
organizations and you know connections have started from that so the al gore's climate reality is al gore did
that film an inconvenient truth about 15 years ago probably short in school my dad made me watch it right sat me
down and said to my brothers and sisters you got to watch this and he's turned he's work on that into an organization
and it used to be he had to pay 7 000 to go and be trained in las vegas now he's in the era of zoom he said
anyone could be trained on it for free really so i trained the only commitment you have to do is you have to commit to
spread the word so hence i did about you know all these presentations getting out and and spreading the word um and that's
really energizing sort of because i think a lot of us feel a certain way towards climate but
feel powerless about what can we do so uh i've done a bit of that hopefully i'll i'm i've got a few more
things coming along on that so will you ever get back into the world of social networking i i really want to
avoid doing that so that's why i'm working hard on podcast and writing because if i can pay
the bills doing that you know full-time jobs are really demanding
and you know my my social media consumptions remains i'm a huge user of twitter i'm a huge
user of tick tock and uh so my social media consumption is still there i just don't want to
i just don't want to work in those organizations again why just you know they're really exhausting
you know like you work really hard i had so much fun working at twitter and youtube before
but you know you do long days especially working with california up in the morning and you you're working
late at night so i don't want to really go and work in a big company again i'm going to conclude this podcast by
Whats the one thing you'd do to make work enjoyable for everyone?
just asking you you know for you and from everything you know about the joy of work and what makes work joyful and fulfilling
if you had to just focus on one thing that was the most important factor for
you um in work what would that be um there's a 70 year long study out of uh
yale university looking at what the the secret of longevity and happiness is and the secret of it
studied these guys for like the whole of their lives and the secret of longevity and happiness is love and friendship and i think
work is far closer to that than we might imagine when we feel a connection with the people we work with
it makes everything worthwhile and i think hidden in all the chat about productivity and strategy
and and you know market fear and usps we lose the fact that when we feel most
motivated by work it's when we feel like we're doing it with other people and so that's it for me i used to a
great day at work was when i laughed 12 times and you know and it was almost it felt trivial to mention that it felt
like oh why do you love your job to mention that i just love these people i love being around these people i'm energized
by these people feels really embarrassing to admit but i think that's the secret of it when we
feel part of something our jobs can feel defining that can feel part of our
identity bruce thank you um that loops perfectly round to the start of the podcast in my expression
that i think remote work as hell so but also it's uh it's something that yeah i've come to learn over the last
nine months i'm sure a lot of other people have um thank you so much for all the work you've done on work generally because i
think it's a conversation not a lot of people are having or breaking through with and some of the ideas you deliver in
your book and just generally in your content across youtube and your social channels linkedin your articles on there
i think really are helping to dismantle a conventional and sometimes toxic
framework for how work has to be so on behalf of someone that works and has teams i want to thank you for that because it's been um it's a value that
the world needs but also thank you for the conversation today thank you it's an absolute pleasure thank you

Transcription:

Intro
all of that stuff prevents us from being at our best we can only be truly great at what we do
if we believe without doubt that
my guest today is an 11 time european world champion in her field anna hemmings she has a remarkable story
not only is she this incredible elite athlete not only did she get to the olympics twice
but she's undergone some of the most incredible mind-bending adversity to get there
she's now a coach she's now an entrepreneur she's now an incredible businesswoman and she has a remarkable story to tell
you she's also a mother and a wife and all of these things and she's she's really incredibly self-analystical and
self-aware and as her journey unfolded and as she rose to the top of her career she got news which all athletes must
consider to be the worst news in the world i'm so excited for you to listen to this conversation you're going to get a tremendous amount
of value and i'll be honest as a host you ask the questions but in this conversation i had more
realizations than pretty much any conversation i've had with a guest before without further ado you can see i'm excited my name is
stephen bartlett and this is the diver ceo i hope nobody is listening but if you are
then please keep this to yourself [Music]
Why Kayaking?
kayaking it's um it's not this the type of sport that
a child would typically dream of getting into so i guess my first question to you is you became
a world champion in kayaking you reached the very sort of peak of your your your career in that sport how did
you get into kayaking yeah you're absolutely right it wasn't something i was going mom mom please don't be kayaking
um i did lots of different sports as a child and i loved sport my mum was always
trying to get my brother and i partly because we enjoyed sport but sometimes just you know summer holidays
going to a week of tennis camp do a week of basketball week of this and it was just something that we tried
i loved being on the river you know the thames in the summer is gorgeous right you know it's pretty miserable right now
um but in the summer it's lovely but also the club was competitive it was it was elm bridge canoe club and
it was probably one of the best clubs in the country at the time so this is late 80s and
and they were all about racing they were all about competing they were all about you know working your way up to the
national championships getting on the great britain team going to the world championships making the olympics that was their mission it was to produce
racing athletes and that played into my competitive nature really well
so i think it was one i love the you know the nature of the sport but also i'd
stumbled on a place where i could be competitive i could race i could
um i had access to these brilliant coaches i mean as time went on i was there with at my club there were
people who were going off to the olympic games who were going off to seoul um olympic games then four years later they
going off to barcelona and so i was surrounded by people who were going to world championships achieving
great things and making me realize that actually
this is this is possible so i've got two questions there the first is what age were you at this
point so well when i first stepped into the kayak that first summer i was just under nine years old and and i
can't say that at that age i was going by first day in the kayak i'm going to go to olympics it wasn't that and it
probably wasn't until the following summer that i actually really started to train and
go regularly and really get into it so you you said there as well about you were surrounded by people that had
these big ambitions that i'm guessing you probably never even considered and i think for i think
that's such a valuable but also interesting lesson about like the company people keep
generally because i can imagine that if you were in a different kayak school surrounded by different people that
didn't have that level of aspiration you may be and this is a presumption you maybe wouldn't have
believed that it was possible for you is that right um so i yes i agree
um i also had discovered the olympics probably around that time and
was inspired by the olympics and i do recall from that young age thinking just the olympics is just this
amazing event so i think really early on i had a dream about the olympics um and i
didn't know what sport that would be i you said you had a dream did you see
yourself actually getting there in a sport someday yes really yeah i did
i i did watch the olympics on television um i recall los angeles i definitely recall
watching um seoul and really being into that so well you know by seoul i'm like 12 years
old i guess um watching thinking i want to be an olympian i want to be in that event
one day and then and then kayaking came along and
and you're right it because of those people it didn't feel like because i guess
probably when you're watching it on tv it's like oh this is this thing that other people do and it's far away and how do you ever
yes we'd all love to be in the olympics moment not everyone but you know but how realistic is that and
then i stumble upon this sport and this club and these young
athletes are going turning up training they're just like normal people to me
but if they can do it and these normal people who just work really hard
can get there then why can't i i'm so fascinated by it and you probably saw me being very inquisitive because
i'm in my head i'm trying to understand how um what the factors were that came together that took you to the olympics
and like i think in all of our journeys we can um we can attribute some level of like
coincidence and luck to various stages and i think one of the moments of like luck from what you've
said is like being around the right people to some degree because um yeah i've just i think especially
lately in my life i've really been able to look back and say you know what if i if i hung around with a different group of people if i didn't have you know mum
that was like this or i didn't have those five friends um i probably wouldn't have uh believed that like that as you i find
it really interesting you say the word normal people because i think we all view ourselves especially when we're younger it's like normal people
and we think that norm when you look at the tv as you say like you don't think normal people can do that stuff on there and at some point someone like bridged
the gap and was like oh by the way normal people do that and i think that's a moment that i had in my life which i found really
interesting from what you've described there there's like the thing where the like the third wall shatters and you realize
that all of your icons and like you know the people you love are also just like we're just like you yeah i think that's
super um inspiring so we've talked a little bit about circumstance and like the the luck fortune part of it and
being in the right place at the right time but also within everybody's journey there is a lot of
intention there's a lot of like often discipline i imagine what what are the things about you that
Why you?
maybe the few defining things that maybe other people don't don't have i always have to be
careful with this question because no one wants to blow their own trumpet but i'm like why you like why are you not someone else we've talked about
circumstance but what are the things that you within your character got you there versus everyone else who
might have quit or not tried as hard it wasn't as competitive or whatever that's difficult um i definitely worked
hard um and lots of people work hard right and i worked really really hard and i think
i think one thing that made me even more determined was that so as i mentioned already when
people see a think of a kayaker they often think of someone quite tall yeah they often think of aurora right and and they're different sports
but most people think roar and they think super tall big and and i am a little bit small
um not typically the typical size for a kayaker so generally a little bit taller um broader
shoulder i'm five six six um and i was i was told regularly too small um
one of my coach actually um the club coach he was also the great britain team coach came up to me at a certain point
um when i was really into the sport and said i just don't think you're ever going to be big enough or strong enough to ever
be a great kayaker knowing that i was really wanting to be a great kayaker
and but also knowing that i did some other sports and was kind of going maybe you should go and do those because
i know you i just don't want you to um put all your heart into this and not succeed how did that feel
devastating right this is the sport that i'm falling and fallen in love with um that i'm this is
probably i'm about 12 years old so at this stage i am training quite regularly i've already
been to the national championships i've got my sights set on being in the great britain junior team
devastating but i think because of that i i just went well i'm just going to keep
going i'm going to keep trying i don't care what you've said i don't care you know this is what i want to do um
i'm going to give it a go and i love it and i think i'm doing okay at it right now and i'm just gonna keep trying what that
did for me was made me made me work harder to prove that
actually because i was told specifically you're not big enough you're not strong enough
and yeah i can't change my height but i can become stronger and when i was at the peak of my career
i was the strongest girl in the gym in the great britain team i've got to admit i saw the photos i was
bench pressing 100 kilos yeah you were strong and so and i i was determined
that no one's going to tell me i'm not strong enough because i i can't change how tall
i am but i can change how strong i am why did it matter though why did it matter to be successful to you at this
good question because a lot of i think about that moment where someone tells you you're going to fail whatever we've all
had that moment i think every successful person's had that moment and people typically google one of two ways they'll either go forget this then
you know chuck it in or whatever um or they'll have the adverse effect i almost
don't know anybody that sits in the middle you either get really in you get some kind of insecurity which takes you either one way which either
means that i'm going to triple down and become obsessive or i'm gonna avoid um avoid this at all costs
and i tend i tend to think that people who this really really really intrinsically matters to
for whatever reason are the ones that go the positive way and use it as motivation yeah definitely i'm i loved winning um
why i love the i love the joy of i loved i i loved winning but i also
loved improvement and i loved it getting better quite often i was told
so they're in kayaking there's singles doubles fours k1 k2 k4 and i was always told
you know not big enough not strong enough but also definitely not big enough or strong enough to be in a k4
definitely not big enough to be in any of the crew boats k2 k4 you need to be big and strong for those boats
and i probably shouldn't say this but they they used to it felt to me defined big and strong
as fat and if you were so i was skin and bones i
was really skinny and so i didn't look strong but they thought someone who looked
chunky had a big backside was strong okay and i'm like no that
that just because they're big doesn't mean they're going to be faster than they're going to be more valuable in that boat than me
so do you think you're like underestimated unfairly yeah i do and and that so winning world
championships in a k2 getting to olympic games in a doubles was very satisfying for me um
whenever i was able to prove that actually you don't have to be what you're describing as this kind of
shape um that's not what makes someone fast and useful in a kayak in a double kayak
or in a four so that used to annoy me i saw you talk about uh
Healthy conflict within teams
one of the things mentioned when i was doing a little bit of research on you is this idea of like healthy conflict
in teams could you explain because i've never heard of the term i could imagine i could guess what it means but i'd love you to explain what
healthy con conflict is in terms of teams and so in a
team um it starts with trust if we don't have trust in a team then we
can't have healthy conflict and healthy conflict is when we healthy debate so this is about being
able to know that all of the people in the team have the same objective the same
um we're all gonna got the same goal we're trying to achieve the same thing and you put forward an idea and you and
and i i disagree with that idea but if we don't have trust in the team and you're the boss then i'm not going
to put my hand up and say i disagree i don't think we should do it like that i think we should do it like this
i think that this is the way we should go i think we need to go down this route we won't have that argument and an
argument debate conflict whatever you want to call it if there's not enough trust in the team
if you think that you're going to be shot down if you think you're not going to be listened to um and then the problem with that is
that we then walk out of the room and you've probably been in meetings right where people all
sit in the room and they all nod and go yeah brilliant yeah we're all going to do that and then they walk out of the room and they go
you got another thing coming you think i'm going to do that and they do that because they haven't had their say
they haven't been able to disagree and and back and forth with their ideas and have that debate even if your idea
isn't gone with they at least want to feel like i've had my say
and i've had my opportunity to put forward my thoughts and my opinion and my suggestion
but actually at the end of the day this is the best idea for the team
then fine let's go with that but at least i've had my opportunity to speak up and you talk about you know that sounds
very sort of analogous to like relationships as well because i think you know like romantic relationships right people get a little
bit peeved if they don't feel like they're being heard and had a chance to express themselves and also when they have that
when they do express themselves quite often it's perceived as in the name of being right or winning
versus in the name of like progress or solving the problem it's like me and you versus each other versus mean universe is the
problem right yeah how do you build the trust foundation they're like what's the how do you get a
team to trust each other and whatever because if that's the foundation of healthy conflict i'm like how do i you
know what can i do to so one of the things that that you can do and this is why you know i work with
teams and leaders and it's about vulnerability it's about being um able to be vulnerable with your
people with your team um being able to admit weaknesses admit mistakes
um it's about being able to say i i don't know the answer i don't know where we're going well i
don't know what i don't you know i don't know how to deal with this or i you know just
being able to be vulnerable and and that isn't always easy to do
but when you start to do it it gives permission to people you know if you we do
workshops where we're trying to build trust and people always say you know at the end we might ask them something like um
share something about challenge from your childhood and when we when people go around and
they share and we say what what made it difficult or hard to do and they say well it made it easier
when someone else went first because once you've opened up and you've bared yourself a little bit
then i feel oh well he's done it then it's okay and no one judged him and and no one knocked him and and it's
like okay well i can do it too and knowing that no one's and when there is that trust then we know
that actually i'm not going to be that's not going to be held against me whatever it is that i share
it's not going to be hard against me in the future it's not going to be um used and i'm not going to be shot
down for it you a lot of this is like about the psychology of how people think and operate and i know that you spent some
Key lessons from your psychologist
time working with a psychologist or a sports psychologist when you were rising in your career um i find that
super fascinating but i'd love to know what some of the key sort of lessons you learned about high performance or about
i guess like self-regulation um from that that psychologist as it relates to becoming a world champion and
you know yeah yeah um yeah so i did i worked with a sports psychologist for from the age of 16. oh really yeah so
really young and and i think that um was part of and you talk about um you
know you asked me earlier what is it that made me a little bit different or why did i succeed when others didn't and i think
part of that was um have you heard of growth mindset yes
yeah yeah so i think that my i didn't know about that then and neither did you know a lot of people but my mom um was pretty
quite growth mindset and and i and instilled that quite a lot in me for example she you know this idea of
just constant learning constantly wanting to learn and be better and recognizing that we can be better all the time we can
improve um and looking outside for other areas of expertise learning from other
sectors and all of that and she was the one that you know it wasn't like i was struggling with my mental strength and confidence or
anything it was just what else do we need to do what who else can help us who else can what you know we don't have all the answers
we want to learn we've got to learn from everyone and i always encourage clients in the business world you know who who can we constantly
be learning from all the time what was the what are they like some of the key things yeah and also what i think
what are they trying to do i i guess they're trying to make you the best athlete you can be but what are the things stopping you
from being the best athlete you can be ourselves yeah exactly most of the time we are the ones that get in our own way
how how do we get in our own way the doubts the the thing the thoughts that we think um
the doubt that that seeds um the nerves overcoming us so so becoming so nervous
that you become paralyzed almost um choking under pressure focusing on the wrong
things not being confident in yourself um yeah so many things that we do
fear doubt is a really interesting one there's fears doubt anxiety nerves lack of confidence all of
that stuff prevents us from being at our best and that essentially is what was one of the one of the big parts
of what a sports psychologist is helping you to do when an athlete when you line up and there's nine of you on the start line at
the olympic games all of them all of those athletes were trained hard they're all in amazing
shape they're all super fit they're all you know strong they're you know physically there's
not a huge amount of difference between those nine you know i think about 100 meter sprint
at the olympic games there's not a lot of difference between them
what is it that makes one of them win on the day and not often it's often not the strongest fastest fittest who wins
on the day it's the one who's the strongest up here and i really believe that
that this is often what stops people from fulfilling their potential
and that's why i love helping people with noun yeah yeah absolutely their mental game is what stops people
from being the best they can be of all the things that we do in our minds you talked about fear doubt
anxieties all these kinds of things fear and doubt like lack of self belief not believing that you can or
How do people overcome their limiting beliefs?
all those things that's probably one of the most common sort of mental games that um holds us back or um limits us from our
full potential um how does how does one go about overcoming their own limiting beliefs about themselves like they think okay
well no i can't do that everybody thinks they can't do everything it seems these days like i don't know why maybe it's just because of what i do for a living but
um i'm just surrounded by an audience of people that have real limiting beliefs
and i wonder why but i also wonder how you help them overcome their limiting beliefs big question
it's a huge question how do we overcome our limiting beliefs it's actually something that i work on a lot with
when i'm coaching clients um identifying beliefs that uh so you know
we would start probably with what are some of those limiting beliefs and start to unpick how are those
beliefs where how are they serving i wouldn't be interested in necessarily where they've come from
i would be interested in how are they serving us right now and how are they not serving us because
sometimes there's we're believing them because they're serving us for a purpose they're helping us in some way but often
more often than not those beliefs won't be serving us um so starting to unpick that um
you know almost like what are the pros and cons of having this belief here um right now that i can't achieve this
or that one of my limiting beliefs was that i'm not very good at sales um you know i was
i had to i have to you know i run a training consultancy i have to you know find clients and um how you
know so what's a more helpful belief um and starting to one pick what would be a better way of seeing
this what are my strengths and what would be a new belief that would be serve me better
i think at some point in your journey you probably not at one particular moment but gradually i imagine you
started to build evidence within yourself that you could be a great kayaker
and i imagine that was over a long period of time probably there wasn't one day where you woke up and thought [ __ ] i'm good right yeah exactly and i think
um that is a big part of where we get our confidence from is like our past experiences yeah so whenever we do
something we we start to build a bank of memories and when we're at the next situation
that is similar we can choose to draw on the bank of negative experiences where
we cocked it up or we can choose to draw on the bank of positive experiences where we succeeded and we did it really well
and the trick is and you know if we if we and if we're not conscious about it chances are we might pick the experience
of when we failed and then that's when we start to regurgitate all those thoughts and feelings of embarrassment and anxiety
and nerves and and that doesn't help us and that's like that probably would then
hinder performance absolutely it perpetuates the you know the doubt and the because
you're reminding yourself of all remember last time when you did it you cocked it up and you messed up and you did it then you then [ __ ] it up because
you're thinking and then you [ __ ] it up because and we think in images yeah and so when you think of something that you messed up
you're seeing yourself doing it right you're imagining it in your mind right here and now and so the trick is to consciously
recall the positive experience the past successes and if there's nothing in the bank
exactly of that experience there's chances are there's something similar there's always something similar and you
know so i would work with clients to identify what are all of the successes that you've had not just
in that specific scenario but let's let's look at lots of different successes and
then let's pick out what are the what are the attributes
that allowed you to achieve those things because quite often someone will go oh well i
achieved that but it was because the weather was good on that day or i achieved that because my team
my team did it really it wasn't me so it's about starting to unpick actually what role did you play in that
success and what are the attributes that allowed you your strengths your attributes that allowed you to achieve that
and then we start to build up the bank of successes and the strengths and the attributes
which we can transfer into any scenario how much do you think people
and this is i don't know why i'm asking this question because it's not quantifiable but like to what extent do you p do you think people underestimate their
potential generally oh massively like would you say like over 95
because i think i'd say over i think i'd say people realize what like typically the average person
realizes about five percent of their potential and i only real only say this because
again like you said i'm was very normal kid from very my parents bankrupt like we i dropped out i got kicked out of
school poor grades everything but this one thing i had and i always say like the one thing i had was i genuinely
believed that i was gonna be where i am today just for no without a ton of evidence just generally
believed and in fact the one of the reasons why i believed it was but not because i had any bank of successes yet
but i had a little bit but it was actually contrasting me to my peers when i was 14 and
thinking i think that i have skills they don't and i think that if these are the people
that become adults then i will have i will always have that advantage um so that was my way of like
and so when i like cocked up my grades and gcse and when school starts with that narrative
that okay well you got an e so you're gonna be in have an e life you're gonna be broke and unhappy like no you're wrong like um so i get my
mother you were you were gathering evident you were looking at your strengths which is part of the puzzle right you
may not have had the experiences and the evidence of the achievements and the certificates and
all of that but you what's more valuable is what you had is the non-tangible stuff yeah because
if we go through life only assessing our success on the
tangible stuff yeah then our confidence our self-belief actually in their two different things
will be quite fragile oh yeah i can i can see that because you're always assessing yourself against
a trophy a trophy or society because you're compared to oh i got this
award against all of these other people and and and i won this trophy and i went past this grade and i
and it's always against somebody else and a society rather than looking at the intangible attributes
that allowed you to achieve those successes because that's what isn't measurable against society and is
transferable to other domains and this is the and you're completely right and i've never actually thought about it that way
before because i've always tried to figure out why at 14 i was convinced that i would be successful
and 18 i wrote my diary i'm going to have a range of sport before that i'm 25 i'm gonna be a millionaire from 25 achieved all of those things
just knew i would but it was pure as you said it was purely based on and it's almost a strength audit or skills order
versus other people that i knew and i thought oh those skills are really good skills and they'll take you far but
school is about tangibles like and i'd say a grade is a tangible yeah so school says okay you got a an e so
unfortunately like it creates the impression from all angles you're gonna be poor like and you're not going to be that
successful but timmy over there who's got an a he's really going to kill it as a surgeon you know and and i think so how
you make it out alive out of that system and still with your you know self-esteem and self-belief intact is
remarkable what i and i think that what you had is is better than the certificate yeah yeah because yeah
but but what it does is it allows you to go this is intrinsic in me no one can take
it no one can take that away and my self-worth isn't based on a certificate
and a trophy and an award how do you give people that well so you work on identifying those
strengths what are those strengths we do this all the time we work with clients on what are those strengths and where's the
evidence of those strengths and when they start to see the evidence of those strengths well you know so i'm i i'm working with a
client and you know so one of your strengths is being an authentic leader um one of your
strengths is building relationships where's the evidence of that look at all these people what do you do about weaknesses though
so would you highlight their weaknesses i think it's important to highlight both i think it's more important to
work on exploiting your strengths and i would um so we do a lot of diagnostics
we use behavioral profiling and all of that kind of stuff and all of that will bring up both and i think it's important
to really be aware of your areas of development but ultimately if i'm sat on the start line of the
world championships and i'm focused on my weaknesses and all the things i need to avoid my
confidence is fragile yeah chances of performing on best slim and so in that moment
i absolutely need to have on the tips of my fingers what my strengths are and i need to know them and i need to be
able to exploit them and i think the more you work on those the better
what do you think about this idea of like labeling yourself in your line of work and the the broader labels we give ourselves even if it's just like bad salesmen you
What do you think about this idea of labels?
talked about that being one of your like previous little limiting beliefs or labels um i think they're not helpful and i
think it's really important that we're aware of those labels that we're giving ourselves and the awareness is the first step right we
can't change it if we don't notice it so we need to notice the the label in the first place and then
it's a bit you know it's like it's a limiting belief really isn't it um and so is that label serving me is it
helping me achieve my end goal it feels like it sometimes because it's making me fit in and it's giving me comfort so
i see this a lot with people that will say i am a in my case i'm just gonna use my case i'm a social media ceo
and i so i've been a social media ceo for 10 years it gives me some kind of like community
to be part of it gives me a sense of identity but at the same time it stops me from being all that i can be
and this is one thing i was going over in my book is like now i've left my company it's so tempting to just start another
social media business but like there's so much more i can do and so what i'm asking this question cause i'm in
the midst of really thinking about it is like how do i just resist my labels and be
a [ __ ] dj i'm doing i'm doing this big theatrical show and working in biotech and um i don't know i just this
idea of like liberating yourself from your own labels has been super relevant to me um i think that
um it becomes your identity is a bigger part of the problem you know it's like when an athlete
retires from sport it took me and it still takes me i catch myself saying
you know i'm an athlete i'm not a business person and i go oh i um you know i don't have a
background in business yeah i've been running a business for 11 years and i was a professional athlete for 15 years so it's almost this
you know i have almost the same amount of experience in business as i do in in sport yeah i labeled myself for so
long and i be that became my identity and your identity is ceo of a social
media company and so that's who i am and it's hard to let go of that because it's part of
who i am yeah and it's comfortable right and you know you know who that person is what the
behavior of that person's like and and you're stepping into a new role that
what does this new person look like how rewarding has that been for you to kind of i guess reinvent
yourself from being an athlete to now being an entrepreneur and a business person was it worth it that's what i'm saying was it worth it to step out of that label
yeah totally and and we should all have multiple careers um and i think as time you know as we're
living longer and longer we all will have multiple careers and i think we need to find the courage to step into new careers all the time
and reinvent and and just recognize that there's so many skills that we can transfer
from that other career label identity and bring into the next one and that's
what will allow us to succeed into the next one and recognizing that we're never going to grow
unless we step out of that comfort zone and yeah get a little bit scared of who this
new person could be or would be or should be and we'll find out and that's the exciting thing is we're
going to find out how do you for some people that's terrifying yeah the thought of like throwing
themselves into that place of uncertainty that they have to travel through before they get to their new self how do you get someone to
come willingly into uncertainty to leave that job or to you know take on that promotion or to
pivot in their career when they're scared of the unknown or you know it's like well
then i would think about what i would think about rather than what i'm afraid of i'm thinking about what i'm excited about
and so rather than i'm afraid of what i'm going to leave behind or i'm afraid of what might happen i'm more about what
could happen and when we focus on what we want and what we could have and you know it's a it's optimism isn't it it's about what's
possible and what could i achieve you know and you asked me earlier about you know some of the things about
sports psychology and visualization was one was a massive technique really that i learned from my
sports psychologist and employed and still use all the time and i think when you can start to
visualize what that new role person identity could
be and when you bring it to life with all of your senses and see it really vividly then that's
exciting and what what could i achieve and what could this look like
and and the power of visualization is that your mind does when it's when you see it really
vividly your mind doesn't know the difference between a vividly imagined experience and a real life experience
Your process of visualisation
what's your process for visualization and now is it something that you do actively you set time aside and do it or
is it just something that you naturally now do when you're pursuing a goal
so a little bit of both as an athlete it was definitely something that i would sit down usually i'd be lying on my bed
i would have done some relaxation because the more we clear our mind and relax the easier it is to visualize and to see really clearly
and so i would it would be a conscious right i'm gonna spend the next 15 minutes or even two minutes or five
minutes or whatever time i had visualizing my next race and seeing myself execute that race plan
as perfectly as i can and in exactly the right way and i would visualize
everything from um if it was the olympic discipline and we've got nine boats on a start line i'm
seeing my i don't know which lane i'm gonna be in when it comes to race day so i'm seeing myself racing every lane i'm seeing myself with with the headwind
with a tailwind with it raining i'm seeing myself [ __ ] up the start because that might happen
but then i just going to recover from it and i'm going to see myself recover and i'm going to see myself win from behind i'm going to see myself win from the
front i'm going to see imagine you know they'll start being delayed or it's a
full start you know all these eventualities so that when it comes to the event i'm
prepared and it can just all unfold and i'm not phased by anything that happens but but
most importantly i've seen it happen the way i want it to happen and then i believe that it can happen
and what visualization also does is when we when we're visualizing a goal for example
it starts to activate the subconscious to generate creative ideas about how we
can achieve our goal it's it's it's my i don't know how it works and why it works but it's
mind-blowing and it does work and and it starts to um get your brain to
perceive and recognize the different um resources that you need
to achieve your goal it's like the law of attraction and it starts to activate that in your
life and bring in the people the resources the environment the circumstances that you need
to achieve your goal and so now what do i do i probably i do spend some
time consciously going like i'm just going to spend two or three minutes visualizing my goal i'm seeing it happen
i'm seeing it realize um but then other times i'm probably just
you know driving in my car and subconsciously you know like daydreaming almost but i think the
the conscious right i'm gonna visualize now is really powerful because then you
start to really it starts to ingrain in the subconscious
so the law of attraction stuff i think sometimes it can take people one of two ways because i do believe in
Your discipline and how to apply it
visualization my visualizations over the years have been very like the daydreaming stuff but then also when i was like
really really really broke and living in moscow in like a boarded up house i would frequently look at stuff that in
the future i wanted so i'd look at these like mansion houses and whatever and that was me kind of just
um setting my i don't know trying to peer into my future life the bit that i think sometimes gets lost
when we talk about like the law of attraction it's almost akin to like when you set
off in the morning you put your satin have him and you say this is where i want to go i want to go test go but then if you don't like put the key
in and put your foot down you're just going to be sat in your garage and but there's something about knowing
where you want to go and as you say like almost programming your brain to trick your brain to think
to completely be convinced that you will get there that i then that from my experience then makes you take actions
in that direction so like i'm sure you then you visualize yourself as a world champion but then you're like you go in
the gym and you you train like a world champion because you that's where you that's your destination
and the the the the opposite is also true like if you visualize yourself not being world champion what's the point you know you know um so
my my real question here is about all of the actions and the discipline it takes
especially as an athlete to get you from where you are to that visualized destination
i'm really keen to hear about like the discipline the consistency because you're in a physical very very physical
endurance race and you know it's like i think muhammad ali said like it's one in the gym it's one in training
a lot of it and we all struggle with that we all struggle with like showing up on monday when it's raining so like what's
the what's the key there so i think i think you're absolutely right you know when we visualize
it it gives us the motivation to believe that it can happen yeah yeah and that's
that's at the core of it because if we don't believe it can happen then what's the point and so yes we absolutely have to take
action but we need the motivation to take action i can't say that you know 100 of the
days that i was training i was oh yeah i can't wait to get out there go training it's pretty freezing outside it's like
the middle of winter on the water and the river thames and it's like ice
um yeah that wasn't appealing every day luckily the funding came in and we got to go travel and train in
warmer climates in florida and wherever else um but yes there's this
you know goal that's the world championships it's the olympic games it's you know those big dream goals
that are highly motivating but on those day every single day
i'd be lying if you you know if you could say that goal in four years time is what got me out of bed
on that rainy freezing cold you know january morning but isn't that the answer then like it
was just take like do today well yeah so it's but but also um i do a lot of work
around intrinsic motivation and understanding what drives us and and we're all we all have different
drivers and unsurprisingly one of my drivers is a sense of achievement and so my driver wasn't necessarily
on that particular day oh i've got a train really hard because i want to win the world championships in two years
time my driver was probably more that my coach has set targets every month
that throughout the winter for you know for five months of the winter we would have targets every month in the gym there would be certain
exercises in the gym that we've got to hit um we would do tests on we would do time
trials on running in swimming and on the water um so as part of our cardiovascular training so and for me
that was really um i loved hitting those targets basically that monthly
right so if i do and i know that if i do this training today then i'm going to get better and i've
got a test on the weekend and i want to hit that target i want to want to smash the target actually because yeah then there's a good chance
i'm going to win the world championship it's not just hitting the targets i need to smash the targets and so that sense of achievement for me
was a big driver for other people in my team it might have been and on actually on other
days it might have been actually i want to get out and go train because i want to see my teammates because we have a laugh and there's banter and it's fun
and i enjoy the connection and the sense of that being part of a team and the community and and all of that and so it's this the
affiliation that's driving me on some days and but for others
you know i can think of some of the girls in my team actually a sense of recognition was a big driver so needing that you
know ah today you know you worked really hard you've you know you really put everything into that session you know hearing that from
the coach or you know look how far you've come or look what you've you know the progress you've made or
so everyone and so when a coach can tap into that knowing what is it that's going to get
you out of bed today that's when we start to get the best out of people or the best out of ourselves
and so you know when i work with with leaders it's about what motivates and drives me intrinsically not just the carrot and
the paste pay slip and the promotion and you know and and all of that that's the external stuff which isn't very
sustainable we need to know what drives us in as
individuals but also what drives our team and tap into both of those and start to ask what what is it that
am i getting that every day and if i'm not how can i get that from work
what is it that i need to get and also really interesting you know if you're a leader of a business and you're working
with a team are my drivers influencing how i operate with others in my team you know
so if my driver is a sense of achievement but your driver is to make a meaningful contribution
and i'm pushing you guys no we need to we need to we need to win this and we need to get the next pitch and and you're like no i just want to really
help these people i'm pushing my driver onto you and that's not working for you
so it's really important to be aware of what my driver is and know that it's not the same as yours chances are yeah that's a good that's a
really good point and i think i've probably as someone that probably values a sense of achievement and
forward motion and progress above all else at times when i'm trying to motivate people especially like friends
i'm trying to sell them on the value of achievement when they're probably just not asked about a particular thing i don't need to
win yeah i just want to doesn't matter to me i i want to fill ownership of this piece of work
yeah actually that's what's really important to me and how do you find out what someone's driver driver drivers or motivations or
How do you find what drives other people
intrinsic motivations are is there is there a system or like a test or yeah so i the work um there's some brilliant
work from um a chat called dean spitzer and he talks about super motivation and this idea that there isn't you know we there's
intrinsic and there's extra extrinsic motivation so what we use a diagnostic actually when i work with clients
and it will identify it forces you to to pick because you know we all want you know
maybe some recognition or some achievement or to feel like we're making a contribution or to be with people all of this but it
really forces you to identify what really is your big driver um
so yeah so i use that but i mean i think when you talk to people you can start to you know the more you get to know
someone and you ask them questions and you see the way they operate and and you see them light up when they get certain feedback or when they're
doing certain pieces of work so we can start to get a feel for that just when we get to know people i
you when you know i asked you there about the that like discipline and consistency and what gets you up every day on like a
rainy tuesday or whatever and it was interesting that um you kind of like shortened your horizon
or your skirt like people i think people typically think they they want to get to the top of the mountain so they think okay
um let's make a plan to get to the top of the mountain but you were so focused on these like short-term shorter goals which meant
that i guess your progress sort of almost like invisibly compounds um to get you to the top of the mountain
so instead of like we want to get to staircase number a thousand we're like let's get 10 let's do 10 stairs today
and then 10 stairs tomorrow and 10 starts and 10 sets and by the time you know it you're at the top of the mountain right
yeah well literally i i am four years ago i climbed um mount tubcall of course you did as you
do and um i we went with there was probably 10 of us
in the group one of them one of the girls that was on the group was a friend of mine and she had i don't know why she joined the group
but she had a fear of heights oh god um and we're climbing a mountain and it was fine for the first day and a half
because it's just like a windy road the morning of the summit it's literally
we're going up we feel like we're going up a steep mountain and you're and there's boulders and and she literally
cannot she's so scared of heights and i can't do i can't do it and eventually
i was like julia you just need to focus she what her biggest fear actually was also
getting down okay um looking down and thinking how i might get but how the heck am i
going to get back down because that looks really scary and it's slippery and
there's there's screen so the ground is loose and i'm like don't even think about that
right now all you need to do is take one step at a time one meter at a time that's all i want you to
focus on and one meter and one meter and one and we'll figure out the rest and you might not even get to the top who knows you
might you might not we might start but just do one meter at a time and then
we'll figure out the down bit and we'll take it one step at a time on the way down because that's all we can do right in
that moment is take one step at a time and it's the same whether it's a goal to achieve
you know x turnover in a business or this many sales or whatever the business is or whatever walk of life yes we need to
know the end goal but actually we just need to focus on the process
because the summit looks scary but one meter doesn't look scary exactly and if you just do one meter at
a time and also you know or whether it's the fear or oh my god it's so far away we've got another four hours
to go it might be you know whatever it is well actually let's just do the next five minutes
and let's see if that is feasible because it probably is right can i do one yeah can you take this next step yeah i
can definitely take that next step okay can you take the next one can i take the next one and that feels really feasible you
mentioned earlier getting at the very beginning of this conversation getting news i think when you were about 24 25
that you had an illness called chronic fatigue syndrome i'm now going to be incredibly naive and
narrow-minded when i when you read chronic fatigue syndrome you think tiredness that's what you think right but um but i
know it's a lot more crippling than that and i know that it's a lot more devastating that especially for an athlete
um talk me through finding out you had this this this disorder but also what it meant for
your career and how it changed things heal this week

messages talk me through finding out you had this this this disorder but also
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome
what it meant for your career and how it changed things so yeah i
like you say was 25 26 when i was uh diagnosed with chronic fatigue
syndrome and yes it's more than just fatigue um it's not just i'm tired today it's being
devoid of energy exhausted almost on a permanent basis it also for
me included muscle pain to the point where the my muscles were sorry muscle ache to the
point where it was painful to the point where i couldn't stand in the shower and hold my hands up here to
wash my hair for more than 10 seconds because it was too painful
um some people have symptoms i didn't get this so much but sort of
you know like can't concentrate can't focus brain fog um some people
are actually bedridden um some people are actually in a wheelchair um luckily i wasn't as bad as that but i
was bad to the point where yeah i couldn't i i couldn't be in my kayak
paddling for more than 10 minutes at a very light gentle walk type pace having gone from winning world
championships for two and a half hours at a very high pace to can't get my hands to hold my hands
up here i i was literally two months earlier able to rattle off 100 press-ups in one go
and then can't hold my hands up here for more than 10 seconds so that's the that's the physical
element and that's only the physical element but the mental and emotional battle was
just as challenging because you can't you can't see it so it's not
you know i i was got frustrated to the point where i actually wished that my skin was covered in spots so
that people could see that there was something wrong with me and could understand that i was going through something that i was in pain
that i was you know unwell but i looked fine so i got diagnosed with the honest in
2003 beginning of the season it was like april and then
so following year is coming up to the olympics 2004 some training for the olympics or wanting to be training so six months
later it was only six months later that they actually diagnosed it because it takes six months for them to eliminate
everything else and go oh this is fatigue that's been going on for more than six months therefore you have chronic fatigue syndrome
and i re i went off to florida um and the sports team doctor was saying
right you need to do this graded return to exercise they think they originally and they still thought it was overtraining
that's the immediate assumption right athletes tired muscle ache must be over trained um so they diagnose
you they um offered me this program of right gently build up your return to
sport um so you start with 10 minutes at a heart rate of 115 i can't remember
and then 15 minutes at 115 and then 20 minutes and 30 minutes and when you can get to 40 minutes then we can go up to
120 heart rate and so on and so on and so i went out like my training group and my coach were all in
florida so i went out to florida to train and and i just couldn't get past 20 minutes um
and so i went out to i went to see a doctor in florida and the doctor he ran some blood tests
and basically like i still looked like an athlete i'm still pretty muscly i'm fair i'm
lean i'm in florida i've got a tan and he basically looked at me and said
well we've run all the blood tests there's nothing coming up nothing there doesn't appear to be anything wrong with you you look really fit and well
i think you're fine and so that just this frustration of i can't see it and
therefore there must be nothing wrong you know it's just mental health right you know people who are suffering with depression or anxiety or
whatever it is we can't see it and so we don't know it and we don't understand it and so the mental
and emotional battle was really challenging and um even people in my sport not
understanding what's wrong with anna oh she she can't cope with it anymore or she's too lazy to train or whatever
they're saying all these things and and that's hard um how did it make you feel
so in the beginning um frustrated devastated confused
um sad lonely so many different things and
frustrated because also we didn't really know what it was and the doctors are saying it's overtraining and actually when i reflect on the
previous two years i'd had episodes of fatigue which i now know were episodes of that
same illness but that only lasted for two weeks or three weeks or six weeks and i would stop training or i'd really
cut back on training and then i'd be able to come back and i'd be fine again and and so i
only know that it was i knew in my heart when i went to see the team doctor that one day and i
remember it that it wasn't over training because for six months i had been doing less
training than everyone else in my group i can't be overtrained i'm doing less
than everyone else because we were so conscious of this uh ana's over training that i wasn't i wasn't it was just was
not over training and the doctor is like oh you've over trained jesus and that i just and then that was it i
didn't train again for 18 months um and i did i did i after working with
the sport the team doctor i went to other doctors i tried conventional medicine i tried alternative therapies
and and nothing was working and that was the the hardest part as well was that
one you can't really tell me what's wrong with me and two you can't tell me how to deal with this and and then you know i went to see
one doctor and he said basically there's no cure there's no treatment and you're don't
don't don't think you're ever going to get back in a kayak you never you might get back in a kite but you're never going to race at that highest level you won't race again
so that was that was a pretty big moment um he said that to you yeah and how is that to him yeah just
like this is this is my you know this is my identity this is who i am this is my life this is this is my career i still have
ambitions left to fulfill and i don't i don't want something like this to end
my career i want to end it on my terms when i choose that i'm done and so
yeah that summer watching the olympic games on the telly and athens um it was devastating and
but i guess i always believed that i would find a way i was like there has
to be a solution to this there has to be a way out um and i i guess that
i'm a very optimistic person and a very much a possibility possibilitarian
i call it that i don't know if that's a word but believing that it's it's possible yeah that there is a way
out there has to be a way out and and i guess i didn't know
whether there was but i just had to i had to believe that there was i had to believe that i would get out of
this and then i would find a way back and that i would get back to training and racing one day otherwise what what what did i have and not that
my life would be over if i couldn't paddle but just that's what that belief i think
is what kept me going um in that in that time and and eventually to cut a long story short
i did find a treatment for the illness and i did recover and i didn't get back um
but it wasn't an easy journey do they before we got into what the treatment was in your recovery do they know what's happening to you
like physiologically when you have um that disorder have they do they know what what's
causing you um [Music] the problem is is that there are many different schools of thought okay
and it depends who you talk to and it depends which doctor um and what clinical or study or what
study you read or which one do you believe i believe
based on the treatment that i did um which was a treatment called reverse therapy and
this was founded by a chap called dr john eaton and back quite it was it was only just
um it was quite a new therapy when i did it back in 2005 for um and
essentially the symptoms are like alarm bells going off in your body so
these symptoms the pain the fatigue the exhaustion that can't focus any of the symptoms that you're experiencing
are alarm bells and your body's way of telling you that there are things
going on in your life that your body doesn't like whether that be pressures
stresses relationships environment emotions all sorts of things that are
triggering these symptoms and these alarm bells and basically if you don't listen
to the alarm bells they'll get louder and louder and louder to the point where eventually they just
go right done you're just not going to move now you're not going to until you listen
up how how how loud do i need to get before you're going to listen and for me it was to the point where i
couldn't train when i can't train i'm going to listen up because now it's really bad and now i
need to pay attention and so um i i'm i'm not particularly
articulate explaining what the physiologic what's going on physiologically but that's that's
my interpretation of what how the symptoms arrive and how you deal and and then
what i did so that the the treatment that i did is about identifying what are those triggers what are those things that um that your
body and mind are saying i don't like what were they and so for me um non-expression of
emotion is one of the most common triggers and that certainly was the case for me to the point where
i didn't open up to anyone really i have really close
friends i have family i have a sister i'm really close to and of course i you know shared it with them but i cried
on my own for sure but i never cried in front of anyone else i didn't really express how bad it was
in fact to the point where people would ask and you know how are you doing yeah i'm fine i'm fine and i would just block it out to them
all the time and that was just making it worse and actually when i started to
one of the biggest and most powerful steps that i took was opening up to people to the people closest to me sharing what
i was experiencing with them allowing them to see my struggle and my
vulnerability and let them help me that's that was a big turning point for me
um was being able to just express that emotion and share and open up
because par what i was doing was i was isolating myself by not sharing it and that was
perpetuating it um and these emotions are worry or pressure that you're
experiencing because of the sport or what were these emotions that you were suppressing or well so when
not when i was competing or you know before with the in the beginning the emotions were different but in the middle of the
illness like not just not sharing it with people not expressing how
hard i'm finding this how um tough this is that how sad i am how frustrated i am
how just i can't cope anymore kind of emotions those emotions i wasn't even expressing in the middle of the illness
you're being tough yeah i'm being poker face anna who has learnt to do this because that's what you do in sport
right isn't that isn't that almost like there's a bit of a paradox there that the thing that made you successful was also the thing that kind of
undid you to some degree it sounds like well so that composure and resilience yeah so
when you're on the competitive arena of sport and you turn up on race day poker face on game face i'm tough
whether i've missed the last two weeks because of an injury or for whatever reason you're never going to know that
because i'm i'm here today and i'm i'm on fire and you know i'm ready to race um and
that's brilliant on the race arena but outside of that
not helpful not helpful in so many ways in terms of building relationships in
terms of building trust you know we talk about trust earlier um
Benefits of being vulnerable
you can't build trust and relationships unless you open up unless you express vulnerability so true i think
that's one of the reasons i struggle with my relationships my romantic relationships is because i bring the tough guy thing into my into
like my personal life sometimes and um it doesn't ever help
and i think the the progress i've made actually in my personal relationships as you've said has been by like admitting more that i'm
wrong and like saying how i feel and being like i you know what i mean and that's but that's not conducive with
the whole like resilient tough guy business thing that i have to do i don't i don't think they're mutually
exclusive it doesn't feel like they are but you're right like they're definitely not mutually
exclusive but um they're two different people trying to achieve two different objectives
in business there's a sense of like you know you've got to really like stand up for yourself you've got to be ruthless to some degree in some
situations especially when you're dealing with teams and there's [ __ ] landing on your desk every day and you're getting horrible horrible news
and you have to put on a brave face for your team because you just found out that your whole server's been hacked and they've basically
half of them have lost their jobs or the pandemic has just struck and then going like
i know what you're saying do you think of certain moments i think i'm thinking one particular moment which i always talk about in this
podcast where on the way to work i got this news that we've been hacked and i've got i got 100 or 200 people sat
in the office in front of me that are now looking through the window and thinking what's going on and my my need to be composed and optimistic at
a time when i probably was panicking a little bit inside i think got us through i think if i'd walked out there and been
like listen guys i am [ __ ] it here it might have but in my personal life it's very important to have that
intimacy and vulnerability i think there's um a balance actually and i think in business
you are if you are able to be a little bit vulnerable and i'm not saying vulnerable to the point where you look
really weak but vulnerable to the point where you're honest and you
might go do you know what shit's happened and actually i'm a little bit scared
but we're going to find a way and i don't know how we're going to figure this out right now and and it's
not great and but you know it's about having confidence in who i am
and what we do and confident in the people around us and my team and you lot and all of us
that we're going to figure this out yeah so there's a balance there between i'm human
and yes i'm scared like you because this is [ __ ] and this is a bad situation that we didn't
want to happen and let's admit that let's put that on the table and be honest about it because people we build trust with
people when we're honest then we show a little bit of vulnerability and humanity and
that's how we build relationships because otherwise we're just putting up this tough guy front all the time who
doesn't have any feelings right and you can't relate to that can resonate can't connect yeah how do we connect with people
whereas actually oh you're just a human being who's scared too and i'm scared and therefore
it's okay to be scared but actually i'm scared but we're going to find a way so it's confidence
and we're going to figure this out because we we are good at what we do
you know our definition when we do our resilient leader workshops is a resilient leader's confidence and has
confidence in who they are and what they do and understands their areas of strength and their areas of
development and finds a way to bounce back and create opportunities and so if i'm confident in who i am and
what i do yeah i can admit that i don't know what to do right now
but i know that i have the skills and the resources within me and my people that we're going to figure
this out i don't know what that way forward is yet but i know that we're going to find a way
what if okay so what if you um and this is me playing devil's advocate what if you don't
know that you're gonna find a way so say you're scared you don't think you're gonna find a way and you think it's all over
say you've got i don't know 500 employees out there the wait waiting for you in the middle of the pandemic to make us make a statement to the team
do you walk out and lie if you within yourself genuinely as the ceo of a company don't you think it's over um
because of i don't know the pandemic has just happened and the business has evaporated when you walk out in front of your team
surely you've got to just lie to their faces to some degree like you've got i think that you have to believe we always
no matter what the situation is we can only be truly great at what we do if we
believe without doubt that the future is bright yeah some leaders don't
naturally you think of you know just some people don't so by like probably probabilistically there's
going to be some leaders that when the pandemic struck thought we are finished and that as we said earlier about like
the self-fulfilling mindset will actually probably take them out of business and i just i don't know just because i
don't think i've ever been comfortable in my career to tell my team that i'm scared i've i don't think i've ever actually
been scared because i am i kind of resist in moments where
i probably should be scared i'm so focused on solutions that fear or joy all these other
feelings don't really seem to be relevant or useful to me but i don't think i could bring myself to tell the team i was ever scared when
i was at social media maybe you don't need to say i'm scared but it might be that you know what yeah this is [ __ ] yeah
yeah yeah i could do that and and actually right now i don't i don't know how we're gonna get out of
this but i do have confidence in my ability and all of us together as a team that
we're gonna find a way the leaders have to lie sometimes i don't i don't i think we need to be
honest i think that we need to be transparent and the more
we can be transparent and we can be honest in what we do the better relationships we build the better connections the more trust we
have in a team and we figure it out together i agree
Overcoming your disorder
yeah so going back to your i want to know so what exactly did you do in terms of you know um daily
to overcome your disorder was it was there you addressed you know you started expressing yourself more was there
anything you you had to take or was there you know so there was no medicine there was no pill there was no
massage treatment there was nothing like that it purely is a recognition that the mind and the
body are connected and therefore i needed to figure out what these triggers are one of so to give you a bit of context
so um i leading up to the sydney 2000 olympic games i left the coach that i was working with
that had got me to become a world champion but i now wanted to go and race at the olympic games and he was very much a marathon coach
and and encouraged me to go find someone who really specializes in sprint racing
so i ended up for three years having a coach who was based in another country and i would go and train with them
sometimes and then i would come back to the uk and i would train on my own and he would
send me the training program we'd speak on the phone he'd email it to me i'd do the training and i would basically train
a lot of most days i would turn up to the training do the training and i was motivated enough to be able to
push myself really hard to i had no problem with training on my own in the sense that i
you know some people can't push themselves hard and i haven't got the motivation to turn up and do that but the problem
with that was that i and i didn't realize this at the time
i was isolating myself and i think i um so i i wasn't engaged there
was my club i was at my club but i would turn up to my club and they'd all go off and train separately and i train on my own and
then i'd often turn up at times when they weren't there i wouldn't engage with the british team really much and i was just ice more
and more isolating myself and then getting frustrated because i didn't have a coach she was by my side
and i thought that all i needed to do was train hard i thought and the reason i stuck with
this coach was because he was a great coach and i thought the training program was brilliant and i thought all i need to do is follow
a great training program and work really hard and i thought that was enough
and actually i didn't i'm not a robot and i needed i needed human connection and i needed
emotional support and i needed a place to vent and i needed to be able to show frustration and when the
training was hard or when i was exhausted and i had no one to even talk to on the riverside bank you know i'm talking to the ducks
you know it's like i had no outlet for my emotions i had no and i didn't even speak up and tell my
coach that i was frustrated that he sent me the program only two minutes before i needed to be at the training you know i was going to train and
because there's this five hour time difference and and i just was probably quite unhappy
but didn't realize because i was so focused on the goal and the end goal and
got to train hard and this is what it takes that i was so not in tune with
what was going on emotionally and i was at my best when i was training in
a group environment with a coach by my side every day supporting me other i'm an extrovert i get my energy
from other people and there i was spending my days alone doing this really intense training
program on my own that is not conducive to a really good
mental and emotional health and so it was really clear that that was
not yeah that wasn't sustainable and that was why i had these periods of oh yeah three weeks falling apart and
i'd have to stop and um and then when i'd get back to an environment that was i was happy and it was all good and i
would train hard and i'd be amazing and i have full of energy and and i and i had my best year and then i would change and the environment
change and so my environment and the people around me and my emotional happiness was some of the things that i needed to get a grip
on um it's so fascinating that people really underestimate the value of human connection but also the
The importance of connection
environment we're operating in like hugely i've had a conversation with a friend and he'll be listening to this podcast because he's never ever missed
one um he's he was working at my old company's um social chain for many years and he's
he's gone freelance and he was talking a little bit about feeling a bit burnt out he came to my house he's saying feel a bit burnt out i'm lacking
motivation in the mornings and things like that and when i was a freelancer before i started the company and had 700 people
around me all day i just couldn't find the motivation to like go to my laptop and send the emails
but the minute i was in that environment where we had this kind of like shared goal and i had feedback and
community my motivation was higher than anyone's in the world but i don't think people appreciate enough
the the importance of the environment and the community that you're operating in and i think there's a certain thing which people don't talk about which i've
talked about this podcast couple of weeks ago which was this idea of like freelance depression and even like you're seeing it with the world now from working remotely
having to get up and like now you're realizing what your job actually is because before
it could have been like seeing susanna and hearing about her weekend and engaging with the office dogs and this and the sense of community
you've kind of conflated them with your tasks at work and now it's just your tasks now you're
waking up and on a computer looking at your to-do list and so i think freelance depression and
it's almost what you've described there is this like inner lack of fulfillment because you've lost
what was a huge part of what made this pleasurable enjoyable but also your so i guess your support network
yeah um and that's why you know we talked earlier about motivation and what gets you off in the morning and
actually going in to hear about susan's weekend or you know to see your friends and the
connection and the buzz from the atmosphere and and that might be what gets you to work not the tasks that i've got to do but
actually the people i'm going to hang out with and that environment and we need to understand what is that environment that
we thrive in and i think people are realizing that over the last 12 months you know
and especially the extroverts have found this really hard and if you live on your own and you're still and you're not able to go into
work you're a speaker you speak around the world and stuff and you you love speaking but the minute it
becomes just speaking to a laptop over zoom to 100 people you realize that
maybe it wasn't just the speaking that i enjoyed right yeah yeah yeah exactly i don't just enjoy hearing my own voice
yeah i enjoy telling my story over and over again i i love the connection that i get and
the feedback and the you know i can't even hear people laugh at my jokes that i think they're supposed to be funny
i don't even know if they landed or not um and you know when you meet the people
afterwards and you go and engage with them and how are you going to apply this and what are you going to put into action and and all of that stuff that's that's
that's the energy that i get when i go and do my work and
that's that's missing right now um and you're getting it a bit but not in the same way and so
and i remember actually one of the very first things i did with my sports psychologist he got me to do
i think it was like a myers-briggs type assessment identifying what kind of personality
type i was and i was a stable extrovert and and i don't know what he ever really
did with that information but looking back now that's such useful information so for someone
if someone had known that and they could see that i was training every day on my own without support without people to
feed off that's where i get my energy of course i was losing energy and tired i wasn't getting your body was sending
you a message i'm like i need people to get energy and i'm not surrounded by people that's just one
example of one of the triggers but you know so it was about finding out what do i need to thrive
it's fascinating uh we had johanna hari who wrote the book called lost connections on this podcast his book is
behind me one of my favorite books of all time he's coming back his whole his whole um book is about the real the nine real
reasons for anxiety and depression and to kind of conclude it in in a very sort of narrow way he talks
about these feelings we get of loneliness and lack of motivation and anxiety and depression when you look
at all the studies and he was someone that was depressed and given the pills and you know they said oh you're broken chemical imbalance when you look
at the studies it's it's almost indisputable that much of it these days is because of social factors and our
lack of human connection they've got examples where they've given a guy in uruguay goat who was depressed and because he's
got now that connection with an animal he's his depression his symptoms of depression almost evaporated
but the lives we live in 2021 between four white walls if we want food
we press an app if we want you know to see our parents it's through a piece of glass and living alone in these industrialized
cities it's actually completely against our innate human programming and he says one of the
things he says which i've written in my book as well is about how these feelings are our calling to get back to being more human it's
like your body calling like loneliness is this calling like get back to your tribe you know what i mean and then
and i and it sounds like [ __ ] because it's like well my loneliness isn't the thing but what you've just described there is
quite literally something that's happened in your mind having a real substantial almost
devastating and crippling impact on your body and health the thought that your mind
can disable your body is um terrifying on one hand but also kind of
like a really powerful important you know but if you think about many
illnesses ailments from [Music] getting a you know crafting people will
get a headache when they're stressed people will get a migraine when at the end of a stressful period people will
get sick sick you know so there are so many illnesses that can be considered
as emotional but manifest physically yeah it's crazy so it's not
the first example yeah and and you know like your loneliness is my calling to get back it's an alarm
bell right you're feeling really lonely and it's a warning sign to you it's a message
to say you need to do something differently in this example get back to your tribe and in the same way that my body the
alarm bells were i'm going to make you so tired that you can't train so then you're going to listen
and you're going to figure out what it is that you need to do differently to get back to training
in a really healthy way and when i returned back to training i was able to change
lots of things about my environment about the people i was with about the pressures i put myself under
you know all of these things that i'd figured out and then i trained harder than i had before
because i was in a really healthy environment and place and i was listening to my body and my
mind they call it mind body and i was able to tune into that and go
every time i was anywhere near just not feeling quite right i'd go what
what's my my body telling me right now what is it that's going on that it doesn't like what do i need to be aware of and then i
could thrive after that it's a big shift in conventional thinking because whenever someone exhibits
physical illness people say oh what tablet does this person need you know what's the chemical and and
that's why you'll get lots of different if you research cfs there's so many different schools of
thought oh it's a post-viral fatigue it's you know there's lots of um
yeah i guess um physiological explanations for it
and maybe and there's probably lots of you know clinical research behind that suggests that it is i don't know but my
experience was that something else and that's all i can go by really and you came back
to the sport competing again i'm guessing yeah so i returned two years later and won the world championships
and european championships in 2005 and then went on to win two more times after that and compete in beijing three years later
it's incredible so now all of that's you know that part of your career has um ended
Whatâs next for you?
very very successfully and you've you know you reached the real i mean you were the world champion multiple times looking forward at your
your your the career since then and into the future what matters to you and what's getting you out of bed now and what's
making you um excited for yeah life um i love
helping others now helping others sharing learning from my experiences in sport and taking those
lessons and bringing them to other people mostly in the business world and developing people you know
i had you know spent a lifetime with coaches who were developing me um
or the athletes and the team and it's the same thing it's about
developing people you know in bus in sport it was about getting results through people
developing those people to get results in sport and now i'm using that to get results
for people in business by developing people and and i get a real
kick out of you know if i'm coaching someone and coaching a director or a leader whoever it is i was coaching
this morning and seeing them have that aha moment about a limiting belief um
you know getting the new dream job um engaging with the team being a more
confident leader whatever it is i love it when i see that change and that transformation in other people
helping them to change habits to change behaviors to excel to get the best out of themselves that's what really
that's what motivates me now is is helping others to fulfill their potential
well listen it's been um an incredibly interesting diverse conversation one that's made me um have a couple of
my own personal epiphanies so i thank you so much for coming today and sharing your story um where do people find you if they want to get in
touch with you where's the best way to reach out so annahemings.com my training consultancy call is called
beyond the barriers so be on the barrels.uk i'm on linkedin um we'll find you they'll finally turn on we can find a

Intro
they just don't have the education so our own doctors do not have enough education in something that we do a third of our lives
if you are waking up in the middle of the night and it's been happening to you over and over again to resolve the habit you're going to
have to
sleep it's a thing that we all do every day but for some reason in our society it's still a little bit of a mystery
how many hours should we be sleeping what is sleep debt is there a perfect sleep routine should
i wake up at a certain time why do i get sleep paralysis insomnia why do i have these dreams
my next guest stephanie romichevsky worked with nasa and harvard medical school to understand
these questions stephanie currently works as a sleep physiologist helping people cure and understand their insomnia and
sleep disorders so without further ado my name is stephen bartlett and this is the diver ceo i hope nobody is listening
but if you are then please keep this to yourself [Music]
What the result of not sleeping properly?
stephanie the first question i wanted to ask you and i've got millions and millions of questions to
ask you because this is a topic which i as i said before we started chatting on air
um has really peaked an interest over the last three years i've never had so many of my friends in my
sort of close circle ask me questions about sleep send me articles about sleep and i don't know what's happened but as
a nation and as a as a species i think we've got really really curious about this idea of sleep and also its
importance the first question i wanted to ask you was a was how important sleep is but
i think a better way to understand that and the answer is to actually look at
the consequences you've seen in your line of work um for people that have
bad sleep or that have insomnia um so could you speak to that a little bit i can that's a big big question yeah um
what i have seen over the last 16 years of my career is not people coming in dying because
they aren't sleeping or with really really significant illnesses i've seen people
very anxious very stressed very low because their sleep is poor and they are
extremely worried about it and i've seen people who are you know at the top of their game and doing
really well in life but are completely crippled by these sleep problems but it is the fear
of bad things worse things happening to them that is keeping them as stressed and upset as they are so
it's quite interesting because i think the the things that bring people to me to get their sleep treated
are exactly that that fear is actually what i'm trying to alleviate rather than
um fixing their sleep because i think they're going to get so sick that something terrible is going to happen to them
and so it's a really interesting question to ask how does sleep affect us the reality is we actually we or why do
we sleep we don't know actually why we sleep we know what happens when we don't sleep
but i think we're getting very very confused between those of us that struggle with sleep and
those that are actively depriving themselves of sleep like the ceo who says
i'll sleep when i'm dead for example sure um but you know those of us who are
actively trying to sleep when we can't and we will do anything and we we make
our sleep opportunities larger and we still can't get sleep we're not depriving ourselves of sleep we're doing
anything we can to get sleep so i i worry about the amounts
out there about sleep at the moment and the way that it's the information is being disseminated because i think
that's where we're going a bit wrong and all the tracking of sleep and all the tech that comes out i'm not saying it's
it's a bad thing i'm just saying that it's almost like we haven't quite caught up with all the information that we have
and we can't cope with it quite the way we need to so you speak about the tech that we have
Where is the bullshit?
now apple watches all these little you know smart devices that are telling us how many hours a day we're sleeping
and also there's you know books there's probably a couple books on the shelf behind me about the perfect night's sleep or the perfect morning routine or
the perfect time to wake up where is the [ __ ] oh my god again another massive question um
there is so much of it it's it's all it's so nuanced you're going to have to ask me some specifics because
there is so much there that actually is i mean well the first thing the biggest thing i
would say is you know going to bed at exactly the same time every night dictating your bedtime is
probably the worst piece of advice i've ever heard and sends people off on all sorts of different tangents which does not help
if anything it makes their insomnias worse because they go to bed in the dark not able to sleep getting
more anxious heart rate going up what should they do instead stay up until they're sleepy
don't worry about it enjoy yourself relax do the things that you probably don't get time to do because you're busy doing
all the other things during the day is the problem i have with that approach which is the approach that i think i've
adopted maybe a little bit too much or incorrectly is if i stayed up doing the things that
i want to do what happens is i'll stay up till 7 am just looking at youtube videos and learning about rockets and looking at like stocks to invest in and
stuff that's that's me to a t i at some point i have to put my laptop down and be like steve just you're going to feel awful tomorrow if
you can looking at this investment fund that you think is interesting yeah absolutely so to a degree you can i
mean we can manipulate our bodies to do anything in a lab i could manipulate your body to sleep when i wanted it to
sleep um but that's taking away all the environmental factors all the behavioral factors of your life
um and what you're doing now you know what it's not the end of the world you know you're obviously coping with it and you're healthy and the problem is you
probably won't be able to sustain that and unfortunately we are built in such a way that kind of goes with the
the light dark cycles on this planet um and so to a degree you are sort of going against that and unfortunately we've got
lots of other we've got lots of research showing that after a while you just can't do that forever without implication
um so it's not i mean if you think about it insomnia is just a different pattern
of sleep you've just trained your brain to sleep differently and you're still surviving with it it's
just that most of us don't like that because it's not the rest of society in the way that they're sleeping
and our friends are sleeping and it feels like we're the only ones awake in the night i bet if you didn't have all those
things to do and you weren't the way you were and you were up at night and everybody else around you was asleep
it would start to feel like a very lonely um anxious place we're not very rational at night we're not really
made to think in the middle of the night so not incredibly rational so i don't think it's the end of the
world what you're doing but at the same time put it this way i treat a lot of entrepreneurs
when they've retired and they're still fairly young but not in a good place because they have not followed anything that
was fairly going along with what our physiological processes want to do our bodies are all about regulation we have
clocks in every cell in every part of our body and they like regulation they like
time they like the timing of things to be ready and and regular and when we keep changing
those goal posts it might seem like we're being uber flexible but actually the reality the reality is
is that later on down the line you'll probably find that you won't be able to cope with it as much
and how does that manifest itself for me so so for you if you just carried on the way you were then unfortunately yeah we
probably would see that um maybe you were getting less sleep than you needed um it probably would be
harder for you maybe when you settled into a routine where you were working around the same hours every day
say you got a certain kind of role that you had to do which made you know you had to have a certain schedule
you might find it quite difficult after a while to stick to that schedule and you might find that you aren't able
to sleep as much as you want the duration and the quality will be impaired and so you might start
all the research around sleep and how important it is for you you might start noticing things like
your cognitive abilities are less so your memory things like that um your ability to
produce cytokines so the proteins that help us with keeping ourselves healthy and keeping
inflammation at bay and things like that all those kind of things will be reduced your healing so when you go and weight
training or something like that or you go to the gym and you want your muscles to repair they're not going to be able to do that so well and of course that over time
short term it's not a problem over time long term that's when we start worrying about
more significant illnesses and um disorders that are happening as we get
older and so that's why we see lots of research showing that as we get older maybe some of these
things like alzheimer's might be related to how we treated our sleep when we were younger however
i hate it i hate mentioning things like that because i think it frightens people and the problem is
with frightening people is that they go into what they think is most logical things to do so they might go
away after this podcast and think oh my god i've just got to go away and get my eight hours because the rest of the
information is telling them out there that they've got to get this eight hours of sleep every night um and of course they can't just get
that you can't dictate to your body how it sleeps there is a process it follows it and so
unfortunately you can never force yourself to sleep you can force yourself not to sleep and that is partly how you fix a
sleep problem but you can never force yourself to sleep but you can induce anxiety and stress and depression
through that and lack of sleep so yeah in um
if you're an expert in this field so you must as you kind of spoke to there you must get pretty i can feel it when you're speaking get
pretty pissed off when you see unhelpful information um being pushed on i don't know social media or online or
through books these sort of simplified narratives what are some of the most um common misconceptions that you speak to your
What are the common misconceptions
patients about you've mentioned one there about this like eight hours of sleep being the optimal yeah and even when i put out
on my instagram earlier what are the key questions you want to ask um i'm speaking to a sleep therapist expert today um
i'd say the vast majority or at least the medium question was uh do i need to get exactly seven or
eight hours sleep every single night yeah um yeah so that is definitely the biggest one we get um
you do not that perfection is the enemy of the good have you ever heard that term because at the end of the day it's true
yes your body loves consistency and regulation but that does not mean you have to get eight hours of sleep every night think
about it differently think about it over a month for example we love this idea of the way the way we look at time is slightly different to
the way your body looks at time and over a month you might actually be all right so maybe one night you get
six and a half hours the next night you get seven and a half and then the next night you might get slightly different as long as it's fairly consistent and
maybe eighty percent of the time you're doing fairly well and you're you're giving yourself the right opportunity to sleep
that's okay your body's gonna do it you know it will do what it needs to do and and with that a caveat to that is
this understanding of sleep debt so we don't understand sleep debt properly people think it's an eye for an eye
i lose four hours i must gain four hours well what happens when your body being as efficient as it is doesn't
actually need you to gain an extra four hours of sleep to recover you your expectation is that it should and
when your expectation doesn't get met you get upset about it and you change your behavior and that's when you start getting sleep
problems when the reality is your brain is so smart that even in the certain amount of hours
that you get normally at night it can recover you from that sleep deprivation by just improving or
increasing the sleep stage that it thinks you miss the most for example but because we have a lack of education
we believe we don't get some sleep we need to regain that sleep and when we don't regain that sleep
that's when the anxieties and the stress is over not sleeping start so that's a big one the sleep debt one the other one is this idea that fatigue
and sleepiness are the same things so yes when we don't sleep well we get a lot of fatigue
so fatigue is anything from feeling like your body needs to rest to needing to shut
your eyes to pain to your brain buzzing because you've been working so hard for like 48
hours straight and you don't know what to do with yourself but the only definition of sleepiness is the ability to shut your eyes and within
a few minutes you're falling asleep so if you were saying to me right now steph i am so so sleepy i'd probably say to you well you
don't look it because right now you don't look tired in the way that i would expect you to be falling asleep i mean you wouldn't be
able to sit still you you would be sort of probably your eyes would be shutting all the time dozing off having little micro sleeps
that sleepiness and that's what we should really be understanding as a cue to sleep so in the evenings if you're
not feeling that then don't be don't be worried give yourself permission to stay up later
because you can't dictate what happens to you during the day and there are so many variables that affect your sleep you are never going to be able to
control them having good sleep hygiene how many good sleepers do you know have it so good sleep hygiene is all these
things that we get told we should do so the 10 top things that you should do have a warm bath never drink coffee ever
again um never have alcohol you know all these things that you're supposed to do but if you look at good sleepers are
they following all those things no they're not and they're still sleeping really well and that's to show that most of the time
sleeping poorly comes down to brain training and the patterns we get ourselves into
you start going to bed early you might be able to get to sleep earlier but you're probably not going to be able to
have that sleep all the way through the night because at some point or another your body's going to be like well you've had enough now but your expectation is
you should be able to sleep till seven and why didn't i sleep till seven or if you lie in you keep changing the goal post of
your wake-up time which is the most important thing that you should be looking at not your bedtime um if you keep changing that
goal post your body doesn't know when to feed you it doesn't know when to make you feel alert because you've changed everything and so of
course you're not going to be sleepy at the right time the time you wake up is the
much more important time to be focused on yes the things your morning routine is going to be way
more important than your evening routine when it comes to your sleep at night but be because people see that as a far away
time compared to when you go to sleep they don't really focus on it in fact haven't we been taught in this society
that lying in as a luxury i can't believe that we have made it okay at the weekend
to lie in so much but during the week one of the only things that gets us up is work it makes
absolutely no sense to me i'm not saying it's the worst thing in the world i'm not saying i never lie
in but i don't use it as a compensatory method for a bad night's sleep because that's when you're going to get into
trouble because that's kind of throwing your your your schedule up is that what you're saying yeah
yeah so if you line on the weekends and you're going to pay for it at some point yeah why are we not looking you know if you
have to lie in so significantly every single weekend why are we not looking at during the week and thinking why am i doing this to
myself at the time when i need it the most i would choose to get less sleep and then
at the weekend i'll just compensate and people and you much of the conversation around sleep and society
talks about the amount of hours and it's almost like the amount of hours that i was in the bed
um what's your sort of rebuttal to that because quality over quantity every
single time every single time and if you have good quality and you need
longer your body will tell you and you will get more sleep but people are so obsessed with duration
and i i think people don't understand what i mean by sleep opportunity i mean every single night most of the time so
about eighty percent of the time i will give myself a seven to eight hour sleep
opportunity sleep window but i do not mean that if i'm not sleepy i take myself into a dark room and shut
myself down i just know that it's there i've got a bedroom a place i really want to be to
sleep that is available to me during those hours and i will not sleep outside those hours and that's the
that is the big thing is you can dictate to your body when you don't sleep but you cannot dictate when you do and
by doing that you will force your body to be in a nice regular cycle it's actually really really simple once
you know how to do it and every time i fix someone of their insomnia there and honestly 50 60 years of insomnia
they often turn around to me they're like i don't know why i wasn't taught this when i was younger and i do believe if
we taught everyone how to sleep properly give them a proper sleep education when they're little i wouldn't exist
How should I be designing my environment
insomnia wouldn't exist you talked there when you referenced your own bedroom i think you
spoke about it quite lovingly it's about this place i like to sleep how important is that how important is it to sleep in the same place and for that
space to be is there a certain way i should be designing my bedroom is there like a bed that's good or like a pillow
because there's lots of fads around yeah yeah there's a lot of fans around i think your environment is important
but i can't dictate to you what that is because we're all so different um yes it's true
you don't need loads of technology in your bedroom to sleep i'm not saying technology can't aid our sleep because i
think in the future we're going to come up with some crazy cool things that are going to really help us i just think right now we're not quite
there i think the least you have in your bedroom that reminds you of the day is really important so obviously screens
and light is very important when it comes to sleep but i think people mis are missing a trick when when we say
don't look at your phones we're not just saying don't look at your phones because of the light exposure we're saying it because it's reminding
your brain of something that you did during the day and so your brain being the smart thing that it is is thinking
okay well i'll um i'll i'll increase your cortisol and i'll reduce your melatonin which is
your stress and your sleepy hormone uh hormones um and i'm gonna help you be
more alert because you clearly want to be alert right now and so your brain thinks it's helping you
and then you're thinking hang on a minute i just looked at my phone for like three seconds and now i'm buzzing why and it's just because your
brain is your your behavior is so much more influential on your physio physiology than you realize what do you
What do you thunk about the snooze button?
think about the snooze button um i think if you have to use it on a regular basis you need to start
questioning why you always need to snooze unfortunately the research shows that snoozing does not benefit us
at all and actually if you think about it if if you are a snoozer you know how many times does that
actually make us feel better exactly delays sorry no i think it's
nonsense as well i did i one of my modules when i was doing psychology in school was about sleep and
um understanding the different phases of sleep made me realize that the snooze button is i think totally pointless because you
have to be in a certain phase of sleep for you to get real benefits and within 15 minutes you're not going to
How to sort your sleep tonight
get into that phase right absolutely um a lot of people when they you know when they
knew that i'm speaking to you today um they want to know how they can sleep better in the short term tonight they're
looking for some kind of quick fix to the to a problem they've had for a long time what would you say to those people
okay so the first thing i'd say is that you're never going to find that reactive very quick method it's never going to
happen and even if you find it i promise you it won't work in the long term it might control your condition in the short term
but not in the long term i can teach you how to re to sleep but it's going to take you
a a a few weeks not a night um but in the meantime don't worry it's okay like part part of
this is i just there is a solution so what i do is called cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia it is not the same as cbt for
depression or anxiety or anything else um and it is just about retraining yourself to sleep and building up that
strong sleep drive you have to do that over time but in the short term i usually tell
people that they do not need to worry nothing bad is going to happen to you and the reality is
that it's more your mood that will affect your day when you wake up in the morning than the bad night's sleep you just had
so i know we've got evidence to show that when you have a bad night's sleep your cognitive abilities etc are going
to be um reduced however if you think about how you generalize that
you're not you're not going to lose your job you're not going to perform horrifically in that meeting because you didn't get a good night's sleep
it would be far better for you to go to bed later and make sure you're lovely and sleepy and only get four
hours than to go to bed eight hours before that meeting and toss and turn and be fidgety and
stressed and anxious all night that's what i do i still get nervous when i have to do like a lecture in front of 500 people of course i get
nervous but instead of you know focusing on my notes just before i go to bed i'll put everything aside
i'll go and enjoy myself do something i really love to do i'll get ready for bed a bit earlier
than usual just so that i do not have to think about anything when i get sleepy and when i am sleepy even if it's two
three four hours later than usual i know that i'll go and have a really lovely
three or four hours sleep and then i'll wake up and i'll be like great i know i'm gonna be a bit sleepy today but that's only gonna help me sleep tonight
and i'm gonna have an epic day i don't care that i'm a bit sleepy sleepiness is amazing sleepiness is such a good thing
for you why are we teaching people that sleepiness is a bad thing you need sleepiness to sleep
i've got two questions though the first i'm sure is it feels like a very um related sort of question to what
Do you sleep well?
you've just been talking about there which is do you sleep well i'm sure you get asked this all the time at every party every
time you it's like asking a comedian to tell a joke right yeah yeah it's like how was your sleep okay so most of the
time my sleep is fairly good because i've been lucky enough to be educating myself through this for
the last 16 years but it's not good all the time because it's totally normal
after some kind of life stressor new illness some dramatic change in our society
like we're seeing right now for your sleep to change and for it to be poor okay it is totally normal to have sleep
problems we will all get them you will never find someone who does not have a sleep problem at some point in their
lives but there is a difference between somebody who has a short-term sleep problem and when the initial issue resolves
itself the sleep problem goes away and the person who has now unfortunately got
a long-term sleep problem the difference is the behavior it is not the person it is
not some trait that you have over someone is not something genetic there are there are all of those things
that do feed into for example insomnia but the reality is the thing that seems to perpetuate sleep
problems is not usually the original trigger so we cannot blame the divorce for example 20 years ago i'm not
divorced but i'm just making an example so 20 years ago we get divorced and it's a really stressful situation and it
stops you sleeping for a month okay but now you're remarried and you're perfectly happy but you've got a 20-year
insomnia problem we cannot blame the divorce for that anymore and also somebody else who's gone through the
same situation same illness or divorce or new medication would not have had that sleep problem 20
years later so what is it and i believe and we know that most of it is your
behavior after a few weeks of a sleep problem most people will freak out and they'll start changing their behavior
so they might start lying in they might start going to bed early they're trying desperately to improve
their sleep opportunity because they believe the mere act of lying in a bed for longer is going to
miraculously give them a stronger sleep drive and make them get through whatever it is they need to get through when the reality is and this is usually
how we treat insomnia or one of the ways we actually deprive you of your sleep opportunity so we don't deprive you of
sleep but we do deprive you of your sleep opportunity so we only allow you to be in bed for a certain amount of time and that fixes it
but that's frightening because with teaching people that sleep is so bad or not sorry not sleep is so bad but
sleepiness is so bad that they don't feel that they can build up that strong sleep drive without something terrible
happening to them so the way we are disseminating knowledge right now is not working and we have got to find a
The Therapy you offer
way to change that you talked about the type of therapy you offer cognitive behavioral therapy for
insomnia one of the elements you've described is this sleep deprivation which is in essence you're
stopping people sleeping i'm guessing throughout the day to focus them on
their sleep opportunity um yes so it's less about restricting their sleep and more about restricting
their bedtime so often when you come across somebody who's had a sleep problem for a fair while enough to come to see me
they're usually spending more time in bed than they are sleeping so for example they might be in bed for around 10 hours but they're
only sleeping for say six hours and so what i would do is i would restrict them in the first
instance only so it's only mildly to six hours in bed because or five hours in bed whatever they're sleeping
for i would we would we would never really go lower than five hours because at the end of the day we're only
um sort of guess it's all a bit of guesswork here um and that's important that it's like
that and we're not over tracking sleep because that's has its own issues um and then for a week or so i'll keep
them on that schedule and try and get them to strictly stick to it which is quite scary for somebody who thinks the total
opposite way is going to fix them even though they've got no evidence that it works it doesn't matter they've been doing it for a long
time so it's quite hard to get someone to do this and then once we can get them to sleep for around 90
of that five or six hours whatever they spend in bed then we can start increasing their sleep
time out very very slowly but people sort of get very over eager about this it's called sleep restriction
therapy um or there's lots of different ways of calling it and people get over excited
about it and they're obsessed with reaching that 90 percent efficiency so they can move on and add time but i try to always explain to
people and indeed i do online courses in sleep that they can do themselves and i'm always trying to explain to them
it's not about adding more time imagine if you are getting to five or six hours sleep efficient every
every night for seven days as an average that's really good that's so much better than the broken sleep you were getting
before think about the new quality that you have built how amazing is that when's the last time you went for a week
and you had that consistent sleep and when they start thinking about it that way they're like oh my god yes this is so much better
and i'm even able to add more time now and we slowly incrementally start adding sleep out and that's how
you fix it i mean it's not everything because you've got to work on the mindset you've got to work on the re-educating people what are those other
pieces of the therapy yeah you gotta so first of all one is the
sort of sleep restriction as you called it yeah one area is you we need to you've got to be
re-educated on sleep much like we've been chit-chatting away today that's how i will talk to someone
and i will try to help them understand um i'll try and pick out a lot of the things that they talk to me about
um but it's trying to help them understand where the myths are where the facts are with sleep because a lot of their ideologies around sleep
will be directly influencing their behavior and so as soon as you can change that and it's not as simple as just saying
that's right and that's wrong you've got to keep doing it and they need to trust you and and you've got to find a way in the right language to
speak to that person once you've done that you can start with the sleep restriction and then of course whilst there is no
evidence that relaxation or anxiety reduction is going to directly and reactively fix a long-term sleep
disorder after you've started improving your sleep drive and using the sleep restriction therapy to do that
then yes we do need to start looking at how do you bring yourself back to balance during the day
is it stress and anxiety that got you here in the first place because you're working too much and you got yourself into the wrong patterns
how are you going to process more during the day how are you going to balance more during the day we need to look at those things but we
need to look at them with the right expectations which is that they are not going to make you sleep because once that expectation is not met
you feel really inadequate and then you feel like nothing can help you and then you get hopeless and out of control and lonely about your
problem so all this lots of different sort of elements like a pyramid to try and help someone
Caffeine and sleeping pills
with their sleep and you know people um cat caffeine has become a huge part of our you know we live in a society where
people take caffeine to wake them up and then quite often they'll take certain supplements to shut them down again like sleep
new supplements or um various knighthold i think is one of them right i don't know yeah yeah um what's your take on all of
all of these chemicals we're using to kind of regulate our alertness and then our tiredness
they just they can't work overtime so all the research shows that eventually you either get used to them they stop
working they make you feel really uncomfortable i don't think there's anything wrong with for example sleeping pills or using
caffeine in the short term things like that um but starting to use them long term they have their own
all of them have their own side effects and over a long time of use aren't very good for the
body and but in general they're just not going to they're not going to suddenly miraculously reset your sleep button or
anything that's people seem to think they're going to do so i don't think relying on these things in the short term is a bad thing every
now and again but if you're relying on them every single time you have a sleep problem you're effectively making it worse
because your brain isn't learning anything it is literally just being giving a cheap method
like a fake sleep almost and that is what you get from a lot of sedatives is sedative sleep which is not the same as
the cycles that you go through usually to sleep well so you're not getting but psychologically
we believe that sleep is better than no sleep and actually i don't necessarily agree with that in a
way i'd rather get no sleep than a really rubbish sleep knowing that my body will like build up
a really strong sleep drive and help me later but people are so terrified of that that they that psychologically they just need
to feel like they've slept but if they had a bit of better education around sleep and they understood how it worked more
then i don't think people would be trying to grab all these things all the time but we live in a reactive society
we're not very proactive as creatures we want we want it now and we want it done yesterday what about caffeine that's
such a huge part of everybody's well pretty much everybody's daily routine people they you know they'll say i have to have
this coffee to wake myself up yeah i have three or four of them a day and then what impact does that end up
having on sleep so caffeine is very interesting because genetically we are all
either sensitive or not sensitive or somewhere in between with caffeine so it's very hard to say nobody should be drinking caffeine after
this time yes it does have a very sort of it has a big afterlife so it definitely
or half-life so what we mean by that is that um you know it's going to have an effect on you hours and hours after you've had it
but depending on how sensitive you're to to it you are you know but at the same time there's so much more you
can do if you started waking up at the same time every day you would start to feel refreshed you would be one of those people who wakes
up and is like yeah i'm ready to start the day imagine if you just used your body the way it was designed to be used
i'm not saying caffeine is bad i definitely wouldn't say you can't drink caffeine but if you're
starting to use it anything in life in anything chemical in a compensatory method because something
is wrong that's when you need to start questioning it but in general having caffeine in the morning i don't think
there's anything wrong with that if you enjoy it great but then there's lots of research that shows that even your performance
isn't significantly improved by having caffeine you might feel like you're able to buzz around everything more but your
actual efficiency isn't necessarily improved i i wonder you know because i think i was looking at some stats
Whats causing all these sleeping problems?
around insomnia and sleep so sleep disorders and the stats are pretty staggering and
i don't know how to say this but i just don't tend to believe that humans after all these thousands of
years of evolution have been born with quite an apparent or seemingly apparent um
problem with sleep so it makes me think okay so what is it in our social um environment and society
that's making us struggle with sleep is it our over obsession with the
perfect sleep that might be one element and this you know and all the fear and anxiety around not sleeping perfectly as
you've described and we're actually doing pretty good yeah right and labeling ourselves as insomnia you know because that word
i'm an insomniac or insomnia it's thrown around pretty yeah absolutely or is it the you know the
tech in our lives is it the the over stimulation of the you know the technology we have is it overworking
what's your take on that because i feel the same about depression and anxiety as well i look at the stats growing over
time um in ver with various sort of mental um illnesses and i think surely we weren't
born um with chemical imbalances as is um said in um yeah i love them
yeah i so it's a hard question to answer i think that there is element there's
lots of different elements i don't believe that the stats are as accurate as they probably seem
for example i believe that before you know the industrial revolution for example we had um sleep problems i i mean i
no i do i believe we did it's just that i believe we're recording things now more so there's that aspect of it
there is this aspect of we over worry about things and you know at the end of the day while someone keep you know lots of people out there
keep telling us that actually um you know if you sleep less than six hours you will die early
but actually we're not actually seeing that today um yeah how much am i reducing my life
expectancy with my poor sleep the thing is okay so if you know you've got poor sleep you need to improve it but
hopefully it's not going to be long term you can actually get some support for that and get it sorted if you're
actively keeping yourself at five hours when you know you're a seven hour sleeper then yeah you're going to reduce your
life expectancy but if you're naturally a five hour sleeper and they do exist then that does not mean the same thing
that you're going to be reducing your life expectancy when genetically you can't you know that's for you
um it's really difficult to understand i think um you know electricity has a big
part to play so again i talked a little bit briefly at the beginning about the light dark cycles of this planet
and the way that we are designed or not designed but you know we're built on this planet we we seem to have
evolved that way um and so we we we definitely do need to be
in general not uh working and resting more at night and we we work better our metabolisms our
brains function we're more rational during the day um and so with electricity has become
many problems i definitely think the scaremongering and the fear and the tracking of sleep
has definitely caused in the last few years a boom in sleep problems or at least how many people are coming to us for help
and with the the pandemic what impact has that had on people's sleep heel let's talk about heal for a second
i've spent a lot of time on this podcast talking about the ready to drink your bottles which are my favorite for convenience reasons it means i don't
have to mix anything but this week as my goals in gym and in my health in my physique have started to
evolve i've started using a new product that i wanted to tell you about and the reason why i've started using this
product which is called huel the black edition is because there's 50 less carbs
33 more protein um zero artificial sweeteners and it's of
course gluten free i wish i had something like this to be honest when i was a student
because it's literally one pound 47 per meal i think you get about 17 or 18 meals out
of one bag and if you're someone like me that in this phase of my life that's trying to build a bit of muscle get a little bit more lean whilst
also you know reducing the carbs a little bit then give black edition huel a try and try the vanilla flavor if you
do get a chance because that's um for me is the the tastiest flavor of them all and do you know what i'm gonna do next week
in the podcast i'm gonna take my top off okay so i'm gonna um show you the impact that uh
all of this being a huel again has had for me you're gonna have to tune in next week and you're gonna have to watch it on youtube to see
that but um i'm gonna show you the the before and after of using huel and uh uh and before i
used to okay so that's something to look forward to or maybe not with the the pandemic what impact has
What impact has the pandemic had on peoples sleep
that had on people's sleep it's had a huge impact so um in various different ways so the first way is that
everybody's routine changed and because we couldn't go outside and move as much as we once did we couldn't get
as much light exposure as we once did we didn't get as much stimulation social stimulation
so our brains weren't being used in the same way plus we all had this sort of uh thing to look at on the news all the
time so we're actively sort of looking at something that is stressing us out and making us anxious so various different components
no wonder sleep changed but it would have been totally normal for that to happen your sleep is
adapting to your new environment and so when people start worrying about this i try to get them to
calm down about it because actually if your sleep wasn't working properly you just wouldn't be here okay so to a
degree our sleep is doing a bloody good job for us um and we need to be better about it we
blame sleep for everything um and actually there's so many other variables that we can control in our
lives that will have an effect on us but yes during the pandemic we saw um or we still see
there's plenty more problems with people struggling to get to sleep maybe they're feeling really buzzy and they can't get to sleep maintaining
that sleep so people waking up in the middle of the night and they're just like what why am i waking up sometimes they
they've got million thoughts a minute or um sometimes they're just thinking of nothing and they don't know why that's happening
we've seen more dream recall very graphic dreams and we believe that's because obviously
when your routine changes and you don't have to work and ironically i always say to insomniacs that actually when they're
working and when they've got busy lives it's a lot easier to treat them than when they don't have a routine
because routine is everything to our bodies i wish we understood more how much our bodies love to be
regulated and going to work and doing exercise and going to see our friends and going to the gym
and eating at regular intervals is telling your brain so many signals the light exposure you
get is telling your brain about how much melatonin to release for you it's fascinating but we
do need regulation and the biggest thing that changed during this pandemic was our routines
What control do we have on our dreams?
people people have a real desire as well you mentioned the the the fact that the pandemic had caused very like vivid
dreams people have asked me so many times if they can control their dreams how do they stop themselves
streaming so vividly or um and some people having you know recurring nightmares and things like that
what what is your answer to that what control do we have on our dreams so you can you can learn to that's what we call lucid dreaming so
you can learn to lucid dream the problem is it's probably not very good for your sleep in general um so effectively when we remember our
dreams it's because we have been woken out of rem sleep so rem is actually a very active stage of sleep
it's not your deep sleep it's actually quite a light stage of sleep some might argue that's even a different state of consciousness and not sleep at
all so rem is a really strange time it's when we believe that more of our memory
and our psychological restoration is happening in consolidation and things like that and part of rem we tend to
have more graphic dreams but it's it's you being interrupted from that state which you
may not remember in the night it could just be a van driving past in your rem sleep and it wakes you into
a lighter stage of sleep like stage one or two sleep and so in the morning you think oh my god i really remember my dreams or maybe
your alarm woke you up in the middle of rem sleep and you're like oh my god i can really remember my dreams as opposed to the times when you're like
i didn't dream at all last night well of course you did dream it's just that your rem wasn't interrupted so that's why you're
remembering your dreams when we try to control our dreams usually you have to kind of control that
interruption a bit and so i haven't looked into it properly in terms of lucid dreaming because it doesn't really help me do my job i don't
really want people to learn to lucid dream because then one they're going to be remembering their dreams more and if they're
remembering their dreams more than their sleep is more interrupted and that's not good for your sleep we want you to go through the cycles of sleepers
as uh you know as comfortably as we can and so that you get all the right percentages and all the right restoration
and and healing and everything that you need from your sleep and so yeah it's an interesting concept
i don't think it's very helpful to healthy sleep but every now and again especially kids
i find when i'm talking to children they seem to be able to control their dreams a little bit better like flying
for example they concentrate more on it that's why so they have more time and they concentrate on
it which is quite a fun thing maybe we should all be doing more of that daydreaming and stuff
it's actually really good for problem solving um so yeah it's fascinating and and there's a lot of
famous people i think einstein though don't i mean i don't know if i'm right about this but einstein and various other
geniuses would do things like hold a um egg or or a spoon or something um
so that if and when they fell asleep that spoon would drop and then they would wake up because they felt they had all their best ideas
i can see you looking at me and thinking about doing this to get better tonight but it's not very good for sleep
to keep interrupting it like that um so you can yes you've got the power to manipulate sleep however you want but
at the end of the day if the goal here is to keep you alive for longer and to feel refreshed in the day
and to have your best ideas consistently and to be healthy consistently then you
probably want to do sleep right the way it was designed and what about what i eat before i go to bed a lot of people talk about that
How does what I eat effect my sleep?
that's another uh thing you know if i order food really late someone will turn to me in the room and go oh you should be in at this time
you know what i mean what do i say tomorrow okay i've said it before a good sleeper does all the wrong things
and they seem to be okay but they're probably not doing all the wrong things all the time so yes
the the later you eat you're basically asking your body to metabolize and asking it to sleep and it does
not like doing both and so one of them will be um compromised um in terms of um
anything that you can eat that will have a significant effect on your sleep there's no real research there is
research to show things like you know if you if you eat enough cherries or you have enough milk or enough turkey
it's going to give you some kind of sedatory effect but at the end of the day
it's you'd have to have a stupid amount of those kind of foods to have any kind of effect it's not going to help you sleep
healthily from day to day that's not going to suddenly boost the quality of your sleep um
significantly and so i would argue that unless you have some kind of deficiency in a vitamin or mineral
that is affecting your sleep then you probably don't need to be looking at the food you eat in general as i'm sure
a lot of people will say but in general eating a healthy balanced diet where you have what you would call naughty foods
and good foods and in balance all that stuff is really good for you and probably the only piece of
advice i'd give around eating is again regulating how you eat so if it's breakfast lunch and dinner you like to
do trying to do that at consistent times every single day is going to help your body understand when you want to be
awake and metabolizing and when you want to be sleeping and then not sleeping too late at night just so that you can
make sure that your body metabolizes well and sleeps well and can i sleep too much is that such a
people people there's this myth again in society where people think that they overslept and now they're knackered
Can I sleep too much?
right so yeah so you can it usually when people say they've overslept if we actually looked at them in a sleep study and
they've overslept for the amount that they usually sleep and they didn't need it probably the quality of their entire
sleep wouldn't be amazing um and that's why they were able to have this dribble drabbily longer
sleep and and it's not it's not going to be very helpful but usually when we're talking about that research that shows that
longer sleepers actually can get sicker um is because the quality of their sleep is impaired by something
like sleep apnea or another sleep disorder which is impairing the quality of their sleep so
yeah so poor quality sleep you're gonna sleep longer it's kind of the same as having insomnia because you're not
really sleeping and so therefore you feel you need to sleep longer and you wake up and you still
don't feel like you've slept as much as you needed to if you're sleeping really well from night to night you don't need to sleep
more so your body won't really let you so if the quality is good and you've reached that optimal time
you'll notice that if you do try to sleep longer it's quite if i looked at that sleep for
you in a polysomnography study so i looked at your brain activity the quality of it is just like a snooze
is probably not going to be the same it's not going to be but it's very rare you find someone like usually they're deprived of something or
rather or they have been sleeping properly and then they sleep a bit longer you hear a lot of them a lot of
These top tips about sleep
successful people i think it's it's part of bragging you know bragging about how little they sleep that's how i only sleep three four
hours a day and i think it's pushed this idea into a society that in order to be successful you've gotta
sleep for you know just two or three hours or four hours whatever but then on the other side you have this total contradiction which is
in order to be successful you need to wake up at 6am and drink green juice and do yoga and like sleep for exactly seven hours um and it
and it i guess this kind of speaks to the original point which was um that there's so much over-generalization
and uh through an attempt to sell you something whether it's the book or um
my authority or to get you to follow me yeah i kind of preach this secret yeah quite easily replicated for all of
you right yeah that's causing us to to be like uh be smart
like smacked with these contradicting narratives around sleep um which is making everyone a little bit confused um what's your sort of take on
all of that because you know as when i was growing up i thought you know if i want to be successful i've got to just sleep less
and i i think if i'm being completely honest with myself i think i used to be proud of how little
i sleeped yeah i thought it was like a war like a badge of honor you know yeah yeah yeah yeah but now i think i'm getting a
little bit older and i'm i don't really give a [ __ ] for what people think yeah good good um uh so yeah i i definitely have seen a
change around in this recently but yeah there has been this thing about like clean sleeping it's a bit like the whole clean eating
thing it's a consent it's a it's everything that you've effectively just said um but people trying to say you need to do this that
and that to have the perfect night's sleep actually that doesn't really exist once you know how much sleep you need
around make sure you have that opportunity most nights that you're how do i know though um so i guess you
referenced genetics you said there are five hours yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so i guess um a more relaxed way of looking at it
is when you go on holiday after the three four days of recovery from you know work life um what happens
you know left your own devices what happens and that's a pretty good way of looking at it if you're looking at a really
scientific way then sleep restriction therapy so what we would put a insomniac
through also will show you how much of a duration that you need right now because there'll be a point where you can't keep
adding time your body won't get you to 90 efficient and that's where you know okay maybe this is around the right time
for me and sleeping mental health i feel like it's i don't know my guess would be that it's
The correlation between poor mental health and poor sleep
somewhat kind of a a cycle right i think poor sleep might lead to poor mental health and then poor men's health might lead to
poor sleep is that accurate you're absolutely right but it doesn't matter what came first the chicken or the egg the main
issue is especially in medicine and i've just done a piece of research and that shows that undergraduate
medical degrees only teach a median of an hour and a half of sleep so this is why this next
thing happens a lot because they just don't have the education so our own doctors do not have enough education in something that we do
a third of our lives so historically or traditionally when you go to your gp and you say i've got a sleep problem
they'll tell you you've got depression and insomniacs will be able to relate to this and it is because
in general we look at sleep or poor sleep as a symptom of another condition now even if it is
even if you do have a significant mental health problem and it is causing you to have sleep issues if it's been longer than three months
you now have a entrained sleep disorder and you need to be treating the sleep problem as a
primary condition in itself and the one that i would treat first is whichever one is most prevalent
so whichever symptoms seem to be more distressing for you at the time is where i would start but i would be fixing
for example the depression and the insomnia separately and the results show that
when you treat insomnia you have less relapse of depression because you have actually
resolved one of these things that unfortunately was perpetuating everything so it doesn't really matter where sleep
comes into it but you've got to give it its own podium it needs to be it is a pillar of health
and you need to treat it that way you reference a good sleeper and bad sleeper what's the uh what are the
characteristics of a good sleeper and bad sleeper
characteristics of each so everyone always thinks i'm going to say well a good sleeper does this and a
good sleeper does that but actually the only difference i have seen over however long doing this is
that a good sleeper is somebody who just doesn't worry that much about their sleep they are very grateful for their
sleep and they're very you know you know they they give themselves a fair opportunity they don't always
sleep well they don't you know sometimes they have sleep problems but they don't get overly bothered by it and they notice that
their sleep when left to its own devices will go back to whatever it needs to be about 10 of
insomniacs we never see because they don't perceive themselves to be having a problem and they're not sick and dying isn't
this somewhat uh i guess a metaphor for the for the rest of our lives as well where
typically much of the problem is people thinking that they have a problem or their own perception of their reality because i'll be honest
um everyone around me doesn't think i sleep very well but i've always thought that i slept really really well and i've just
i think refused to buy into the idea that i'm a bad sleeper they think that because i'm up at strange times sometimes i'm traveling extreme but i
i've never worried about my sleep when i go into my room eventually i'll fall asleep and at some point i'll wake up
but i guess the point i'm trying to make there is as well if you look at what's happening in the world with the pandemic and you know people
feeling certain um feeling like they should be a certain way is actually making them
that way people feeling like they should feel self-pity is making them feel self-pity and um as someone that's been to
rio de janeiro and seen the um the favelas there and spent time in the favelas but also i've been to india and
spent some time in the harvey i think they call it which is you know known as the slums which i think is a derogatory term
um i've seen people in this in the slums in india who were significantly happier um
than people that i know that are very you know relatively cushy and i know it's all
subjective living in the uk and it just but people hate when we talk about these these
these things because it gets the mirror of blame and responsibility and it just turns it
back on themselves and says maybe you're the problem yeah maybe the way you're thinking is
the problem and maybe you can do something about it yeah absolutely you've hit the nail on the head um
i like i said about 10 of insomniacs we we never see and actually if you think about it
insomnia is just another pattern of sleep and you have a certain pattern of sleep right now and
if it's not broken do not fix it i firmly believe that and if you ever have a problem well you know where i am
um but hopefully you never will because you'll follow your gut follow what you feel is right
um if that turns you awry then fair enough um get some support but actually
you you really have hit the nail on the head and i really do believe with a bit more understanding and education around sleep and that it's not
night to night your sleep doesn't work like that i get yes we do need to most of the time
sleep night to night but it can survive without doing that um it is it's incredible if we spent
more time understanding how amazing sleep was rather than fearing when it doesn't happen and then blaming it for
absolutely everything we would be in a much better position we would cherish it more and we would um you know love it more
but not overly put pressure on it which is ridiculous sleep cannot force you to lose your job sleep can't
do though or lack of it it just can't um but our belief that it does is making this problem worse so yes it
is a hundred percent a mindset i spend most of my time not training people to sleep again
but actually trying to help resolve that mindset one of the last things i do when i finish with a client is i have to
go through and help them understand that sleep is not the be-all and end-all because actually even to treat their
sleep i have to get them to focus on it and actually i need to take the focus away now and one of the exercises i do
is i tell them look i now want you to think that we're in a world where sleep doesn't exist and when
i do that people are like oh my god that would be awful because it would just be one long perpetual day we'd never finish our day
just philosophically and psychologically how would we deal with that and actually i'm like yes that's how you should be thinking about it because that
time even when you're not sleeping is beautiful and we should cherish it um and also if you didn't sleep what
would be all the other variables that would affect you and i start getting them to think about the rest of their lives and all these other things like
exercise and eating right and they're just the basics who you interact with when you watch the
news the bills you paid that day whether you walk to the dog um all sorts of things pain um noisy
neighbors uh your commute to work how many of those things actually have a properly significant impact on you but
you'll still blame it on your sleep and then it's a perpetual cycle because then you start compensating well i'm not
going to do this anymore i'm not going to go to the gym i'm not going to see my friends i'm terrified it's going to do something that affects my sleep
and then your sleep is worse because your body's now thinking oh so she doesn't need to get good sleep at night because she's not doing anything
in the day anymore and so you make it worse and worse and worse and that is one of the biggest things i see
in a long-term insomniac is somebody who's literally stopped living in order to fix the problem why do we
think that's going to fix the problem it doesn't what about a bad sleeper then so we talked a little bit about the pro like the profile of the characteristics
of a good sleeper what's a bad sleeper so a bad sleeper is somebody who really does um they get bad sleep and suddenly they
start worrying about the lack of sleep and then what they'll do is they'll look up how do i fix my sleep they'll come up
with 10 regimented rules and they'll start becoming obsessive and ritualistic about those rules
they'll stop going out in the evening and they'll start having the hot one bath the herbal tea and every single thing
that they have um they think and they know it doesn't work but they're so terrified of not doing them because
that's all they've got to hold on to now that they are um you know they they they
can't go away from it and actually trying to take teach those people to sleep better is is harder than somebody who's a bit
more relaxed around their routine because they've built these things up so hard you know what's really funny is um
what you've described there is a person who is so keen to solve a problem that probably
isn't that much of a problem that they've they're in search of these techniques and tips and secrets and
shortcuts and whatever probably a lot of the people that felt compelled to click on this podcast today to listen to it and
you see the same within uh success and ambition you see this
like this certain group of people that i'm gonna be honest okay are almost never really successful
but spend the most time trying to be and when i when i think about my success so when i read these books about oh the
the perfect way to be successful here's 13 tips that all successful people share i think
this is total [ __ ] nonsense because my sleep is i sleep whenever i feel tired as you say
i eat blah blah blah you know i don't do yoga i don't like meditate every day i don't i don't
follow any script or blueprint i just kind of go with the flow and do my best every single day and show up and try and
be better tomorrow like if that that's as far as it goes for me there's no looking in the mirror and saying steve you're going to be a
millionaire steve you're going to be you know what i mean all of that feels like nonsense to me but the people that seem to
um do those things the visualizations in the mirror the mood boarding my future like they're not
they are never the successful ones all of my successful friends don't do that yeah yeah and um and i i maybe i think what i'm saying
is i sounds like the same applies to sleep yeah where like the the people that get addicted on techniques and tips and
tricks end up having the worst sleep overall yeah what have we missed i'm asking you this question because
What do you want people to get from this podcast?
there's so many unknown unknowns i don't i don't know a ton about sleep again because i've never really cared that much about it right so
is there anything that you think we've missed any specific topics or i think i would love it if people came
away from this podcast and gave their sleep a little bit of a break and in the same sort of with the same idea i'm sure
there'll be people out there thinking yes but when i wake up tonight in the middle of the night what do i do about it so i guess this is
one thing we haven't covered to understand that if you are waking up in the middle of the night and it's been happening to you
over and over again this has become a habit and therefore to resolve the habit you're going to have to do something
consistently you're not going to be able to solve it in one night it's just not going to happen however if you're waking up and you're getting
stressed and anxious do not lie in bed it's not going to help you you've got a different problem now
you've made yourself anxious and stressed and you need to alleviate it leave the bedroom go and enjoy yourself
it is not going to wake you up you are already awake your sleep drive clearly isn't there to take you back to sleep so
go do something else make sure you get up in the morning do not lie in go and have the epic day enjoy yourself go and see
your friends or talk to them over zoom or go and do some exercise get outside get some light exposure be happy and
content in your life focus on other things and go to bed when you're really really sleepy and when it happens again the
next night do the same thing and i promise you eventually you will be able to get out of it but if you lie
there and you get anxious and stressed and you try and force yourself to sleep you already know
this doesn't work you're trying it over and over again so don't do it so that's the thing i would say i hope that when people listen
to this they come away and they're like you know what i'm not as worried as i was about my sleep i'm actually going to
chill out and i'm going to be all right about it but if i do want to improve the quality i've listened to what she said there's
some key things there i'm going to i'm going to try do those few things but it's about the little things so it's
not about doing 20 different things it is just about literally get up at the same time every morning stop overcompensating stop diluting your
sleep opportunity when you don't get good sleep make it smaller build that sleepiness it's actually good for you don't freak
out nothing bad is going to happen and you you talked to one particular point i wanted to come back on there because
i when i asked my audience about the questions they had for you again about i say 15 20 of them were all
about i keep waking up in the middle of the night yeah yeah what to do so you're saying get out of bed get out of bed and
go and do something that you love do not yeah do not go and do something
like clean the bathroom or do something boring go and do something that is going to be distracting
for god's sake we're always going on about how little time we have you've got more time now so go and use it go and do something fun
i'm not saying get up and go to work i'm not saying that because i still think this is your sleep opportunity and
if you want to retrain your brain to sleep during this time then you've got to sort of do things that are i'm not saying you need to
relax relax relax because i think people get stressed at that term and they're like i can't relax i don't know how to relax don't make me do this
so i think what makes you happy do some things that just make you happy whether that's looking at old photos or
just doing something that you love it is okay okay it's not gonna be forever like i said
you cannot force yourself to sleep but you can dictate when you don't sleep so as long as you're not
overcompensating by lying in or going to bed early because you're so worried about the sleep that you've lost
forget it it's gone there's nothing you can do about it so just move on and do the right things and i promise
you you will start sleeping better but the more you freak out and you're worried about what is going to happen to
you if you don't sleep another night in a row the more you won't be able to fix the problem great
where can people find you uh so i'm at sleepyheadclinic.co.uk it's gone pretty
international now because of the covid is literally i'm online now um and sleepyheadprogram.com if you have no
time to speak to me or you just want to do it yourself um i have set up this online course that you
can do which i'm very excited about with two awesome business partners who are just as crazy and passionate about
sleep as i am and hopefully we can start seeing more people um and and build on it and make it an
even better experience so yeah listen thank you so much for your time today um sleep is a thing that i think is as i
said at the start the podcast has been increased in relevance um in our society
in my personal conversations online through instagram through books that aren't as you say necessarily very
helpful so it's been um very refreshing to to hear
a almost a counter narrative to the kind of very binary specific um quick
um secret orientated like hacks that people push online and that's uh i think will do a ton of people a lot
of good so thank you so much for coming thank you so much for having me thank you thanks

and this is why tiger woods keeps working this is why warren buffett keeps working it's why richard branson keeps working
the only way in which businesses or people will become successful and truly perform to their optimum this
amazing question is probably the best question i've ever been asked
[Music]
camille thank you for joining me today it's a pleasure to have you here so early in the morning i i typically on this podcast will won't
introduce people because um i i'll do a little bit of a pre-introduction but your
your background and the work you've done specifically with high performance people and successful people is so compelling and fascinating that i
feel like i want you to introduce yourself and i've read through your bio multiple
times it was deeply inspiring and i think without an introduction everything we
talk about from here without the perfect introduction which i feel like only you'll give everything we talk about from here on um
might not have the the context it needs to have so who is jamil creation
i'm a performance coach and psychologist so i've spent my time working with some very
good sports teams some very good business teams some successful people and i guess what
i do is i help people cultivate a mindset for success so i always say that for us to act differently we need to think differently
i'm going to create different behaviors different actions this is about creating different thoughts first so i guess what i do more
than anything else is help people change their mind so i said there's new new opportunities new possibilities that will come from
new perspectives so a lot of my time is spent working with people not to give them new skills
but more to allow them to understand the skills that they've already got and then create a perspective for them
to use it differently so um as a performance coach i think everyone can be better
everyone can perform better at terms as a matter of i guess trying to create the mindset the attitude um i guess some of
the precursors to those to the performance which are which are beneficiary which have benefit to them
and so you said that everybody has the skills and i i you know i i see that in a lot of my friends i
see that they have a lot more sort of um natural capabilities than they've managed to sort of give the world
through their actions if someone has an ambition to be something if they have the ambition to be you know
a sports uh star and you've worked with a lot of athletes and you've worked with business people or they want to start a business
what you tend to see it and what i tend to see in my inbox is a lot of people with intention but there
seems to be something preventing that intention from turning into action or like behavior into an
achievement yeah yeah and i think you know turning ambition into achievement is the key because most people will have
good intentions most people will be wishing and hoping to be better there's a big difference between wishing
and hoping and believing and executing upon it so i think that the people who genuinely execute on it
probably want it more for a start at a monastic key no one's ever wandered around the bottom of a mountain
and then simply found themselves at the top and it does take that determination the resilience it does take the ability
to execute upon ideas to drive success so i think the key is the desire which
is fueled by having a purpose a mission a vision towards what that end goal should look like
a lot of people um can't quite they say one thing they say that their
their purpose is to go to the gym yeah for example we all say one thing and do the other
yeah and why is that like because it's sometimes hard to distinguish with someone whether that's their real sort of desire
or whether they're kind of like virtue signaling to themselves if they want to be something or you know they want to start that
business or become an entrepreneur be you know get a six-pack but then their actions show that
quite a different story so i always wondered that with my some of my friends always think are they do they actually want that or they just
it's very easy to say that this is what i'm after and much harder to do it and i think one of the reasons why is
because um we have to invest we self-invest so we probably all know these um kids at
school who are great footballers at 14 15. you think you know what they're gonna make it they're just brilliant they're gonna make it
um or great track athletes at 12 and you know and you just think they're special but they don't make it
and the reason why they don't make it is they don't self-invest so the people who make it are the ones
who um will get up on a rainy friday morning and rainy saturday morning to go and practice whilst their mates are
in bed the ones who will practice on a friday night when their mates are out drinking
and so talent is not enough you need talent plus teachability so talent plus the ability to be
open-minded agile in our thinking to commit to practice and turn that practice into something which develops
our talent even further so there's lots of people with talent and business lots of people with talent
and sport um but i guess that we need to be open-minded enough to invest in how we practice our talent to become
successful so you know there's no there's no substitute for practice i get lots of golfers who say to me that yeah can you
make me better yeah and yeah the number one golfer in the world will practice more than any any amateur you know and
you know their lies the truth but you know we need to we need to apply ourselves in a particular manner and so
we need to be practical about how we exercise our talent you create good feedback loops to
understand what we're doing gain better personal introspection and self-awareness
to allow us to use our talents differently how do you give someone that purpose though like i'm trying to think like
so we know we know practice is like so incredibly important to master something but my i guess my question is um how would you
give someone that motivation because i i i guess you can't give someone purpose a lot of
us spend so much of our lives trying to to motivate people right to motivate friends families you know
siblings whatever it might be i'm wondering if there's a thing we can do as like loving
friends or whatever to to give someone that kick yeah so i mean a couple of points i guess on that in regard to
discovering purpose um it can't be done for someone so
i always said purpose is never achieved it's attained on a daily basis so the mistake that people make with
purpose is they confuse it with an end goal so here's my purpose and have this vision statement of what they're seeking
to you know achieve or create whatever it might be and get practical and tangible about it
but purpose isn't that purpose is achieved on a daily basis that um sorry purpose is never achieved it's
attained on a daily basis and this is why tiger woods keeps working this is why warren buffett keeps
working it's why richard branson keeps working it's because it's never achieved it's attained on a daily basis so i think that you know
we need to find something which is purposeful to us um and then we need to lose ourselves to
it on a regular basis so once we start to become more purpose driven and express ourselves in a
particular way obviously being a good colleague being a good business leader been a good sports person is not seeking to impress
it's about seeking to express and be ourselves in the context of our work so once people can find that um
within themselves um then i think they can direct their energy and their focus in a particular way
and become much more purpose driven in how they go about their daily activities but you can't give someone that purpose
it has to be theirs and i think life is about timing i think some people find that very late some
people find that very early and um and it makes no difference we're all individuals in regard to
helping other people make change we're almost too quick to go towards behaviors so we tell
people to be different all the time tell our team members you should be more collaborative guys i don't guys need to be more innovative
and tell our children to keep their rooms tidy so we're constantly talking to people about
behaviors say to our friends that you should give up smoking or eat healthier whatever it might be
the only way in which you change actions is by changing thoughts so we think and then we feel and then we
act that's how we work so if you're constantly working on actions we're telling people to be different and this is why new year's
resolutions fail from tomorrow i'll be different start doing this i'm going to stop doing that and we start talking about actions and
behaviors um we need to go back to the um granted a precursor of all our
actions which is our thoughts so the only way in which you genuinely drive commitment rather than compliance when
it comes to change in your team in your friends you know and yourself is by changing the words and pictures in
your head or their head to drive different feelings and then different actions there's um a little tip which i sometimes give
leaders and so i said leaders never say to your team you're gonna make a change you say to your team you're gonna make a change they won't like it um say to your
team i'd like to try and experiment they'll they'll be on board with it and um we'll give that a go that's okay
so even just a difference in language to allow someone to think differently or make them feel differently and hopefully
therefore choose to act in a different manner and how how would i get someone to change their thoughts
you know i think um i think the best way is gamification um what holds people in place is what
they believe to be true and then so um so people will sit around a boardroom table
and i'll discuss strategy and i'll say you know look you know we can do this but we can't do that and they'll have a viewpoint on budgets
on consumer buying behaviors on on compliance and governance and that's what holds this in place
so what we need to do is break free of some of the parameters that we think are in the way so if we got people
around the boardroom table and said look guys let's just this strategy piece that we're going to talk about let's imagine we got an unlimited
marketing budget for it if we had an unlimited marketing budget for it i know we haven't but if we had
what would we be doing how would we be doing it um you know if we had no marketing budget what would we be doing now what we're
doing here is that we are helping people to move outside of the mental tram lines that we all operate under
and under habitual thinking so let's ask some what if questions can you imagine that you know a life if
you weren't smoking i told what it looked like i don't know what you'd be doing today if you weren't smoking what'd you spend your money on
that you saved on cigarettes just played the game of what if so let's break free of some of the things which
are holding people in place by um not by conflict not by arguing and and debate in a
confrontational manner but finding some common ground and working from there and the common ground
is let's play a game and you you said that you know about people finding that purpose um in their
lives you we hear this uh phrase um a lot which is
find your passion yeah and i almost feel that it's it's in many respects quite harmful because
it that question is kind of loaded it it assumes a singular passion for a star it
sounds that you can discover it like an easter egg and then and also um the the context in which that
question usually sits in it implies that once you find it then it's you know then it's the the the
it's a can of unlimited like happiness and orientation forever and then that's
yours and it i just feel like sometimes language can be harmful because it it simplifies very complex things and
sometimes multifaceted plural things you know so i wondered if that you know that phrase uh find your per find your passion was
something you um you felt similar about or yeah i do i mean yeah it's true that passion can be
a significant multiplier of human potential so you know if people are passionate and
engaged in a business they can direct their energy in a in a worthwhile meaningful manner
so so so it's it's worthwhile but you're right and um that you know there's a big difference between
passion big difference between happiness and joy um some are in the moment at home i
think joy is in the moment and i think happiness is something um that we continually continually
adjust towards um your passion can be a significant multiplier of human potential
particularly in the workplace so it does have a place it is something which is useful to
understand and then ultimately it always comes down to personal introspection and self-awareness for me
and i think that um we need to work harder at understanding ourselves and when we are constructing a mindset
which is conducive to performance so we optimize our potential when we're in a particular state of mind
and that state of mind might be passion it might be relaxation it might be enthusiasm might be
enjoyment but we need to almost get to know ourselves and know that um there are certain
things which enable us to do others and once we work backwards and understand what that looks like maybe we
can gain some more consistency i say to a lot of sports people and to a lot of business people that
consistency of mind gives you consistency of play and i'm convinced of it and the more
consistent we can be in our thinking we understand um the building blocks the component parts to success
yeah the more success we can have and how does one establish consistency of thought because i completely agree with that i
completely agree i've seen that in my own life when i've been consistent with my thinking i've managed to you know
perform the same habits every day um but then sometimes i'll lose consistency in my thoughts
because i lose um [Music] i lose i guess i lose attachment or sort
of my anchor with my my why yeah and i talk a lot i've talked a lot in this podcast over the last couple of weeks about
this realization i've had this year with the gym which was every year february march i was incredibly
motivated to go fired up trying to look good for summer yeah and then obviously once you look good
and summer has ended it's almost like you've lost your anchor right so you get into
september and the why which made you go and to think consistently every day has been is evaporated and i'm tr i
can't get myself to go to the gym in october right you look in great shape for it this was the other
video i realized so this was the year i realized that this is the year i booked the trend for the first time in my life
because i realized that i thought to myself every single year i i do it for this period and then i
stop and they're two different people august steve and october steve don't know each other they're like you know what i mean
they're like twins that were separated at birth and so this was the year where i realized what i was doing and why
i was losing my motivation so i thought [ __ ] it you know i'm gonna anchor my why to something a bit more uh long term
and without a timeline so i said to myself listen i persuaded myself of all the reasons why i want to be healthy and view my
life as one season and that's what's allowed me to persevere and also i got a bit pissed
off with myself i thought you're really like that like like you're that vain and you're like you
know but so yeah do you know i mean i always think that consistency of mind comes from
understanding the intrinsic quality of our decision-making processes and i say that a lot to people in sport
and in business so yeah you can make a good decision and have a really bad outcome you can make a bad decision have a good
outcome and this is why i've worked with leadership teams who have confused luck for genius and really bad decisions with a great
outcome you know markets have changed competition's done something something's just worked in their favor um so um so it's really important for us
to not judge our decision making by our outcomes and we often do so we'll say this is a
good decision because it resulted in this or this is a bad decision it resulted in that and we can only understand the outcome
retrospectively so it's wrong to measure our decisions by the outcomes and we need to go back to how we made a
decision in the first place and once we start to understand the intrinsic quality of our decision making process
we can become more consistent in how we make decisions and therefore have more control over those outcomes so i think that you know
two things i don't i think that and then we'll use you as the example here steve um that consistency of mind will come
from knowing how we make decisions okay i understand that we put our weight into evidence how much we use
prejudice and bias and opinion whatever it might be but let's understand how we make decisions and in that way we can be
consistent in um how we apply our logic and thinking and feeling try and determine some best outcomes and
then the other thing and um as you've just positioned is reframing let's stand back and create some time
and space to understand and um you know why we do things and why we don't do things
now i always say that um the people are most successful and i've had a pleasure working with six sports people who got
to number one in the world i can guarantee you one thing i had in common was that um um they um they never made big
changes and um it was small changes so i'm a big big believer in the one degree of change
if you take two parallel lines and you move one by one degree it may not seem much at first but it's a really big difference between
where you start and where you end up so um everyone's trying to you know make a dramatic change and see change from
tomorrow i'm going to be different i think it's about doing something a little bit more than what we've been doing it matan a bit more consistently
and then the other thing with these people who obtained you know what i call um super achievements at home so they
did really really well um is that they actually worked on their strengths they started to understand what was good about them
and do that some more so we think to be better as human beings i'm gonna be better as a
business or a team of people we need to fix our weaknesses um i'm not sure that's true i actually
think it's more about understanding our strengths and playing to them so um i've actually worked with teams
before in business and in sport who have actually weakened the strength by trying to strengthen a weakness
if you think about it it's ridiculous and actually weaken the strength by trying to strengthen the weakness we need to be careful
so i think understanding what's good about us understanding you know where our behaviors come from in regard
to the thinking before it and then reframing some of those words and pictures and i guess that's what you've done with your gym
example because i guess change some of the words and pictures in your head to therefore feel differently which has
resulted you and acting differently yeah and i really you know i was i was valuing intensity over consistency and
intensity wasn't sustainable right so i was going through the summer like to the gym two times a day i was starving myself like eating things that
i i didn't want to necessarily eat yeah and the the consistency came from being a bit more um
realistic with myself being yeah you know if you missed the day of gym it doesn't matter you don't have to perspective yes perspective isn't it yeah and i
think do you know it's funny because again something so many sports people have worked with and business people who
will lose perspective they'll lose the tournament and it's dreadful you know win a tournament i've made it you know
this is it this is turning point for me now they win a big contract you know in business and you know this is us now we're set up
you know or they lose a contract and um and life has never been so dreadful um but i think that we need a
better perspective on things so their ability to think more long term term to be more forgiving you know to
understand with more um reality at uh what's good and what's not so good
is probably the way forwards and in terms of responsibility it's a it's a topic that's fast
consistency is a topic i've been so fascinated about over the last year as i've reflected and done has been sort
of introspective about the things i've been able to achieve whether it's getting millions of followers on social media whether it's
growing my business or going to the gym it seems that the the very ironically consistent theme across all
of them was consistency it was being able to do perform x habit for a long period of
time and then you have that the eighth wonder of the world shows up and things start compounding in your favor very quickly usually um but the other
term that i've been fascinated with is responsibility and as i've i started out as an 18 year old kid
dropped out of university disowned by my parents no money at all and
the one of the things that i noticed as i look back on 18 year old steve versus a lot of other people that i see
that that are living in the same [ __ ] area i was living in and stealing pizzas like i was stealing them
um was they don't take responsibility for their situation they kind of see themselves as a a
victim of the situation they're in whereas when i was in that situation not only did i not view it as my destination
i was literally taking photos of the the nothingness in my fridge and the how dire my life was because in
my mind and i started keeping this diary on facebook which i really randomly wrote in my diary that a tv company had
asked me to keep this because i didn't actually know how to tell my own diary right that i thought i was gonna
show the world this someday um i i didn't see it as my destination and i
took full responsibility of my circumstance it wasn't anyone's fault but my own and i was gonna change it but then one of the things that makes me
concerned um about our generation and about certain political narratives and certain
themes i see on the internet is like a an avoidance of responsibility
for your life and the the default to blame someone else and i'll be honest it's something i see
more in the western world than i do in the african village i was born in yeah you know so
i wanted to know if really from you like what role responsibility plays in people's outcomes
okay that's a big one yeah um you promised me some easy questions um
no so um responsibility is huge it's just massive it's um it's it's one of the pre it's one of the
predetermined of successful outcomes is our ability to take ownership and accountability so
circumstance and situation push and pull us in different directions on a daily basis the world is complex it's
uncertain it's unpredictable all of those things the people who perform best have huge levels of
responsibility and ability to respond to those circumstances and situation no matter
what they are to drive the best outcomes or opportunities so i always said there's a circle of concern
water cooler conversations the stuff that's going on you know around us circumstance situation incidents and
accidents then there's a circle of influence and the circle of influence is where we make choice that's what it's about
so responsibility is all about choice for me i absolutely guarantee you now that the
circumstance the situation is not a predictor of success and um because we know of people who
were born into privilege their great role models had good access to opportunity to wealth
they had good guidance and good support and they ended up dying heroin addicts in prison we know some
people born with a physical disadvantage now a lack of good role models now the lack of guidance lack of support lack of
opportunity they grew up to be some of the most successful people who have ever walked this earth so it proves beyond doubt that attitude
is more important than intelligence or facts and i genuinely believe that to be true in all areas of high performance that
attitude is more important than intelligence or facts i always say give me i will over iq any
one of my teams i'd rather if i will over iq because high technical expertise and talk about the western world at the
moment high technical expertise is no longer as valuable as it used to be and the reason why high technical
expertise is no longer as valuable as it used to be it's because we can google things that's why so knowing a lot
isn't where your success is going to come from yeah it's not what you know which is important it's how you think about what you know
and how you bring it to life with your character and personality to determine the best outcomes or
opportunities so you know i genuinely believe that the only way in which
businesses or people will become successful and truly perform to their optimum is taking full accountability and
ownership we need to almost move away from circumstance and situation which is a distraction
so um the more that we realize that our success is dependent upon us and not on situation the better and
because the world is so unpredictable i need to simply learn to dance on a shifting carpet
not see the rug being pulled from under our feet you know life is a game of continual adjustment
and it doesn't matter what happens it's how we react and respond to it to determine those best opportunities or
outcomes and i think that you know it's funny because initially i'm working a lot of businesses and um on culture on team
um people strategies and the focus on responsibility has never been higher
mainly because we've been asked to stay apart people are having to determine their own work schedules people have to
determine their own working week and um they're going to have to take responsibility for driving the best
outcomes and whilst they're not surrounded by team or working with directly with a leader
so it's been a greater call for responsibility i wonder whether in answer to your question i don't know
the answer to this um i wonder whether we'll see a better shift or greater shift towards more
responsibility in the western world because i agree with you i think that many of us will see ourselves as a
victim of circumstance and situation and not necessarily see the beauty in the chaos because of it
you talk there about the the internet as well in the power of the internet and how that's been a bit of a leveler which is yeah which is a really
wonderful thing i think um what how important is it do you do you think when you think about the
successful people you've worked with to be a sort of self-driven
learner beyond school um did you see in the specifically in the sort of upper echelons of like business
the ones that are the people that are most successful are proactive sort of self-driven yeah i
think i think it's true i think that um i've said that our only sustainable competitive advantage is to
learn faster and better than your competitors so you know and you think about that for a business you think about that for a
leader you know you think about as a sportsman it's probably true isn't it you know our only sort of sustainable competitive advantage is
just learn faster and better than anyone else two powerline lines yeah yeah and i think that you know and i think that
i think that how can we learn faster and better yeah if we're not proactive lifelong
learners and so you know and i think that you know learning isn't necessarily about being taught um we don't necessarily need
teachers um it's a strive for greater curiosity you know i think curiosity is worth more than creativity at the moment but
it's a strive for greater curiosity it's a matter of being massive being open-minded it's a matter of being um
agile in our thinking so we can deploy resourced of opportunity as it becomes visible
um it's about um it's about self-discovery so it's about a variety of things which
are based not necessarily upon traditional learning but more in a way in which we can open
our mind up to experimentation and feedback you know and understanding ourselves differently and
i think the best leaders um you know have this ability to you know reimagine repurpose reinvent
i don't think they're beholden to a particular or wedded to a particular mindset but that's for a lot of people that's
terrifying the thought of experimentation and being agile and reinvention i've seen that in my own business i've
seen over the years i was um i was known as being the guy that would walk in i think a lot of
business leaders are walking in the morning and be like we're going in a different direction everyone come in this room we're going to launch this part of our business and we're going to
take it we're going to experiment and i i would often say to our team that experimentation is like at the heart of
all of our strategy it's like why especially as a social media company where our platforms social media changes every day there's
new updates pushed by facebook and instagram every day um so our company slogan was keeping
keeping brands at the forefront of what's possible which meant that we had to be agile but i'd often see people in my organization
that were really against change fearful of it they would take you know they would
resist it yeah you know uh and i i i am i wonder how you if it's i always
wondered why it was i think some of them had levels of imposter syndrome so they were
you know they were just uh just trying to get a hang of the role they were in and not do more that
you know they were already you know but i wonder what your thoughts were on that i think i think people don't like change because they don't know what it results
in and that's one of the things so let's take um let's take uh moving your desk yeah
someone sat at our desk for ten years in a particular office he said you know what you need to you need to move down the corridor
i'm going to make a move but uh people weren't like the slightest um if you said to them that you know you
need to move down the corridor you know we really appreciate the move we're going to give you a million pounds at the end of the year because of it
they'll be trotting off with their potted plant in hand i guarantee it so i think that because people don't
necessarily know what it results in why should we invest in doing something different which is uncomfortable because
it goes against our mental tram lines our habitual thinking so now you're asking me to compromise my
patterns and i don't know what for and i know what's going to result in um it could be good it could be bad so
therefore i'm not sure i want to go to the trouble without investing in this change when i
haven't determined you know the result of it as human beings we like patterns um that's good and it's bad
and um it works in our favor sometimes sometimes it doesn't so we like patterns and so we like
consistency and we compartmentalize and how am i getting a viewpoint on the world and in fact if you look at um
the office is a good example the office is a great example of keeping people in patterns you've got your phone on your desk here
your computer there come in at a certain time working a certain way take your lunch at a certain time
so we're conditioned to work in a way which is reflective of the consistency which takes out variance in business so
you think that management has been around for about 100 years and the reason why management's been around for about 100 years
is to reduce variance at time because then you can guess then you can scale so businesses got bigger a lot bigger
100 years ago and um because of the ability to keep people habitual so um so because we've become
conditioned to do this and everything around us keeps us in in in a pattern that we quite like being in
as soon as we start to move outside of that there's a level of discomfort so i guess leaders can allow people to
make change atta and embrace change um i guess there's a few points one it's always best if it's co-authored and
co-created right um so let's involve people in what that change looks like um it's always best if um
we look at our organizations or teams as a community instead of as a team or an organization
at the moment communities are outperforming bureaucracies and hierarchies when it comes to maximizing human talent
so let's try and form a community and um let's co-author and co-create and and then um let's have a look at um
peer recognition peer coaching peer challenge it doesn't need to be a top down thing done to people it can be something which
can happen from the inside out you know it's meaningful when when something is endorsed by others
that that you know you are that you feel an affinity with sure what when you read about the steve jobs of
the world and the elon musk's of the world they seem to buck all of the a lot of the trends that you hear in like management coaching they
seem to be very authoritarian you know i was reading about from i was reading steve
elon musk's biography and there's stories of him just like calling someone into the office and saying how much does it cost to do this
they'll say 10 million he'll say do it for 5 and do it within 30 days and they'll go away feeling puzzled but they'll get
it done yeah he has this culture of like intensity and when you start he says to
the teams that this will be the hardest you've ever worked in your life but it'll be the most worthwhile but it'd be the hardest you've ever worked
and and i you know and then steve jobs as well i've heard the stories of how he was you know how he built the company at
medlo park and um he seemed like the antithesis of what you would read about in a business book
but obviously these are two of the most successful entrepreneurs the world has ever you know seen so i
wondered if there's a i'm trying to appreciate the like
how they've achieved their success by being so different from what all the business books say from all accounts they're you know what
i mean yeah i mean i think a couple of things i guess that you know you find what works
for you um i think what they have on their side is they have a really big
purpose statement it's a really big mission so there are lots of companies with mission statements but very few on a
mission and i guess that when it comes back to um the point i made earlier that passion
been a significant multiplier of human potential i guess that these people have the ability to engage people
so to tell a story attempt to inspire and motivate so i guess that you know there is a
there's no doubt lots of logic and time there is no doubt lots of rationality which is used in their
management leadership style you know but what you're describing to me in the people that you're describing
i think you can really get behind something that someone passionately believes in and is something which is worthwhile and
purposeful yeah on such a grand scale so i think when they're talking about um and things which will change humanity
um i think it's possible for you know us to be swept along at him on that particular vision and
so maybe it does mobilize people in a different manner because of who they are what they believe in and what they're
trying to achieve yeah no that's probably true i mean yeah you think about i mean the example i'll give you is jfk
well yeah i mean i mean jfk do you think that jfk's speech about putting man on the moon you should read it actually rather than
look at it um it's a rubbish speech when you read it the term and the reason
and the reason why is that there's no logic to it until there's no rationality so he says we put a man on the moon and
the reason why he gives that we should put a man on the moon is because it's it's hard and not easy
which is a rubbish reason to do anything it's hard that's why we're gonna do it yeah so um
but not only did they end up doing this it mobilized the whole nation behind the space race and the whole
nation behind science in fact um the reason why was that because logic was low
inspiration was high it was such a um it was such a literally a moonshot it
was literally such a big goal and so ambitious so expansive you know
that people bought into the dream and i wonder whether and i don't know you know
the examples you gave at steve jobs and elon musk whether whether people just buy into that dream and they buy into
what they not necessarily what they're seeking to do but what they're seeking to create and maybe there's a lesson for all of us
who manage and manage teams that maybe it's not about trying to you know get people to do stuff it's about people
to you know to create stuff is that you know my time to be part of something which is worthwhile
and meaningful and sell a big vision and tell the right story
and you know engage people emotionally you know all of this stuff about psychology i know a lot of stuff
i read a few books yeah you've read a few books about a few books a week last tuesday yeah you know don't tell my clients
um you know when people come across people like you they think that you've got all the answers and
because you've got all the answers or at least an answer to most things um they think that you must live
a life of sort of perfect decision-making couples children have the worst worn
shoes yeah exactly um so yeah what what do you like at living these things that you're aware of
speaking of performance one of the things that's integral to performing at the highest level is nutrition it's something that i
i guess i took a a long time to finally believe but that is why having hewlett's
response for this podcast is such a privilege because there was a time in my life especially when i was early in my business career
where i wasn't getting the vitamins the minerals and i wasn't having a sort of nutritionally complete diet i was
if you look at some of my old photos i was definitely lacking protein as well and a lot of that maybe it was an excuse
was because i was um i was busy and when i discovered huel when a guy called
mike walked past me in the office wearing a heel t-shirt and shaking a little bottle and you know upon my curiosity of asking
what was in that and why he was drinking it it really really did change my life and so here's what i want to do
you know this particular podcast today has been about high performance and mindset and how we how we become our best selves and how we
teach our teams to become our best selves i'm going to give away this week five
boxes of your big boxes right all you've got to do if you want one of those boxes is hit the subscribe button

but if you're listening on youtube then please um just leave a comment down below and any comment you leave enters you
into the competition and i want to know what you think of huel so um it's as i say i say it with
full honesty it's changed my life and i really believe that those of you who aren't getting your sort of um all your minerals and proteins and
all the good stuff i think it can change yours too what do you like at living these things
that you're aware of yeah i'm rubbish next question
and the reason why is that two things that one um we're all human because we're all human
you know we're all prone to make mistakes in our doing and our thinking um and i think that being you know
better never stops so therefore we've got to continually adjust you know we don't find hints tips gimmicks that make us
better and then we just apply them regularly and it works so i guess there's a level of
inconsistency which is reflective of the fact that you know that
i'm a human being who tries to do better you know give me an exam on a regular basis on an example well you're aware of the
truth but you're just not oh you might you know on the amount of time so as you know i've been a guest speaker for 10 years now so when
the world is normal and sane you know i would um go off four days a week
anywhere in the world so twice a week i was abroad and i'd speak to a few hundred people i'd stand on stage i'd do an hour's talk
about performance psychology and i'd come off um so i did that for ten years four times a
week and um but um but i'd often come off and think
cause any good i say to the stake at stake i would come up to me and say that you know that was really brilliant this is
exactly what we're after it's perfect are you happy oh yeah it's exactly what we're after but you sort of covered the brief yeah
yes yeah absolutely it's exactly what it was send me an email let me know the feedback and then
you get you know maybe even get some feedback which is like you know you get sort of scored out of five it's almost like 97 percent five and um
i'd be scouring for the threes and twos and think that you know there's like you know 500 people there's that sort of five people who put two
and so it was all right i just think [ __ ] but um but uh but i'd be wondering why
what did i do wrong what was real and it's unbelievable it's unbelievable the amount of times i've sat in front of an audience
and um and you know maybe 300 people there there's someone with their arms folded like that and they're just like i think he doesn't
look engaged you know and so out of friend of people there's something there's most people writing down things or nodding or
smiling or whatever it is it's amazing how many times i can pick out the one person who doesn't seem to be enjoying
it so i think i think look i think it's a couple of things that i'm i'm always prone to you know we
actually we wait quite highly stuff which we think we're not doing well you know we're trying to fix what's not
right about us what's not good you know you know what we should have done and um what we could be doing um i think i'm
still prone to that rather than sort of enjoying the you know the success that i've had really what about things in your personal life
in terms of like like you know health and like being a parent
and like yeah pursuing goals and ambitions you have in your personal life what about those things
yeah i think that you know um health-wise i need to take some advice from you we should i'll lie down and tell you all
about it i keep i keep meaning to i keep meaning to run more and get to the gym more there's always an excuse
um so you know i'm the most demotivated motivational spooky
life's pretty [ __ ] and um so um so yeah so i think i need to work out
more um i'll tell you the one thing that gets me and um i've got three children i got sort of um four four-year-old twin girls
and a nine-year-old boy um is that you know as a psychologist and um yeah i'm pretty good at i've sat
in front of some sort of pretty difficult clients some really difficult clients you know some people at the absolute top of their
profession and um and they're they're [ __ ] screwed in their thinking and um and you know and you know i've
dealt with it four-year-olds and nine-year-olds just do me i can't you know i just you try and apply psychology to it it
doesn't work so the level of frustration that comes about in regard to being a parent again this is my point that you
know all human beings and um so um so you know you try you try all the influence persuasion and
negotiation and all the psychology and all the techniques that you know that um it doesn't work on four-year-olds
it doesn't work it's so funny the guest that was here yesterday joe wicks are the exact same thing he said i'm like a you know calm guy but he just said you
know when i my daughter i'll tell her that i want to just put her down so i can clean the counter and she just won't be
the irrationality of it is what it does yeah and um so you know you know it's funny because um
i've had some really good sports people sit in front of me and say you know give me you know you've got something that makes me better then
and then you give them something and they go away they come back a week later and they say i tried that it doesn't
work have you got anything else it's a bit like going to the gym working out for half an hour going home looking in the mirror and says yo let's
crap that i don't like the gym film refrigerator um and so and this is my point that that you know
it's not about tools gimmicks and hints it's about striving every day to be better than what you were yesterday
um i worked with a golfer it was very very good really good um and you know literally
top 10 in the world it's about a whole year and uh with just a piece of paper in his pocket
and he used to play with his piece of paper in his pocket um and it used to just say um what did i enjoy today and what did i
learn today 2 questions on it and then in the evening he just answered those questions so that whole year forget the numbers
i'm not going to look at numbers i'm just going to answer this question so i've had a good day i've had a bad day doesn't make any difference i'll
just answer that question these questions what did i enjoy today and what did i learn today had the best year we ever had and i'm just answering
those questions yeah and in a way there almost needs to be more simplicity to not using tools
and techniques not to try and apply psychology to a four-year-old you know but to just try and consistently enjoy
and learn on a daily basis so i guess in regard to like you know yeah i'm still prone to say
god i need to get running okay i've been drinking all week i need to do some exercise at the weekend
um and you know again it's falling into the trap of the i've been at the mercy of the shoulds
and musks rather than thinking about at um you know what am i enjoying what am i learning
what surprised me this week um you know where am i experimenting and
what have i discovered you know this week about myself and then once we start to talk like that maybe we can so i guess apply more
consistent thinking and therefore change our doing so you want to run let's use that as an example
yeah i need to run more definitely i need to run more why do you need to run more and um do you know because i want to
improve my heart and lung health i think i think i've got tonight it's all right for you because you're young and fit and
um but um but i think i've got to an age now where i realized there's more of an importance on exercise so you know before i could just
i'll just do it anyway you know pick up running every now and then i'll be able to run i go to the gym every now and then i'll have a great time at the gym for a
couple of weeks and then i'll skip it um yeah but now you know but now it's it's different a term you know now i
sort of feel at them as though you know i could be fitter it should be i think this year has also sort of illuminated that for everybody
at the importance of health i think it's made us all well it has for me made me think about my health a lot more
no not for the vain reasons that you know young guy would think about their health because they're trying to trying to get laid or something but
because you know i i want to live longer and i want to have more memories than those kind of things did you know near ielts he wrote a book
called indistractible i know yeah i'm not familiar with i've read it you're probably familiar with the book yeah i know the name but i am yeah he
said this quote to me which really changed my life and i think about it all the time okay when i find myself procrastinating from doing something or
whatever he said that typically we think we're humans that are seeking pleasure but we're actually living in
the avoidance of discomfort and when i think about the things that i procrastinate against or whether you know we're at six
seven o'clock in the evening you think i can't be bothered to go whatever it does ring true to me that i'm actually
avoiding some kind of psychological discomfort yes and so i now whenever i feel myself like this weekend i had
had this big project to do i also had this talk that i had to do um for my manager dom and i found myself
like and then i've got the book my book which i had to do go through the whole book from start to finish in a day
and i'm like low-key finding myself oh just clean the countertop because that's important
and i said i stopped myself i thought you're avoiding the discomfort associated with sitting down for nine hours until six am
in the morning and doing the book and it wasn't until i realized why you know what i started that term has
been like this flashlight that i shine in like the corner of the room we're after hiding the you know the thing that
i don't want to do now so i wondered if it was you know for some in in regards to your running if it's in some respects similar like
you're avoiding some kind of discomfort where you think i'd rather play i'm convinced of it because running such an unpleasant
experience for me it's a really good example i can't stand it so but you're absolutely right that uh
that you know i totally agree with you that you know we we do sort of go about our lives trying to seek
moving out of that space of you know of of being uncomfortable this is why we don't have conflict
conversations in the workplace this is why we don't challenge our own thinking this is why we don't like change and uh
you know we like we like to operate from a comfort zone that's what we do um so yeah no i agree with you i think i
think because running is such an unpleasant experience for me that's absolutely awful um i'm probably
avoiding it because i just don't want the experience whereas riding a bike isn't so bad for me um so so yeah so
maybe therefore but um instead of sat there at four five o'clock thinking god i need to go running in an hour
and i really don't want to i'll go tomorrow maybe maybe what i should be saying is i
need to go running no you don't um why don't you ride the bike why didn't you yeah why don't you just have stairs
um okay well i'll have a go on it after this but um we should have done a whole
interview on that i'm gonna kill two birds with one stone i hate running as well it's like i hate
the impact on my knees yeah just i don't want to be outside yeah that'll be swerving past people so i got the peloton um it's low resistance
it's fun super engaging and gamified because you see the data you see everyone in the world and where they're placing you see
jenny 55 in north carolina's beating you yeah make me feel bad
i hate jenny forever that just makes me realize how unfit i am and how much i hate other people who are fitter than me
but i mean interestingly it proves how fit you are because you said you don't like running because of your knees and swerving past people
i don't like running because i can't breathe so you're already winning chicken egg that'll be cured if you
start running um but but on that point of um of psychological discomfort um
how does somebody in your opinion
face a challenge that they know is uncomfortable like you know to be honest i don't i don't
want to go to the gym or do all these zoom calls all the time it's not like
you know i'm not getting comfort or in pleasure out of doing two hours zoom calls at the moment about
like you know biotech or whatever it is the thing that i'm involved in but i'm doing it and i wanted to know in
your case what what does it take someone who like doesn't want to do something because they know it's uncomfortable to
say do you know what [ __ ] it i'm gonna do it today yeah and is it does that go back to that
point of of having that like long anchor purpose yeah i think it does i mean
mohammed ali said i've i've hated every moment in the gym but i did it so i could live the rest of my life like a champion yeah and it's in in a
way it's true isn't it that that you know there are there are component parts to success um and i think the
two of the interesting one is and the one that most people probably relate to is failure
so people don't like to experience failure but you know for example failure is part payment towards success
so the price of success is always paid in full and in advance the price of success is always paid in
full and in advance you can't be successful and you start making mistakes you can't be successful and start having your two hours zoom calls but uh you
know in a way you need to fail we need to have these awful conversations we need to kiss lots of frogs we need to
you know do deals which don't work but i mean you do all these things to enable you to be super successful so um there's lots of things that um
again it comes back to reframing if we see it as part and parcel a stepping stone towards a greater advancement
they're probably more likely to do it you know if you see failure as something which is we're trying to avoid and it's just
awful and you know and it screams to me that i'm useless um then we're probably going to stay
within a comfort zone you know if we embrace failure then we see it as part payment towards success
until we see it as something which is um an active contribution a stepping stone towards
you know being better maybe we're more likely to indulge in it and not have the discomfort that we associate with it so now i feel
that um it is always good to think about you know what you think about that end goal have that purpose that
vision the mission you know what you're seeking to achieve and create um and then think about what those
building blocks look like because you know all great achievements are the result of many small achievements
um you know you had joe wicks here yesterday he wasn't super successful overnight
and he probably kissed a lot of frogs i'm sure you talked about it you know um know his business and korean personal
life went in all sorts of different directions like ours at um and you know it's not necessarily
as we said earlier it's not necessarily what what happens it's it's our interpretation of what's
happening which will then enable us to use that as feedback towards something better and do you find with a lot of the high
performance people you've worked with that their childhood is a definitive
reason as to why they are the way they are today i'm going to try and articulate this if i can
but i've i from speaking to guests on this podcast and also from a bit of introspection to be honest
i tend to think a lot of people that have extraordinary outcomes have often had
some kind of extraordinary early experience and i'll give you a couple of examples
the a lot of the billionaires that i know are really really successful people that i know um cite their father's disapproval
as the reason why they've always had a chip on their shoulder and they've always strived obsessively to be enough right because
their father told them they weren't enough yeah um have you seen that in successful people that there's the
the thing that makes them just a bit [ __ ] weird is often a you know i think one
particular instance with a friend of mine a comment their mother made when they were four that they just can't shake
yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean i i'm not a psychiatrist so i don't delve into
backgrounds in the way that maybe someone involved in psychiatry would yes as a performance coach i tend to
work with how people are now basically and um tell me about what you're thinking and doing what you're trying to achieve
and more so than to try and deconstruct you know or analyze some of the you know the earlier experiences um so that's not my thing
having said that though you're absolutely right there seems to be some sort of correlation between
extreme experiences and then how people interpret or translate them and in fact you know as you're talking i
was trying to think of the book i can't think of a book i wish i could now and they talk about in this book the fact that so many super
successful people politicians actors um business people lost parents when they were young and
there's a direct correlation believe it or not it's a direct correlation between people losing parents when they were
young and then becoming super performers be incredibly successful um and the psychology behind it was that
you learn independence and um it's almost easy if you've got these loving fabulous parents who
you know hopefully you know many people have got um you're not as independent you know
whereas you know if you lose a parent young you end up sort of doing things for yourself a little bit earlier
and so maybe that going back to that responsibility the ownership piece and i'm having to sort yourself out
and um you know means that people learn some of the skills which enable their talent to then be used differently in the
future but there is a direct correlation believe it or not i wish i could tell it's like the real psychology in the actual
article in the actual piece in the book um but you just reminded me when you're talking about it so i do think that some
people do have these extreme experiences and i think that um it's almost easier
to get to know ourselves and get to think about life and contextualize things um you know if
we're experiencing things which are outside of our i guess our normal field of vision i i
resonate a lot with that i um you said you know lose a parent but the reason i resonated with that is because
i've said multiple times on this podcast again um that when people have asked me why why i was successful i i cite that when
i was younger my parents weren't ever in the house and that made meant that i had to find a way to make money to feed myself or
you know my mum was never in the house when i went to bed and she was never there when i woke up because she was just she slept at her shop sometimes my dad
worked in london for six days a week which was four hours away and i and it was only
of the four of us in our my family the four siblings that wasn't the case for my older siblings when they were
younger or when they were my age my mom and dad were in the house every day doing date nights together and then when i grew up by the
age of 10 i could leave the house for three days or two days and they wouldn't actually know that i'd gone and so that meant that i became
like this sort of self-autonomous kid at like 12 13 14 50. and then started businesses at 14 and then you know
went off but you could have gone the other way as well couldn't you oh you know with 100 you know with that
level of freedom and autonomy but not the maturity and you know to deal with that freedom
um my friend my best friend said to you and i'll never forget where i stood when he said it in this takeaway shop he said stephen
you're either going to be a criminal or a millionaire and it was because i had that my
independence created this connection where i knew that my outcomes were going to be a direct result
of my behavior i always think of like school dinners as the perfect example
for a lot of my childhood maybe up until the age of about nine my there was always like two quid on the counter which is like okay you take that to
school and then by ten the two quid wasn't there anymore yeah so it was like waking up in the morning and being like how am i gonna
eat today i'd have to find a way so i'd go and sell cigarettes or you know i'd like i knew that there were cigarettes in this this room
upstairs which my mum had got from nigeria one one year so i just went to school and i was just shopping cigarettes or chewing gum and
it was that that connection i made super early that my outcomes are a direct and only correlation of sort of
connected to my behavior um so i resonate with that a lot and it kind of explains the difference between
four kids that grew up in the same household and one the three of them went to university llc cambridge whatever and one of them dropped out of everything
got kicked out of school and became an entrepreneur it's true isn't it so it's not necessarily the um
yeah the experience is how we translate that experience and exactly how we channel our feeling into something which
could be productive or destructive you could have become a criminal and a millionaire and got a job at this tory government
you could be
yeah but the last thing i really wanted to ask you about was um you know this idea of distractions
social media is uh made it incredibly easy to distract ourselves and you see you know teams becoming
much more distracted at work because of all these screens and you know the digitalization of the world and individuals and
what are what's your thoughts on on why we're so distracted and how to overcome it yeah um it's true that we are distracted
i think focus and concentration have to be practiced so many things can be improved
so um whether it's resilience whether it's concentration whether it's courage all these things
can be practiced so many think courage for example i say courage is like a muscle the more you exercise it the
stronger it gets so it's possible to exercise all these things and be better at them and i think that um it's fine to be
distracted because it's actually quite nice to have different stimuli and different um provocation
and so we just need to choose when it's good to have that provocation and change and when we need to
concentrate we need to practice both now um uh here's the thing for you adam
is that as human beings we don't multitask so multitasking is a lie so for all the um all the girls and all
the women watching this and um oh listening to this um i'm sorry to tell you it's not true you
don't multitask better than men it's true amen it doesn't happen we're both equally as bad now we're both
useless at it so what we do is we do rapid switching so we don't multitask we just want to talk about exactly um this is why
actually um i can't remember it was a couple of years ago that the um the blackberry network went down in abu
dhabi for a weekend from friday to monday had a 48 decrease in car accidents that
we get really because as human beings we don't multitask you don't like check your text and drive well it
doesn't work so um so i think that we are living in an age where it's easy to be distracted
and some of these distractions are incredibly useful um we need to come back to greater responsibility and choice
and um let's choose at home you know when it's fine to do that and it's fine not to be and um and practice
you know these levels of concentration of focus that we may need for certain tasks but we may not for another so i quite
like times when i can sit down and read a book or absorb something or think about something
and narrow my focus sometimes i quite like sort of tv being on music being on at um
phone next to me on the computer because actually um i'm sometimes picking up on certain things
which um for a level of creativity can be quite useful and a bit of provocation a bit of a bit of
changeability in my thinking because i get distracted by something and come back to it i find that as well i find them for some
bizarre reason if i if i go for a walk or if i go to the gym uh inspiration floods into me but when
i'm stood sat in my office trying to think of stuff it's yeah almost impossible the shower is another
weird place where my ideas seem to show up all at once and it's like i'm not like this isn't hyperbole i'm not
exaggerating at all like if i if i'm sat here and i'm trying to think of something to write or whatever yeah i go for a walk and sometimes i put my
my music in it's like non-stop and i find that quite you know
interesting yeah teams are often trying to think of ideas and creativity and if you say to people where do you have
your best ideas and have asked people that question whatever your best ideas do you know what they'll say well i'm walking the dog
and when i'm in the shower just about to fall off the sleep um on the commute over breakfast uh you
know um they'll they'll they'll come up with all some recreational drugs they'll come up with all sorts of stuff
but no one will ever say in a boardroom with some mints on the table and a jug of water
no one will ever say that but but where do we where do we um you know try and create ideas in the
business at all we get them around this boardroom table no one ever said don't get me wrong you can't get your team in the shower with
you maybe you've tried i don't know what it's like around here maybe you've tried i don't know yourself better but um but yeah maybe
yeah maybe we can't do that but we've got to find a way of trying to you know uh create a more natural
environment for people to flourish and i do say to you many organizations i say to them that you know you're
too quick to train the people rather than fix the environment you know people say oh i need more innovative people they don't um you know
we need to train them on innovation no you don't let's try and create a culture an environment where people
are free to express themselves the problem we've got is that you know we're so we're so convergent in our thinking and
uh you know we start off as divergent thinkers we start off making really weird connections
um i had a six-year-old once um asked me what does the number nine smell like
amazing question i think that's probably the best question i've ever been asked well do you respect the interviewer
today i was going to say that but um but you know what's the number nine smell like it's a great question um yeah was the last time you heard a
ceo ask that question they don't um you know children ask these divergent questions because they make the
connection between two things usually unconnected um and then you go to school and the school says
why are you asking that we're doing numbers today just concentrate on the numbers um and then we go from divergent
thinkers to convergent thinkers and our careers get better because of it our businesses get better because of it
and making simple connections you know margins down okay we need to do this you know revenue's down okay we need to do
that um but what do we need in today's society in today's world
and um i think we need convergent thinking i think we need to move back and and get into that divergent space
again and yeah who are the most successful people you know at the moment and people are making really weird connections
people who this is where uber and airbnb and all these things come from it's from people who are making a
connection between two things previously unconnected because they're still divergent so let's try and create some
environments where people are free to explore experiment free to break some of the rules and to talk
about things which are um which are not easily put together and i think that that's the best way in
which we can see the opportunity and possibilities in in this changing world in which we live in
how do people find you what's the best uh yeah i think i mean uh twitter or linkedin really i don't use anything i don't use facebook or
anything like that so um for your website so you're on my website into me people contact me through my website but i used
uh i started using twitter again and but linkedin is great for me i can imagine there are about 30 000
people on linkedin and that's really where where i sort of communicate have you um
how do you find social media just out of interest in terms of life i'm a bit like an alcoholic who can't get the top of the bottle
yeah i mean i mean i love the idea of it but um you know i am you know i i think
oh god i should be doing more um but um but i but i just don't
people say that you should if it's not you should you should do yeah well but you know what it's funny one of the advices that i give people at the moment
if it ain't broke you should break it because um you know we almost need to give up what's allowing us to be
successful to allow us to be successful and um you know i know it's a counterintuitive argument it makes perfect sense to be
honest i mean that's the definition what innovation is right yeah it's breaking the blueprint so so i think that you know and again look
it's probably my running isn't it it's one of those things which are uncomfortable so i probably don't do it so um so what i should do is is
try and find out more about you know social media and then i'll have a look at your social channels after and obviously we've got a lot of
content from this so we can send it to you in a way that will do perform well if you post it so listen thank you for your time
today thank you very very generous and it's a really inspiring conversation that's uh i actually want to read it's one of the few conversations where i'm like i
really need to re-listen to this again and maybe with my notepad out and really take notes because there's so many
ideas that are really really profound at times that i'm like i'm trying to hold on to and then because you're because you're full of
them i'm i'm going back i'm thinking you know what i mean because there's so much intelligence condensed in such a
short period of time very kind no i really mean that as well yeah
sometimes i have experts on that have really well studied in their field and the things you say as someone who's
ran a multinational business with 700 employees for the last 10 years of my life i'm like perfect sense and i i really
want to i could unpack all of those individual topics more but yeah thank you such a pleasure to have you thank you thank you for inviting me

Transcription:

intro
this is the first podcast i've done this year where we had tears um and not just once and uh i don't
really know how to introduce this conversation i guess i guess the thing i want you to
know is that things aren't always what they seem and um
really that humans will feel the same we all feel the same emotions the same peaks the same troughs
and no matter what it looks like on the the outside things aren't always what they seem i'm
stephen bartlett and this is the diver ceo i hope nobody's listening but if you are then
please keep this to yourself
Achieving my ultimate goal in 18 weeks
visualization that's a very relevant word i think to start this conversation because in our last conversation last
year when i asked you what you wanted to be remembered for what you wanted to do next in your career you told me that you wanted to have a
legacy for getting kids all across this country up exercising and really into exercise sort
of similar to how jamie oliver completely changed the way we view like school dinners and things and i remember jamie oliver was the reason i was eating
apples instead of mars bars when i was younger and then just like a couple of months
later the pandemic happens and you're getting
millions and millions of kids in this country up dancing and into exercise
only a couple months later it like boggles my mind i've never seen someone say something so big such a big ambition
and then only like a couple of months later do it on a scale which nobody has ever done it before
that's what happened i remember when we met and we talked about that moonshot thing the idea of like having a goal so big and so outreach
that you feel you can never you know almost never attain it and that was my vision it was to have that legacy of making an impact you know and
i do think about james he's had amazing success as a chef as a you know an author but i think about the jamie's school dinners the man who went
into the schools all over the uk and said look this isn't this isn't enough our kids can eat healthier and i
feel the same about school fitness and exercise and pe not just about obesity and the diabetes
thing but i think about our children's mental health and i said to you that i want to have a legacy where i can create
absolute you know national change and national um create awareness around fitness and you
know lockdown happened and within you know 18 weeks that happened so it was almost like a 10-year dream
happened in 18 weeks and i'm so proud of that i've reached that many people take me to the start so lockdown happens
where does this idea come from like what what happens how does and then i want to hear like when you saw the numbers the amount of people tuning in
every day and the impact it was having how did all of that feel it was an intense moment in time but it was also something
i did visualize and i did i had been working on so i'd been visiting schools i'd on the uk tour
i went to ireland northern ireland i'd visited schools i'd worked out with hundreds of kids in these schools and that monday i was
supposed to go on another tour me and nikki were going to take the camera you know it's my brother nikki um and like i've always said there was
no tv show there was no money there was no budget it was just me and nikki going and doing what we love which is connecting and i suppose reconnecting
with the mission and purpose that i have because when it's all digital i do sometimes feel like it's just numbers and is it
is it real people so i have to go and visit the schools and actually meet the kids and do it so on the monday i was supposed to go
out on the road we had about 15 schools chosen and boris announced you know there's going to be this lockdown so
it was 12 15 a.m i was laying in bed on the thursday night and i text nikki because i looked at my whatsapp the next day and i text nikki
saying i've got this idea and honestly i saw everything i saw a hashtag i saw a logo i saw the name
i said it's going to be called pee with joe every day next week do it let's just try it for a week nine a.m
um monday to friday i announced it and loads of pr you know loads of school newsletters you know school news letters or twitter
tweeting it and i was doing espn cnn like global pr and i thought this is going to be really big
but still had no idea how many people would tune in on a monday and on the monday we went live i stepped in front of that camera and i was really
nervous and 850 000 i think it was live streams and i thought wow if you think about how
many kids that could possibly be and then day two was the biggest one so day two was 954 000 live streams which is a
world record it turns out yeah concurrently it was almost a million people watching at the same time
yeah it blew my mind then i i realized there and then that that was like families that was kids it was schools it
wasn't like individual people so really it was probably tens of millions of people a day and i felt this amazing sense of purpose
like i was there for people that when they needed me the most because everyone was locked in you know whether you had children or not you were like
confined you felt restricted your mental health was going to suffer that day and i was there like to to be there and just have fun and i never once one thing
i was really cautious of never mentioned lockdown never mentioned covid or the or you know anything to do that was like it was a
safe 30 minutes where we could forget about things i put the music on we were dancing around being really silly and
that was a gift that was my gift to the world it was just a bit of laughter some feel good energy and a real boost
in their mood when that finished i know that they were happier and you must have got a lot of calls from the big sort of production
companies and tv companies wanting to like buy it or or to bring it to tv right within a few
days so you remember i told you the story about the channel 4 thing i was trying my hardest to make the uk tour thing and a documentary
around schools fitness but they never had the budget that no one could do it well within a few days the head of channel 4 like the top guy i can't think
of his name called me up personally said joe what you're doing is amazing we'd love you to stream the workouts on channel four and
i i was like dude like i'm doing this on youtube i've got kids in sri lanka and south america and india
and like even like madagascar and the maldives taking part in these workouts i can't do this on channel 4 i need to
be global and i'm so glad i stuck with that because that really allowed it to go globally it allowed everyone
all over the world to take part and don't forget i was getting a million live streams but by the end of the 24 hours there was seven
eight million views crazy so total 80 million views on the 18 weeks so 80 million
individual views but how many families or schools are doing that so it's tens of millions of kids and
that was my dream so i just can't believe it happened but i'd built up that trust over eight years
you know as the body coaches joe wicks as this mission driven person anyone could have the same idea
but maybe they wouldn't have had the same reaction because like i said i put out so much love and energy and positivity and visiting these schools
that those teachers knew i was going to live deliver a really fun and safe session for their kids 18 million people is you know when you
sat down with me last year we had this conversation you said you wanted to to do this nationally right you said you want to get kids exercising
nationally there's only about 60 million people in the uk you managed to do 80 million people all around the world
on a global level but also at a time when people really needed that kind of
energy the most at a time when the country was you know fearful and people were trapped indoors and not
exercising as much as they they could have been so i you know we can talk about the the p with joe
Feeling lost
thing for a long time but the thing that actually fascinates me more is what happens afterwards
so you've just that goal you set out to achieve you achieved it quick how does it feel after
well you talk about that gold medal syndrome you know of people having this like coming off tour or coming to back
from the olympics and they have this kind of feeling of like feeling flat or not depressed maybe but confused and
lost and that's what happened i moved into this new house and i thought i've got this lovely house why am i feeling flat and for the first
two weeks i was there i was missing my old house in richmond because my children were born there p which i was in that living room that
you interviewed me in and it was like this i left this energy behind and moved into this new life and i was like why am i
feeling like this and i realized it was because i'd lost my purpose i'd been disconnected from that audience every day
um so when i felt that the first thing i do i jump on my instagram like i said to you i used to do dms and voice notes
and i reconnect with the messages i read the youtube comments so that i know two million people a month for
doing youtube workouts before the lockdown i'm now getting six to seven million views a month so that's real people that
have changed their habits they're still doing it um and it reminded me why i did it and also
i had wonderful letters i had two two or two or three i'm gonna say it's probably nearly like two or three thousand like letters and
cards and things that seems mad but i had this stack of things to go through so i sat in my office for two days
you know laughing crying like feeling this love it was like this wave of love when i realized what i'd actually done during that time
it wasn't just about me getting kids exercising it was like widows it was single parents it was people with anxiety and depression
living on their own and in all the all the different places in the world it was really emotional so i did feel lost
but i've reconnected with that because now i'm still doing my youtube workouts i'm still delivering free content and although there's this new product in
this app coming out i'm so passionate and committed to doing that one workout a week that i will never neglect that free
content and that audience that are there that still may never buy my app on my books you talked about buying a new house
probably a bit of a dream come true in many senses um but again you speak about it being kind of anti-climactical like in like
not feeling like that expectation that when you've got that big house because i've seen the house it's a nice house you should have felt
like confetti should have come down and you should have felt amazing and but you kind of described it like you didn't feel that like that yeah i kind
of thought you know i was i was gonna move anyway but it was like the the the lock down accelerated because we had paparazzi outside and i
wasn't used to that you know i wasn't used to being having like folks taking a meaning when we walked to the park and we lived on a main road so it's quite public and
people would knock and and sort of say hello and it was fine but sometimes you just want a little bit of privacy like when you switch off
so we found this lovely house and it's you know it's got a nice driveway it's got a beautiful back garden and when i was in there i just kind of
thought why aren't i double as happy i've got more space i've got more garden but i genuinely
felt like i left that part of me behind in that house that was so purpose-driven it was all about pee with joe it's where my kids
were born so i suppose it's a lesson and i really talked about that when boris announced the lockdown number two and i'm sitting
there in my kitchen i've got all this space i'm thinking it doesn't matter if you've got a massive house we live in a one bedroom
flat we all feel the same right now we all feel very disconnected very lonely you know we miss our friends and
family we need to socialize we need events we need live music we need dinners so so it's just a really important
message that it doesn't matter what situation you're in we're all feeling the same and i really wanted to share that message and it definitely helped
people open up the conversation because we're all struggling you know mentally with this with what's going on and yeah you know
you've talked about it before you know ordering the car and the house and i think we're driven by these things and consumerism like we we're always
wanting the next thing but what i've realized you're in this lockdown is i'm happy exactly where i am with just what i've got
and that's a nice feeling it's really nice when you realize that another rolex another car even another motorbike or another
holiday it doesn't it doesn't give you what you really think and i think people listening that are desperate for that life i think we
all come to the same conclusion eventually whether you're 30 or 60 we will all level out and realize that what's important is our friends and our
connection and our love to the people around us it's it as you say it took me a long time to learn that lesson and
i the the phrase that i was having 27 aren't you something like that yeah you ain't taking that long
you've got i think you're very when i listen to your podcast i think you've got a lot of wisdom i think you've spoken to a lot of people and you've
you've absorbed a lot and i think you've really taken into your own um your own life and philosophies i
think i think you know what i think it is i i've also been really like self-analytical as in i will
have a thought and i'll have a feeling and i'll try and grab onto it and hold that out in front of me and go why are you feeling like that so the day
as you kind of alluded to there where i realized i was going to be very wealthy and i start looking at cars and houses
i get this feeling of like the feeling you described with your old house which is i think if i get this i'll actually feel
poorer in some way i'll lose something like if i and then i thought to myself well if i get this one
what's next if you get a lamborghini aventador the the best [ __ ] sports what's next and then i was like i'm
gonna just keep go and then me realizing that if i if i always start believe that my happiness was somewhere else in a
promotion in a new car in a big house it will never be here if i believe that i can't possibly be
happy because i don't have x i will never be happy because once i get x it's like a mirage or a rainbow it
just moves out further in front of you yeah and you see that with a lot of celebrities a lot of musicians like talented people that get everything so
young you know they get to that point where they start you know they go into depression and anxiety and it can you know manifest in drug addiction or
you know all kinds of things but yes if you're constantly looking for the next thing or almost living in the past with old
memories and what you used to have like you talk about down contrasting and up contrasting like that thing you said
changed my life just thinking stop thinking about what you did last year how you went to america and you went to coachella think about what you're doing today and
not worrying about that and it really just brings you to a it's like a medita it's like a meditation it's a thought a simple thought where you can
actually start to bring yourself back to the moment and like like i said i it could be a quote it could be a podcast it could be an
interview little things just sometimes it opens up a whole new thought process isn't it and you start to think actually you know
what that's amazing and also i interviewed fern cotton and she said one of these lovely quotes is
nothing in nature blooms all year round you know where we're constantly i need number one podcast i need the number one app i need to have
um you know the best book i need everything's got me number one i need to be doing everything every month for the year but i've realized that
in nature like nothing blooms all year round and that again made me realize it's okay to have quiet months and not be in the media
chill out relax because something good will come late on a year you'll bloom again and during summer and i think so little things like that
really open up my mind and i'm evolving quickly i think since i become a parent as well um you start to
be much more empathetic and you start to understand and you feel a lot more when you've got kids i don't know where it comes from but
i'm i think a lot more about other people's feelings now more than i ever used to i actually wrote down um when i was
watching your video that you did during the lockdown where you start discussing your own mental health and you saying i've just watched boris's announcement
and i'm feeling really [ __ ] but in that video you also say i'm feeling [ __ ] at the thought that
there's loads of families out here that are going to lose their jobs and stuff and i wrote in my notes right like incredibly empathetic like
you are incredibly empathetic and it kind of it made me question like where did he get that from because that is a trait i noticed in you last time as
well most people in the middle of a lockdown when they just found out that we're going into our second lockdown don't think oh my
god all these other people that are going to lose their jobs and you i could see it in your face and i know you're a genuine guy because i've
been with you we've gone for dinner you know outside of the podcast i know who you are i'm like he genuinely genuinely cares i
think it's grown him i think that feeling has grown in me but where i used to be like you know when you're a teenager you're a young adult it's all about you it's like me me
me and then you you know you find a partner and you start to realize it's about your partner and it's about your kids but i think yeah like the more i realize
that we're all connected it's that thing of connection you know it comes from sometimes a meditation or a feeling of like
we're all we're all in the same experience and you know i've had i've been very lucky like the
body coach brand has grown you know my youtube audience has grown like the sign ups of the planet it's all gone insane and so i think
about other people in small business i genuinely care about fact i think about families that have run like restaurants
for 30 years or had you know properties or had like amazing nightclubs or you know amazing restaurants that are
suddenly going under like that it affects me and that really when i stop and think about all the pain and suffering in the world it
really brings me down it really kind of brings my energy down and then i have to kind of exercise or do something positive because i start to
feel a bit sad because that is the world right now you know there's billions of people that are going for a really difficult time
and so my reaction to that is trying to inspire them to move to eat well to exercise because i know that it
can counteract any kind of you know financial pressures or stress that's going on if you exercise and you lift your energy
and you and you put good food in your body you know even temporarily you're going to feel better and it's going to change your mind so
that's my gift you know i try and inspire people to exercise and feel good for you know even if it's once a day or once
a week it's enough to change the way you feel about yourself and your life we went from a little dinner a couple a
couple of months back i don't know i think just after the first lockdown before the second one um and
i was i came home really inspired on one end but just i couldn't shake this thought and i i
hate to go back to it but i couldn't shake this idea that you just had the biggest achievement of your life
with this p i mean outside of your kids in my opinion um out with this p with joe format that
just shook just spread across the world right and the joe i met at that dinner was
somewhat despondent as you say like confused and um as you say like really unsure
about why you weren't feeling on top of the world and also really unsure about what you do next to
to kind of like top that i guess and it really stayed with me it stayed with me for like a couple of
weeks what did you think do you think i'd be more like energetic and and and proud and like ambitious or what
every every person on planet earth would have thought okay so joe set out to achieve something and he smashed it out
the park he is on all of the tv stations congratulations on the mbe by the way that's a whole nother conversation we'll
get to that mad he smashed everything at the park
um he's got to be just absolutely buzzing we were sat at the dinner and there's people coming up to us
asking you for pictures halfway through the dinner as well but you weren't like that and even though i've written about this in my
book at great length about gold medal syndrome and gold medal depression and my own experiences i still when i saw that in you i was
like [ __ ] people need to hear about this because you were i'll be honest right
that was the lowest i've ever seen you really oh yeah i suppose i i was concerned no i mean
look i was i was really looking forward to seeing you and i was it was i was you know we hadn't been out for a while but i think coming off the back of that pee with joe
i was emotionally drained i think you know physically i can do workouts all day i've done it dude i've done a 24-hour workout like i
can move my body but i think the energy of performing like going on stage stepping in front of the camera
when i wasn't in the mood for it when i had to like pick up every i was literally carrying everyone's emotion and energy and trying to and i
do believe in energy that we carry and we push it and we sometimes hold negative energy we sometimes hold things locked up from years ago and
i was just i suppose fatigued emotionally fatigued at that point but i've bounced back you know i'm back in the zone i'm filming workouts
again and i'm um i'm refocused like i said on the on the purpose and the mission which is like
fitness rule and i've got the app is one option i've got the books there's one option but then also instagram youtube you know there's so
much free content because i don't want anyone to feel like the body coaches premium brand and i can only get him through that paid
subscription no i'm still gonna give you one workout a week on youtube and i'm still gonna do my instagram recipes i'm still gonna
share my daily stories and motivate you um and every now and again i might mention the app but it really is
just like for people that want to give it that extra push you know and try something a bit different so as we park pee with joe you know last
Goals going forwards
time you sat down here you put out into the world your your goal your ambition and it came true
so i think you know let's tempt again uh what is your what is your goal and ambition now going forward in
terms of your purpose well i think what i what what happened i achieved was a short-term thing you know
it changed behaviors but they had to they had to do it because they were locked in parents had to keep their kids moving um
you know schools weren't providing pee everything was closed so it was a temporary thing it was the start of a movement but it's
the legacy is still continuing that movement you know continuing to visit schools continuing to speak to
heads and i don't see it as a government thing because i've realized that you can actually just speak to local schools and they have the ability to change their
curriculum well they have to follow the curriculum but they can change their timetable so if they want to fit a 15-minute workout
in once a day with their children or do it um you know at the end of the day they have the ability so again it's about continuing to grow that
mission to create content maybe it's a separate platform which schools can use but it isn't over because like anything
motivation drops it might it drops for me it drops for you um different times of the year and with young people
they're very engaged at the early ages in primary school but when they start hitting their teens they're in the devices they become more
resistant to exercise so the challenge becomes tougher as they get older so my mission now is to continue the
school's work when i can go on the road start visiting schools again creating content you know
i'm hopefully creating a tv show around that you know like jamie over school dinners was only six episodes in my head
it felt like it was weeks and months and months of content so you know i want to do the same thing i want to create a really amazing series
whether it's um you know netflix or bbc or channel 4 where i can continue that conversation to get one teacher or one dinner lady or
one um head of a school to believe in the power of exercise for their children so i really feel like i've just started
there's so much more to go i think you have as well and you know so like we what one thing i've learned from doing this podcast and
speaking to guests like you is that and even eddie hearn who we had on last week is how pivotal and how defining
our early years are and you are like a really fascinating guy in so many ways we talked about your empathy
Your childhood
your achievements um all of these things suggest that you're because they're such
extraordinary things or out of the ordinary things suggest that you probably had quite an
out of ordinary childhood whenever whenever i meet someone uh who is achieved out of ordinary things i
always think okay tell me about your childhood so how was your childhood joe oh so you think you don't think it was a stable
child do you think they were saying a bit more that motivated me to yeah i think i think um and it
doesn't necessarily mean it was like a really bad childhood or a good childhood i always you know and i actually did childhood psychology for two years which
people don't know about this is why i'm so fascinated by like all the freudians um psychology and and how one thing that happened
i've got a friend who told me that one thing that happened when he was a kid he still remembers to the day to this
day and he holds that one comment that someone in his family made to him as the reason for his
probably his single biggest flaw in his personality and it was just one comment on one day from a parent yeah
that's that's that's amazing and that's the power of um yeah the power of a negative thought like if someone says
your teeth are a bit crooked or you've got skinny legs like someone could say you've got lovely teeth your whole life but you still think your teeth are
crooked yeah and that's happened to me in the past i got invisalign because one a girlfriend said to me you know your teeth are a bit wonky really you
know and and someone said about you know this is a true story when i was 16 i had glasses but i was really embarrassed i
was really shy about it and the girl i was going out and said i said something like i wonder if i'd look good in glasses and she
she said oh no you'd look silly in glasses so i never wore them for two or three years i just hide them in my car
drive to our house take them out and you know it's that thing of we really take on these these thoughts and
it can really affect our confidence and that definitely definitely happened to me as a kid but i suppose
my childhood was very chaotic you know it was very unstable my dad was a drug addict from a very
young age so you know that was it was a bit like you know he was there one minute next minute he was in rehab next minute he was he was back
on the gear you know and he my mum would take him back and it was all good and then they'd be arguing and you know i lived in a council flat with
um really thin doors so it was like um it's like plywood and so
there used to be holes in the wall there's be holes in the door because i remember um i need to think why are there holes in
the door like and i look back now i know it's because mum and dad used to fight and argue and you know it'd be like it was a symbol of aggression and
impatience and intolerance and then it'd be gone and so i always i didn't have a positive role model in
terms of in terms of a male and also when it comes to marriage you know my mum and dad never got married if they were married they would have been divorced a
hundred times so i had similar beliefs around marriage and commitment to you like to hear you
talking about it like i i suppose i had the same feelings when i was 25 i didn't believe that people stay together people are
committed that marriage is going to work that you know people get through tough time because it was always like when it got
[ __ ] and tough my dad would piss off and we'd be back on our own again so you know again it was a tough childhood
but also i had a happy childhood i didn't i don't feel like resentment i don't look back and be like i wish it was different i wish my dad was there
because we got a great relationship today but it definitely affected me you know the destruction of drugs in my household
and what came with that all the chaos really put me off ever wanting to smoke weed or drink
alcohol you know i was so scared that i was going to enjoy it and i was going to become an addict i thought it was a genetic thing i thought i don't want to be a drug addict so i wouldn't go near
it so it definitely um it definitely shaped me you know and when i look at where my love and generosity and empathy
comes from it's my mom like my mom is she's so kind and loving and she's so always putting other people first and i
think that definitely shaped me as an adult i didn't actually know this stuff about you before i didn't know
that you'd been through such a um traumatic early childhood and as you were saying that i was thinking
[ __ ] hell it's remarkable that you are who you are and that you have such feelings of empathy and you're just
such a kind human being having gone through such a you know violent and traumatic
childhood and i guess that is credit to your mum um i suppose yeah i look back when i get
asked in interviews now like where where did your generosity and your kindness come from and your kind of desire to want to help others it's about
help you know i'm happiest when i'm helping others so if i know i'm helping someone or i'm helping millions
i'm really happy and so when it when it stops i felt i'm not i'm not i'm not i haven't got my purpose i'm not
valuable but i've realized i am still valuable i'm still helping people um but yeah my mum you know she left
school at 15 no qualifications she met my dad in a squat she had my brother when she was 17. then she had
nikki she had me when she was 19. she's like a kid and when we used to go play she's like people she says that your sister
she looks so young you can't imagine like um but somewhere along the line she taught me value she taught me respect
you know if i had to be home at 10 o'clock on a friday night i was home at ten o'clock my mates were down apart till one two
for him because their parents let him run loose and they were the ones graffiti and they were the ones smoking weed they were the ones that got in you know in trouble for
you know crimes and whatnot so my mum was really considering she wasn't parented her dad
left her when she was a kid she was she was a banner when she was a baby so i don't know where her love comes from but she's got this
ability to just love and and be so generous and when she went to university she went back she said i want to study
she she went to become a social worker so the first thing she'd done with her life was going to help people that you know young offenders people that had
been through abuse and and all this stuff so it has to come from her it's a motive it's my mum so when i took my mom for
dinner um the night before it was going to be announced and i said to her like we're celebrating my birthday tonight
aren't we because it's we we were having a late birthday there but it's something else yeah miami and i said mom um i've got an
mba and she we're in the middle of lucky cat restaurant in london and she burst into tears and i'm like
in the middle of the restaurant crying with her and she's like when she was younger like all her friends used to say you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] parent imagine the
pride and it is it's she raised me like i have to put it down to her you talked about your dad then said you
said that you've um after all that you'd been through and all you'd observed and his addiction and his battles with addiction you've got a
good relationship with him now yeah we we do because you know addiction never goes away like
he's you know he does his na meetings it's a part of his life but he he needs that he needs to have a
fellowship and a network of people to talk to like i don't understand addiction i've never been addicted to anything so for me it's like
it he needs that that network of people he can talk to and that's obviously the moment mostly through zoom but usually it's like n a meetings
you know you go and have a talk and you you feel better and he's had you know he had therapy but you know he's learned he's he's became he's evolved like again like
his dad left him and i understand my mom and dad because they went through so much trauma my mom was
abandoned when she was two years old was living in a she was in a um you know an orphanage
and then my dad the same thing he's that left him like he didn't have you know he didn't ever say i think i
don't think my dad's dad told him he loved him until he was like on his deathbed when he had cancer so like i understand where that addiction why my
dad chose to like do that with his life and i understand why my mum had ocd like because i know what she
went through as a kid i know what she went through as a young teenager and so you start to understand it and then you start to really love your parents even
more because they protect you when you're a kid they're just protection they can't tell you what they went through they can't tell you this stuff so it really like
makes you realize how much trauma they've had and where that's manifested
and so now like my relationship my dad is i understand him i understand that he he has seasonal depression during the winter he's really low and he'll have a
holiday and he feels great and he comes back and he's up and down and that's him and i just have to kind of love him and although i'm quite
consistent with my emotions and you want everyone around you to be happy all the time don't you think i'll buy him a motorbike i
send them to the maldives or you can go and stay at my house in america it's all temporary it's all it doesn't do a lot you know so real
connection comes from like communicating reaching out spending spending time with him like he's happy when he comes around and we
go for a walk or we got on our skateboards together you know we've got electric skateboards so it's about reconnecting and being with
him and he he needs that my dad needs to see the grandkids he needs to see my brothers he needs to see me and um
yeah i've just learned that like i said that really nice quote that the the antidote to addiction is
connection not push him away i hate you i can't stand it why are you relapsing again why are you going into depression
you know the mind's really complex and you have to understand that people aren't going to always be how you want to be and you
have to love them unconditionally but if you ask me as a teenager i would be too angry i'd be like [ __ ] that no like i can't deal with it i
don't have a dad but that's a drug i don't speak to him i wouldn't have had the emotional um ability to deal with that but now as an
ad i'm 35 and i can understand it a bit more a little crazy because um i love that
quote by the way and it i think johanna hari is a real uh sort of yeah i think i've got his book on the
shelf behind me about lost connection from yeah that's yeah i think russell brand mentioned it to me and i thought wow that's such a nice thought
and that's what the book is about it's about the real reasons for depression and anxiety fundamentally stem back to a loss of connection of some sort
and it was telling when you were telling your story about the generational sort of cycle that's going on there your mother's you know your dad and her
upbringing and then your father's dad and how like it was a lack of connection it seems
that put them into the situations they were in and then that lack of connection made them a certain way which then nearly made
you treat them with a lack of connection as well and i think it seems like much of the
reason you're able to break the cycle is because you've realized that and you're like as you say bringing
bringing him close despite you know i talk about this a lot with my friends that have um an estranged parent or have lost a
parent and i always tell them i was doing it this week i was saying you've got to forgive them for
their own faults because their faults have come from some kind of trauma and tony robbins
says it as well he says you've got sometimes we've got to forgive our parents for being imperfect not being the parents we hoped they were yeah
it's so true and like you said you you know memories memories can form like your literally
change your characteristics and your personality and your belief system and i had really negative beliefs around commitment around um
you know people being faithful people sticking together like when things got tough to people and even i'd be affected if like
celebrities that i really loved like they'd break up i'd think see that even they can't stay together i just thought no one stays together no
one's loyal no one's no one's ever like actually happily married and stays together but now as a married man with two kids who i love
i'm really really like i don't believe that i believe that you can be happy i believe that when i see an old couple on the bench you know 78 year old couple
i love that i think how amazing they've spent their life together i want to be like that i want to be a couple that are stuck together so
it's you know my child has affected my um my my love and commitment as a as a relate in a relationship to
rosie but also as a parent like i don't want to be impatient and intolerant and snappy and swear and shout but
that is my default setting that's what my head's trying to do when indian miley screaming at me i want to slam the door and walk out the
house or i want to scream and shout back at him because that's what i that's what i had as a kid so i have to actively work against that so
although i might be screaming in my head i just take a breath and i like almost just sort of um yeah just take a
moment to just sort of calm myself and then i can react very differently but that is a that's a muscle you have to train it
because otherwise i'd just be screaming and shattering all day long you know so that's definitely it's hard
to do that when you've had it all your life when you just got you know screamed that shouted at it's just it's like what you know it's
default it's a default yeah like it truly is like a it's like a computer program and you have to sort of try and undo that code um and i read a
book called um calm calm parents happy happy kids and it's that thing you can either fight
flight or or pause and have a breath you can fight and swear and shout and scream and slam the door you can
run out of the house and just deal with it and let them deal with it and just not even deal with any emotion and show no emotional control or you can
pause and have a breath and that's the secret it's just having that right in these two years old her brain is not rational she
can't understand why i really want to just clean the side and put her down on the floor right now and so like you've got to literally remind
yourself every time and then you can start to really respond differently we're all human you have days where you
you get it i have days like i mean course i have days where i shout and i lose the plot and i feel terrible but also i know that
she won't hold it against me like the amount of times i was showered at i i love my mum to death so it's not like
she shouted at me i think she's terrible and i don't love her for today like i think it's okay to not be perfect not be a perfect
parent and the other dad had a row of rose and i said i'm i'm sorry i'm not perfect every day i'm sorry that some days i'm surprised
rosie's my wife i said i'm i'm i'm sorry that i'm not perfect every i love you so much i'm so
affectionate and sensitive but if i'm stressed and i've got something gone sometimes i'm snappy sometimes i'm impatient and
i don't shout the kids i might shout at you and i'm sorry and it's nice to say that out loud and have
a bit of a chat about it because then you kind of move on and you can just you know get on with it and you learn from it you're getting busier right with
the app coming with the app stuff you're doing you're getting more requests than ever before surely dude i'm so i've this has been the year
like i've i mean i've worked hard really over the last years you know during the growing stage like with social media you know it's hard building
You must be really busy
an audience and then i kind of had great success with the books and now like you know this a year
since p with joe um the 24-hour challenge i i then done wake up with joe which is three workouts a week for a lockdown two
because i thought they need to exercise people need to move i'm i've now had the book pr i've been doing radio interviews i've
done the channel for so the bbc children need 24 hour channels i've not stopped like i don't know how i'm still
going but i now at this moment need more energy than ever because this is the busy time this is like leading up to christmas i'm also doing a
january bootcamp five days a week i'm doing live workouts through the app you know which is great because it means people are going to go
i want to give it a go and it's a really amazing way of marketing the product but i'm going to be exhausted if you think about your state and your mood and how
you feel within yourself in the midst of all this like chaos and then we've got the pandemic rattling on outside as well
what impact has it had on you um all of this busyness and now you've got
two kids you know that are you growing up and screaming at you and don't want to be put down
have you felt a change i deal with it in different ways like usually i have these like blocks where i'll i work for like two three months and then
i go right i'm gonna go to santa monica for a few weeks so let's go and have a nice week in dubai just to unwind and leave the phones and
stuff and i've missed that i've missed that just that reset button because i've had a i'd like a couple of days away um just
when lockdown was over but it wasn't enough because i actually spent my time filming workouts because i said i was gonna do
three workouts a week so although i was there relaxing i'm still there and my what i do is so physical like
you know being being physical and doing exercise but also doing if such an amazing energy through the camera is so draining but
last week has been the most emotionally draining i was doing like radio interviews with um
like jamie oliver and ricky gervais and uh doing all these things i'm it's out of my comfort zone completely
and then i had phone calls every every hour on the hour to promote the new book so that is a different type of emotion and
when we talk about the body code so you know i am the physical body like the energy and nikki is like the cto he's the
brains he takes all the stuff all the things i can't the process stuff nikki's on a laptop doing zoom calls nine hours a day like managing this
agency and all the other marketing stuff so together we have this perfect kind of relationship where
we are working as equally as hard but we're taking we're doing what we can do sure so i don't feel like burning out
but i do think at the end of january i need to block a month out so i've taken the month off hoping to go you know somewhere nice
like i love costa rica i'd love to go with the kids amazing you know just just just unwind and basically when i have that time
down off the offline and i'm not filming it really re-energizes me when i come back i'm like i'm like resetting like
body coach volume 2 ready to go again sort of thing you talked a little bit there about marriage earlier and you've also
you've also heard me on this podcast talking about marriage right i want you to tell me where i i'm getting it wrong yeah and
also why you think i'm getting it wrong so i listened to two episodes of your podcast and i i really hear i hear myself and you when
Marriage, tell me where Iâm going wrong
i was like 25 and i was a lot and i feel i feel like a part of you is lost because you've got everything on the surface you could
possibly want you've you've smashed it in business like you've got an amazing story and you've got you know incredible success which is
wonderful but there's maybe you're missing that deeper connection with one person you know you've got amazing friends and you've got a great network of people you
work but i do feel like the love between one person you know it's different it's a different kind of relationship but you
can always lean on them so when i was 25 i was in a relationship from 19 and i really i was running away i
couldn't commit to i didn't i used to say like exactly what you were like this marriage is like this
religious thing it's a contract and why should that person get half of what i've gotten what it's not gonna work all my other
friends are unhappy they're all divorced you know one in three marriages so the more you tell yourself that the more it becomes true and the truth is
how you feel now is how you feel and what you believe now is what you believe but when you meet someone and you you
realize and when you do fall in love in whatever sense that could be it was almost like with rosie i was telling her every day i
loved her and it wasn't enough it was i needed to tell her more i needed to have something
stronger between us so i said can we have a baby you know then she felt pregnant we had indie so for me in my head the ultimate
bond between two humans and he's another child and then when she was pregnant i never thought i would get excited about the
idea of like proposing and getting married but it was just it just changed my mind has changed
as i started to think you know i love this girl i don't want to be waking up you know every other week with a different girl
in a different hotel i'm like that's not who i have been and it's never who i'll be so i love being with i love being close
to one person i think i'm quite um emotional right there um and then after to marry me we had this amazing wedding day and
i do love being mad and i just think when you have kids and you start seeing your children grow and you
you see how wonderful that can be how much joy they bring you i just think your perspective will change over time and you're just not there yet it might you
might not get that till you're 35 you could be 45 i was 30. i met rosie at 30. okay and
i've been the happiest since i turned 30. honestly i've just been i'm commit because being being honest
and being committed is two of the most wonderful things being sneaky being deceitful not being honest or being
jealous and insecure they're feelings you do not want to go through your life with so when you find someone you know be
committed and be loyal it's a really it really takes your love to another level you believe in the you know there's a bunch of words people use in
uh in this in this realm of like love and marriage uh they say you know you gotta find your soul mate i don't
know if it's soulmate but everyone says oh hard you know loves hard work marriage is hard work it isn't
it doesn't have to be hard work not if you're with the right person of course you could get with someone too young marry the wrong person it all goes wrong
and you know that's a bad experience but it doesn't mean that the next relationship won't be better and you can't improve and learn from it
but you know i do feel like rosie is is the kind of female version of me like when we met you know we were just having
so much fun and she's she's a wonderful parent i watch her and i see how patient she is i think i learn a lot from her because
i i've got like a two or three minute kind of tolerance of marley screaming and screaming in my face where i just have
to walk out the room i just can't handle it whereas she can be in there like 20 minutes all through the night and i'm like because
yeah with indie crying or marley teething i think it's amazing she's just got this natural
innate like motherly patience and love and tolerance so i watch that and i literally like go i need a bit more of
that and i sort of learn from it but yeah i mean you know maybe maybe you might have one relationship last five
years but i do believe that when you are in a relationship like give it all don't don't be thinking this is going to end soon this
my last one didn't work out i know now it's going to break down and we're going to end up breaking apart we're gonna end up leaving each other
she'll have an affair i'll i'll leave her it won't work that just it's hard to be happy in that situation so i think take every
relationship and just maximize it to the best of your ability like you would with
someone that you were of a business partner if we went into business together you're trying to try and make that partnership so like
awesome and so effective and efficient and it's the same with a relationship you've got you know keep keep
keep doing the things that make you happy and and yeah i think with rosie like just having a night out going for
dinner um and the you know the secret is if you stop kissing you're [ __ ] if you don't kiss your girlfriend and
you stop kissing you just bypass each other and you don't because everything starts from a kiss i mean
it could become a massage it could become you know you might do a bit of hanky-panky but if you stop
kissing that one thing that intimacy i feel like i feel like everything breaks down seriously
can you kiss him it's one of the it's probably the only thing that i've thought about going and seeing a therapist about is
like i have a fairly negative pessimistic let's say
perception on romantic relationships um and i think i've identified that
on one hand i'm my expectations are probably like somewhat unm unmutable and then on the
other hand i kind of see relationships as being like a bird in a cage is the best way where does that come
from like so i know your mom and dad and they're arguing at each other my parents that's the only th that's the only
marriage role model in your your base and your opinion on yeah so i i have these v but when i say my parents screamed at
each other i'm like my mum i've never seen since a human able to
perform this screaming match she did nigerian woman if you don't know nigerian women i do visualize it like around the
kitchen table the sound is un like you've never seen my dad actually said one day he said i your mom was
screaming at me this is i think when we lived in manchester probably before i was born your mum was screaming at me and i went
out like went shopping did all that she had no idea i came back and she's still screaming she had no idea that i'd left
the house and the the the the sound of it i i have this like mental image of my
dad sat passively just this like passive white guy just sat there watching tv just looking at the screen
and my african mother like kind of stood above him just bellowing into his face at full volume for like six
hours she didn't lose energy we talked about like exhausting yourself she didn't lose her energy and she would
follow him around the house and so i looked at my dad and thought he's trapped and this is what my you know that that
experience of seeing your mum shout is that effect is that like affected your you know your
you know when you argue are you confrontational are you like because me and rosie more like silent tree and we sulk and we're so stubborn and we'll
like go two days without talking we don't scream and shout each other you are you quite shallow i will never shout
i see you're calm never i will not do it i i will the minute so i will try and explain myself in a very
calm way and then i'm like okay i'm going right away i will like do you ever say sorry do you ever admit you're wrong
or do you find it hard for me so if you'd asked me that question two years ago the answer would have been like no i
never say sorry like because i always kind of think i'm right and it's like my way or the highway in the last year and when i was i got
with this certain person um who i won't name and she kind of taught me to like grow up a
little bit and and i started to apologize for things and i started to learn to apologize a
little bit more but i'm i've got to be honest i'm not going to lie it's like the whole point of this podcast is not to [ __ ] lie like i'm still not that good at it it is hard
i'm the same i find it hard to say sorry in the moment but i do if i go away for a little half an hour an hour have a walk or do a
workout i do come back and i go i was a bit disrespectful there i do apologize but yeah it's an ego thing it's like you just gotta let your guard
down one thing i say about relationships which i really think is valuable i can't remember where i heard it i read it but it was about
you can be in a relationship with someone and this expectation thing where you want them to do everything perfect and be everything in one and be like this
amazing like just like unicorn right but you might find them really attractive and really
funny but intellectually they just don't challenge you just you can't have conversations about what they don't understand you but you can ring me or nicky and we you can
get that that that that part of a relationship with from someone else so there's no pressure on that person you're with to like be really
intelligent really understand business and really understand social media like that's something i've learned that sometimes you have to love the person of
what they've got you know love they're they're really affectionate love that they're really caring considerate but maybe other elements of their
personality you have to get from someone else because the chances of you finding the unicorn it's so rare isn't it
that you're going to find that and also you like you might be amazing at certain things but you might not be good at one yeah i'm not a unicorn this is the
problem who is he from no wonder no one's a unicorn really no one's completely perfect because
when you're in a relationship you want the other person to like you know do everything like you and it'd be interesting the same things you
like rosie's not into you know motorbikes but i got my brother and my my my little brother george and
my dad so i kind of get i scratch that itch and i come back and then i spend time with rosie and the kids so it's
really about finding the needs that you need as a human being in in maybe in multiple people and then
you can really just focus on what you love about your partner it does help you talk to a little i
talked a little bit about that about going to therapy have you ever gone to therapy so this week i had my deadline for my
book happy sexy millionaire which you can now pre-order and it's been an absolute
labor of love over the last couple of years and because i had the deadline on sunday i was head
down smashing it out um typically like me forgetting to
eat my meals and things like that and um and this is where he all saved me once again and i was in my office until 6 a.m
in the morning i was getting very very tired i had two heels and um i had dinner as well and it's for
me that was the perfect that was the reason why i've teamed up with huel because someone like me in that situation would
basically either completely skip meals i would not get my sort of vitamins and minerals i wouldn't get protein
then i'd start feeling like [ __ ] um because i didn't have the time and that's as i've said in this
podcast before the reason i've um i'm so attached to huell the company the brand the
the founder julian because it really does save my ass and it has done for three years and if you ask someone like
me you know that does have uh a very time limited life then i really really
recommend you give huel a shot i really recommend you you give berry flavour huel a shot because that
is my favorite flavor and um yeah so this week i just wanted to shout out because you definitely saved me on sunday
when i had my book deadline and also go and check out my book happy sexy millionaire it's quite nice it's like um
yeah it's nice i talked a little bit about that about
going to therapy have you ever gone to therapy i call it the gym but yeah i think my therapy from a kid and i look back
like for sure like i was stressed i didn't want to go home i would be always out the house always
playing sport i think it was my therapy and i dealt with things through sport and maybe that's why i became the body coach but i think
Therapy
i had um i had one therapy session with a counselor at once um because i was basically in a
relationship i didn't want to be in and i needed to talk to someone about it and i had that session and i i just
spoke and and verbalized everything i was going through and it was almost like just by saying i was like i know i need to walk away from
this now and i i went home and that was it so it was a re it was an investment it was like an hour of my time
um i i spoke to someone because it wasn't my mum who's invested my dad who has invested it wasn't her parents and
my friends who really cared about her it was like a completely neutral person and it really helped because it changed
the rest of my life because i left a relationship i wasn't happy in i met rosie i got married and i had kids
you know and this is the situation i was 19 when i met that girl i was backpacking i was in a bar in australia you're very different
10 years later so maybe maybe there can be such thing as a relationship that's really great at a certain time in your
life but then when it's not right and it isn't working having a child and marrying that person is definitely the wrong thing to do
and i didn't really realize that until i met rosie just how how unhappy i probably was in that last
relationship so yeah i've had it once and i think if i n if i feel like i need it i'd be open to
it i've got a lot of friends that do it it's like i see it as like personal training for the mind isn't it it's like why not why not take care of your brain
and your heart and your mind and that can be done through therapy so i'm open to it um i just haven't felt i haven't had the
calling i'm more interested in um i really like the idea of doing an ios ceremony can we do it together do you
know why i'm just i listen to your podcast i listen to like certain people that do it and i i'm drawn to it because of that gateway
Psychedelics & mental health
and opening up that even more love and more connection when you realize we're all so interconnected and
obviously you can meditate for 10 years or you can go and do an rsc ceremony and apparently you get it's like a fast track
to that feeling but yeah you've talked about it have you have i mean i was in mexico and tulum and they they were doing like peyote
ceremonies out there and i i just couldn't quite convince enough to do it but i would love to do ayahuasca one day like go proper into the amazon do it
properly with a shaman and like you know feel feel that mother nature they talk about that feeling of like the earth and
that are connected to the human race it must be a wonderful feeling have you ever done mushrooms i've never done mushrooms now i've never
i've never done drugs so i couldn't really um i've never done anything like that i've never done mushrooms or ayahuasca but i
the more sorry i've just i've just invested almost a million dollars into a psychedelic company that's using it to
kill men's health disorders we talked about this didn't we yeah for the psilocybin so my dad was involved in the trials um the imperial
college london he's involved he was basically um one of the uh not the guinea pigs but yeah he
it was a trial between psilocybin um a placebo and an antidepressant drugs and obviously the the studies come back that
like this can really help and it's a natural it's a natural product from the from the earth so yeah i can see that
growing in the next few years for sure when it when it gets appropriate has it been approved in the u.s for like yes it's impression and stuff um don't
quote me on this but uh it's an it's in the final stage of fda approval psilocybin so it's very very
close and there's a company called compass pathways which has just gone public and is as of right now worth about two billion
which is really dive sort of leading the pack and developing psilocybin but it's crazy that i've not tried it but
i've looked at all the research and development videos and studies and data and it like blow blew my mind are you are you
tempted to try yourself are you scared and nervous about it cause i know the numbers i've been through i've looked at every drug and i've seen
where mushrooms and psilocybin um rank in terms of the harm they could possibly do to you and the harm they can
do to others when you're on them it's below alcohol it's blown like every it's at the bottom it's the bottom thing on the list
yeah it's been shown to really um really help with addiction and depression and trauma from that so
yeah i suppose i wonder what experience about for us who maybe we're not depressed and we're not anxious i wonder what that experience would be like but
yeah you know i listened to a lot of podcasts you know tim ferriss is big on it rogan you know yeah
it's just kind of it feels like this scary thing but it's because it's been going on for thousands of years you know we've kind of tribes and
it's not some dirty chemical drugs been manufactured in the lab i think it it's non-addictive it opens up so what
they say is it opens up like neurological pathways that maybe is all these memories locked did you hear the tim ferriss podcast he said
like he'd done an ayahuasca ceremony or maybe it was psilocybin and he had this vision of trauma that came
through that he completely blocked out really yeah so he got he experienced them child abuse like he
literally didn't remember it and he had this vision and all these memories of being abused and it like completely like
opened up his mind he's now obviously sharing about it but that was like something so it's quite in a way you don't know
what you're unlocking you can unlock really beautiful memories and amazing things like it can also show you like
quite traumatic upsetting things but either way like you can learn from it i think you know what i did this morning is the
the the founder one of the founders of the company a thai um which is leading the charge in
terms of psychedelics they're really developing about 10 different compounds in the space i i said to him i need to get you on
this podcast would you come on and so he's he's um as far as i know he's an incredibly successful biotech guy he's been doing
it for decades and um he's going to come onto the podcast and really talk through all of these things so like ibogaine and psilocybin
and all of that so that would be interesting fascinating i've been listening to that one yes but listen ayahuasca
mushrooms psilocybin if you want to do it then i've been saying to my all these people in this room now
i would say let's go and do a retreat with like a shaman and um they've told me what the best way to do
it is like the best retreat the best shaman the best place i'd love to do something like that yeah i would be up for it i mean it's
it's a real person it's like personal growth like you read a lot of books i'm not well read i wish i had more patience and
more time and well i wish i had more um commitment and discipline to reading but i do i do i'm drawn to it and it always
it almost they say like it will call you like my dad's i've done an eyewash or someone in wales and he said it just calls you like the plant mother
nature like you'll have a calling one day and it'll be like i'm ready at the moment we're just sort of experimenting with the idea of it and
your dad did the psilocybin trial with imperial so what was his feedback to you after he did it yeah i mean it was um
it sometimes takes a little bit longer to integrate you know you have the experience and you know it's in a very controlled room
like it's in a proper like clinical setting so you're like in a hospital room and they're holding your hand and talking through it and i'm not sure the exact dosage but he got
blasted with a decent dose of psilocybin um and yeah you know he saw some things and it unlocked a little bit of
you know trauma and some visual stuff that he saw but again it's just about moving forward it's about it's about taking what you
see and integrating into your life and saying i've had these experiences but how can i be present today how can i enjoy
my life today and you know with depression is i don't think it's going to be cured i don't think you can cure it like that
because of the way the brain works but you're going to learn to deal with it and and spot the signs and kind of counteract it
quicker um but yeah he had a positive experience for sure and he's he's really proud that he took part because he
he genuinely wants to help people like he said if if people can come off chemical antidepressants and be given a
really beautiful natural um you know natural product that can actually help them feel happier and
especially for that post-traumatic stress syndrome disorder like people dealing with some really really harsh stuff and they're getting
blasted with you know antidepressants which are very addictive and it's like morphine isn't it it's like it's not even
it's not even like good for you so they're very addictive as well i don't think you're going to get the same thing yeah the side effects are really really you know crazy um
sometimes i think that opioids i think the opioids yeah antidepress i think opioid i think antidepressants are like opioids
or amphetamines it's one of them it's like it's basically the drug that you know you do not want to be taking in a very small dose but over time it can
real generate real addiction and you see it in america like the prescription drug addiction over there is is really destroying people's lives over
there my next question you would have heard this on the podcast if you've listened to the eddie hearn one uh it's kind of a new question i'm
asking and it's a question i really really love because i think it gives a unique sense of perspective um you're an incredibly busy guy you're
If you were to die today what would you regret
running around at the moment doing this that and the other you know all over the place um if you found out god forbid touch
glass um that this week was your last week for whatever reason god forbid or you walked
out here and you got hit by a truck what what would you regret
having not done or not doing more of i really wish i had like this long list of
bucket things i wish i'd done but i'm i've always even when i was at university like i would
go traveling in my half term my summer holidays i always i've always maximized life to the
at that moment in time you know i've always i've never kind of i've never regretted or like missed out on things i've always
traveled with my friends i've always you know done the things i want so if i had a week left on earth
i wouldn't really regret anything i'd be proud i'm proud of what i've achieved in this short time i'm 35 i feel like i've
i've been good i've done some good things i'd probably bring everyone together and like throw my wedding party again because my wedding day was wicked
like all you know your best friends and all your mate your mates and we had fun fair and we had all the food and we were
dancing and i think i'd try and recreate that if i knew i had seven days i'd get everyone together and say look it's my last week
come down let's have another blowout and have a party um but i wouldn't regret yeah i just really wouldn't i think
it's a shame to live your life like that you know regretting and wishing your child was different wishing you know you you i've and i've got
friends that kind of live in that mindset of always looking back and almost thinking about a moment in time if they just done it differently they
were like life would have been different today but you can't think like that you can't get stuck between the future and the past can you because that's really
really depressing whereas if you actually just think look i've done what i've done even the bad things and the times i
wasn't nice or disrespectful like i learned from it and today i'm a better person for it a lot of people
when you ask them that question they reflect on like a lack of balance in their life they'll say oh god i work too much i didn't see the kids enough and
and those kinds of things that's typically what you hear it's like you know i really wish i spent more time with this person or
or that person i think if i was to answer that question i'd probably feel i'd probably say that i'd say why didn't i spend enough time with my
family i think the reason is because a lot most traditional businesses like if you're a grafter eddie hearn always on the road always
around the world you know footballers again away every weekend they're training their you know traveling about musicians
away from their family and it's hard for like you know stability stability and so they do sacrifice a lot for that fame and
success whereas my fame and success has come through an iphone in my kitchen so i've really even before lockdown i
filmed all my workouts at home so i have a great balance where i can do what i'm doing and be successful but
also leave my phone for two weeks and go away and not not worry about it or i can you know put my phone down like i i spend
quality time my kids every day i'm adamant about that so i do you know breakfast i make them breakfast every day
i have two and a half hours so between like five and 7 30 where i don't have my phone and i do dinner time bath time but story
time like i love it it's like my routine and i know get one set down i can go back to work or you know watch a film
but it's having little moments at just having that structure so that you don't feel like you've missed out and you ask them how their day's been and indy's
favorite thing is like she loves cooking and she loves doing her handwriting so even just running in there and doing 10
minutes with handwriting with her i mean she's two years old and she's doing the alphabet she's she's got like these dots you follow the
dots and just seeing her with a shaky hand to like now a month later she's banging out the a to z and
it's like immaculate that's that's fun it's amazing so i'm not missing out on these moments although
i'm really busy i'm also optimizing my time with them as well if you know i mean when you said that india's really into cooking i thought
she's going to be the next body coach and then i thought oh god i wonder if joe would want her to be on social media oh i don't know i had this
dilemma with rosie you know when i was bringing out my cookbook my weaning 15 book so i got a book deal and i was genuinely enjoying that journey i
Social media
was learning to win indy for the first time i didn't know what to do i was working with a nutritionist and i shared so much you know we got 50
000 pre-orders and i worked hard for them pre-orders because i shared everything you know i shared the dinner i was it was camera
at breakfast it was camera at lunch it was indeed you like that darling do another one of them like so i shared so much in order to have
that success but now i've kind of i've just gone a little i just don't want the phone out during dinner time so
i'm producing less content i'm not producing as much recipe stuff because i want to have that
time just with us and i used to just film every gusto recipe every recipe was on instagram so yeah
i've had to sort of step back a little bit and there's no way you're going to keep your kids on social media it's just whether they're 10 or 15 they're going
to eventually get it but would you like to though if you could there's two buttons in front of you one of them was she won't
join social media until she's 21 and the other one was she'll join at 10. oh 100 no if i have if i could have my life
about social media like i have an unhealthy relationship with it and i you know i watched the social dilemma on netflix and i was like i
cannot believe how addictive we are how these devices are so well designed i would hunt i know
i wish me rosie and and the kids weren't on social media but i know i wouldn't have been the body coach p
which i wouldn't have happened so it's almost this like trade off it's like a trade of business life you want to have the success and
have this amazing life and also reach millions of people the only way you can do that is social media it's not tv it's not radio it's
social media so it has its pros and cons but i i hope that i hope that we kind of
we can somehow learn to control this mental health epidemic that we've got going on with social media and the
narcissism of instagram i just hope that we're trying to go actually you know what that was cool in 2010 and 2020 but maybe now let's be
more humble let's just be kinder and let's like share useful content do you know what i'm trying to say yeah because it could
you know india she's gonna get she's gonna get her phone she's gonna open it on that first day when she's 10 years old
and she's going to see kylie jenner in a bikini on a yacht in a louis
vuitton bikini on a massive yacht looking back at it with her ass looking perfect and perfect
boobs and a perfect face and perfect hair and india's gonna stare down into that phone and think
okay yeah what's my life yeah and it isn't it's that comparative thing and it it happens to me like i follow a lot of
instagram accounts and you know my explore page is basically like motorbikes or it's you know fitness models and it
it's like because i'm in that in that in that kind of atmosphere in that um world and it does you think oh these
guys are in such good shape you know i'm looking a bit skinny i'm a little bit positive like whoever you are you still start to compare yourself oh god
it affects your confidence whether you know it subconsciously or not and you know i wish i was more tanned i wish i was on holiday i wish i had a bit
more muscle with this i wish i wasn't so skinny or i wish i didn't have a little bit of body fat on my tummy this year because you
you're just bombarded with these visual representations so yeah i think that in that effect it almost like you
can't really stop that if you if you're looking at it all the time you can't it's almost like you have to just
unfollow someone's account you said didn't you said like unfollow the accounts that don't serve you yeah and i've started doing that if i get to
one and i go why did i follow that bang unfollowed you know what it is as well so i was when i wrote my i started writing well i
finished my book now but when i started writing the book um people are quite crazy at the time the title's happy sexy millionaire
and in this one chapter i really focus in on comparison and this is a bit of an exclusive and i
go through all of the studies on why we compare ourselves to other people and why we compare our
you know our car to someone else's car and the conclusion i came to is we're not actually gonna ever be able to stop
comparing because our brains are wired that way for survival they like that's how our brain works it's
very very lazy if you show someone three tvs in a shop an expensive one a middle one
and a a cheap one statistically people will pick the middle one because they think
that one's gonna break and it's [ __ ] that's the cheap one and they think the expensive one is maybe two flashes so it's just
if you show them three stakes on the menu statistically people will pick the one below the most expensive yeah you know even i actually when you
come to say that i sort of feel the same like i'll be like no i don't i don't need that you know the wagyu one because
i'm happy with a 20 pound one in the middle whatever yeah you're right it extends across everything if i said to you joe would you rather
um drive 10 minutes to save 10 pounds on a 200 pound jacket or drive 10 minutes to
save 10 pounds on a 20 20-pound jacket people go well i'll draw i'll save the 10 pounds on the temp
on the 10-pound jacket and you go why it's 10 minutes it's going to cost you to drive and you're going to save 10 pounds
but the rain is just assume it's like the very the conclusion yeah what's the summer
because i'd like to know what you're sharing about that the conclusion is that our brains are so so lazy they make such
lazy snap decisions and conclusions because those snap decisions helped us to survive when we
were when we were 10 000 years ago alliance running towards you you can't [ __ ] like right okay is it you've got just like so our brain does
it at super speed and and in the context of social media it's like i loved my nokia phone
yeah until until the new one the iphone comes out right i was the proudest kid in school showing
everyone oh look snake i can do snake on here yeah but then but then the minute that same thing which hasn't changed in value
exists in a world of iphones which is what social media is it's like me looking at kylie jenner immediately
even though i haven't changed in value i am less than your brain tells you i agree i agree with that and i i feel that myself
sometimes when i when i watch that show that the netflix documentary um the social dilemma did say all of the guys that created the
products that created the like buttons all those people said my kids aren't on social media yeah and that's the alarm bell it's like saying
you know it's like um that joke of you know i wouldn't trust an eye surgeon who's wearing glasses like i'm getting
my eyes laid on saturday by the way but they say you know don't you know if that person that created it and that does it
every day is saying to you like get your kids off social media it's not good for their mental health and that is what it is it's not about
it i don't think it kills ambition i think it just really affects people's mental health and their self-esteem sometimes that's
irreversible and you could be like a young teenager that has an eating disorder you know all
through your life or is um is binging or under eating or you know not respecting your body and
that can really stem from like how you feel about yourself right so i i try and use my social media to obviously promote
healthy food and fitness that's a positive part of social media and i think your content is positive i think some of the quotes that you share
like they know like the ten things and all these little sometimes i really want to go bang wow like it's just a nice little
light bulb moment so you're using it for positive and we have to just always focus on that focusing the people that are bringing
the good stuff out of it i think you've probably heard me say before that my the way i use my instagram i genuinely believe has like
saved my life a little bit because i would have before if you scroll down my instagram right now you'll see what i
was like oh picture of a lamborghini picture of a louis vuitton bag and then at some point when i became a
ceo of a company and i felt a sense of responsibility not to be that guy i thought okay so how can i use this i'll post quotes and because i've done
that for the last like i don't know two three years it's meant that when i do have it means
that i don't buy stuff to post it yeah and i if i'm in a helicopter going over sri lanka sat next
to my girlfriend which i was no one will know because i actually don't have a place to put it so i'm now making decisions on your
close friends list i'm so glad i'm on that that's why i get through your nice villains yeah that's
only there's only 100 people on there but like i i don't have a place to put it and so when i'm making the decision
it's not based on social media because i'm not gonna be able to tell really anybody other than like a couple of my close friends my question
though which is kind of attached to that is about money something that a lot of people probably won't talk to you about
now listen it's always uncomfortable it's uncomfortable it's just awkward everyone articles come out like joe buys this much
What roll does money play in your life?
you know this million pound house it's like why is that important but i just know that people are obsessed aren't they ask what
you want to ask and i'll be honest yeah so an unavoidable consequence of success like the thing is the reason why i'm actually not uncomfortable about asking
you this question is because if there's anyone on planet earth on off camera that i know
has the most genuine sincere intentions it is you probably of all the people i've met i'm like i can't think of a guest i've met
who is more sincere about their intentions more oh thank you steven you're all maximum sincerity right so
some people are as well but you're maximum so um i've got no problem asking you this question which is an unavoidable consequence of your success
over the last year previously is money right it's what allows you to have a camera to dp with
joe right of course yeah so this year i mean you've made a lot of money
right like every year um what role does money play in your life just be honest with me
it's a it's that it's that thing of you know it talk we talk about you know freedom of time and like you know owning yeah i've always been
about time and being with friends and family so for me it's like it's removed a lot of stress because when i was a kid i
remember money was a stressor like we you know we had um we we never had food in the house so my
mom would have to go to my nand and we'd have to get like borrowed pints of milk and running next door you know when you're on a council
stay it was quite common you'd go and ask for a pint of milk or a couple of i remember asking like a bag of sugar for our cereal and stuff so i i didn't
have any money growing up and you know i was on school dinners you know i was my mum was on
benefit so it was it was all like iceland two for one buy and get them free it was crap food and that affects
that affects things as well you know the food you're eating but i suppose for me when i started to make money it was a gradual thing i didn't win the
lottery and wake up a million pounds you know i i released my online plan and one person signed up
and then it was 10 and it grew and it was gradual and so it was a nice way of becoming like with my followers it was a
nice gradual thing i didn't just jump off of love island with two million followers and have money thrown at me and i think
that does affect your ego differently and i think anyone that's young that gets thrown into the media with money and
fame it would affect you in a certain way um so it definitely allowed me to have more
freedom and to take care of my family i think i'm not someone who has been successful and left
people behind that would make me seriously unhappy i've helped my brother out i've helped my dad you know i got my mama house
we've done amazing holidays together with all the boys you know they know i'm there if they need me and and that's that's a nice feeling but
yeah the question is around motivation around money as well i feel like as time has gone on i've become less motivated by it and i remember that story said
about you're up here and you could have run down the center and even got 20 grand i have days that too where i think i could go and do another gusto post and
10 000 people might sign up or i could go and film another workout and it could get two million
views and i have and when i feel like that i have to remind myself of like why i do what i do and and that mission thing
about there's someone at the end of that youtube video just waiting for a new workout and they live in scone for when they've got no man in their proper skin
and they're waiting for the workout and i remind myself for that so yeah money money allows it just allows freedom it's
less stress and money was always something we always argue about i think maybe my marriage i'll be honest is easier because we
don't argue about money and maybe your mom and dad used to argue about money like school uniform the new trainers you wanted the school tripped me on this guy
i remember like going on a school trip was really hard for mum and dad we couldn't afford to do the school trip sometimes and
you know they would always work really hard and it would you know sometimes i did sometimes i didn't so i think having a bit more man in the
bank means there's less pressure on you as a person and therefore you can sort of you can go through life a bit
easier but i had to overcome as we talked about kind of earlier i had to overcome that that feeling though like that
[ __ ] if more money isn't gonna have an impact then what the hell are we doing steve like what are we
doing here because you know 16 year old steve told me it was money was the whole game and you get more of it get more happy
it's just like that your happiness goes up with your bank balance your ego inflate because i i can i can imagine when you said about you know
i used to go to like china white and punk and like you know shoot over there and i never had money i
was skint i was a university kid i had like 20 quid in my pocket i'd be in there on a freebie but i imagine if you had man at that
time you'd be the one with the bottles spraying it about and all the lights and all the girls come with the big flares is that what you were like did it
inflate your egos you know spend more money i i and i've got to be as self-aware as i possibly can be here
i um i don't think it's ever had an impact on my perception of myself however i did like i've nev i genuinely
feel the same opinion of myself as i always have since i was
three like i've it's never changed i bet people around you changing like because they knew steve had the dough and you were there
to come over i was rolling into clubs and spending i remember this one club in manchester called neighborhood they had this little star next to my name because
i was like the number one spender and i'd walk in there and get five bottles of dom praying i didn't think i was anything else but i was still doing it
like that's a really important point to make like you you hear about these rich [ __ ] and these like young kids that like
they get all this money then they start treating people like [ __ ] and they change all of my friends say to me you haven't changed at all yeah you just
we're still doing it you just bought you just i suppose you were like the facilitator you just you were the fun how did you exactly brought people together and you
and you could have the fun and i think you know maybe fight a bit more at that time maybe i would have done this because i do i mean my thing now is going to a
nice restaurant so i love going to like zuma or nobu and having a meal my friends i didn't have that kind of
flashy kind of like nightclub vibe but you know at the time the thing is at that time that was what you wanted to do at that time you don't do it now and
i think if you had fun like it's good it's all good but yeah money i've got out my system yeah get out your system
and it's weird because i'd i looked at those people in the clubs and i'd looked at rich people and thought oh god like yeah when i when i become
one of them then i'll be super happy so then you go and do it i went and got this massive packing mansion in the
countryside and i'm sat there like nope yeah spray the bottles for a year and you're getting all the bottles free and you're
like okay nope so when you um when you like when you you exit and you know or even before
that you've been financially secure for a long time has your motivation dropped or increased because i
at the moment i'm feeling quite demotivated but i'm more excited by the legacy and the potential of like
building the body codes to a point that in 20 years time i can look back when i'm a bit older and go i started that i created that company
you know that's still going do you did you find a really good question lost motivation because you're like you know what
i can chill now i ain't got i ain't got the hustle in me anymore it's a really good question and again i've been writing a lot about
motivation lately so i think i've got a pretty good answer to this um you know one of the the best sort of easiest to
answer this question is just referring to my gym routine i think you might have heard on the podcast i said in one of the episodes that every
february march i'm the most motivated person on planet earth to work out and i say to myself i'm gonna get i'm
have a great body for summer and then summer comes i drop the photo on social media summer
ends and i literally can't bring myself to the gym because my motivation my why was anchored to a timeline which is
somewhere in summer and looking good and so the minute i post and everyone likes it it was like i genuinely couldn't get
myself to the gym and i was going like two times a day before and this relates to our motive our other motivations in other parts of our life
like when you lose when you lose the anchor with your y which is what you described after p with joe yeah you've got to [ __ ] find it again
it's like the gold medalist you've got to go and find it again and you've got to re-anchor yourself to something that hopefully doesn't have a short-term timeline against it
gary vaynerchuk says the same thing he says the worst day of my life will be when i buy the jets it's been his yeah that's his thing isn't it it's
forever this is moonshot and you you i didn't hear that before that that term moonshot is nice because it's like joe
so big don't just do something you know you can do in six months do something you think will take you 20 years this is what the conversation we
had right yeah that's what you said and i went home and i was thinking the same as it's nikki i said i love that i love the idea of a
moonshot what's our moonshine he's like well our moonshot is that we build the body coach and we have an exit so that someone comes along and
buys it and it continues to flourish for years to come because otherwise i was the it's like mr motivator smashed
it in the 80s or 90s whatever it was and i would have just been the body coach the mr motor of this time
unless i build it to sell and i build it to sustain itself and grow and continue to help people and that's
really where my heads are now i think i've had a shift in my mentality towards that but i did lose motivation at several parts of my life and it was
always as i described with the 20k and email downstairs it was when i was doing things without
that real intrinsic deep sense why so when before social change started i had no
motivation to do any marketing for anybody or to send emails to anybody and then search chain starts and i'm going to the [ __ ] ukraine at 3am in the
morning i spent what was it i spent 11 of the 12 months last year in hotel rooms happy
driving for this mission of building this company with super key thing with people i loved yeah right because
it didn't have to be social media we had a purpose we had a worthwhile goal
i was working with people i loved towards that worthwhile goal and i felt competent in doing so if you have those three things like competence
a worthwhile goal and you're working with people you love yeah and lastly i'd say a sense of control like autonomy because
a lot of people don't we have that in our lives a lot of people working in factories and other industries don't have that sense of feeling of autonomy over their
time and have you got the hustle now could you like go back and do the eleven months on the roads too no no no i remember used to always being in
the airport always rolling that little wiggly thing around i thought it must be like no matter how much money you're making no matter how much money
and how much you're building there must be an element of loneliness and that exhaustion where you think i just need to be like settled in one place and now you're
in london think you're sticking about are you gonna hit the road again um great question and it's something i've reflected on if you told me now
to fly to the ukraine and do a talk i'd be like [ __ ] off i've said this to my assistant i can't
understand where it where the motivation came from and it's because i've lost it i've lost the anchor i've quit social
change so when i re even with this mindset i think go to the [ __ ] ukraine and do a talk at 9am
to a bunch of people for an hour [ __ ] off yeah he lost it i've lost it
because because i've quit so my anchor's gone and i can't even get myself back into the mindset however i will get my anchor back at
some point yeah and i'll find something else that and i'm not trying to find it at the moment yeah just it's nice to slow things i
think the lockdowns helped us just think we don't need to be on this hamster all the time like it's alright a
few months of the year like you said you know nothing in nature blooms all around like you can have a couple of quiet months because you know you know your event didn't happen i
really wanted to be at that event in manchester but i'm hoping that happening i i need to come back it's gonna be huge
yeah i know i mean like you showed me the music i got me and nicki got mad like goosebumps just listen to the music you're gonna play
um but yeah you've got loads of heady i think it's important to just have these months where you go i'm not everywhere at the moment but i
know in six months i've got this great project and there's your moment to bloom and that's kind of where my head's at now rather than like come on what should we do now let's do
another this let's let's do more of this i'm like it's okay to be not busy and not be successful for a few months
and to create a void in your life that's what my mentor said to me he's one i think he was one of the first investor ever in spotify he
said steve i met him after i resigned and he said steve listen it's so tempting to just sort of grab the bull again and just go and run and
run and run and run he said but the reason you were successful before is because you were really hungry yeah so he said create a void in your
life resist the temptations just to run back into something and just let it be the concept that's probably
not easy for me to understand like just the i'm getting it now though i'm getting it now because i like i said i've always had like
two books a year i've had a dvd out i've had merchandise pots and pans you know
protein stuff i've always had something but actually now i know i need to just chill out and take some time off because
i can't i don't want to be hammer i don't want to be selling stuff to some people all the time i want to just be get back to my free
content what i'm good at what i start you know the organic stuff that i generally started doing in the beginning because that's when i'm
happiest when i'm getting millions of views on my youtube channel i love that i love that people are actually like doing those workouts it's 15 minutes of
my time but it's helping someone really transform their day and so i'll continue to um you know push that mission which is to
get people moving and if it's within this one person a day like it's enough sometimes i just reflected them when you said that
i think of one of the conversations we had in that restaurant which was you were saying you know i've done the pbj and what's next and i'm saying i was i
remember saying she's like joe this is a false peak because like did i say this yeah i said i don't think i'm going to achieve
anything in my life that's going to have more impact because there may never be another lockdown and there may never be like 80 million
people in their living room doing my workouts again but you were like joe don't be silly there's something else there's something that has to be like
if you don't you're going to lose it you can lose motivation so yeah you said the thing about the moon shot like imagine eradicating
you know whatever it may be like going for that real like still steve steve jobs or bill gates like
vision of like changing the world it's exciting it might never happen but at least have a crack but you have that you this is why i refer to it as a false
peak because mountaineers when they're climbing they look up the mountain and they see these peaks and it because of the perspective when you're
climbing a mountain it looks like the top and they stop and they go oh [ __ ] that
was but it's a false peak and i think for you this is going to be a false peak because now you have more power than you've ever
had so you have this i in my view again no not telling you live your life you have a responsibility to you're a
[ __ ] mbe you know everyone knows your name now and you've got the power to do things on a global level that even
i'm not sure yet you realize you're capable of doing and i think when you realize what you're capable of then um
you're gonna find a why because listen you you can't waste the power you've got you just simply can't and there's a lot
of pain out there there's a lot of people getting fat there's a lot of people not eating right and they need someone that has your power it's like
it's like you know life is giving you this this responsibility and gone joe listen we need you and i think that's i mean that's enough to get our bed for
every day that is the goal mate and it's so lovely to hear you say that and i do believe that we have a purpose and we have
we have an energy inside us and i bumped into this guy once on the street in london and he was really i think he was a shaman of some
sort and he he he basically put his hand on my shoulder he does my workouts and he's like there's something about you like you've
got an energy there's something pushing you forward isn't there like it's more than views and fame and numbers that there's something inside
yeah like there is it's this energy that is constantly like just go and film the work i know you're tired but do it and
it's that that's that thing of giving i i'm my happiest i'm giving and sharing and the minute i stop that
even if i sell the body coach you know i know that that moment will come where i feel like you know i still need to be
doing what i'm good at and still needs to be reconnecting and that is my energy that's that and i didn't have that i was really lost and
confused until 25. i came back from this trip to america i started to become a personal trainer
and it was like i just knew in that moment this is what i was going to do and i've just put all my energy and love into it since so yeah let's see what we
can do in 2021. thank you so much for your time joe it's been an absolute pleasure and i'm super excited to bring you back on for a third
time once you've conquered the world and we'll be like we were sat here and you said this and then
and uh it's been a pleasure man and i really do enjoy your podcast i take little nuggets from it i think you're always sharing a positive message so
keep doing it um it's good to see that you're growing and building and i am i hope this episode does really well for you
thank you i appreciate you all good luck thank you for sharing all of your wisdom and learnings i'm continuing to be
inspired by you i can't wait to see what you achieve in the next few years now go and get your moonshot can build a rocket

Intro
this week on the diver ceo we have a returning guest jake humphreys he is an entrepreneur he
is a tv presenter he's also now a podcaster and jake has spent the last
year on his podcast sitting down with some of the most high performance people some of the most accomplished
people in their industries from acting to business to sports you name it and so because of that experience
because of all the insights he's gained over the last year since we last spoke i wanted to sit down with him and
compare notes we have a lot of high performance people on this podcast too i wanted to understand the similarities
i wanted to pick into the minds of some of the guests and what he's learned from them how are they the same what makes them
different and that's what we're going to talk about today so without further ado i'm stephen bartlett and this is the
dire of a ceo i hope nobody's listening but if you are then please keep this to yourself
What are the key lessons you've learnt in the last year
you've um you've had what 30 people on your podcast today you've got
a lot more coming up one of the key questions that i that i wanted to ask you because it's you know
something that i asked myself is what are those like key lessons that you've learned you've interviewed
you know high performance athletes actors authors um and really sort of high
performance people from all industries what are the key lessons and the themes i think there is one key lesson that was
summed up for me by matthew mcconaughey the oscar-winning actor who came on my pod recently and his phrase is don't leave
crumbs and what he means by that is like when you're making a decision
don't leave stuff behind don't make a bad decision now that later on you've got to go back and pick that crumb up and be regretful about it and
that's brilliant because sometimes when we talk on the podcast we talk about really like big
blue sky thinking you know like we've talked to you about social change setting up social change sometimes to people that are listening and that can
seem like unreal almost untouchable because it's this huge multi-million dollar business that
you've created but actually don't leave crumbs is about making the decisions for a big
big business like that and creating something amazing but also like make sure that you don't have an extra
drink and even in case it leaves you with a hangover tomorrow and you've got work to do or make sure you simply choose your clothes the night
before so you're not doing it in a rush and like i still leave crumbs all the time like i'll tell you when we uh when we
interviewed matthew like he's the first hollywood actor we've had on the pod so for me it was quite a big moment
and i thought i really want to be looking good for this so i thought i'd have a shower and a shave before we do the interview and i was having a shave in the bathroom
my wife was in the bath and she was going to come down and like listen in the corner in my study because she was like she loves dallas buyers club she was
excited and uh she starts having a shave and she goes it's 9 54.
i was like and i thought it was like 9 30 or something we put the kids to bed and then the next thing i'm running
downstairs i haven't done my hair properly i'm on i've got two wi-fi zone because our upload speed living in the
countryside is horrendous so i was then on the wrong wi-fi i then looked for the script i'd written for the questions for matthew couldn't find
them and i was like i was the last one in i'm getting beaten to the interview on my own podcast
by a hollywood actor and i left crumbs and now that's a good lesson for me because i do it all the
time and i think that you only learn about the crumbs you leave by doing it and i just i just really want people i've had a few
negative comments that have come my way about the podcast direct messages from people saying um
you're getting this all wrong we're in a global pandemic i'm having a really hard year and here you are with a podcast that's
just celebrating success all the time and showing up how um how we're all doing badly compared to your great guests
and for me the podcast is a that hurts me to think that because i don't want anyone to come to
the high performance podcast and leave in that way but it's the absolute total opposite of that because when we talk about what
lessons can you learn from people on the podcast the other biggest one is they mess up all the time i think
i genuinely believe successful people make more mistakes than anybody else because they're constantly challenging themselves to do
stuff and you you're no stranger to making decisions that at the time you just simply don't know
but you have to find a way of making that decision um and i'm sure there are times when you've made 10 or 15
life-changing decisions in a week you know the the the point about those crumbs and you know rushing down the stairs
when you realize that you were like what could you have done in hindsight to um to prevent those crumbs being left
behind per se i just need to be really honest with myself that i have weaknesses and i need to address them rather than thinking that everything's
fine and i am notoriously late i am always a few minutes late and always my new year's
resolution is this is the year that i'm not going to be late is but it just i'm surprised you know that you're
late because um the industry you work in i know it's very and look at all the guests
i've had on my podcast we had um sir clive woodward who won the rugby world cup and you think of all of the discipline
and the rules and the mindsets you need to win a rugby world cup the number one thing that stands out for him is something
called lombardi time which was created by the players and they lombardi obviously is a famous
name in american sports and they call it lombardi time because it's a name that sort of resonates with winning and it was 10 minutes early
so if you say to any former england rugby player what's lombardi time they'll tell you 10 minutes early so listen i'm hearing this stuff steven on a
weekly basis and still not getting it right and i think it just goes to show that we are human we have
we are fallible and i do think we have blind spots which there are some things some people find really hard i don't there are some
things that is not an issue for other people and it is a recurring problem for me to deal with
but no one's perfect and how do you emotionally feel about the fact that you have blind spots
in terms of like do you beat yourself up about it yeah yeah i think so
yeah um i think it's a really common phrase isn't it to hear that you're your
own biggest critic i think i'm probably less my own biggest critic
than i was previously like when i first started in my presenting career and i used to come off air on the
formula one i would solely focus on the bad stuff on the issues on the problems and that
was instilled in me by david coulthard because he'd step straight out of a formula one car straight into broadcasting and
tv is a friendly and lovely place to be most of the time you know we're really good at telling each other how great we are and we had
our first production meeting just after the first race and i was just grateful to get through it it was my
first ever bit of live formula one so i was just glad to have survived so i was ready for this lovely you were great you were great you
were great this was great we started the meeting and david coulthard went well sorry
can we just stop and that this is unheard of he goes i'm just not interested in this and the
producer was like sorry i don't understand he's like i'm not interested in sitting here and going through all the good stuff
how does going through the good stuff make the boat go faster why are we not talking about the bad stuff and that was a revelation from me
i was like yes the good stuff's already good so you focus on the good stuff now i have a different mindset and
bearing in mind my first race was 2009 so this is 11 years ago and for a long time my focus was on
the stuff that i was struggling with or the stuff i wasn't very good at or the times where i didn't feel life
was very good so i would look at a bad month or a bad year and go right why was i not flowing why was i not
really in a happy place why was this why don't we focus more on the good
stuff and that is my mindset change that is the thing that i for 2021 that is going to be my focus
let's focus on the good stuff so we realize what the good stuff is just do more of it let's focus on the times when you were flowing and when you were
feeling great when you were barreling around the place and when you were the guy and when everyone wanted to work with you what was i doing what was i eating how
was i sleeping who was i spending my time with what was feeding me what was making me feel
fantastic that's probably a better place to focus on i particularly after the sort of crap
2020 we've all had i feel we've become a nation maybe even
Your experience with failure and anxiety
a planet with this light obsession on failure to not fail anymore to be good and it's
almost like a badge of honor isn't it like i'm sure if you said to me three or four months ago how's your relationship with failure my
love failure love faith bring failure on that's how i learn failures where i grow i need to be on the absolute edge so i'm
failing all the time i want to fail forwards and i want to fail often like i still do but when i fail when i
leave crumbs when i'm late for an interview with matthew mcconaughey i'm not thinking why did that happen
because then i'm focusing on the failure i will allow it to be there and i will do my best not to do it again
but i'm gonna try for 2021 to think about the good stuff man and just to see how that changes things for me
super interesting you know do you focus on your failure um i i don't focus on the failure i
think i was just i was actually asking myself that question when you were talking i was thinking do i am i someone that dwells on failure to
be fair i don't i'm very very good at being detached from it all i think i talked earlier in this podcast about
this like um video game mentality that i've taken on my life where
i see my my worst days and to be honest a lot of them no i
think it's just my worst days as if i'm playing a video game and that i am
i am not what's happening and it's and i i think that detachment from what's happening
has allowed me in my most chaotic moments to remain calm it's allowed me to form a
sort of calm within my chaos so if i have a big failure or i really really [ __ ] up and i'm i'm disappointed
with myself or whatever i'm very good at detaching from that um so i think i think the absolute
absolute ownership of what you're doing for me is powerful which is is that the total opposite of what
you're saying because like whatever i do i have to absolutely believe it and own that decision because then if it goes
wrong or people question it i can say listen i really thought it was the right thing it's like the emotional detachment it
means that i'm not i don't think that i'm going to die although i am totally responsible for changing it so i can think of i'm
thinking specifically about the day where um i was driving to work get get the emails and the text messages
saying that our whole server's been hacked and every client we have has been sent really really personal specific abuse by them
from our email server that's come from my business partner's email that looks like it was meant to be sent to my assistant
but the client was just accidentally ccd and this happened this happened about four years ago five years ago
so i'm driving to work and i'm getting all these and in that moment one has a choice whether they want to
fall into the problem and become the problem and become consumed by it or if they want to hold it out in front
of them and deal with it there yeah if it consumes me i'll be crippled with anxiety crying in the corner
but if i can hold it out in front of me and realize that this isn't gonna kill me this isn't gonna end me
yeah this isn't you know but this is something that i have to deal with out in front of me then it becomes much more um possible to
be rational and to think in terms of probabilities and i've come to learn especially over the last year or two
that when you can um make your decisions based on probabilities of the outcome you can make really really good decisions yeah um
you know i was thinking a good example of that is actually um a friend of mine yesterday texts me and
he said to me that it's interesting he said to me that
at his marketing agency his clients passwords have maybe been
exposed to one outside individual so there's one guy another company that might have seen all of his clients
passwords and he said steve i'm going to call all of my clients now and tell them that all of their passwords have been exposed
so i said let's go through the probabilities here if you lined up a hundred people like the guy that might have seen these
passwords how many of them would do something malicious with that information we both agreed it was probably less than one percent
of like reputable people that would take a bunch of passwords and do something malicious so i said okay so one person out of 100
or less so your probability of harm is less than one percent um what's the probability of harm if you
call all of your clients and tell them that all of their passwords have been leaked probably greater than one percent
yeah so let's think about ways we can get that less than one percent down to like zero so i said
email all your clients and tell them you've done a security review and that um you you highly recommend they all turn on two-factor
authentication today and that means the probability of harm goes from less than one percent to zero
and but he was like in the in the emotional mindset he was just like i'm going to call them all yeah apologize because you probably felt a duty of care
but if you do the two-step authentication i suppose you're still it's like you zero yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah music to zero percent
it's a duty you're balancing their duty of care and you know how do i remove harm from my clients but also
remove harm from my business but he was so emotional when he called me that he wasn't thinking rationally yeah
and that's why holding it out in front of you allows you to think in terms of rational employment perspective that perspective is so
important to have like i've always had like this irrational fear of imminent disaster
so when i was a kid i used to come in from school my mom would go and walk the dog and she might be 15 or 20 minutes most kids would just watch cartoons
i would be like out the window after 10 minutes singing where's my mom where's my mom and then these little voices come in my head all maybe
something really bad's happened to her maybe she's like slipped over and banged her head and or maybe she's lying in a field right i
might have to go and find one my mum is and then she reappears i'm like oh thank goodness even now with my kids if i'm out someone
they go around the corner i don't just think to myself i'll walk around the corner and my kids will be there until i can see my kids again and there
might be parents listening to this that relate the worst possible things that could happen to one's children is a
is happening to my kids until i can see them so i find myself like speeding up or saying to my friends yeah hey let's go and sit over here so we can keep
just literally so i can keep an eye on the kids and then i'm a little bit of a hypochondriac so i fear that and then
when my phone goes and or someone sends me a message going hey jake can we have a chat later like it could be someone from
whisper or it could be someone from bt sport or someone about the pod i don't go yeah yeah cool i'll call you later i'm like oh what could that be
my brain goes to worst case scenario and i found myself really quickly going so it's got a really important call to make
my heart's racing 10 to the dozen and then as soon as i if i find out what it is i'm like oh
thank goodness where does this come from i don't know because there is no skeleton in the closet like a friend rang me the other
day and the message that you gave me was he's separating from his wife which is massively sad but he rang me
and said listen i'm really sorry to call you with this um quite awkward news i'm immediately thinking oh my goodness right
what on earth can this be but in my head it's gonna end everything it's gonna cost me my marriage my kids
my job my house isn't that ridiculous but i now have the perspective that i know
this is how i am i've had this since i was like 11 or 12 years old i know this is how i'm made so that is a
really powerful thing for me because i then think when i feel this feeling beginning like when my kids go around the corner i now
say to myself listen your kids are going to be fine playing the other side of a tree
you know yourself well enough to know that this is just a rational anxiety it's your brain and it's just playing a trick on you
that's all this is you talk a lot about responsibility yeah um there you just said this is how i'm made yeah
that sounds like giving up responsibility yeah yeah so now i think i'm taking i yes you're
right you are totally right but then i feel like i'm taking the resp i'm slowly still learning even at 42.
i'm taking the responsibility back by saying right i'm not going to allow myself to get anxious about that because i know what i'm like if i'm the
most chilled out person in the world and i find a reason to be anxious maybe i should be worried about that i'm going to tell them about the lift
jake so we're on the fourth floor here and uh jake jake came up uh
knocked on the door looking pretty sweaty and said uh i just took breath he said i just took the stairs because i
opened the lift and i didn't trust it this lift there's never been any problems with it if you look at the stats around deaths in lifts or things
you and me are not hanging out today that seems somewhat connected to what you're saying yeah i think you're probably right yeah
maybe i should have taken the lift because i know that everything will be fine in the lift and i should know that i'm a bit claustrophobic but
i think it just goes to show that again and you've spoken about this so powerfully over the years on your podcast is that from the outside world
you look at someone like me and think wow a couple of kids few businesses great house nice broadcasting career
what a lovely carefree life he must live every day man is riddled with little anxieties and little worries
um a few years ago probably almost to the point of derailing as we've discussed on your previous
podcast with me but now knowing myself knowing yourself is so powerful because
only then like can you love yourself you think that's also somewhat linked that you said earlier on about that comment you
read where people are like jake you know you shouldn't be doing a podca happy podcasting sad times basically
yeah the fact that you remembered that and you referred to it as hurting you seems also somewhat correlated to this
yeah i think i don't know i think it's a i think it's a it's a fair point
i find that a harder thing to get i find external criticism is a harder thing for me to deal with i
find that more i find that a more difficult um thing to own in my head why
um i think because probably human beings just want people to like what we're doing i mean i find it confusing as well
because i think if you're being offended by my high performance podcast like
wow that that shows the level of offence that some people can take because i really want i honestly
want it to just be a holy positive experience from the moment that someone clicks subscribe or starts listening to
the pod to the minute they leave i just i just want people to be happier to get
takeaways to live a more empowered life to go and be successful i honestly believe it like
it comes you've got thousands and thousands and thousands of reviews on your podcast yeah it's rated five stars
people pour their heart out telling you how much they love it how much value it brings and we're talking about this one guy i'm
a human i suppose am i i think you slightly over index a little bit in terms of caring about this stuff though
and i i actually you know when people asked you know what you're like after meeting you i said he's just such a nice
guy such a good guy and you are such a good guy and it it's
maybe that is part of i don't know is that somewhat connected to your i think so don't you think that
don't you think the two are completely connected though that if i wasn't the kind of guy that genuinely wanted people to
you know be in a better place i wouldn't give a [ __ ] whether someone said my podcast was useless i'd be like well i don't care anything i'm just doing it to
make some money for me that podcast and i will openly say this i've not made a penny from
creating and operating for an entire year and we talk all the time that this is about the outcome not the income
and and i think the reason why it has been successful is that whether it's me or whether it's
damien or whether it's the guys that help us to film and edit the podcast together all of us totally believe and buy into
what we're doing like i genuinely think that it is what people need to hear
because it is empowering people and do great things who have been you know a lot of my friends messaged me
after you had johnny wilkinson yeah and they said that was [ __ ] weird it was deep wasn't it i had to listen to
that back five times and i did the interview you know what was the remark i haven't heard it what was the surprising
so the the bravery really from from someone who won a rugby world cup as a certain
person and now is a completely different person i mean i can give you like a sort of salacious headline like he told us that
winning the rugby world cup is no more important than doing the washing up and the the way that he squares that off in his
mind is he says what are you doing if you're playing rugby moving your body to achieve a goal what you're doing if you're doing the washing
up moving your body to achieve a goal and if i make winning the rugby world cup more important or to hold more value
than doing the washing up and i'm no longer a rugby player what am i less valuable because i'm no longer doing the thing that was more important
that was the that is the sort of sentence that he was sharing with us which i think is
brilliant and brave and i can relate to it and i and i can understand it um
[Music] but i think that for me the sort of the real the real
revelation that came out of the johnny wilkinson episode and what i really want people to understand if they listen to it
is that when you strip everything back he is someone who has
totally changed from where he was when he was conquering the world because when he was conquering the world as a rugby player
he thought he had to stress and struggle and sacrifice and fail and now he realizes that
stressing and struggling and sacrificing and failing leads to
more stress and struggle and sacrifice and fail and actually one of the amazing things
he said he said when i released a book after winning the rugby world cup i wouldn't be surprised if there wasn't a spike in mental health
cases from people that read that book because the book was saying you've got a struggle you've got a struggle you've got to you've got to
really struggle in life to be successful and i think that that is something that i
when we first started the high performance podcast i loved it when people spoke to me about
the battle and the struggle and the strife and the sacrifice and the late nights and the early starts
because i wanted people at home to go yeah man i'm gonna work harder i'm gonna commit more i'm gonna
sacrifice more now i think that is so so so wrong that
is the total antithesis of what i now the message i now want my podcast to give to people
it's tough isn't it because it's hard to find someone who's been really successful at the very top of
their game whether it's business or sport hasn't done that yeah so i've contended with this i've like contended mentally
with this idea as well well again when i started putting content out there especially when i was really young like 18
i was bragging about how late i was staying up i was like look at me at 4 a.m and i'm still working
and i was doing that because i was trying to portray an image that i was i don't know a superhuman or something and my content
followed that theme and then i got to the point where i probably flipped the other way because of public pressure and people's and the
the world now thinks that if you go on the high performance podcast and say hard work really really matters you will
take an l you are an [ __ ] for saying that because you're going to make people depressed and anxious and you're a hustle porn star
and then i got to another place which is if it's the truth it's the truth and i'm comfortable with
the truth and so there's so many levels of nuance it's like the most successful people you'll
encounter at the very top of their industries worked like hell to get there yeah yeah
yeah it's you know will smith you know circlive woodward or um any anyone in it
that's a very consistent theme elon musk right but it but what i've come to do over the
years is detach that from happiness first and foremost because it doesn't necessarily mean they're happier
and then also redefine what success is because success can be being a great parent yeah or is
it to you then i it has to be happiness i feel like yeah that's my answer yeah
that has to be because you can still have the hard work and you can still have the
sacrifice but you don't have the struggle that's the that is the mistake i made i thought the struggle was part of the hard work
and it was part of the early starts and the late finishes and it was part of sacrificing some things that's what i thought the high
performance podcast was about but it isn't you're totally right it's about happiness and you can still get up at five like i probably take too
much on and i probably get up early than i need to and i go to bed later than i need to
but i am so happy and that's what it has to be and it can't be happiness at the
detriment of others happiness yeah it has to be being happy content with yourself and spreading that happiness and that again
is something that johnny wilkinson spoke about which for me has been one of the biggest revelations being absolutely present
absolutely totally present so when i'm here with you my phone is down on the floor and it's
actually on silent but it should be off because i need to be totally present with you right now because what's happened is gone what's
yet to happen which is me going off to do a game at bt sport is a story i can write that in my head if i like but i'm probably going to get
it wrong because it hasn't happened yet exactly the way the day's going to go so i need to like look you in the eye right now and i can now promise you that
on this podcast i am absolutely here with you and it might be in half an hour i leave but
that's cool because when then we're done and i'm then traveling and then i'm totally present and i'm
into that that is a really important thing that has again been a mindset change for
me on the high performance podcast and maybe now i sit and talk to you maybe this whole thing is like a totally selfish
exercise for me because i must have said four or five times that this podcast has rewritten the way that i see the world
and the way that i operate and i think maybe maybe i want this podcast to be messages to my kids like i talk
already about my anxiety probably another of my anxieties is how much longer am i going to be on the earth you never know what's around the
corner i love the fact that if it all ended for me as a walk out onto shoreditch high street today and a car comes along
what can my wife say to my kids that oh i don't know my dad very well listen to these 25 episodes listen to these 30
episodes of the high performance podcast there's your dad that's him you walk out here today then
What would you regret if you were to die today
yeah touch glass um and bus comes boom yeah it's over what are the things you
you in you would regret not having done more of uh traveling with the kids probably but
they're only little they're only young it's such a hard question for me because
i think i think probably um maintaining relationships with people has always been an issue for me
because i i failed my a-levels as you know at school so all my mates went off to uni so that was kind of lost because
they went off having fun and i redid them and then i've always found that one of the issues
with trying to really be present is that you're totally present in that part of your world at that moment and so i was then totally plugged into
life on children's bbc and then i got this amazing opportunity at formula one and i was totally plugged
into my life in formula one and then i got you know a big opportunity at bt sport and i had to
make that work so then i was totally plugged into my new producers and my my new colleagues and you know i
had a conversation with someone the other day and they said you know like who you who are your real friends
it's a hard question that for me once i moved beyond my wife because i've got four or five mates who
i'm close with but they're i would probably name people that live on my street well i've
only lived there for four years i might name a couple of parents on the school run my kids have only gone to that school for four years
i'd name a couple of people i've run my production company whisper with but that's only been going less than a
decade i'd now probably class damian hughes and i do the high performance podcast with
well i've done that for less than a year but i'm in this and maybe that is
possibly the only regret i think but maybe i don't need i don't know maybe we don't need to hold
on to people for too long maybe we have to accept that people come and go from our lives and that's okay
and do you think it's because you you haven't sort of perhaps you said like you haven't prioritized investing in those relationships as much
i think it's because i'm always too invested in the thing that i'm doing at that moment
like i am so absolutely committed to whisper coral eyewear the high
performance podcast bt sport my kids my wife and my family
there isn't an awful lot left right i guess the question the better question to ask would be then but you're are you happy
because that if that is the ultimate goal then you know society will tell you to live have loads of friends and do this
and have this car and whatever but then the question the most important is be happy happiest i've ever been
i've been the happiest i've ever been yeah so you've got to be doing something right right yeah i think yeah i mean i i love what i do
like i really like work i like getting up early i like having five or six things on the
burn all the time i like having a whole page of jobs that i'm gonna do other people are not like that my wife
is the opposite she's got four or five jobs she's like oh man i feel so stressed i got i don't want all this stuff whereas
sometimes i sit there and i'm not making a list of big things on the horizon and i'm i need
to have a lot of them and again maybe i give a c to everything and i'd be better to have fewer things and give them more than an
a matthew mcconaughey tells a great story about cutting off two of his big businesses because he was giving a b
to five things and he wanted to be an a in three things the guests you've had on
Are successful people happy?
your podcast all these wonderful people you've met do you sometimes get the impression that some of them aren't
that happy yes yeah um it's one of the things i've
learned from doing this as well yeah it's really interesting and and i totally get that everyone is
everyone is in it for different reasons aren't they like we spoke to sean wayne who and i
would say you know sean wayne is not a household name he's one of the most successful rugby league managers in the uk
but if someone wanted to get into the high performance podcast and they wanted like a first podcast to listen to
don't just go for the big names i'm telling you now sean wayne gave us the most moving and
revelatory interview and he in his sort of broad northern accent
he said you don't i'm not bothered about being happy he said i'm not not happy i don't care about happy and that
was not you know happiness was not his thing he's con as soon as he achieved something within moments it's about the next thing
and we sort of broke it down that he was very badly abused by his dad as a kid you know physically punched in the face by a big man often
and that his entire life his entire energy comes from wanting to redress the
balance and he's now a rugby league coach the the england rugby league coach because he
he has this deep-seated desire to make the lives of other people better now he might personally never be happy
after the story that and the path that he's been through but he's definitely making other people
happy and he is also totally comfortable with not being happy
now that's not everyone's story that's his story um but i certainly think that
we like in the past we've thought that success and happiness are mutually exclusive what do you want to be here
and be successful you can be happy how wrong are we to think like that the
very flame of success should be happiness
that should be the absolute nub the crux of everything what's the point otherwise man what is the point i i get that a lot
with guests that i've had on they seem to some guests seem to be very neurotically obsessed with
the next thing and the next thing and the next thing in the next thing and when you ask them to pause and reflect on hey when this ends or
um or why they're doing it it always seems to flick back to their childhood eddie ham was the was the same um i know
he's been on yours he was on mine last week and he uh when i was talking to him about his aspirations for the future
with matroom he says i want to sell for five billion and we'll do this and we're gonna there and i said why do you wanna sell for five billion you're happy now he goes
he goes well you know we should be doing we could we should be selling five billion that's why i want to do it but why does that matter and he goes and
he goes back to his dad when he's younger he goes back to the fact that his dad used to criticize him and didn't give him praise and it's
and it's weird that those early moments have driven so and it's the same with me
to be honest they drove this like obsessive desire to just keep climbing a never-ending mountain
and that's the trend that i've seen in very successful guests and very successful people is often some kind of
it's a strange thing to say but something that went not to plan yeah when they're younger seems to be
the reason that we all adore them admire them it's something that had hit them in their emotions or their wiring that
sent them into an obsessive state in in never as good as you think it would be though you know when you get
when you achieve those things that you want to achieve like the the biggest thrill i've ever had was
when i spent 9 750 pounds on a green mgf it's my first ever car
i could still remember the number plate njn and i looked at that car i bought it from an elderly gentleman in
colchester and i went to his house and i said i've got a banker's draft and i was working on children's bbc
he took me out to his garage and you know those old like um fluorescent light strips they flicker
come on i remember it's still on my head as vivid as the day it happened the light flicking and just lighting the car up for a
second and then it goes and i looked at it and i was like i cannot believe now fast forward to
where i am now you know a successful tv presenter invested in coral eyewear run a podcast
um have two beautiful children um who have a production company the kids
and my personal relationships are aside from this because that is that is on a deeper level than anything else but in terms of material successes
nothing and i mean nothing man nothing has come close to spending less than 10 grand
on a green mgf so you've got to enjoy the journey you've got to enjoy the travel because a
it's not as good when you get there as you think it will be b you spend an awful lot more time getting
there than arriving like you have to answer this totally honestly
you have you've totally left social change now yeah with money in the bank yeah that you
wouldn't have had if you hadn't walked away from that business right yeah what is more thrilling to you to
look at your bank account now and see the number in the bank account or to know the journey you went on the social chain
oh yeah of course i mean the bank could be double triple quadruple
ten times it wouldn't matter now if i said to you if i came to you in manchester when you went to nab frozen pizza just to feed yourself and i
said listen dude you can either absolutely work your nuts off for the next 10 years
like build a business hang out with people develop some good relationships or i'll just bang 100 mill in your bank
account today there you go yeah and now here you are you've got 100 mil and the thrill came from
the journey there's something like i'm always conscious of my own like hindsight bias
because it seems to be the case that every broke person um goes on the journey to
get rich you know that ends up being successful they get the money they go it doesn't matter but it's a wonderful thing to say when you have you right like
part of the reason it doesn't matter is because there's so much of it now it really mattered when i was stealing those pizzas right and when i was like
going behind the sofas in this pub looking for the pound coins and i found 13 pound coins so i went back the next day and like it really really mattered in fact
it was all that mattered you know in that moment so i'm super conscious of that bias that we have because
um and you should be by the way and we we are the same on high performance when i say or you
know you need to have the bad times to appreciate the good times and um the the the traumas and the difficult
things will will equip you for the rest of your life i honestly know that there are people that would
listen and go hold on a minute middle class white guy from a lovely village in
norfolk yeah you've had a few issues with mental health and bullying and that as you know the death of my
grandma which was quite tragic and things like that you haven't really struggled yeah so then i think it's
important that we uh we've done an interview that we haven't put out yet for the podcast with ceo khaleesi
first ever black spring box captain and he tells us a story in the podcast about not being able
to sleep at night because his stomach hurts so much because he was so hungry so his grandmother gave him sugar water just to get him to
school so he could have a day at school and she died in his arms at eight years old when he sits on the podcast
and says he will go through some really dark and difficult horrendous times you know he grew up
in the most deepest poverty you could imagine in south africa when he sits there and goes
you can get through it and you can use it as a flame and a fire that is i think when you listen um
Burnout in the world of successful people
it's um i i have to say i also completely agree that uh you know the things that have mattered
most to me professionally especially as i reflect have been doing as you say doing work i love but then like doing it with people i love
um and a mission that's worthwhile and there's just always people talk about this topic of burnout a lot um
and i tend to believe and i'd like to get your opinion on this i tend to believe that your burnout is somewhat inevitable if
you're doing things that you don't intrinsically love doing especially if you're doing it with people you don't
you know really really love as well and i feel like in any facet of your life if you're doing it too much you don't enjoy it the outcome
is burn out um but is burn out a topic that's been sort of prevalent on your podcast no you know it
i suppose partly the reason why burnout hasn't come up very often is because we're talking to people who are in the midst
of their successes or who have been successful and they love what they're doing and they love what they're doing they're full of passion whereas
people who have perhaps tried to do something that wasn't quite right and have suffered burnout and it hasn't worked
we we don't know about them because the burnout ended the dream but it's so funny that's such a good point
that the fact that your pod you haven't had that come up as a topic on a podcast that speaks to people who have clearly been intrinsically
driven by their passion to the very top of their game passion is everything you know you say you spoke to eddie hearn what's his
what's his podcast no passion no point i mean he is a great advocate of finding something that you believe in
but i also get that again you had a real passion for what you do like i honestly
like i have a such a deep love and a passion for all the things that i'm involved in because if i didn't
then i wouldn't do them or i'd try and find something else but there were times in my life where i've done certain things like i don't
as a tv presenter you often get asked to do like corporates you know standing up at awards and things like that and you
you need to welcome people on stage and shake your hands have a photo and i i find them a real struggle i don't know
why i just don't get a thrill out of doing those things so that's a good thing for me because i
i've noticed that's something i don't like and that for people that are listening to this thinking you know what what's my passion like what am i one of
one of the really good ways of finding you is to look at all the things that is not you
who are the people that don't make you feel good what are the days when you feel drained and exhausted what are the the
trips or the phone calls or the conversations or the lunches where you leave thinking every time i see that person i feel like
this if you can see the see the stuff that isn't good for you and strip that stuff away you will
eventually and it might take a while be left with who you are and that's the time to really then think right
what am i about what am i as a person because i don't think you you can obviously get
tired and you can be in and you can have problems but i think with real passion i don't think you suffer burnout
because every day i seem to get this like so you've not got kids yet right but when you do you have argument you have a
beautiful feet remember when my daughter was born i love her with every piece of my heart right i had this real
fear that when my son was born where's the love going to come from yeah no you do there's a feed that is
it's a quite common thing for parents like my daughter had every single bit of love in my body so my wife
obviously would we're really super close but love for your child is so different it feels very different from the moment
that child is born and i could not have loved my daughter not one percent more so then my son is
about to be born my daughter's gone off to the grandparents and i'm watching my wife in labour thinking i've got nothing left for for sebastian
what's this about sebastian's born and within two seconds i love him equally so there's no
diminishing of the love for my daughter not one bit but all this new love has just appeared
out of nowhere and i could love my son exactly the same how is that possible and it is exactly
the same when you have a real passion or a real love for something like every day that i get up and i'm making
phone calls or i'm having conversations or i'm you know brainstorming or blue sky thinking or thinking about guests or
heading to do live television it's all filler it's filled up again i'm full i'm ready to go
you know i don't feel like i'm like the cup is draining slowly because i love the stuff that i'm doing
and that's a great point because i think people tend to believe that passion is a singular thing yeah and then they're searching for it aimlessly
like it's an easter egg hidden somewhere yeah and that you can drain you can't drain your passion yeah you can have multiple
passions yeah and you know you've met a ton of you know high-profile people on your you
How do you deal with assholes
know from your from your presenting career but also from your podcast i'm sure you've come across a bunch of [ __ ] as well
yes i'm not gonna ask you to i'm not gonna ask you to name them holly tucker on her podcast came out with her you
know what it's like she created not on the highstreet.com she said i'd rather have a hole than an [ __ ] in other words
i would rather hang out with no one than hang out with someone that i don't like which i which i thought was uh which i thought
was a good one but then matthew mcconaughey said do you want an [ __ ] or an idiot give
me the [ __ ] because at least you know where you stand really yeah so he was like at least and
i i do relate to that somewhat the people that i really struggle with in my life are the people who
one day you see them and they're like your best mate the next day it's like you've never met them before i do struggle with that i i like to know
where i stand with people i'm cool if you want if you and me want to have like a distant professional relationship
and you'll send me a text saying happy new year i hope the podcast goes well maybe hook up sometime in 2021
and we never see each other socially and you come back on high performance i come back on here and we use to and throw a bit professionally
that's absolutely that is cool what i don't want is
hey let's have a coffee do you let's meet up in london yeah great oh man it's so nice to see you so how's things how's life we chat a bit more have you got a
partner how's your dog as your life and then you hear nothing for six months and you think whatever happened to that dude
and then they reappear again i'm so sorry for not texting you back there's the truth i feel like you're
shouting um there's the there's the difficult thing for me not knowing where i stand with people i you
know i don't want to be everyone's best friend but i do want meaningful relationships with people and they can be meaningful
from a distance or super intense on that point of arseholes as well i think um what made you what made you ask
that i just i just one of the things i i could you know what it is i remembered one day
you meet a lot of people and when you do this podcasting thing and you you have an initial perception of how they're going to be
and then you meet them and sometimes you know sometimes they're souls i actually don't think i've had anyone on the podcast that was an [ __ ] but i have
had experiences i remember this one day i got in this plane i think i was flying emirates or virgin or something
um and in front of me i saw that guy from the food guy the guy that eats all the
food on tv someone give me his name oh um yeah yeah yeah yeah um everyone in the podcast
man versus food guy yeah man versus food i mean i don't know his name yeah and i don't care about saying this
um and we run this huge food channel at social change so we have you know tens of millions of followers on a food channel
so i text the food team and i'm like oh my god he's on the plane they said i'll go up go up and ask him a question which
is a question we always ask us on our food channel so i went over to ask him this question he was sat in um business i sat in
business as well and he's just he just he looks at me and goes
listen give me a second okay and i'm like whoa so i walk back to my my chair and i have
to tell the 500 people in this like company group oh so i went up to him and this person that you all
absolutely love i've he's just cussed me out um and he will never know the impact he had
on me or the 500 people that i then told and also the you know hundreds of thousand people that i'm
telling right now um if you got to the point though where you're brave enough to call that sort of stuff out because i think that is the important
thing when he's when he does it to his face yeah for me that would be like
ego because you go from you yeah it would be like do you know who the [ __ ] i am or it'd be like
why are you saying that for me the piece was like no reaction yeah because there was no win there was no win
in me calling him out i wasn't going to win so the win for me was saying okay no worries and we're going back to my chair
and also not letting it ruin my day um but but i'm sure you the reason i asked you the question is because you have tons of
guests in your presenting career but also your podcast when you encounter an [ __ ] um i guess how'd you deal with it
you just know that you're there for a stop and not stay i think and you um does it break your heart a little bit
sometimes um when it's someone that you uh admired yeah i suppose so i suppose i don't
worry too much about it because i just think you know what you can you're just not for me and also
like who am i to sort of judge whether their behavior is arseholery if it's clearly a rude and unfair and unkind absolutely
i i now feel like i'm 42 and i'm a parent and i want my kids to operate in a world
where um they can be themselves and they can't be bullied or pushed around i think we're
i'm old enough now and i definitely wasn't like this a few years ago where i can hold my chin up and say that behavior is really not
acceptable would you call someone yeah you would but i wouldn't do it in an arrogant look at me i'm a being a dick
where i just say listen i just think that behavior isn't acceptable and have you done that um yeah
to someone someone i work with you in your presenting career uh yeah name
and address and actually do you know what you find is that often i've done it twice and
both times they've gone yeah i'm really sorry that is actually unacceptable i mean we we had an interesting experience because
my wife used to work in production so heard she was a production secretary which is not very high up the ladder of
people in television and i was a presenter so she would be looking after security
taxis tickets logistics clothing call times all the stuff that makes
television happen but is not the glamorous side and the number of times i would say i met this person today
aren't they great and she'd be like really and then we would meet those people
and i'd be like oh yeah i think you know my wife harriet and they were like oh right yeah hi
because they would be you guys love to come around sometime for some food and harry's like that's not how they were really when they
thought i was just sorting out their travel and that is the definition of an article yes i think it is because you just treat
everyone the same man and they're treating you well because you can potentially benefit them in some way
i don't know it's weird isn't it like why i've got a job on the television why treat me any differently because you're all connected and you can
that is what really annoys me we see that and i saw that in my business over the years and i i came to believe that even with me
leaving the business it won't break the business but i do believe that like so i believe one person leaving a business doesn't break it and you can apply this to your
relationships your life your friendship circle but an [ __ ] staying can me leaving
the business i don't actually think will be as detrimental to a couple of [ __ ] staying in the business not that there are any but
um i know what you mean yeah don't you think though like this is like it sounds naive and
churlish and a bit childish probably from a 42 year old bloke that has a
decent career and runs a few businesses but like i honestly think that we do have the power to make the world
positive and happy despite all the issues because all you have to do is worry about your immediate circle
and that is why i get frustrated with people who spread negativity and criticism and i just i've just got no
space in my life now for negativity from people because i just think if let's say that i know seven people
and i just say you know i'm gonna really radiate a positive energy i'm gonna lift them up i'm not gonna be critical i'm gonna do
everything i can to make them feel like a million dollars the only agreement is that they have to
do the same and you say that to those people listen i'm going to do this thing i'm going to be really super positive and i'm going
to do everything i can to help you and if you ever need something i'm going to be the person that comes and helps you out all i'm asking is that you do it for the
people in your circle be the change see how quick that would radiate yeah so my seven
so if i go if each of them goes to seven you know what i mean yeah no and it just feels stupid doesn't mean that's that's what karma is yeah you
know i don't believe in wishy-washy karma isn't like oh if i help a lady then someone's going to help me in the future but i think from a logical perspective if i help
everyone i encounter maybe they'll be more helpful and that can make its way back around to
maybe my niece you know but you know so true i just i can't see any i can't see any benefit
any benefit to criticism and negativity and like driving other people down someone that get feels better for driving someone
else further down is like for me the absolute epitome they are the worst of them do you ever get jealous
Do you get jealous?
be completely honest uh yeah um i get jealous but i only ever get
jealous through comparison and that is ridiculous you know it's the nasty is it the nasty jealous where you're like
why have they gotten yeah probably yeah yeah but you've got but i think that is innate i think that is
almost there i am giving up responsibility again for someone that talks about 100 responsibility but i think that it's
innate in human nature to to compare and to contrast and look at someone else
so it's not a very long experience for me i will look at someone and i'll go but hey listen i'm so happy
and i've got all this i'm gonna and actually sometimes i look at life as a graph and you literally don't know where life
is gonna take you so let's say like the people that i now sit with in a tv
studio like um i sit with they say when i when i had robin van persie stephen jarrod and rio
ferdinand were all the pundits on bt sport there was a time where all three of those were three of the most famous
footballers in the country earning phenomenal sums of money competing on the world stage representing their country
and i was a a guy post a level failure trying to sort of find a
job and earning six thousand pounds a year and there was a time where they were there and i was there and our graphs over the time have done
whatever's happened look where i've ended up sitting next to them on a tv studio now it may well be that they go up there
again and something happens to me and i go down here or it might be that i do that and they do that but you never know where that graph is
going to go and that is what i think is that for me is one of the most exciting things about this world that we live in
like you are only one step away from a phone call where someone goes hey guess what and your graph goes so don't worry about
where other people are on that graph because it might be in five years time you're right alongside them i guess that's where that that hate a
lot of the hate comes from so if you take the jealousy feelings that even you have as you know one of the nicest people i know and you just you know times it by ten
but you know and that's the you know people feel a certain way about their lives and how their lives are going
that's because it's it's chucked in our faces all the time yeah what is instagram if it isn't a tool for comparison what is it
why are you having a great day and we i and i'm we're jealous of that i'm not jealous we're guilty of it making other
people jealous of what we do but we went out for uh we went for a couple of days away as a family to a
lovely hotel called clifton and it was lovely but the kids for some reason were just badly behaved and it
does happen sometimes and we had this meal it was breakfast actually and they were like it took ages for the food to come
and the kids were like climbing the wall and that's having to say to the waiter at least i'm really sorry but like we've been waiting for 20 minutes which is
fine for me and my wife but the kids yeah they need and it was a posh hotel where you're trying to said you get to
just stay at the table sit and sit nicely don't make too much noise and then at the end of it i was
stressful man and i said hey i'll tell you what the family will want to know where we are so i'll get my phone out and i go kids kids just
smile and we take a photo and we put it we have a family what's up group with harriet's mum and dad my mum and dad all
the cousins all the aunts and uncles right we're all smiling everything looks great just had a lovely breakfast at the hotel
i said and then then we get loads of messages back like from people like my sisters are going oh you're
your life always looks perfect and my brother going oh another great day for you and i think actually yes like i've just
given them an absolute falsification of what my sunday morning cleveland house was like that was a stressful hour and i've taken
the one thing that wasn't stressful why have i put that in the group why haven't i just gone hey guys hope you're having a good sunday call we've just had
a [ __ ] half an hour here having some breakfast but hey don't we all that's and that's what we all do all the
time why else do all the people you follow on instagram put the things they put out there i i've
you know i think the world has somewhat flipped is flipping back the other way in the sense that when we
all started instagram it was this new thing you had these filters and it was like a show the best holiday you've ever had in your
life to the world that was kind of the that's the thing you'd get the rewards for and that represents
in terms of being able to relate to that or it's like 0.00 of the viewer's life like most of
our lives the 99 of our lives as i've said in this podcast before is like eating the pot noodle in bed and now i see that the win with personal
branding and building um an instagram page is the antithesis of showing that it's like
i've just woken up with my face covered in spots in fact the last you know two podcasts ago we had christian here who's like a superstar
influencer entrepreneur and i was trying to understand why her community are so engaged with her so engaged with
her versus even like even compared to mine or other people's and it's because she wakes up in the morning she goes
my face is covered in spots oh my god i'm not gonna put the filter on today and you see the spots on her face and
stuff like that and then she'll cry on her instagram story because her you know her best friend lost her mother and
you really can resonate with that you can and also the amount of supply
on social media of that realness is low demand is super high because it
represents the 99 of our lives supply is super low and uh and people joe wicks is the same he he will
he will tell you everything i feel like [ __ ] today you know and people just and that's the thing i think you can
form a bond with a real deep bond so even as i reflect on my instagram now
i said to my team earlier this week i'm like i need to like go on my instagram story more and do a lot of the stuff that i do on
the podcast which is just like telling you the [ __ ] stuff too yeah um and so i i say this yeah if you want
to build a personal brand i'm like you know you really need to get comfortable with that make you happy though let's go back
to where we began would you make me happy yeah because i know that it would not make me happy i my
instagram isn't a lie it is real but it's real with the things
that i choose to share basically yeah do you know what i mean by the way i have no lunch can i knock yourself down it's actually yeah
this one actually worked this month so it's um what is it this one this is not had one present for you though when
i saw that you've got huels yeah it's just great i was panicking i'd undone it and i was going to flip fuel
all over your lovely rug in here doesn't matter that that would be a cool piece of promo um nutritionally complete
drink yeah yeah yeah i think it's great man so i've eaten nothing today what's the time it's vegan 20 past one so this is perfect for
me now this is my lunch and my breakfast try let me know what you think
this is my favorite flavor of all that's good and if you have this all day
um which i don't know if that's to be recommended but all of your sort of essential minerals
are in there vitamins high in protein so it's 20 grams of protein at the same time slow releasing
carbs spill a bit on your really lovely glass table it's fine don't mind low sugar gluten free yeah it's great
that's nice it's lovely yeah and i drink it because um because i skip meals
that's how i first well i'm trying to intermittently fast because i've seen um other people's six packs on social
media and they make me feel at me okay they make me feel like i just need to
you know right why do you feel the need to share more of yourself on instagram like so yeah so what's the benefit the
Connecting with our audience
benefit is if i share more of my truth all the the tough stuff which is pretty much why i started the
podcast in the first place i feel that i'm helping a lot of people and do i enjoy helping people and
getting um and helping them overcome their problems yes yeah i mean you do that already on this
podcast yeah but i don't do it on instagram and i i think that do i want to have a deeper connection with my audience on
instagram yes what am i doing on instagram predominantly just posting quotes to be honest so if i want to have a deeper connection
with my audience on instagram then i should go deeper with them yeah as i do on this podcast because the podcast audience are like a cult
you know they're super engaged because of the depth and the realness so i think it would make me happy in the
long run there must be a reason i don't do it that's a good point this i mean it's been a huge revelation for me doing a
podcast because when you're a football presenter you don't get nice messages
on instagram you don't get like an engaged core saying this resonated with me that resonated
with me partly because you're not the story you're there to facilitate former pros to be the superstars i mean i liken my
job on the football to like being a referee like if i'm not seen that's probably a good thing i make them look good i make
them feel good and people let's be totally frank tune in to watch the game more people will tune in for man united
the more tuning for norwich city more people won't tune in for me because i'm just
the facilitator whereas with the podcast the nicest thing has been this genuine
conversation connection like creation of a proper community and that's that's been
a totally new thing to me i thought i knew everything that was to know about broadcasting and you know with a million followers on
twitter and an instagram account and running a tv production company and being a tv presenter like i knew what it
was about i knew how to connect to people i've never known anything like it never seen feedback like it never had fulfillment like it
it's amazing is there something crazy about podcasting though versus all other channels and i think it's that depth
the messages you get if i post something on instagram i'll get a oh i can totally relate the podcast you
get a like essay about you know they return with their story
yeah and it's like depth begets depth yeah yeah yeah i totally see what you're saying
and i and it's um it stops it from like because when i
first started the high performance podcast i wanted it just to be me opening up amazing people to benefit
other people and i will now admit part of the thrill of that podcast is seeing the response and seeing
seeing the reaction and i'm i'm not foolish enough to think that isn't my ego at work it absolutely is my ego that
likes it but it is like it's amazing when you see hi i listened to your podcast and i
changed jobs after wanting to do it for 20 years hi i listened to your podcast and i've quit doing something that's
been bad for me for my whole life i've reached out to create relationships with people that are allowed to die
from listening to our podcast bloody hell what's the most emotional moment you've
had with a guest that you can recall on the podcast is there a particular
moment that you know yeah who there's quite a few times that i've kind
of um that i've sort of edged towards tears and i think you know someone i've
already mentioned sean wayne you know when um when someone talks to you about
that sort of the devastation of being physically abused by a parent and
they've got i suppose what was emotional for me was the was the learning during the interview with sean and i
knew very little about him before we spoke the learning that all of the good stuff
he's done you know he talks about if he's got an issue with one of his players he doesn't just have to chat with him after training he turns up at
their house in the evening he says what's the deal man how can i help how can i solve this um
and he is now a parent himself and a really loving and caring parent to have the start in life that sean had
and to for your whole life to be about helping other people that was like
that that was a that was a hugely moving conversation with him yeah i think all of all of the guests
i've had that have um moved me in the same way is almost identical it's nice isn't it i
don't know whether you're like this with podcasts but i love that we have footballers on and don't talk about football
we have rugby players and i don't really talk about rugby um we just talk about it
my podcast is a podcast about life exactly like this one is and we were talking before we started recording today about the
Tips for starting a podcast
the desire to try and avoid the typical talking points with guests and i think this is maybe just a general a general point for people that are
trying to start a podcast you know um there are so many podcasts out there yeah and
in order to what would your tips be then for someone who's considering starting a podcast from what you've learned in your
30 or you know you've you've recorded a total of 50 so far but yeah we've done that live
what tips what did you give to someone who's thinking of starting their own first of all go for it because i honestly what i honestly
was this close to not doing it the great thing about podcasts that you that i didn't have in my life was
ownership so i'd spent my career working for children's bbc working for
formula one and the bbc working for the premier league on bt sport and i sat down with someone they said
like how's your career and i said yes great i'm really happy i love doing the football i love being with the players
and everything and they said what if you've got a phone call tomorrow to say that that had ended what would you be left with
and i was like um today i have to go and find another job they said so what do you own of all
these years of graft and hard work like what's yours and the answer was nothing and then the next question they
you know they obviously knew what they were talking about i said what do you really want to do and i said well i don't really care
if liverpool beat man united or norwich city be ipswich not really but i
love like the effort and the graphs and i love sitting with the pundits i love the way that
rio ferdinand and steven gerrard watch a game of football i love how they turn up looking smart or they bring their own food in little
plastic containers still or the day that i first met lewis hamilton and he walked in the room and he like
took off his watch and he didn't just chuck his watch on the side he got it and he closed up the clasp
and he put it down and he moved it and he goes bracelet off and he went
[Music] i just looked at i thought ah that desire for perfection that elite mindset
mentality i said to them that's what i want i want to speak to elite performers and elite thinkers
because i think that everyone can benefit from that everyone can think and operate and perform better because
there's no tricks there's no secrets like you just need to have the passion and go out and do it
and they said well then that's what you should do a podcast so that was it right great i'm doing a podcast and then i mentioned it to a couple of
people and they went why you can't do a podcast i was like why because everyone does podcasts like there's literally so many
podcasts you can't you're not gonna make a splash there's thousands of podcasts and then i rang an old friend of mine
from children's bbc and she is i don't really even ever told her this but she's the reason i do the podcast
fern cotton who does happy place i said hey i think i'm doing a podcast now she is
such a nice person she is not the sort of person to go oh hold on a rival podcast yeah she'd never even
consider she would oh my god you'd be great at doing a podcast like she spoke about what it was about
and i said but my issue is i just think that like there's loads of them out there and then she was the one that said look
we worked together at children's bbc yeah television had been invented for 50 years there must have been
hundreds of channels thousands of programmes did you think i'm not going to work in telly because there's already loads of tv programs no course you
didn't you just thought well i'm gonna work in telly and make my mark she said you need to do exactly the same thing with your podcast
um so the first thing you is you have to do your podcast you have to go out and do it but the second and that's the biggest
challenge though isn't it starting it's just in every facet of life yeah entrepreneurs contact me and i'm like the biggest risk you face
of all the things that might yeah i think you can do a podcast risk-free though you know you can spend a very minimal sum of money if any money at all
on on the equipment 100 but then you can you can so cheap yeah no you could start
you could do a great podcast in terms of sound quality with less than 100 pounds yeah the risk
though is overthinking it to the point of procrastination to the point of select
paralyzing yourself i think in all facets of life business my dm's are full of people that are like
steve i want to start a business i have an idea i want to start a podcast or this project but there's just this one problem which
is preventing me starting and i always say the biggest risk of the success of your business the number one thing that's going to stop
you becoming a billionaire honestly is the probability that you'll just never start and also
that you'll think you need all of the answers to all of the questions you have before you start yeah well i don't know this i don't have the
funding i don't like when i started my business i was 18 didn't know the word entrepreneur no money went on google and typed in
like how to build a website spent three months googling it but that was me starting you know um and i think it's the same
with podcasting i'm like my first episode was dog [ __ ] i was downstairs inside
what is it when telly would say the first is the worst you know that's the way it is that's the way it has to be but the point is
you got going you started and i think you need to begin and then you need to be consistent and
you need to keep going and don't expect instant success and instant gratification but i think the other thing for it like i get a lot of
i get a lot of people sending me letters saying i want to be on the television
and i always reply in the positive because i always say well someone has to be doing my job
in 20 years time when i'm 62 i will not be presenting the premier league on bt sport i just won't be someone has to be could
be you why not make it you make the decision now that it's going to be you that's the next well-known sports tv broadcaster and
then i remind them that when i started out in 1998 99 to be on the telly to be a
broadcaster you actually needed a job that was not very easy to go and get now
you can pick up your phone and you're a broadcaster you can have a youtube channel you can have an instagram handle
you can have a twitter page you can have a podcast as long as you've got a passion because
you then funnel everything into that passion and everything feeds everything else so the instagram handle points people towards
the podcast the podcast is fantastic so people go and watch the podcast that you've recorded on
youtube and then you start to build an audience there and you make a little bit of money and it slowly starts to build
be consistent but have the passion have the thing that's different like i will get maybe 10 times a week hi jake
um i just wonder whether you would come and be on our podcast we just want to talk about you know your journey and how
you got to where you are now it'd be really great to have a chat and you roll your eyes and it's like man you've got to be better than that
everyone can go and have a conversation about your journey and the highs and the lows and the struggles
what's the niche what's the team yeah so tell me anything tell me what someone would have to say to you that has
basically no listeners or is starting out that would make you go on their podcast because like passion would be absolutely
definitely about their passion and i have done plenty of podcast interviews in the last year where there hasn't been a big audience
but i've really loved the fact that the person has come to me known a lot about me and said i really
want to explore this particular area with you i think just the broad brush stroke of can we just talk about your inspiration and
talk about your upbringing and talk about how you first got into broadcasting yeah let's like i'm a bit like this now
and everything i do like even when i'm broadcasting i'm not interested in canon united win the league i am much more interested
in um looking at one of the players marcus rashford for example and having a really proper
deep conversation with paul scholes and rio ferdinand like explain to me how hard it is for him to
concentrate on football when he's got so many people criticizing him on social media for doing the school
dinners or how difficult is it for him to run out of old trafford and really
perform at a high level when he hasn't got 80 000 people how much of a difference does it really make to have the crowd at
old trafford they're inspiring you and driving you on like that is a much much more of an interesting
conversation for me because it feels much more real yeah than just the general stuff so that would be my advice to people is
make it really specific make it really passion based and there's that big about like having
How to contact high performance people
you want them to show evidence that they've done their research on you so because listen people send emails invite you
onto a podcast or dms whatever but most of our lives um and the success of our lives
as least as i can recount it in my journey has been predicated on me knowing how to ask someone for something
that they really didn't have a huge clear incentive to give me yeah asking in the right way so we're not just
talking about inviting jake onto podcasts here we're talking about how you ask for something how you knock on a door that uh you know
maybe is a bit above you at that point i think that often you get a lot of respect there
just for asking the question and i think i think the other thing is for people to remember when they're in our position
you've been in that position as well like you have been there and don't expect them to be perfect by the way
like everything that you now find easy about sitting here and recording this podcast once you didn't find easy
yeah you found it a struggle that's the really important point and those people are often right at the beginning of their journey and they're
finding their way and why can't you give them 10 minutes even if you can't go on their podcast stephen why can't you just go do you
know what just give me your number i'll give you 10 minutes 10 minutes of your day is nothing could change your entire life
so there's a lot of people asking for 10 minutes this is the problem and if you add it up there's then we don't have much time left for anything else and i i sometimes think to myself
if i gave all of these people 10 minutes i wouldn't be the type of person that they'd be asking for you can't do stuff you don't have time
to do but you probably can do 10 minutes once in a while a couple of times a day yeah
the thing that annoys me a couple of times with the dm's the night once in a while yeah once a couple times a day yeah
anyway yeah do you know i'm doing it anyway for like i told you about my friend that called me with a problem like so i give him 20 minutes to solve
the problem with him i'm doing that all day every day and my employees all at social change now that i've left contacted me more than
i think they did it when i was there asking me how to solve problems with each other with the company what
should we be doing so yeah i still feel like i'm mentoring a lot of people don't always look for like the
instant value and stuff no i know that when someone rings you and goes um stephen i know i'm a social
chain and i know i wasn't very high up the chain at social chain but and i know you've left i [ __ ] love
what you did a couple of quick questions right yeah you might look at it and go do you know what i remember that person i just
haven't got the time i've got to get in the gym right let's say you did yeah what you've done is you've seen the value to you
in that moment of giving them 10 minutes of your time what about if that person then goes on and thinks
wow i've been so impressed by what i've done at social channel i'm going to set up my own business i'm going to do this and suddenly the snowball effect comes
and then in a couple of years time you get the phone call steve and i'd love you to be on the advisory board of this business i set up because i actually set
it up because you gave me a bit of inspiration a few years ago there's the value you never see it's invisible if you don't give them the few
minutes at that time i call it hand it out man invisible pr yeah you never see it in the moment you never
see the impact it's having but when it matters the most it will show up so for example the guy told you about from man vs food
we have a huge food channel and we're looking for hosts for this food channel that would potentially get paid a ton of money
and in that one moment he will never see he saw the value giving you 10 seconds in that moment and then with
no value yeah but but now he's clearly going to be excluded from the process of deciding who hosts the food channel yeah just because of that
10 seconds he'll never know because it's invisible pr um but what i see what does make me annoyed is i'll get messages from
someone and i'll say steve i swear to god i got this message i screenshotted and said it's my friends because it
it's synonymous of the wrong approach steve um i'd love to know uh how you did what you
did i've produced thousands of videos podcasts interviews
blogs on how i did what i did there's actually a video called like how i built a 200 million company or whatever
and for me when someone says that i think you don't actually want to know because
if you really wanted to know you would have put that into google yeah or you would have put more effort in you're being super lazy and then i said
to the guy i saw it you're not fine got the video where i explained how i didn't i did what i did and i sent it to him he goes uh you know
you should write a book i
maybe he just doesn't yet know what he doesn't know and if you showed him these these little
bits in 10 years time he'd be embarrassed and maybe if you looked at some of the early interactions you had with people
you'd be embarrassed about what you i know i would some of the emails i sent i've i so i have a really old hotmail account
that i've had literally since the beginning of time and i don't use it anymore but sometimes it's quite cathartic for me to go back into that hotmail account
zoop back to the very beginning we're talking about emails i was sitting in 2001. and i'm surprised man i get my tone
wrong and i'm a bit bulshy and i'm a bit pushy and i think this doesn't sound or
seem like me maybe i just think benefit of the doubt man always benefit of the doubt and i'm not
saying you need to bust your balls and spend two days giving this person a private seminar but definitely do i mean i think it's
great you replied and just reply go listen here's all the stuff that i've done but when he replies and says
you should write a book a he's giving you a compliment b he might be a bit nervous you know the
problem is so there's thousands and thousands of people like this on a weekly basis yeah so my
my decision as to who to help or to who to engage with is based on the message they send
and if someone says some people would message me go so um so what is social change come on like if
you just googled it yeah if you if you clicked on the word in my bio there's a description of exactly what it
is but people will still and for me that's laziness because if i like i can't think
of a point in my life where if i wanted to know whether i was 16 or 26 whether if i
wanted a piece of information i would have just my my attempt at getting it would have just been to
message the person you know the public figure whatever you say so uh how did you uh win that uh formula one
championship lewis i would have at least tried you know what i mean do you think there's an issue here with um
like with a social media now there's a complete lack of formality so like when you and i were growing up and we wanted
to run a business that someone had set up and sold for hundreds of millions you literally could not get to that person
unless it was a real graft to get there so by the time you did manage to get an email address for some ceo of some big
business it had been such a journey you weren't going to lose the opportunity or waste the opportunity
because it had taken you two or three months just to get to the point of being able to send something part of the issue now is the people who
want information from you literally this is how long it takes steven bartlett
direct message h-i-s-t-e-v hi steven um can i know about your
business right that's taken me 30 seconds that's how long it is so that's why
the quality of effort is so low because because they're just used to it that's how we now communicate with each other but then the other thing
is 20 years ago when you were trying to get hold of a ceo of a big business
there was quite a good filtration process so that by the time you got the email address of that guy or that woman at the top of that
business it was a journey you would have had 20 knockbacks 10 or 15 setbacks blah blah blah blah blah
so actually the person that got those email addresses were the grafters man and the ones that were
finding the route and finding the path and it shows though that the most important thing one of the
2020 growth hacks for your career is knowing how to ask yeah because everyone everyone has now
got the email or the dm but there's a real art in knowing what to say when you're in there
i know that people like you are getting a lot of messages every day all of the same quality but that's great
because it's easy to stand out if you want to say a good thing if you send me a voice note that jumps
up in the queue if if the voice note is um well researched as you say jumps up in the
queue further if you're asking here's the thing for me it's like if you're asking me for something and you're making some attempt to
acknowledge the fact that um that you know i don't have a lot
of time that also jumps up in the queue because i think you this person's a little bit more you know savvy and it's being more realistic um but yeah it
makes a huge difference coral yeah i want to talk about this so
What are you working on?
i eyewear brand i received these lovely um sunglasses in the post and as i said to you before
we got on out i'd usually look a little bit weird in sunglasses but this pair of sunglasses and i'm not just saying this
and i actually said this behind your back as well so this is how you know it's legit right um i actually think i look quite cool
you do look good yeah and i would never wear sunglasses like this normally because i couldn't find
the right shape yeah tell me all about coral and and what this is this is your first sort of significant investment yeah it's the first time i've ever
invested in a business really obviously whisper group is different because i was a founder and we set that up together
um but i've wanted for a long time to do what i can to help people who are perhaps in a
position where i can have some influence on their lives so about a year ago i set up a scholarship
with the uea the university of east anglia in norwich it's pretty simple when people apply for
the film and tv course they're means tested so they have to fill in a form so we can find out their
family income and if the family income is below a certain level i will pay five grand a year every year
that they're at university so 15 grand over the time of their course to make it affordable for them to go to
uni so it's literally my way of finding people who wouldn't get a chance in the tv industry it's similar to the ethos we
have at whisper like we want to lift up people that are underrepresented and i think there's amazing tv talent out
there and they literally will never get the opportunity to have a tv career purely for financial means and that
really makes me sad so i set that up and then i had this great relationship with the uea and they introduced me to a
young guy called george bailey and he's a 19 year old student he's 20 now at the uea
and he had this idea for recycled eyewear and it is literally taking fishing that's out of the sea
taking plastic out of landfill and turning them into eyewear and ice and i said you know what george
like that's a really good idea i really like it but it will be everywhere already because it's so
simple because when we sort of run through the numbers there's something like nine million pairs of eyewear sold in the uk every
year almost all of them virgin plastic covered in lacquer full of glue full of
metal bad for the environment not doing any good for the planet at all
so i sort of heard what he said and thought this would be happening already and i was actually in london for a meeting with my agent in west london i
thought the perfect place for recycled sustainable eyewear brand is west london so i went into all of the high street
eyewear places that you could possibly imagine you know david klullo and um sunglasses
hut and all of these others on oxford street and bond street i was in that area and i said the same thing every time i walked in hi
can i see your range of recycled eyewear blank faces can i see your green range
your sustainable range the same nothing response and i was straight on the phone to george i said
listen we need to make this happen we really need to make this happen and we're not the only brand in the world
making eyewear from recycled material but we're the only brand who have gone
and got our own eyewear designer so it's original designs handmade in a factory in italy we then
offset all the carbons when that gets delivered to you there's not been a single hit on the planet from the carbon and
the plastic has been taken out of the world to create those the lenses are infinitely recycled and
we have a system where you send the lenses or the whole eyewear back to us and we can recycle them so it all goes again
so the phrase i use is planet positive it's not just like not putting pollution into the planet it's actively removing
plastic and turning it into something that you would otherwise have gone and purchased um and look we're a startup we're small
it'll be a slog and it'll be a battle but i wouldn't have got involved like everything else i've been talking to you about if i
didn't passionately believe that those are the answer none of us go shopping now
without a plastic bag in our hand already or a reusable tote bag or whatever but none of us think twice before we go
and buy a pair of sunglasses and coral i wear i want to be the answer the case there that's made from plastic
oh this case or this case yeah that's recycled plastic the cloth inside recycled plastic you'd never know would
you no even one of the things that really struck me as well is how high quality it all feels like it feels super luxury like the
the case and then well that's the thing we want we also didn't want people to think yeah i want to sort of help the environment but i'll have to look a bit
rubbish we actually want people to think i can still buy a really nice high-end high-quality bit
of eyewear you got a little note there from george yeah what's he said on this says hey there thank you so much for choosing coral and our vision to make
the eyewear industry kinder to our planet smiley face george that's super nice
yeah no i i was you know i was i was nervous because when friends send me things and then he probably sometimes i don't say yeah and i'm i'm
known for being really honest with my friends um and saying oh i don't really like this about it or whatever because i just think the truth sets you
free and that's what people really value as you said earlier it's like the the critique is often um more valuable at certain stages than
just total praise one word you said earlier that i has become incredibly important in my
The importance of consistency
mindset these days is the word consistency yeah um maybe from meeting exceptional guests
maybe just from understanding the root cause of my own accomplishments but um i you know i used to think that
intensity was was the answer but if you look at all of the success that i've had whether it's getting a million followers
on instagram or social channel whatever it was it was that word and i never really appreciated the importance of
that word up until recent i think when i was writing my book what have you learned about consistency i've learned
exactly as you have that consistency is the root of all good stuff because if you find
something that works for you you have to do it consistently like i used to say consistently relentless
i regret the use of the word relentless a little bit now i i do think you have to be relentless but i now change it to you have to be
consistently happily relentless and if you can be consistently
happily relentless i don't think you will go far wrong because you'll be doing a passion project which
is what makes you happy you will be consistently doing things and consistency is absolutely key for people to understand what you're
about and let's be totally frank we can sit here and be fluffy and friendly and say oh you know let's not
push people too hard in the modern world because it might cause issues and whatever you do have to be relentless
for success but it's okay to be relentless if you're being relentless and you're happy being relentless
so try in 2021 to be consistently happily relentless and let's see where
we all are in 12 months time i have one more question for you it's probably a question people don't really
Addressing the gender imbalance
talk about in the podcasting game but um we have struggled at times to get
women to come on the podcast yep um for a variety of different reasons
men seem much more willing than women have you found the same thing yeah we have yeah it's
interesting you should say that yeah we have i don't think that we have found women
not willing to come on the podcast i think it's only when you start doing a podcast about
relentless high achievement that you realize how dominated by men
the tops of our industries are yeah that's the problem and i you know we keep on saying right who should we get on as really great
inspirational female leaders and all the suggestions people keep making to us are in the sports space i keep saying no not sports women
because we are totally i am totally plugged into the fact that i want to celebrate
brilliant successful females you know i have a daughter and i want her to listen to this podcast in years to come
when she's old enough and go that's who i want to be that's what i want to be inspired by and i think that sometimes we like to
trick ourselves into thinking oh no we live in a really equal society now what are you talking about there's loads of powerful females at the top of
businesses when you break it down we are still in a male dominated society
and it's a good reminder that we need to keep on lifting up female role models and pushing them to
the absolute top and we are on the high performance podcast we are totally aware of that um and we will
continue to do what we can because actually when we get brilliant female leaders on
there and we just recorded with joe malone um who set up the amazing joe malone brand she now runs
joe loves we've recorded with holly tucker who was fantastic dame kelly holmes who was really inspirational and moving steph horton is
going to be on the series in the not too distant future we've had brilliant female
leaders on our pod but it is still a challenge compared to the amount of
male leaders lining up going i'll definitely come on there and talk and there is something else that maybe
we need to address in the next 12 months black women at the top of business mate
where are they why what is happening that is not allowing them to shine as they should
and that's one thing and i just say one thing that really is pissing me off massively at the moment is when people talk about the
over-representation of black and mixed-race or female role models in society
and they say oh everywhere you turn now you know that's all this and i drive this home to the whole time i say listen you've got this completely wrong
the reason why we now have to promote and push and celebrate and shout about black men and black women
and women in general and underrepresented areas of society is that if you are a
little kid growing up in norwich or manchester or birmingham or
los angeles you have to see those people there to believe that you can get there as well
there's no good saying oh yeah they'll eventually make it through we have to show them now that you can no matter who you are no
matter what the color of your skin no matter what your gender no matter what your background no matter how affluent you are
you can get there and that's why we have to push them to the forefront now to inspire the next generation because
once they're there they'll stay there and it'll be a much better more equal society for everyone we've both got a big responsibility yeah
with our platforms yeah and it and we should we absolutely should listen thank you for your time no one
was incredibly busy it's always nice to sit down yeah thanks for lunch no it's always
fascinating and i i you know you're discovering um incredible stories through your own podcast high performance and
it's uh it's really powerful to kind of compare notes sometimes with with people uh
because yeah my one of the things i've learned from doing the podcast which i'm sure you have as well is that the themes that have made people
successful and giving them that high performance mindset are actually quite consistent yeah yeah yeah i think when i
started my podcast i was expecting to find 50 different ways you know to become
successful but it all seems to be distillable down to these simple themes like you know consistency and discipline and
passion and then for me anyway much of the root cause of that consistency or that obsession with
that passion has come from often in many circumstances something that might not have gone
right yeah on the playground or some insecurity they had or something their dad or mum said to them
um and that for me is fascinating but yeah thank you again for your time it's pleasure and um it just reminded me that we're all on a
journey right and i said to harriet when i was coming on here today i said oh i'm going back on diary of a ceo with steven
and she said again what are you going to talk about because you only went on there a few months ago and you know when i now sit here and
talk to you i'm a different person to the one that you spoke with before i began doing my podcast before i began doing my
stuff with coral airway even in the last year i feel like i'm sitting here as a different person
and i didn't realize that you could learn and change and develop and adapt quite so much quite so late so man look
joe biden took him until he was 77 until he nailed it as the president you know sometimes you have to wait a
long time in life for your dream job or your dream opportunity what has changed since we last spoke for you in terms of who you are just a much
deeper understanding of how other people operate i hadn't
i've spent my life hadn't like on my own journey me as a presenter me learning me setting up a business
what am i gonna do the high performance podcast was the first time i'd ever sat down and just said from the outside this is
what i think you're doing can you just explain it please what a growth period it's been for me personally
absolutely unbelievable and therapy at the same time right yeah it's therapeutic absolutely um

Transcription:

oh my god eddie hearn what a guy there's very few people no
i'm gonna change that i've never met someone as neurotically obsessed with success
and with winning and with accomplishing things and with living a life in constant forward motion
as my next guest eddie hearn and it's remarkable because when you unpack the reasons for that
obsession and that dedication to being more and achieving more there's quite a fragile vulnerable
insecure story that's something i've noticed with a lot of my guests
and it often makes me think that the most successful amongst us aren't necessarily choosing to be
something's happened to them that's left them with no choice eddie han is one of the most notorious
sports promoters in the world he's the king of boxing in this country he is known for his no context and twitter
page which i'm sure a lot of you have seen but what i wanted to do when i sat down with eddie herm was to get
underneath to get underneath the external sort of braggadocious loud
promoter side of him and to find out even in the case of someone like eddie who is loud who is
successful who is ambitious who is a promoter are the same things true for him that
are true for you the insecurities the vulnerabilities the mental health issues
and how much does he really understand himself my conversation with eddie was incredibly enlightening but it also
wasn't that surprising so without further ado i'm stephen bartlett and this is the diary of a ceo
i hope nobody is listening but if you are then please keep this to yourself
What made you so relentless
you've done a ton of interviews especially over the last couple of weeks and there's this really consistent theme
that i felt in all of the interviews i watched i watched you at cambridge the high performance podcast loads of them and um and then before we came
uh started filming today i had a chat with frank and he fully grasped on you know what he
said to me which i which was also consistent with these interviews is that you are relentless and he was
telling me he's he's had some um i probably shouldn't say this but he was telling me he's i've started having this uh is it
night owl or night night because eddie will text me in the middle of the night and he went i'll tell you one thing
about eddie he is relentless you're what 40 41. 41 years old what's made you
that relentless at 41 years old to the point where you're you're uh pestering your colleagues at 3am in
the morning i don't know really um i think when i when i did the book it was like it was quite a good um sort of
counseling session with myself because i wasn't really great at school i wasn't particularly a
hard worker at school i loved the pound note always and when i wrote the book it just i
started writing about my childhood and what it was like growing up and how i
was molded and i think a lot of it comes down to the fact that i love to win and i'm a why did you love to win i
don't know because with my dad that's what we did so when we played cricket when we played
football when we played table tennis when we sparred with each other it was like for me growing up
you weren't you know i would come back from a match say i played cricket and he would go to me and actually my mum was
the same and he would say to me how many runs you get today son and i would say ah four ah useless come on
next time knock in a fifty right it was never oh well well done son you know you took
part that's what really matters that they taught me taking part is completely and utterly
irrelevant you win and ultimately sport is how i was brought up i was brought up on the
foundations of sport the lessons of sport the winning the losing you know the highs the lows but always
taught that winning was everything so i i'm a failed athlete you know i think any kid growing up would love to
be a sportsman now i played qriket at a very good level but i was never good enough for anything so
this is the next best thing but i think if you're not trying to win in life and win winning
it means something different to everybody success means something different to everybody some people view success as being able
to get their pay packet on a weekend you know be able to you know spend time with her family
and have enough food on the you know make enough money to have food on the table and make sure everything's okay at
home and and be happy you know and have a happy life with no no stress or no drama that's success to
a lot of people but people's interpretation of success is very different and you know for me i i still don't know why
i i i do i know i know why i do this but
like you say i love it i guess that's what it comes down to a passion for what you do and i don't know what the passion is is
it the passion that i love the sport of boxing is it the passion that i want to succeed against you know and
be bigger than my dad i think that's a big part of it as well or is it just that i love to win or is it that i'm a bit sick in the head maybe
all of them the sick and the head point i want to play with that idea a little bit um i write i i write in my book actually
we have the same publisher i wrote in my book that the thing that invalidates you when you're younger becomes the thing you seek validation
from when you're older and what i meant by that is like in my childhood because we didn't have money um and i
was this black kid in a school of 1500 white kids everything that we didn't have became the things that i chased when i was
older or the thing that made me feel somewhat invalid sometimes when i was a kid like you were saying about your dad saying well you lost today became the
thing that i would seek validation from as as a as an adult and i wondered if that resonated with you at all i mean like
well i had a different background i mean my dad was poor became rich and i was born so
i've said before it's not like when you talk about generational wealth we didn't have generational wealth
um i had a dad who was from dagenham was from a council estate his dad was a
bus driver and then i grew up in this sort of nouveau world where this bloke
had made his money and he was you know i take the mickey out of him i suppose he was a bit of a chav you know he was like from dagnam and all
of a sudden he's got ferraris and big cars and we used to have a white limo and a black limo
that would drive like the snooker players around and the fighters around and i was horrible i was obnoxious imagine like
a 14 15 year old kid hanging around with eubank and naz and then you're in the limo with your mates going up to london
or to romford for a night out i mean i'll look back and just cringe but mine was different you know and and
i guess when it comes down to it and you know again from the book and speaking and speaking to people like frank lampard he
went to my school um he was in the year above me at my school i was barry hern's son and frank lampard was
frank lampard's son you know his dad played for west ham he was and it's a different kind of drive
if you can make it flow in the right way you know when you're talking about sort of mindset and and and hustle
where all of a sudden i think so many people with successful parents
end up just doing okay you know but how do you go beyond that how do you
outperform everything that he done and i will and i feel like i've done that in many ways but i will never be able to outperform
the fact that he came from nothing my friends uh my friend is in a very similar position you if i said my
friend's name you'd know the guy okay his dad is a multi-billionaire i know you know him because i've seen you with him before actually in new york
but um his dad is a multi-billionaire and he grew up with living in the shadow and his dad was the same and i had a
conversation with him and he said um it was all i was always trying to be better than my dad he is now
a billionaire himself of his own doing um but it's just it's fascinating that and
he's that dad sounds very similar to what your dad sounds where his dad was tough on him tough on him i think they're tough on
you because they don't want you to be that spoiled kid i mean you always want to
um spoil your kids you know you want to give them the great even now you know i've got two daughters i love to spoil i work hard so i can
give them a great life but i just want them to understand manners respect and discipline these are the
three most important things and he would make sure that i would understand that even by having me working
you know giving me a clout every now and again you know trying to keep because i it must have been frustrating for him
because i was probably all the things that he resented when he was growing up and the
rich kid oh with with parents who had got big house and cars and
and i would have hated me at school you know but he would have looked at me and that's why he was so disciplined with me and you know i was
in his slipstream growing up so i would sit you know we're here now that's that was my house over there
so he would get home from work if he was in the country you know he would always go out and give me a game of football cricket
and then he would go in the office all night on the phone and i would have dinner and i would just sit in the office you know i might have a ball just
throwing up in the air but i would some subconsciously listen to the arguments and you know him losing his temper and and
just listen not because i wanted to learn just because i was there and you're talking there about the
The sacrifices in-order to be successful
sacrifice of his success which is one of them as you've highlighted is less time with
your family you are relentless um everybody says that what is the the cost of being a
relentless person you have to be incredibly selfish you have to you know for me family is the most
important thing but i have to be brutally honest and say i don't let even family get in the way
of things that i have to do you know and that that can make you an [ __ ] and it can make you sound
terrible but i just don't know any way around it there is no way you can be the perfect husband
or the perfect father and run a successful business or you know be a you know
a relentless operator it's impossible because i know because i try to balance both but when you're flying
back from america from a show and you land at seven o'clock in the morning and then you go to manchester for a press conference
and you come home and you just make it to pick them up from school and then you get back and they say dad let's go over the park and
you're just absolutely on empty and your phone's going and you're trying to do another deal and
you know you're pushing the swing and you're going like this trying to send a message at the same time it's impossible you know listen i know
because sometimes my eldest daughter is old enough to say dad please get off the phone
and that's that kills me because that's uh that's bad to hear you know i'm like okay okay but then for 30 seconds later
i'm back just haven't looked down because it's a lifestyle you know and it's impossible to be great
at anything without making sacrifices you know it doesn't matter if you're a fighter if you're a sports when you speak to old
successful people you can't be everything it's impossible you know and and but what you don't want
to do is you don't want to disregard your obligations your family obligations because they are extremely important
but you also need a wife or a partner who's understanding enough to say this is what i know what he's like he
won't stop and that's why when frank talks about the 3 a.m 4 a.m that's because a lot of the time
i'm sort of making up for the hour or two that i've lost out playing with the kids so i'll put them to sleep they'll go to
sleep at nine half nine you know chill out with a wife for an hour she'll go to sleep and then
i'm up and now with the growth in america it means that at 4 p.m 5 p.m the west coast wakes up so i can't
go to bed i can't disappear when it gets to 11 a.m or on the west coast or or midday on
the west coast because they want to speak to me and we want to do business i am much earlier in my career maybe 15
years earlier in my career and um i've struggled with romantic love for the very same reason that for the
last decade i've like slept in the office multiple weekends i've been obsessed um i would
basically sacrifice everything and there became this moment in my life where i think it was maybe the day that
someone tried to buy the company and i thought about what i'd spend it on and i remember going home and i swear on
my mother's life i went on right move and auto trader at the same i had two tabs open and i'm like the lamborghini tinder no
no no no no that's that that always follows the lamborghini so i was looking at this lamborghini in this mansion the
countryside and then i thought if i buy these things i'm trading like this purpose i have this job this you know
for for this lamborghini and this mansion and it felt really really empty and then i thought
that steve you know when you were 18 and you were broke and you had no money 18 year old steve said wrote in your diary that's why it's
called the diversity that you wanted the sports car the million before you were 25. this was what we did it for
and then it threw my head into this like confusion it's like if if it's not that if that's gonna make me feel empty
they call it like um gold medal depression where michael phelps won all the medals and then got depressed um then what's it all for and and then i
thought and then also when does it all end like when does it end well it doesn't end because and actually
you you're always searching this is this is a problem and something you have to be careful of because when you are trying to succeed
and when you're trying to become great actually the great people they never feel content with achievement
and i'm very much like that frank lampard again going back to him he said that when he won the champions league she always dreamed to win in the
champions league and he stood there with a trophy and he felt nothing i mean he felt happy
but definitely not content definitely not i've cracked it that might go back to the sickness you
know that we talked about earlier and when we talk about sickness i mean not probably not medically sick but sick in
the head a little bit to a point where i get it all the time you know we say that you know we wanted to do
you know when aj turned pro we wanted him to be the world heavyweight champion you know he won that great we was in the
ring after jumping up and down as soon as we got out of the ring the ma yeah and then it's like okay we
want to do something you know we've got the klitschko fight okay you go through it 90 000 at wembley you stand there everyone that
was at the event tells you it's a great sporting occasion they've ever been to how do you know uh at the time
amazing in the ring amazing you know and then not even the day after it's i i never i
never go out really and i never drink really after a show because that's probably you know
depressed is the wrong word but you i go back you know i finish the media obligations two three o'clock in the morning go back
to the hotel and that is when i'll sit there get into bed and then obviously you can't sleep because the buzz and the
adrenaline and that's when you just feel a little bit low and empty is that okay
it's over same with what you talk about with phelps it's the highs versus the lows you can't just
experience the highs and then be happy with the lows so you want more and more and more and more and i
i'm my i'm my own biggest critic and i'm also very pessimistic which is strange to a lot of people but
i kind of use it to play tricks on myself to keep myself driven so when i do something or when i plan
something i always say to myself there's going to be problems i think it's going to go wrong i doubt this will
happen you know i don't know why i do it but it just helps me to battle away to overcome everything to get to the place
and then when i achieve something which others might think is great i say to myself that's nothing you've
got a long way to go because i'm scared of sitting back you know with the the cigar on the beach
again i've cracked it you can't touch me you know and we got to a position with uk boxing where
you know we are virtually untouchable but i just don't want to be that guy who takes the foot off the gas i want to
bang every single nail in the coffin you know and then move on to another market and another market another market
but you do get the worry with that mindset is you may look back when you're 80 or 90
and go wow you know look at everything you've done you never really enjoyed it did you i mean i love what i do
but you probably should savor it a little bit more than you do but again it goes back to that mindset of being so
driven you want the next drug success is a drug but you've got to be careful that it
doesn't turn you into an [ __ ] at the same time because how many successful people do you know absolutely
horrible rude no manners obnoxious what's it done do you ever find moments where you think
[ __ ] i was just an [ __ ] then i think that it's just time for people you know you end up being
it's not that you can turn into that if you're not one but
when you become busy it's a bit like you know when people say that oh he's changed of course he's changed his life's
changed you know his responsibilities change his business has changed you can't expect him to say the same
people and you know when you have a group of friends when you all come out of school and sort of going from there and
you're talking every day and the ones that sort of grow [Music]
the friendships are still as strong but you just don't talk to each other every week every day because you've got
your own life you've got your own vision you've got your own plans but you still go for lunch and you get on better than ever and you met but
and it's the ones that say oh he's not no he's don't talk to us anymore i ain't got time mate but this just goes back to the sacrifices
you know if i fall out with friends because of what i'm trying to achieve in
my own personal life and my business so be it i know again that that sounds
you know and it's not about being a bad friend or a bad person but you you can't you can't worry about
other people as long as you're a good person as long as you do the right thing the fact that you don't have time at the moment
but that's when you people might perceive you to be an [ __ ] yeah you talked a little bit about that
Deathbed thinking
about being 80 years old and looking back on your life i'm gonna just play a little uh a little game with you so we've got to imagine um
imagine that what day of the week was i think it's tuesday today tuesday so friday you find out that friday's
your last day on earth my question is and really put yourself there right so friday's your last donut all
the fights coming up aj fury all falls away what do you immediately regret
that's actually something that i've thought about quite a lot and the reason was is um about
four months ago my granddad passed away it was 93 great life you know and when i went to see him in his last
couple of days you know he obviously didn't look great and i looked at him i thought wow life's
crazy in it i said everything that you've done in your life
and now you're laying here about to leave so when you get experiences like that
just you have to be reminded sometimes that this is a game life is a game we're only on borrowed
time right and you can never take yourself too seriously i think that's one thing i do well is i love to have a laugh and i don't
take myself too seriously um in answer to your question
since that moment i've been thinking a lot about if i you know if i went now do you look back
and say i couldn't have done any more i had a great time and i think the answer is yes i mean we could all do we can all do
better but my dad is an inspiration that respect because he's the kind of person that couldn't have squeezed one more
drop out of his life right so i'm quite envious of that he's 73
and who knows how long he's gonna last but i do feel like it's very important that when
you get to whatever stage when god says that's enough for you that you are able to look back and
say i couldn't have done any more. and that scares me a little bit because i want to know exactly what
when you think about more you're saying i could have done more you find out that this friday is your
last day what are the things where you think do you know what because i think that the
that moment like the the death bed moment puts everything in perspective it does but i think in that moment your
emotions are very different to when you're well and fit and on the hustle and just you know so
you don't get a chance to reflect on that kind of moment until you're there yeah and the obvious reflection at that
point is i wish i would have spent more time on my family you know i wish i would have been less focused
probably on work but i'm not a believer in you know the thoughts then
are not the thoughts now and you have to act on the moment you can't live your life saying well blimey when i'm on my
deathbed you might look back in because i don't i don't think you can plan like that you have to do what's in your heart you have to do what feels
right and what feels right for me right now is this sure what what might feel right then is
do you know what should have probably missed a few trips really and just done the school run a little bit more and
and i know that you know you you have to you really have to understand where you are in life this is great for your
mental health as well and your sanity you got to be honest with yourself and and you gotta understand the situation
i know exactly where i'm at what i'm thinking what i'm doing the sacrifices i'm making
what i could do better at what you know but i'm okay with it you know you can't get the perfect
balance but as long as you understand what is going on and you're not deluded
you're not stubborn yeah i know i know i need to do more at home
i know i need to do more school runs i know i need to be less short with the wife sometimes but can you
there's a couple of points here that i think are super interesting so um that death bed moment what i think it's
doing and i've never been there you've not been there but what i think it's doing is it's telling you what actually mattered
because to some degree i think that it's it's like with that hindsight you can say [ __ ]
that person criticizing my hair or my cut or this none of that [ __ ] ever mattered all of that was trivial but the things that
mattered was you say like my niece or my you know so i think that's what that moment so that comes over time how do you now
2017. okay you're a baby yes right when i was 27 what what people thought of me really
mad you know i mean listen i've been working out for 35 years just to stay fat
you know it's going a little bit i could not give her monkeys now at your age oh wait i was
you know i might have been jack the lad i might have been turning out that but deep down you know i'd only take one of the boys
to say you know tell you what edge you're putting on a bit of timber there oh look look you're barnett's creeping back
what what do you mean what do you mean now okay yeah mate i know listen signing the times isn't it so
being comfortable with yourself is the best feeling in life you know it's the best feeling in life and i
think when i was growing up at school i wasn't subconsciously i think i had a massive chip on my shoulder and that's why i was
a bit of a bit of a knob to be to be quite honest but when you get comfortable with yourself it's a
beautiful thing in life it really is you know when you wake up in the morning and you've always got to try for me and look
good and feel good and be the best version of yourself you can be but you do get to a stage and that's actually when you become really powerful
and effective you know it's the same kind of thing you know when you're young and you're courting or you're looking for
a young lady to show you some interest you know when you try really hard and you're sort of on edge and you be
don't really like my hair or oh god you know you know the ones that walk into the bar and just go oh my
you know i know i'm not the best but you know they're the ones that everybody gravitates to anyone with a smile on
their face is always creates so much more energy and flow and the people that
don't and and that's about being comfortable in yourself so i think that it's very difficult with
everything you've achieved at your age to just know where you're going or what you're doing i'm done do you know what i mean i'm i'm married
i've got two kids i've got business i'm struggling to balance everything you know but i'm here you know i'm not
gonna roll back the the years and do this and do that and i know exactly what i'm doing i know exactly where i'm at
i know exactly what i'm focusing on and that life starts to become a lot easier then at your age you know i went to work i left
college after my levels i went to work for five years in sports management companies and event management companies
i was a sports agent on a pga tour in america i had no idea where i was going
i mean i just wanted to be successful i wanted to earn money you know but the mindset of
or the changing mindset over the years is unbelievable i always say to people now what matters to you now you will
look back on when you get to my age and go i can't believe i even used to worry about stuff like that
and that that's important because i i feel like people that are very successful you know you did it at a very young age
very impressive because i think it takes time now when i did the cambridge uh talk the other day
you know you're sitting down with all these young i mean i'm i'm i'm street smart and i can sell
right these people are like yeah i'm jealous of boffins i used to take the mickey out of boffins
i'm jealous of boffins now i find intellectual people fascinating i love talking to them and just trying to learn and absorb and
i'm sitting in this room with people and they're listening to me and i'm thinking you know firstly you must be listening
to me thinking this boat who is he what is he a car used car dealer something like that
and then but i'm i'm talking around i'm saying to you what do you want to do uh
you know what what is success to you they've not got a clue and it's not because they're oxford and
they're deluded it's because that's just it's very difficult that age to understand i don't believe anyone at faulty looks
back at what they were thinking at 20 and said yeah i had this plan i'm there now and this is what i always wanted to do
so it takes time to develop a passion for something and that that is the that's a key word passion because when
we talk about being relentless and we talk about this work ethic you can only have it if you love what
Is ambition choice?
you do and if you have a passion for what you do i don't think you can trick yourself you can but you can't be as good you
know you know you said um earlier that you you feel like you're self-aware of like the the lack
of balance in your life because you've got this real relentless streak you've got this family and you're self-aware of it
do you think as much as you're aware of it do you think deep inside you you really
have a choice or do you think you're being somewhat
dragged by your own ambition because this is what i find fascinating about people successful people is it tends to be the
case that like me i'm aware i need to see my niece more but i just sometimes don't feel like i
have i'm fully in control well i i do it because it's what i want to do
ultimately i mean i do have an obligation you know i do have responsibilities i'm talking about in the workplace sure
you know we've got a fantastic team here but ultimately when we're announcing a show when we're doing a press conference when we do they
want me sure they want their flesh so they roll me out and i'm just like i'm like a traveling salesman right eddie
announcing the show today off you go right here we go bubba back in the car here we go you know what so but i do it because i enjoy it
because i love it because i have an obligation to do it for the business
that my father created and of my responsibility now
is to take that to the next level you know he built this from the foundations from nothing i'm not going to let it just fizzle out
as he goes into his 80s i want to take it to the next level but the difference is is i don't have to
do this you know i'm not looking at this it's my way out um you know i'll just if i just make
some money i can you know i can buy the lamborghini or i could have done that at 21. but imagine the eddie that that doesn't do this
imagine what how do you feel but the same thing it was that was me at school now that was the kid telling the
teachers i don't have to do that you know that runs shivers down me give me some
Finding the work life balance for a relationship
advice on um because you've got you're married and i'm i genuinely even genuinely no it sounds crazy but
i'm like you've managed to crack it seems like because you're married um crack the balance of being relentless on
one end but then managing to find a person or to at least keep them happy to some degree but yeah
i spoke to her but i genuinely i started to think of the the last couple years i'm like how am i going to find someone that understands that i
want to send text messages at 4 am in the morning and that i sometimes don't want to talk to them and that when i'm satisfied i'll
be quiet for seven hours because i've just got an email that i'm thinking about and so i'm like is it that you have to find the right person is it something
you say to them i think they need to know you they need to know
what drives you i mean if you had a conversation with my wife and you said what what is he like
you know she just go well he's just in his own world isn't he i mean the amount of times you know that moment where you get home
and they go right i need to talk to you and you go into the kitchen and they go right now isabella you know i spoke to her teacher
today and um i'm gone right so i'm good i'm going and i'm thinking that contract's gonna
be in at 9pm you know and she goes to me what did i say and i'll go this is cool what is it and she's just
she but it's not like and she'll go listen we have blazing rounds you know you're you know you're so selfish all you care
about is work you know but you again it just gets to a point where you just have to understand
life you just nothing's perfect you know you've got two people that love each other i've known her since you know my 20s
i've i've changed we've both changed a lot over the years but we've changed together and we've grown together
and this is what i do you know and i would have had that conversation with her at some point many years ago to the point saying look
nothing's going to get in my way i i don't mean to sound horrible and i love you and you know i want to spend
the rest of my life with you but you have to understand me you have to understand that this is
extremely important to me not don't say this is the most important thing to me because that'll get you bang
in trouble but this is extremely important to me and i think because she's been around my family because she knows
how important it is to us she kind of just gets it you know and there'll be times where
she'll say did i hear you on the phone last night at five o'clock in the morning i say yeah you know who's doing the
canelo deal or you know aj do or she'll just look at me and go but over
time you know i think they might the most difficult thing is the early stages of dating because it's very difficult
for a woman that they want your attention you know people people sometimes think that women want
uh you know money and you know the nice house and of course everybody does but they don't really
they want your attention and they want your company and they want your time and there are three things that are very difficult to do
when you live that kind of lifestyle so you do have to you know we'll do i'll race back from somewhere and i'll
say right you know tonight let's go for dinner and i'll be naked i don't you know hopefully she don't listen to this i
really don't want to go for dinner tonight but you have to do it and that's what my dad has kind of always taught me
something you've got to do you've got big we're big family people my mum is from from the east end
she's old school as far as they're concerned the man goes out and puts the bread on
the table and the wife looks after the man old old old world that don't exist
anymore but every morning or every night my mum will iron my dad a shirt
and she will put it on his on the door for him in the morning if you want if your wife right say i say
we put her in this room we sat her down with god and he said listen you can decide what happens next with eddie and his career
right so you can we can bring it to an end and he'll spend more time with you what do you reckon she would do she
could make the decision on you your relentlessness and your career how do you honestly think she would make
that i think she because she knows how important is to me i think she would say
no he he he he needs to do it he has to do it but i think the i think the hope is that
there is an end place or an end goal for me yeah but for me i don't
whether in 20 years time we we play this back i don't think i want to be 70
you know maybe even 60 70 80 doing this dealing with problems and
listen maybe i won't even make it that long but for me i definitely have the mindset
of not i want to get in and get out but i do want to get that moment
where i do sit on the beach with a cigar don't even smoke you guys but you know and a whiskey don't even like whiskey
but you know i couldn't imagine the picture at least and go do you know what we've done it
we've done well but walking away is the thing that at the moment would kill me you know to be able
imagine when you wrap up shop and you know this might be i mean for us we've gone from being a family business
you know to having four employees to now all of a sudden having hundreds employees
in in multiple offices around the world we're being approached by for for investment for takeover for
ipos and now we're sort of at that stage of growth where i don't know i just see i see a i see a faster exit
strategy than my dad at least that's what i'm selling to her you know just give me a few more years
just give me a few more but i do want to go and enjoy because i can't say i'm not enjoying myself because i love what i do but i do want
that moment to just you know but it's the walking away you know how do you just one day turn around and you might sell
the business or you know you might float and you take a more of a backseat role that's difficult
because we make our own decisions we're a hands-on business that's what we love we've we've turned down investment and opportunities for years because we don't
wanna i don't wanna ball the directors we we make the decisions and we do what we wanna do because we
love what we do but when you see such growth and you see such interest and you see
the opportunity for you know a much vaster wealth being quite honest
do you want it and if you want it what's the exit strategy because at the moment the exit strategy
for our family is from the day you start working from the day you die you work your nuts off
every single day i mean it's not particularly advanced is it that strategy but that's just what we've always done
mental health big topic you know especially over the last 10 years i think if you go back well 10
years ago and you said the word mental health people think people are crazy right they think like um run away from that person but now it's
become like the opposite it's like oh someone's got you know it's become something of where you'd give someone affection and you take care
of them because the stigma's somewhat changed we know the stats around male mental health
have you ever suffered from any sort of mental health um predicaments
this is my favorite day of the week my all-time favorite flavor of huel
berry i went up to hill's office in tring last week and had another tour around their headquarters and so
pretty amazing they have this massive massive gym as you would you would you would expect but the thing that i didn't realize
about huel was that it's also a vegan product and also i didn't realize their commitments
to sustainability now there's tons of reasons why you might choose to become a hooligan like me i've been drinking here for about three
years long before they um decided to help me with the podcast and to sponsor us but i never realized that element of it
the reason i've always consumed tool is because of convenience right um some people might consume it because
it's nutritionally complete um which i guess is part of the reason i did as well and then some people might
consume it because it's affordable but for me i never because i'm not vegan i never realized it was vegan i never
realized their efforts around sustainability and i never realized it was also gluten-free because again that's not a
problem i have and so on this week's episode of the podcast that's the key message that i wanted to get across
is that if you are vegan and a lot of people don't know this a lot of my friends didn't know this hewl is vegan too um
and this is my all-time favorite flavor which is berry um for me it tastes great um
20 grams of protein i'm currently trying to get in better shape as you i hope some of you have been able to notice if you've seen
the podcast on youtube if you're listening on youtube right now um yeah and i love it and this is why it's so awesome to work with a brand that you
believe in because their impact on the environment is low they are good for you nutritionally it's
super convenient and if you have the berry one it tastes unbelievable so what a what a
win-win-win-win-win for me it was working with you because um i get to tell you guys about something that i would swear by
and i don't have to be dishonest with you um if you look at my fridge right now maybe you should take a look at it it's
pretty much all heal i'm not advocating to have a heal-only diet but
that kind of speaks to the nature of my life and how busy i am and and how many meals i was missing before
i became a heel again have you ever suffered from any sort of mental health um predicaments
Your experience with mental health
i don't think so no i mean i think again depression's one of those things a
bit like yoga and breathing and stuff we were talking about earlier if you would have said to me 10 years
ago listen maybe even five or six years ago so and so suffering from depression
if if your perception of that person is well he's young he's good looking
he's healthy he's rich he's successful how can he be struggling from depression
what a load of rubbish and actually it takes the older generation even longer i mean i think my dad's only just accepted now that it
exists with people because his mentality is what dust yourself down what's the
matter with you and it's that's you know that that's wrong because it is real you know and it does exist um i don't
you know have i had days where i've been feeling incredibly down yeah but surely that's normal you know i don't i
don't see myself suffering from that and i think i think mental health problems and depression i think it comes from
overthinking you know my um my brother-in-law is hilarious he just i've never known
anyone who just overthinks and worries about stuff you know you're gonna be
having a conversation you'll go i've just been thinking about that you know and and if that happens i was thinking you know next year you could be there and
now and then from there it's like whoa whoa whoa what are you doing just when you're struggling mentally
focus on the short term focus on day by day i think sometimes people look at and
this is the same for business when you have a project or a long-term plan there are
so many short-term obstacles and goals to overcome to get there that's why many times you spoke someone
got this idea you know i'm going to be doing this and that and that and then a month later you've not even heard about it oh well what happened was
we launched and then you know the council came in or the regulation board came in and and this other company tried to do this
and and it just it's like no because you didn't focus on the short-term goals all you were worried about
was the house and the lamborghini and you weren't prepared to to tick the boxes to get there so sometimes when i'm a little bit off
or you know it might be traveling a lot and the equilibrium has gone and it's like okay so i'm just gonna write down what i'm
gonna do today and it can be really menial stuff it could be walk the dog you know it could be
finalize a contract could be go to the gym it could be go and get some food you know from
work just to say and and i would tick everyone off really yeah and i would say at the end of the day i would look at it
and i'll go done and that's the momentum back that that's where you get the feeling of accomplishment even even
on tiny things say okay i'm moving in the right direction for me that that is a big help for me he's
short-term focus because once you start worrying about what's going to happen next week or next month or next year
no and you're going to start driving yourself crazy you've just got to say okay this is what i need to do today and
tomorrow i need to do the same thing and then before you know it you'll start making positive changes you'll start achieving because you know
what what you've set the targets you've set yourself you are achieving you're a bit of a philosopher i don't know if you realize because um
there's a great famous philosopher that says uh depression is too much of the past and anxiety is too much thinking too much about the future and
he says the cure is more now and that's pretty much what you've done yeah that's true because you can't worry about things that may or may not happen
and you can't change things that have already happened what you can do is change what is happening today and it's simple to do that again in in
the book i ran a marathon one marathon right because my dad ran loads and he took the mick out i mean i had to do it
and it's the same kind of thing you start the marathon you think 26 miles if you start thinking about
running 26 miles i mean i it did give me anxiety attacks to start with i was thinking
that's just ridiculous i've never done more than 10k and then you train you train you train and you build and then
every mile marker is an obstacle you start off you think 26 miles by me
and you go one two three four five and you're you're okay and then and then you're 12 13 you think i've done half and you get to 18 19 you think
i can't do it anymore and you think just get to 20 get to 2021 and when you see that 20 mile marker
you know and then you get to 20 and you go do you know what i've still got six miles i can't do it and you go 21
22 23 and then when it's all over you can look back but if you start worrying about the future you're going to get out
you're not going to make it do you feel that anxiety sometimes in those big moments where you've got you know some things coming up and you
just can't stop thinking about it um in my business it was actually the first you know i heard this term mental health and
i think at the start i thought nah it's not real and then a couple of years in i see a lot of people i just started
hearing you know friends of mine and stuff going through really bad things i'm like i think it's real and then i got to this point where i was always scared to admit
that it would be real because i almost felt like if i admitted it was real then i'm like welcoming the
possibility into myself of like labeling myself something and then there was one moment where i
had this really big decision to make in new york and i'm laying in the hot tub in manchester and
i just got really anxious and i was anxious for about four days up until the point of the decision
and then i thought that's probably the closest i've come to some kind of mental health predicament is that real
anxious feeling that i couldn't shake i think social media is horrendous as well like
Social media
i've made the decision in the last couple of years years specifically to start ignoring and
blocking out a lot of um you're a celebrity now yeah
but when i was coming through when i was overturning the system the support was unreal and i was really
feeding off that i mean anyone that says you know they're not affected by criticism or they're not
worried about i mean that's a load of rubbish of course you don't like people criticizing you and by the way you love
people patting you on the back and championing you of course it's natural what things get to you though
stuff that people like the personal stuff couldn't give couldn't give monkeys about it's more
about the it's it's more about people when you're putting the work in
something and you're so passionate about something and you're actually working for the good of might be the sport or whatever
it's the people that just you know presume see you completely differently so that's the frustration but over the last
couple of years i just started thinking to myself what are you i was having a conversation with man my old man's on twitter right and he
phoned me at me ago i'm having an argument with this giza on twitter right and he was going on about the snooker in the format
and i said to him i'm like whoa whoa whoa whoa i said are you serious i said who is one who is this boat i
said you imagine someone stopping you on the street and having a pop at you about the snooker format but it also it's it's the
platform that made us what we are it got us to the top you know the interaction with
the fans and the understanding of their mindset so we can't just you know but it's become a toxic place
it really has you know and i worry for i worry for my kids you know sometimes one of them be on
tick tock and she'll put a dance out and someone will come back and say say you know i don't know uh you're ugly you
look really you're stupid you know and it's like we never had that now they i mean we never even had a phone you
know if someone didn't like you they might say something in the playground but that's about it so we live in a world of criticism and i
think it's a negativity but that's what i said to my old man said you imagine like these people
they're all doing it all day i'll put a post out and it's the same ones all the time i don't think you know i mean even um to
the point where someone posted my phone number on twitter right and i've had my phone
number for 25 years same one right and someone posted it and
went give it this is eddie hearn's number give him a call and you know tell him what you think about the pay-per-view
price or whatever it is and my phone was going men's like it was like every literally all day it was just private
number private number and i thought you know what you got to change your number and i thought i can't be bothered so i started
answering a few right and to this day this was a few years ago it's that people still do it and there's
this one guy you've got the same number yeah i can't be bothered to change it right so this guy's private number private
number private number and it's all day right so i pick it up and i go
hello mate and he goes oh bloody hell eddie and i go yeah how you
doing mate and he goes uh um when you're gonna stop ripping us off on
the paper views or something like that right and i go and it and i went to him mate let's have
a serious conversation what are you doing and he goes what do you mean
what am i i said have you got a job and he's like uh yeah i mean i said you haven't have
you and he's like well not not at the moment i said what are you doing
i said how many times have you phoned me today oh i mean the answer was like 40
right i said you can't focus i said all the energy you're putting into phoning me because
you think it's banter or is some kind of accomplishment if i pick up the phone i said put it into
something worthwhile i said because you really waste in your life and he just went quiet and he's like uh
oh come on no eddie what about a few quid off the paper view and i'm like no no mate i'm serious but i want to help you
you've got to you've got to change you know and then you just hung up and i thought [ __ ] okay but it's true
isn't it what are you doing what are you doing i mean all right once might be quite funny you know i'll pick it up and you give me a bit
but all day every day you know because i'd hate to be one of those people that just wakes up every morning
with no fire in the belly with no passion with nothing and there are by the way that's 95 of
the population many people it's why it's so important to me here to create an environment a mattreum for
the for the team where you enjoy being there you know we've got we get food together we've got
a gym we've got a pool we've got we're all traveling away to events we'll have a night out do that because you can't be in a job or a life where
you just flat how am i going to get the best out of you if you don't love what you do and it's very difficult to have that same
passion when it's not your business you know so motivation is important but
I don't like being a celebrity
you know frank said to me he said he said uh you know eddie's a and he's a businessman that's that's
where you came from your dad's a businessman too and with this new age of social media and all the interviews you do on youtube and you are relentless
with the interviews as well by the way and i was when i saw you in new york uh on that rooftop with like the nice
garden stuff yeah you were back to back to back doing those interviews with all these bloggers for three hours
that's helped grow the business it's why most people know matroom especially of this generation but it's
made you a celebrity and frank said to me he said i don't think he's enjoying the celebrity thing you know and i think a
lot of people would be really really surprised to hear that because you know
people would they think that you'd love it they think you love the attention i mean promoters are in the business of attention right
but from a personal perspective apparently you don't like it you don't like the celebrity i then set out to be a celebrity and i
set out to be a businessman i set out to um continue the success that my dad built
but i do recognize that if i am well known if i am a showman if i am a
celebrity it will help me push my events it will help me push the profile
of fighters you know you get to a stage now where the industry haters might say oh well
it's ridiculous he's doing all these interviews you know he's more popular than most of his fighters
you know more popular as a wrong word well known than zombies but that's me you know i look at the success of the ufc i look at the growth
of of that business and dana white and every major fight sport um product has that lead guy
in wwe it's vince mcmahon you know in mma it's dana white and in boxing i guess it's me or you know i want it to be me
so there's a method to the madness and but you know the book
the book was something that i wanted to do because i just thought it was funny that i would ever write a book right how
do you think it's funny no but if you knew me at school and you knew i just it was more like
hodder put it to me during before lockdown and when lockdown come i panicked and i was like
oh and next you know talk about being at home with you kids now i'm at home with my kids and i've got no events
and oh so i was just like for those first two weeks i was just right we launched a fitness show with
sky that people could do at home fight and fit you know i've said to the guys here give me that book deal i'll write it now
let's do the book now and i wrote it in lockdown you know and it was just zooms more zooms more
interviews because i just i was just scared of not having that drive every single day of you know going
out there and and and i didn't enjoy it like an illness he's an illness let's be honest we're
all sick aren't we i mean like you can't do you can't wake up in the night every night
and start writing emails doing contracts texting people right and then wake up at
seven and do the school run and then drive to work and do it all over again every single day unless you're a little bit ill in the
head you can't actually be still like so when you talk tell her about that cigar moment in the future
sitting on that beach i didn't believe you for a second yeah you're probably right but i just i'd like to think that it's at least what i'm telling to miss is
that one day we'll be we'll chill out you know what i mean could you imagine laying on a beach with a cigar like this no emails no nothing
just no fights coming up nothing just meditating no but i think it all depends where you
get to you know it's like when you're building your stack at poker you know the problem with gambling is you never
know when to walk away right and we're not gambling anymore because we're very good at what we do
but life is always a gamble so when you build your stack it's that moment when you say to the
cashier can i get a rack please and you put it in your rack yeah and you
go up to the cashier's desk and you say cash out in for me and i go sue and you walk away and you go yeah
and then you get sit down you're gonna have a nice beer but that moment sucks you said the moment the that moment
doesn't suck but then after again it's the thrill isn't it yeah i like to win i like people
so the thing that would hurt me more is if i turn around tomorrow and win i couldn't have done any more in boxing
i'm out bye what would hurt me more is sitting on the beach not not you know enjoying myself going
now i'm gone all those people that i was fighting again for all those years to become number one they've got no
they're back you know they're back and that's what my dad walked away from boxing because it is the most um aggravating
business an intense business and that's what i'm saying about it all throughout the night because everyone's trying to [ __ ] you
non-stop right so you have to sleep with one eye open and i think he got to a stage where he went i don't want to do this anymore i'm
going to go and do darts where everyone's going to love me do what i mean and i'm jealous of look at that because i saw growing up
this guy that was so intense and who had a bad temper and you know and then all of a sudden once
boxing went he was just chilled out wow i can't believe what's happened to my life so
you know i i hate to let people win and if i left ultimately they would win but i guess
the only time you can walk away is when you're content and will the contentment ever come
at the moment like you say possibly not but who knows you know who knows where we can build to where we can get to
where it might be that moment and again you have to always leave the option open because as i said
your thoughts at 20 are totally different to your thoughts at 30 and 40 and 50. i may get to 50 and we
may be you know i've had another great 10 years and i might go fire's not there anymore i'm done or i
might be saying right now i want to take over music now i want to take over football now you know so it's difficult to say
Selling Matchroom
and with the family businesses they're a very special thing and in the world in the world we live in today
these big global corporations and the public markets growing it's very rare for a family business to withstand the
temptation of acquisitions or going public or whatever what
who can you don't have a son right and uh i'm wondering who continues the
family business if you were to go down that route is it no well that's a good point because that
is the the conversation you know ever since i started to
understand business more for me that that is a natural progression of a family business
to go family business you know investment or acquisition or ipo and that's what you
do because how do you i have i have aspirations for this business to grow
globally and to study staging events in every major territory in the world you know to do that does require
huge investment does it does require you know management it and we can do it but that's not our
speciality our speciality is creating great live events for our broadcasters and fans
okay so my dad has always said to me i will never ever ever
take investment for the business float the business or sell the business and i've always
over the years gone yeah but you know it's gotta we gotta get to it and actually
the the something's quite interesting you know i've been blessed with two amazing daughters of course every man with quite a lot of son didn't
work out that's what god gave me but there is it's an interesting point because
my end goal if i had a son and listen only 41 who knows but i think it would be more
you know here we go again down the line kind of thing with me i would quite like
to end the journey with my dad joe to me to say
look at what we you know not it's gone but look at where we started look at
where we finished because it's very difficult and i take the interest
from you know hedge funds and you know investment funds with unbelievable amount of compliment
to say well you know and the calls are coming in non-stop because they appreciate the model of growth where when we talk
about one sport one promoter one belt you know that mindset it's a carbon copy of the ufc now the
ufc sold 4.6 billion there is no reason why boxing
with with so much more history with so much more credibility with fans and broadcasters
can't replicate that model and actually be even more valuable than the ufc business
and i'm really the only chance it has to do it it's not going to be bob harrem
it's not going to be don king it's not going to be frank warren it's going gonna be me so all of a sudden i've been giving
interviews like that and then the calls are coming well right we want you know and it's like guys we're not we don't need it we're
not if i wanted to go and get funding if i wanted to go and float i'll do it tomorrow but it's a big
it's a big you know head-butting system with me and me and my dad and you know he's starting
to look and i'm just saying we can't just be blind to it it's a natural progression for any
business in terms of growth to look at these models and but is that why you're doing the business
because you know the happiness you've got from this business i i would guess and i run i ran a public
business until recently um much of it aggravation loads you don't necessarily want right quarterly
reported you gotta hit the numbers if you don't then you've got to do something short term that's not necessarily in the long term interest of the business
right so i i i'm almost quite jealous of the setup you have the control you
have you have it in your family and you're happy but but you're someone that almost needs forward
momentum to continue to be to be just growth isn't it you know you know that as a family business you know we we
you know you can see in our financial results we're fantastic you know we're a huge uh family business in terms of the
numbers that we're delivering year on year end yes but at the same time
you're almost capped by the growth and by the numbers within the currents within that setup
yeah you know okay so when you start you turn a break-even business into a
a 5 million ebitda company and then before you know it the aim is 10 and 15 and now we're 30 and you know but
how'd you get to 4 billion why does 4 billion matter that's just the ufc number you know so but
because why it matters is it was never on the agenda it was never
possible it could never be done and i guess it goes back to the competition with my dad where i'm saying
you know i believe you know when you talk about pe ratios and the value of a business yeah we know
what we're worth now but i do believe we have the potential to be worth those kind of numbers
and that would be your success in some respects it's a game it's a game steve it's not i
don't know it's not like i don't i don't think that deeply to i
just see it as a game but when you start thinking deeply it doesn't make you question so yeah it's good point why does
i don't know i i just i live in the moment i live in now i just feel that every day we're trying to expand we're
trying to push the boundaries of trying to do more so would i like to this business to you
know sell or have a value of for [ __ ] right why because it could it's ridiculous we're
just a couple of like he's out of dagnam i'm his son would be a great story yeah but it
it's just it's us against the world because the money would do to be honest nothing the money wouldn't change my lifestyle
at all i'm not i've got a couple of nice cars right i got a nice house i don't want a yacht i don't want to jet
i don't want i mean well i mean we'll talk about it but you know i don't i don't want for anything i'm not
i'm at the age now maybe when i was in my twenties yeah wow yeah private jet he got you
just rent it if you need it so it's just it's just the fact that what we've done i think i think legacy
is um i was talking to freddie flintoff on my podcast and i said i said about
legacy and he went yeah i think legacy's a load of bollocks i actually i disagree a little bit because
you know when you go back to that moment where you're on your deathbed and you might be today or
and when you've achieved something like that you just you put yeah you start laughing you got i can't believe we've done it i
can't believe we've done it and that would be the better kind of memories or the achievement to me you know
can you believe we've done it but you've got to enjoy it at the same time but you know i don't know it's you could you
can debate this all day long because you sit back on the death bed and you say yeah but was i really happy
of course because this is bringing us happiness this is i know that every day i come in here
and i'm smiling and i'm up for it and i'm passionate and i'm full of energy and i've got a drive and a fire in my
bed that's good enough for me my dad comes in every day has been coming here you know into this off into this business for
50 45 years and he's got the same passion the same energy that he did when he
first started the company that's got to tell you something and this is almost somewhat of a contradiction because he's
coming in here every day you're both really really happy you're coming in here with a fire on your belly but then there's this other part of you
that's like but we need the end point yeah he doesn't he doesn't he he
he doesn't want any of that you know he's going ah son we've got the most amazing business you know we're forecasted to just for
continued growth for the next five ten years we've got broadcast contracts locked in
we're untouchable and i'm like yeah but how do we go you know i want offices you
know we have offices in in england in new york in milan in madrid i want offices in sydney in
toronto in mumbai in beijing that that's what i want why because we're not supposed to have it
we were never supposed to be this business i was never supposed to be this kid so it sounds like you're proving something to
somebody maybe but probably to him and if that's what it comes down to
which comes back to your childhood probably and if you prove that to him right you have all these offices around the world
you sell for five billion will that make you happy probably not but i don't know i i i don't think that
rebellion for 5 billion and making a load of money will make me happy it will make me happy to be able to say
i can't believe we've done it you know i can't believe what we've achieved but then you'll need the next thing part possibly
or that might be the the cigar on the beach moment i wrote i wrote this one sentence in my book where i
started to understand the moment i described at the start when someone made me an offer for my business and i looked at it when i was 23 and i
thought we've got 25 million quid [ __ ] and then what i learned in that moment is
my whole life became so confused and i almost fell into like i'd call it chaos and so in my book i write that we live
our lives thinking that we're striving for stability which would be completed goals the cigar um
thinking that stability of stability and that we're trying to escape chaos but what i came to learn was
in fact um our stability is chaos it's the having unanswered goals and
it's the problems and it's the forward motion so our chaos is stability and our
stability the cigar moment would actually feel like chaos yeah it would feel like some kind of text if it wasn't time
if it wasn't time and we don't know when it'll be time yeah but what you just said there is very true because
like any athlete that moment when they're in the chaos is where they
feel most at peace with themselves you speak to any fighter and you say where would you rather be
anywhere in the world and say in the ring and that's the same for us so it's not like i want aggravation but
stick me in it put me in front of problems and and tell me i can't do something
that's where i'm in my moment am i in my moment where i'm sitting at home
you know watching tv no i'm i'm at my best when i'm doing those 100 200 interviews
or i've got problems or a fight's falling through and you know all of a sudden the shit's hit the fan that's when i'm at my
best so and that's where i do feel calm in a way you know at first when you have problems you know it might
be a panic but for me okay this is what we do we go to work now you know and that's that's the same for an
athlete or a fighter that's when they feel calm when you might be watching going
because that's not your your calm that's not your your moment it's their moment i'm fine you know when
aj fights he ain't nervous i'm [ __ ] [ __ ] myself because i can't control it it's not me it's not
what i do but that's what he does you know when when a fight's falling through or it looks like a massive
show's about to be cancelled and other people in here might be oh oh do you think you'll be all right do you think we'll do
well and i'll just lock the door and say right leave me alone and i go to work that's my that's that's no problem for
me you know but but you only become exceptional at things and used to things
when you become familiar with them and when you put yourself in the same position time and time again
it's all about frank you know we we always laugh about him giving his press conferences you know because when i did my first
ever press conference which was audrey harrison against david haye i couldn't stop shaking you wouldn't have known it the time but i put my
hands on the table like this and i and i could i could feel them you know i could i could see them going so i just when i spoke i just put them
underneath my legs like this and just leant forward and you would never have known and when i done the next one a little
bit less and the next one and then within five or six i never needed notes i just speak you
know four hours i couldn't believe it and with frank you know he done one recently and i could see him shaking you know i
was just taking the piss out of him and i just said just keep doing it keep doing it repetition repetition keep putting yourself in situations
steve davis who is my godfather i said to him once how do you you know when you
you talk about sort of sports where millimeters make a difference it's
nothing more than snooker you know i said how do you do not get nervous you know you're about to go down to pot the
blackboard and just little one little jolt and it's all over and he said i have no nerve endings
he said because i've been put in the position time and time again in the end it's just it's second
nature it's just like riding a bike and that's that's what the same with business you have to keep putting yourself in a
position time and time again and you'll keep improving listen thank you for your time today
no it's another counselling session yeah you know i'm going to leave it now and go away you know i think the best the best thing
you can talk about mindset and and mentality and
for hours and hours and hours just keep it simple don't over complicate things don't
overthink things be happy keep smiling that's difficult when you want something so bad and you're chasing it but if you start to
really overanalyze that's when you know things start creeping in just keep it simple
and um you know i said sometimes if things get tough or you know we've got problems and i'll say
tomorrow man he said don't worry he said just wake up an hour earlier tomorrow and go to bed an hour later
i'm thinking that's so that's so and he is the most simple mindset but it works for him because you and the
best thing you can do is be honest with yourself as well just try and understand take a step back and just
think about what is happening in the world and your world right now and if you can understand it you can
deal with it and you can solve it but just think simple thank you
you

Intro
honesty really really matters and i think much of the reason why i started this podcast was to give
the world the much needed honesty it needs but often doesn't get you hear success stories that are glamorized and that are oversimplified
but that's rarely rarely the case this week's guest will give you exactly that raw
unfiltered honesty like you've never heard it before and in some points honestly that might make you
a little bit uncomfortable it made her uncomfortable it made me uncomfortable this week i'm joined by
chrissy chella she's an unbelievable and in my opinion heavily underrated entrepreneur running
multiple multi-million pound businesses she's one of the uk's number one fitness creators
athletes whatever you want to call her she's an author her book is coming out in january
she has a remarkable story one that starts from very very humble beginnings as an immigrant that was
bullied on the playground in the uk and what you'll find out about her is inspiring it's captivating
it's real one of the most amazing conversations i've ever had on this podcast and i'm so glad that we can bring you
her story in this way told with total honesty without further ado i'm stephen bartlett
and this is the dire rover ceo i hope nobody is listening but if you are then please keep this to yourself
as i did a little bit of research on you and i got to sort of uncover your story and i got to
stalk you a little bit on social media um the more and more that i observed and sort of looked
past your instagram feed the more i saw a pretty remarkable
entrepreneur and business person and one of the thoughts that came to my mind and you know this podcast is all about
speaking the truth and being honest was this question which is do you think that you get the credit you
deserve as an entrepreneur that's the question
Justifying myself as a woman
um it's not about me i haven't built a community about me i've built a
community about helping other women and i think that
it's never fully been about me and the credit that i get is seeing other
women thrive and succeed and come together and that for me is enough credit i don't
need an award i don't need someone to say oh my god you're the best business woman in the world for me when i see or when i read another
woman's story that for me is enough i don't need anything else
so yeah i do so because i was when i i was watching some of your stories on instagram and you you run an office right
of people you run multiple businesses right and i typically think that people
are very very quick to arrive at judgement when they see a pretty young lady who's worked out on
instagram who has a big following and they t and this is just being completely honest they tend to come to judgments very quickly a conclusion a
conclusion yeah and that that conclusion and that narrative or that image that they form of that person i've come to learn is usually severely
wrong 100 it is and you know it's funny you say that because i've also been on multiple dates with people
and you know they see my instagram following and they automatically assume that oh it's because you get your ass
out that's that's that's why you make money or it's because you get your ass out that's why you've built what you've built
and the truth is if i did that and if that was the fundamental reason then i wouldn't have
a team of 30 people in one company and building another company that sells out every time we
restock it goes past being a pretty face or a pretty picture it goes past being a nice body it's
about the message that you have it's about what you want to truly truly put out in the world and i
think if people make that conclusion it says more about them than it does to me does it make you feel though
and i want you to be really honest here how does it make you feel i think okay like i'm gonna be complete honestly
i think it's one thing to be judged and it's another thing to be judged as a woman
okay so why is it that when you see a handsome man you don't come to a conclusion that he
only got what he got because he's handsome why is that as a woman i have to justify myself more
i have to explain myself more all the time it's draining i shouldn't have to
explain myself my face my body all of this stuff it's just external you know and
i think that can i swear on this question
i smell my youtube all the time some people get offended and i'm like listen this is this is who i am something else yeah no it pisses me off
it pisses me off but at the same time it's like it feeds me right you know it feeds me like piss me
off even more because that's how i thrive you you saying to me i can't do something you saying to me that i only
got there because of this and that it pushes me more to achieve more
and yeah i mean it's their problem not mine i guess there's a lot of you know let's just for
a second imagine that that judgment of you was correct and that you'd got here because you were pretty or whatever or you're
you know you have a great physique or whatever it was um what would they be missing what is
the truth why why did you get here because there are lots of very pretty people out there right
yeah um but for some reason you made it here and i've seen your businesses i've looked
into them you have pretty phenomenal businesses and you're running big teams of people in big
offices so like there's two kind of thoughts to this but i think the central question that i'm trying to answer for myself is what is it about
chrissy that differentiated you your approach your message and the way that you
connect with people from all of these other people that are trying to do what you're doing
i think in all honesty if i'm if i'm answering that question from a personal perspective
i've always been 100 honest and transparent with who i am you're not gonna find a hidden secret or
some nasty surprise like this is who i am you literally either take it
or you leave it and i'm not going to try and be anything else
to fit in for anybody else you know and for me when i started my fitness
journey when i you know moved countries to england i never felt like i had a sense of home
i never felt like anybody understood me so to be blessed with a platform where i
can build a community and bring women together globally you know this is this goes beyond
me this is about bringing women together that have been abused that have had you know
mental disorders eating disorders such bad things you couldn't even imagine what
women have gone through and have told me to bring them all together and to create this
tribe you know that for me is like i think that's what people see
yeah and i think that's what people believe i want to do because i genuinely do want to do that
and you know one of the things that sorry to interrupt there but i really wanted to one of the things you said was about you
being yourself and i asked you that question actually with a bit of a preconceived idea of what the
answer would be and when i watch you on instagram the feel that i get from you versus
pretty much everybody else other than one other person i've got to be honest and he sat in this chair and he's actually coming back is joe wicks like when i met joix
he is the guy you meet off off off air or whatever is the same guy and
he's so [ __ ] genuine and all he cares about is like genuinely helping people but the reason i said to
joe i said i think the reason you're so successful is because you are yourself and
you will share it all and when i was watching you on instagram and watching some of your videos you cater to the 99 of people's lives
which is the real [ __ ] yeah i saw your video this week you did on your story you're waking up and you're saying
listen i don't want to wake up today and most people don't admit that because you know a lack of perfection is sometimes
perceived as weakness so i wondered how that resonated with you in terms of the importance of your success originating from chrissy
being her truer self yeah you're you can only be the best version of yourself right
and i think if you start trying to be something else soon enough it will come out or you'll start to fall through the
cracks or it will slip something will slip and you can only uphold that image and
you know that presence for so long before it really just [ __ ] up so the only thing you can do is be the
best version of yourself and this is what i tell people all the time it's never been about other
people's perceptions of you it's always been what you think about yourself and if you
truly truly believe in yourself you won't want to be anybody else you
want to you won't want to be fake you wouldn't want to be trying to please everyone my job isn't
to please everyone were you always at that point no tell me about that oh my god no i mean
i remember when i was in a relationship i was 16 years old i was like i'm gonna marry this person i'm so in love like this is it uh and then he cheated
on me and i was like oh [ __ ] this is not it it's his name no he does not deserve the air time i'll
tell you that much but i was heartbroken and i was trying so hard to please this
person you know i was trying so hard even in school i know it sounds petty but i was trying so hard to fit in
all the time all the time i remember like this is so this is not
cute on my end i'ma be honest with you i remember being at school and i'm foreign okay like
i'm mediterranean we're hairy okay and i had a no i had a moustache and the
girls used to rip me for it and i was so sad i was like oh my god why am i not like
these pretty english girls like i don't understand like i used to feel so shitty about myself
constantly trying to like fit in and then when i got cheated on i was like oh my god it must be because i'm not pretty enough
it must be because i'm not sexy enough [ __ ] that that's draining what do you
mean i constantly have to be something else for someone else i'm never gonna be happy and i i wasn't
happy for such a long time so yeah i just i just fully like expose
my moustache story there so let's take us from mustache to self-confidence
um what was that journey and what changed your uh your your self-esteem and your self-confidence what helped you
get that confidence in yourself i think for me it was can we just i think that
should be the podcast title master no no seriously even sarah doesn't know that
i used to have him no guys i'm gonna be honest with you okay like i don't give a [ __ ] i had a
moustache growing up okay and all the girls used to rip me the [ __ ] up they used to be like uh
your man your boy like honestly [ __ ] [ __ ] man and i ate my school
dinner for six months in a toilet because i didn't have any friends do you think that experience is part of
the reason you are who you are today 100 like honestly it's pretty impossible to to break me
Building my confidence with the gym
and when you've broken me understand that you've really like broken me down because it takes a
lot now was that we talk about the mustaf mustache thing is if it was this trivial thing but i'm guessing what
you're saying is you were bullied in school yeah but at the same time it's not like i was constantly bullied like i think
i don't know a lot of us go through awkward stages in school trying to make friends trying to be with a cool gang trying to do this try and do that then
you almost become like mean as well because you're so hurt by everybody else that you only yeah so
i think you know like i remember walking into sixth form one time and a
lot of personal things happened in my life and no one wanted to be around me at that point
and i just hated everyone around me and i was full of anger constant anger
and hate you know and i didn't want to be that person anymore especially after being cheated on i didn't want to be that
person anymore and i remember being on the train one day because i used to work in potter's bar
at the time um in this little men's boutique like retail shop and i was coming back home
and i remember like the penny dropped and i was like i can try so hard to be sexy and cool
and all this stuff other people but i'm not doing anything for myself and that's where the quote do this for
you comes from because i signed up to the gym that day
and then i'll walk straight back out and then go back for two months i'm not gonna lie to you i was signed up and like i'm
gonna do this i'm gonna do this i know what to do signed up didn't come back for two months i was actually actually hanging
back i don't know what to do why didn't you go because i was scared i was like who i was like who do you
who do you think you are crazy trying to be like a fitness girl you don't know what you're doing you know
this was like six years ago you don't know what you're doing go back home relax right relax chill go
to work study relax at some point you must have changed your mind yeah i did i did and evidently i did and
i was like uh okay now i need to do this like what am i doing i'm so lethargic i'm tired all the time i'm
not strong i was never like um overweight or underweight i was just tired all the time and drained
especially mentally so when i got into the gym i remember looking at the leg press machine and i
was like what is this transformer i don't know what the [ __ ] to do with this machine
and everybody else around me seemed to kind of know what to do and then there was like
men there and the women were on the cardio machines and the men were at the weights i didn't care about the cardio machine i
was so intrigued by the weights i was like what why do men go there what is that about
men that go there and women go there i want to go there and i didn't know how to use weights i
didn't know what i was doing i was training i didn't have anything like no one was on instagram at the time
no one was teaching the way social media has literally opened up a book full of information
and free content and we didn't have that at the time i started you know i didn't
know what i was doing it's how did you i learned you learned i just learned i
just was like you know what i'm just going to do this and i kind of i kind of got addicted to
the feeling of how completing a workout made me feel
and i started going again and again and i started learning because what was it doing for you going
it was giving me my therapy therapy from what from life from
my reality from the fact that i was so depressed or with who i was and
so angry at the world and everything the world had done to me
and the only time i felt like i could escape was at the gym which is so crazy
because the gym is like a chore for people i've got a [ __ ] train today but i went there and i escaped
it was therapy and no one could take that feeling away from me
not an ex-boyfriend that cheated on me not a mean girl at school not a horrible boss no one
isn't it funny that so much of you know when you speak to people that have achieved great things
it all seems to have been sparked by like an earlier catalyst of being bullied or feeling insecure and or
inadequate in some way i see the same in myself the reason why i am successful without a shadow of a doubt is because
the feeling of being broke and being inadequate in the area that i lived in and having all the windows on my house
smashed for a decade and the grass being six foot high and but living in all of these around all of these white people zero black people at
my school other than my brother and my other brother that feeling of inadequacy put pressure on me for like 15 16 years
and so my obsession as i wrote in my diary 18 was i'm gonna have uh a million pounds
before i'm 25. i'm gonna have a range river is going to be my first car right couldn't even drive yeah it's so funny i did the same
right i swear and it's so funny you say it was the only black man in your school because i was the only foreign guy on
mine i was trying to contend with this whole idea of having curly hair i was like i i started relaxing it when i was 12 so
it'd be straight and it and and i look back and i think if i hadn't have gone through that in the way that i had you wouldn't be where
you were not a [ __ ] shadow of a doubt and and it's like that pressure releases at some point
in different ways i could have ended up in prison right my my friend said my best friend said to me at 18 he said
steve and i remember where i stood when he said he said you're either going to be a millionaire or you're going to be in prison and i hit me like a ton of bricks
because he was telling the truth i cared so much about escaping from that pressure and from that life that it was going to
channel itself into something so tell me about your diary what did you write your day oh god i remember so funny right
i remember i wrote down and i will never ever forget i wrote down i'm going to be someone one
day i wrote i wrote that down and then i remember you went you have blackberries yeah all right
back in the day and i used the right of my blackberry and i just believed it
and anyway when i went to the gym and kind of figured it out along the way um i fell in love with someone
at the gym like i was going he's now my ex-fiance by the way everyone we're no longer together but he
is a very important person in this story because when i met him i was at rock
bottom but i was also trying to find my feet and i was becoming more confident in
myself and that confidence confidence did grow and attract the person that i was
supposed to be with at the time right because i do believe your your vibe and energy attract the people that you have
around you right and i remember he was driving me to work one day because i was waitressing
and i looked at him and i said i don't know why i started instagram at this point had like 50 000 followers i started
instagram in all honesty i started it just to see how i looked doing exercises
and hollywood recorded me and i was like oh my god i'm gonna break my back i don't know what i'm doing i need to fix
my form but somehow people started loving it and anyway
he was driving me to work and i go jack i don't know why but i feel like we're gonna achieve something
by helping women and generally said to me he goes yeah whatever man you get to work i'll come
pick you up i was like no i feel it and i started crying
crying streams of tears he's like what's wrong with you i was like no i believe
it i don't know what it is this is feeling i can't explain never had that feeling before and
here we are today what do you think that feeling was belief where did that belief come from
me i just believed in me so much that no one not even
you know the person i was with could sway me another way and i do think a lot of that comes from
persevering in the gym and growing that discipline and growing evidence right yeah that you
could right yeah because when you're when you start doing something good for yourself training was good for
me right you start to build these disciplines and habits and consistencies
and they transfer in other aspects of your life it's like a domino effect so
i started becoming more disciplined at university i didn't need 10 cans of red bull to stay awake i was
focused um i would excel all the time and it wasn't because i put in extra
hours it was because i was so hyper focused where i was with who i was i was present
and if it wasn't for the gym i wouldn't be able to have done that so your ex fiance yeah jack
do you think you would have met him had you not built the confidence within yourself or
started to build a confidence within yourself that the gym had given you do you think you would have been ready quote-unquote to have that relationship
with him at that time if you were the old chrissy no um and if i did if i was with someone
at the time i wasn't so confident it would have been the wrong person because you attract the energy that you
have you attract what you believe in yourself if you're constantly negative about yourself if you're constantly just
trying to make yourself believe you're you're just not worthy you're always going to attract that
and don't get me wrong there was like dates in between jack obviously
when i wasn't with him by the way i mean no i mean like after the guy that cheated on me i had like went through
i went for a phase i went through dayton and it's always the wrong guy i was the wrong guy and then it was i realized it's because
i'm trying to find happiness in other people constantly trying to find happiness of people and then when i started focusing
on myself he came along
you know a lot of women when they're in the situation where they're lacking confidence or self-worth or they're
feeling like something is missing will and this isn't just women this is men as well yeah right
they'll think that the answer is a romantic solution yeah right is it no it's not um
i've been there i've done that and obviously i'm speaking from personal experience you could find someone that really helps you you know you could
genuinely find someone who inspires you motivates you pushes you
and that's so remarkable and if you do find that person don't let them go you know but unfortunately if you have
so much self-hatred you are never going to be satisfied in the relationship that you
are in because you constantly have to find that person to give you that happiness you're constantly waiting for that
person to do something for you stable right it's unstable it is a lot of dependency
and um i think that the most rel most important relationship you're ever going to have is going to be with yourself
because when you go to bed at night and you're in your own little thoughts up here right that's you and you that's you and
you so you've got to fix that up here first before you go trying to find a a person to share your life with you
know and you know so you end up you know
jack ends up proposing yeah you you build a business together which is a topic in and of itself which you're
you're still working together with him on now yeah and then at some point you both decide
in a very you know i've listened to your story so you decide in a very amicable mature way that this situation
isn't making both of you right happy yeah and there was a sentence you said where you said um
you and jack grew apart which i found quite curious and i find it curious because on this podcast we've we've been
talking a lot about monogamy for whatever reason and this idea in fact the last guest we had on dr arya
who was you know who people have been really really blown away about um he he was cheated on by his partners you
know and he found out in a really horrific way that she was pregnant with another man yeah i listened to that okay and so on
that sentence about growing apart this makes me ask you the same question about monogamy if it's
possible for you to meet someone and grow apart you know especially you know because everybody's growing in some way
um what are your thoughts on monogamy having been almost to the altar with someone what are your
Growing Apart from my ex
thoughts on monogamy and i can i be honest i mean
please you never have to ask permission again to be honest i've never said this ever and i'm a
little bit nervous to say this but i when i was with jack
i thought that that was my person and i genuinely felt it in my heart and
my soul i never questioned it once right and we grew apart and that's because
a lot of people don't know what was going on behind the scenes last year when i launched toner sculpt with jack we had a lawsuit against
us you know no one really knew about that you know 50 grand in lawsuits trying to
get our app that we we built just to be ours and then build it from the ground up that's why we had
to refurbish and relaunch the programs because everything is now built home grown in our offices with our
technology right and do you know how much pressure that adds to a relationship i can't imagine and you're going home
and you're like what do you mean you don't do this what do you mean you didn't do that hating each other resenting each other
because you think they're to blame he thinks you're to blame i think he's to blame right and it's going to take a
very very special person to fit into the shoes that jack left
you know he is such an incredible man in every aspect works hard is caring is
loving as ambitious is everything a woman would want in a man unfortunately we grew apart
and it is unfortunate because i genuinely loved him and still do love him
unconditionally i'd give him my kidney if he needed it and it would take someone very very special
and confident to fill that space up and i'm not gonna hold my breath
does that make sense i'm not gonna hold my breath i'm gonna you know let's just see where it goes
you think it's possible um i think it's possible i think anything's possible
i just think that it's gonna take someone with a hell of a lot of confidence and someone
that understands that i don't need anything else but effort
and time from them i don't need your money i don't need your gifts i don't need so you're saying
you think that jack's shoes will be difficult to fill and it's almost like you're setting his shoes
as the standard of what you're looking for in the future so it kind of begs the question well you've got two feet that fit those
shoes perfectly jacks so why isn't he filling those shoes
i think if anyone turns around and says to you that i work with my partner and we run a
company of 30 people and hundreds and thousands of subscribers and you know an
ever growing company and we're so in love i i really literally will look at them
and be like how did you make that happen working and being romantically involved
with someone is difficult because let me tell you something when
you come home from work you're coming home from work with the same person what do you think you're
going to speak about when you get home work what do you think you're going to speak about
um after you have sex work the work i'm being honest like
you you live and you breathe your company jack is an entrepreneur and himself jack is a co-founder jack built this
with me right yeah so if i'm going through all those things as an entrepreneur as a
co-founder he is as well i don't know if you're answering the question chris but i am answering the question it
doesn't work it doesn't work because you work together yes it doesn't work together it would have probably worked
isn't that a shame when i when i um when i first met jack i have never felt
that way about someone before and i never once questioned our relationship or i never once questioned
whether i didn't want to be with this person and it's funny because when we hire new people at tone and scope they obviously
know mine and jack's relationship and a lot of employees tend to get a bit nervous
they're like are the co-founders going to be better are they going to be nasty to one another and you know what they always say it's
insane how much respect and love they have for one another it's actually a bit worrying how much respect and love we have for
one another and had we not had tona sculpt we would have 100 be married by now
probably expecting a first child is jack in a relationship i don't know we don't speak about stuff
like that i don't know if he's in a relationship okay so here's another thing
jack's made it pretty clear he's been like i don't know who i'm gonna find that's
like you and you said the same to me today and i've said the same thing about him um and another thing is i've been
with him for five years right i was with him for five years i still work with him in a normal situation you break up
and you go separate ways go separate ways you don't speak you don't see unless you're stalking each other
which i would because i'm a weirdo so i'd stalk you for a bit until i got over you but what i'm saying is i see
him every day so it's like how can i ever forget about you you're always there
i speak to you every day i'm on the phone to you every day we make executive decisions together
every day i still go to you for advice every day but why is i don't look at you
and want to kiss you right do you no i don't i don't
i don't not not right now anyway but i don't
to be in a relationship you have to have that flair come on you have to have that spark that
you you make me feel some type of way and i know over time it will pass
and whatever but it sounds so weird but i see him almost like a best friend but then
everyone always tells you to marry your best friend so maybe have i got relationships all wrong
right so i don't know i don't know but all i'm saying is the
person that i'm with and next with or whatever they don't necessarily have like they're
not competing because that's horrible you don't want to compete kind of somewhat unavoidable though especially
in chrissy's brain but at the same time it's like jack
was is the most genuine person like would always take care of me always
listen always put me first would always want me to to succeed it was every check check check check check but why
are we not together i don't i me myself i still don't have a
a fundamental reason as to why you know i read the comments and people
were like of course she would leave jack now she's got like millions of followers and has got money
of course she was she's gonna go marry a rich arab man i was like what you clearly don't know me you
clearly don't know me but um i don't have a rich arab man as a
boyfriend by the way i just want to clear that up but i don't know if jack's dating i i don't know
what he's doing all i all i do know is that i want him to be so happy could
you imagine life without him oh no well that question just took my
breath away a bit no i couldn't no i turned around tomorrow said he said i'm leaving the business i'm moving
no i'd be absolutely heartbroken i'd be i'd be absolutely grieving
i couldn't imagine life without jack but then again don't they say the most
important person in your life as a business owner is your business partner you almost speak
special bond you always speak to them more than you speak to the partner you go to bed with but it's also and the
reason i asked that question is i remember asking myself that question about my business partner many years ago and i'm embarrassed and i thought to
myself what if they died and it was like well then there's no point me doing this business anymore
which is a really weird thought i had i thought well then they were such a fundamental part of the purpose and the journey
and i it made me question you know why i'm actually doing this and i think with jack i think it's probably
true that um a huge part reason why you do this business is because of him you've been
through so much together yeah i couldn't imagine doing it with someone else yeah but i also can't imagine doing it
without him and you've been through hell and back together with jack right yeah and that strengthens the relationship like
you know so much been through so much with jack um you do five years with someone shit's
gonna happen shit's gonna hit the fan is it is it a possibility to be back with him
I hate talk about my success
um like i've always said you can never say never and anything is possible however
if jack was to find someone right and say oh like chrissy you know out of
respect he would have to sit me down because we work together and be like i'm with someone now
and if i see that that girl is treating him so well and looking after him in all honesty
that's all i hope would you be a little bit jealous probably i mean i'm not gonna lie probably would
but and would you then question the decision oh no i'm not the type of
person that if if if i if i don't have you no one else can on you know me and that's just weird
i mean you'd go home that day and start thinking oh i would go home and be like oh like damn you'd set reminders off
like alarm bells will start going off i absolutely don't regret ending it i've learned more about myself in the
year and a half of parting ways with jack than i did in five years of being with him facts i don't regret ending it would i
feel some type of way if he were he was with someone else you'd be absolutely lying to yourself if you said
no come on mate like we buddy was about to get married
we own a company together of course you'd feel some type of way but would i be jealous no would i be happy if he was
happy hell yeah i would because his happiness makes me happy is
in the future a possibility of me being with him again i don't i don't know how can i how can you possibly answer
that question when the possibility of me parting ways with him five years ago was
not even a vision i can't answer that question but if he was to find someone and be
truly happy and in love and she was a good egg i'd be happy and it's possible to be happy for someone
but also for it to suck at the same time 100 but that's only because you just feel some type of way but deep down you
just want them to be happy i think he will find someone i think he's going to find someone who's really
genuine are you smiling i wasn't smiling you're smiling no i wasn't smiling i think you
are i think you were smiling i think you felt some type of way by saying that no i really do i swear i
but yeah i've been honest enough now till now to like lie but but if when he does right
when he does which he will i just want one thing from that girl if you're listening out there to jack's
future wife i just don't want her to sway he's a mind on our business
does that make sense yeah oh leave tone and sculpt you don't need it anymore
that's horrible like don't interfere don't need to get involved love all right look at you but it's true
like i'm sorry but when i'm with a guy if he starts telling me what to do with my company
or if he starts telling me or it's me or jack i'd be like yeah get a grip it's jack
if you give me an ultimatum i don't want to be with you you know what this thing so i was i was
thinking about this earlier and i've got some friends i wouldn't call them necessarily friends but people that i know personally
and they would hate because they're so insecure as men they would hate the idea of dating
someone as self-made and successful as you mm-hmm and it's a certain type of insecure man
i'm laughing because i already know already been there really yeah certain type of insecure man
that really is seeking to control that would would not like a chrissy because
you can't be controlled you can't be controlled through gifts through x and you've been there yeah i've been
there i've done that like you know i remember one time
go for it sarah was like yeah sarah was my pa she's like yeah open up
but i remember one time when i was speaking to this guy you know after jack and i was going to a
lathe this was one of the biggest photo shoots for tone and scott this was you know to refurbish the entire app and everything
like brand new look brand new everything so much money went into this i think nearly 90 grand in production that's a
lot of money [ __ ] to the money [ __ ] ton of money yeah i mean i can put down two mortgages
for that yeah so as you can see like what but when we do things we do things right i tone and sculpt and that's facts um
so i remember he sat down he was like i don't know i just feel a bit you going
i said what do you mean what do you think i'm gonna do go and go and you know
go crazy with other men in la i'm going to work oh i don't know i don't know really
insecure and i found myself thinking it was me
i was like wait a minute and then i sat back and i was like no that's you you're insecure that's a problem that's
not my problem when la had the best time ever with my team we had the most incredible time
you know met the most incredible people came back most incredible campaign and i felt good but had i let that
man sway me maybe i i may have been a bit vulnerable
at the time and let's say he did sway me what if i changed my eye and didn't go that could have happened
was he intimidated by you and your success do you think at the beginning yeah 100
let's be honest i'm 20 oh my god i'm 26. i'm 26. i was still 24. i'm
26 years old and you are killing the game i'll say it because i know you're too humble
no i no no no no no no no i said it it's fine you didn't you
say whatever you want but it's not even that it's you know when you're 26 years old and maybe you have a few things
um people start to obviously feel a bit like you know i think it was
people start to feel like they should have them i say something when you talk about your success i get
awkward don't i i'm super awkward and i'll can i just say an observation and i think this is
a society problem not you problem men aren't like that no they're not i love coming up on here
and saying how much money they're making and how much they're killing it how many x wins that they've achieved um you
don't seem to be as comfortable talking about your success and i feel like that's a reflection of the society we live in
uh honestly it's not even that it's me i'm very awkward with stuff like that like can i be honest i don't even check my
bank accounts i let my account and deal with it i i i don't i i think for me i stay so
tunnel vision and the vision so i wake up in the morning the first thing i do is check
my mentions and dms and go on my community pages in that forum that's literally the first
thing i do and if i start thinking about how am i going to make a billion how am i going
to do this i'm going to do that i don't know it becomes a bit suffocating to the vision that you have
um and i was really number driven at the beginning not financially but on instagram followers
and followers the more followers it means i'm amazing the more likes it means i'm fit enough to be here
you know and i got so obsessed i used to almost like not think i was good enough unless i got a certain amount of likes
or followers and i completely lost sight of why i'm doing what i'm doing you know now i don't even check the
likes i get i don't even check the the my statistics my team do i don't check it because i don't care
what i care about is that comment that a lady saying to me oh my god this has helped me so much
this has made me so confident that feeds my energy if i start thinking
how am i going to get 100 million how am i going to juice that will come i'm confident it will
come but it's not my fundamental you know and it's going to be focusing
on something else yeah i'm focused on something else and it's not that society has made me feel uncomfortable to talk about my success
Are you hard to date
it's that i've you can speak to any of my team like i just don't care about it can i be honest
with you like i am not thriving to
i don't know i'm not i'm not thriving to have the biggest house or the fanciest car
i mean i even said to you like i don't have a fancy car a fancy house by the way and you were like i don't care yeah you
know like i don't really care about stuff like that i never i never have been like that
and it's not that i'm trying to be humble it's like i literally don't give a [ __ ] i don't care about a fancy car never
have done on the things that you do care about you talked about these comments and these dms you get um
i imagine you know because i get a couple dms as well you get a lot not a couple you get a lot
and uh how how does it feel to have that sort of responsibility when someone messages
you something so deeply personal and that they're seeking advice or guidance or they're just
sharing a problem with you how does that feel in terms of well how does it make you feel um
when can i message sometimes because you know what to say because i'm not qualified to deal with
certain situations but at the same time the contradiction with me is like you're giving that advice
something yeah and i just want to acknowledge the person but i know i can't so and it would be almost irresponsible for me to try and solve
their problem 100 you're not there to fix someone's problems yeah but but i think the value that i can bring is
just by like listening and acknowledging but you know there's a spectrum right so you have on one end i love what you do
in the other end you have people that are suicidal or that are you know and um it's it sometimes it's a lot i
had this one video go viral 30 million views and it was about depression and i got 8 000 dm's that week from
people on that spectrum and i just didn't know what to do i was like because when you read them some people
are really really suffering and they've come to me because clearly in some cases one girl that said she'd
barricaded herself in a room in egypt and she was on the verge of suicide like
she didn't feel like she could speak to anyone else and sometimes a stranger yeah is the the most safe place to you
know how does it feel that that has kind of made me emotional no it didn't i did the funny thing to that i remembered
that instantly this girl barricaded in a room in egypt who would watch this video and had reached out to me to for me to
give her the answer she's looking for in her life which i'm not qualified to give right all i can do is
be a friend in that in that situation um but but i'm sure you get messages that are you know yeah i get um messages
every day thousands and um so there's two things that i've started
to do one of the biggest teams we have at tone and sculpt is the customer support team right
and by the way this isn't because we get influxes of emails it's because we have a person for each
social facebook community manager instagram all of this stuff and the reason being is we don't need
them it's because i want every single person to be heard and what you just said that
is exactly what i think as well you want to be a friend i call my community familia
i always use that word i always say you're my sisters you're my familia
because at the end of the day i'm not here to fix your problems but i'm here to listen to your problems i'm here to be the friend that you may
think you don't have in in your reality you can't fix someone's problems you
can't offer you know mental health advice because if you say something wrong god forbid anything happened but you can
listen you can make feel make someone feel like they're part of something and that's the best thing i can do you
know yeah and you know i was i was thinking then as well about the previous topic we had i rarely switched back
but before you came here today there was a question i actually wanted to ask you about because i only ask questions because i am
curious myself sure and i'm trying to i think the reason i ask these questions is i'm trying to find similarities in some way
between a you know a person on your journey and a personal mind the question is are you hard to date
today was one of those days in my life where i'm filming this podcast with chrissy i've got a ton of things going on i've got tons and tons of emails
i'm sprinting around and like usual in my crazy crazy world i am neglecting my nutrition something that i
i have done for probably the last decade and this is why huel sponsored this podcast and why i've
been a huge customer for about three years and why when i was looking for a partner to work with on this podcast hill was the
company that came to mind it's a company that helped me with my nutrition and for me to stay sort of
nutritionally complete as is huel itself despite the fact that i have a crazy
crazy unfi predictable unforgiving schedule and um i love it and it's it's such a
pleasure to get to have a podcast and to have a partner in huel and then julian who is the founder and ceo
where i can talk about it and the benefits it gives to me in such an authentic way if you've not tried huel and you are
someone that frequently neglects your diet whether it's through busyness whether you forget to have meals because
of whatever's going on in your life i implore you just to try it just to check it out um they and heal
comes in many different like shapes and sizes there's the powder they've got like the savory meals now and they have the bottles
and for me i've always loved the bottles um so it's yeah it's a pleasure that
you'll sponsor this podcast and support us in this mission and they're the reason that we're going to be scaling this podcast up
big time i was just chatting to um chatting to some of the production crew that worked with me and jack and dom
and i was saying that um now we have a partner on the podcast we can really take this up a level
Your parents
you've seen me taken up one level this season already we're gonna take it up even further and that's in terms of production in terms
of the guests in terms of what we can invest into this into this um piece of content so thank you to huel check it
out try the chocolate flavor let me know what you think if you are a hula gun right and um i appreciate you listening
back to the podcast the question is are you hard to date
um oh [ __ ] yeah i think so i think i am i'm not gonna lie
like okay so here's the thing right i'm super loving when i'm with you i'll do anything for
you like i'll look after you i'll make you feel special
it's gonna be like but if you like it but no no like honestly like even i
i can honestly say like even sarah and my pa will tell you like i fall hard in love yeah
i head over heels for someone i'll fall so hard for you um but i also fall so
hard out of love for you oh [ __ ] that's the issue of me and that's
facts and i hate that about myself so much it's the one thing i hate the
most about myself i'm a switch you do something to annoy me or you do something to kind of like
it's bad it's not healthy like i people think i'm superwoman i've got my
own problems this like i want my own issues i feel so in love
with someone and then if i don't see that same level of love back i'm like [ __ ] this [ __ ] self-defense
yeah i do think in relationships i'm really i'm really defensive and you know what i can't believe i'm
admitting all this but yeah i i would say i am and i think that um what are you defending yourself from
i don't know okay why are you are you hard to date yeah okay so so are you defensive
christy this is all about your diary well come to me no i want to know what you're defending yourself from
because you you literally said if i didn't get the same type of love back
okay okay so you're obviously very motivated you're very inspired you're very like
driven right thanks you're welcome i'm the same like i just want to keep going
i want to grind i want to grind so if i see someone kind of just not doing the same
infuriates me like i'm almost like how can you not have passion for something how can you not
have a try for something and then it leads me to believe that hold on a minute if i did have the same
person that had the same level of drive would we be compatible maybe i do need someone a little bit
more like low-key because then it will make me feel a bit calmer when i'm home it's all over the gap i don't know what
i want women don't know what they want stop asking women what we want we don't know what we want
we don't know what we want but what i can say is i think sometimes when we overthink
things especially me i overthink relationships all the freaking time i think sometimes
it's a good idea to just take a step back and just relax a bit because if someone is genuinely there
for you willing to listen willing to take care of you and willing to always always put effort
in stop being a [ __ ] pretty much you know i i
me personally i'm i'm difficult to stay i'm not gonna lie i'm not gonna lie i don't even feel bad
saying that i felt quite free saying that like i'm i'm difficult today so no one said you should feel bad no i
i am and i i feel bad for the guy but so i really want to dig into that because i can
really really relate and that's why i started laughing because i've gone over the same predicament in my head thinking maybe i need someone
that's super ambitious and has loads of passions and there's a flagship person and then i thought but then maybe they'd drive me crazy because you know and then
so i flip-flop and usually when i'm with one i think i want the other same and then yeah and then when with
that i'm like nope yeah that's literally me yeah i'll
like maybe we can figure this out today i honestly can't and i think you know what it is
i think it's because we are people that are constantly switched on yeah like
neurotic obsessive obsessive like with work with this with that i'm not obsessive in a relationship
like if someone tries to tell me what to do with my life i'd be like no way and i couldn't imagine ever
trying to tell someone what to do with their life like if you want to do whatever you do whatever you want to do that's your life
you live it the way you want to live it um so because i'm obsessive with my life and my career
i'm constantly switched on so if someone around me isn't i almost feel
like i don't know she doesn't think they're a bum
oh my god i think that's true
it's true yes i know it's so true and then do you find yourself
feeling a bit lazy yeah but also i i'm like steve don't tell him because you're
passing your own world view and your own values onto someone else who doesn't want it yeah and you
shouldn't be trying to change people out here you accept them oh my god that is me i'm literally like
what do you mean you don't want to be ambitious in life what do you mean you don't have a passion what do you mean and i go crazy in my
head and this is happening in my head whilst i'm looking at the meat do you know what i mean like let's say
i'm like let's say we're we're at dinner i'm having a full-on-blown conversation in my head like what do you mean i'm not
ambitious what do you mean you don't want this and he's just chilling you know you're not doing anything wrong and then i have to let you take a
breather and be like what am i doing i can't i can't push that on to someone i can only push that onto myself i need to
chill out connected to this maybe maybe not your parents hard working oh my god so hard working
um came from another country came from another country um immigrated at the back of the lorry
you know i immigrated back of banana lorry yeah and um i remember we landed in
france and my family got arrested because we were immigrants and they separated us so they put
me my my brother in one room my dad in another room he could see him through the glass and i remember crying and crying and
crying like dad dad dad i didn't know what's going on i was four years old but i still remember that i'll never
forget the the prison room was turquoise i'll never forget that and when we came
to this country my mom and dad worked hard my mom worked three jobs my dad worked
as a hb1 lorry driver every single night you know every penny they had they saved
they saved they saved um my dad had a pretty bad gambling problem
The pressure on women
i'm gonna be honest my mum was constantly trying to like fix that problem and
i've never actually mentioned that ever before ever and as much as i love my dad with
my entire heart and and i want nothing more for him to be happy it caused a lot of strain on my mum
like trying to feed her family trying to like work hard trying to save trying to take us on holiday you know
um so to save money and then to have the person you love gambling away it's like
what's the point like i don't understand why i'm with this person but in my culture you don't leave the man you're
with you're stuck with them but my mum even though he was like that my mum
loved and loves my dad so much it's pretty bizarre because that would be enough to take
anyone off but she just believed in him he doesn't do any more believed in him and nourished him and
loved him so much and together they grew better um
so for me if i have a man and he like places a bet on something
it triggers me to think he's going to be gambling and i'm like oh my god no sorry out he's put one bet down and i
think he's canvased you know what i mean it's crazy so i asked that question for a reason gone
um because we've we've established that we have very much similar traits and relationships that we
we tend to really value hard work and ambition and it tends to be the case
that the value we attribute to hard work and ambition probably comes from a childhood where um
hard work and ambition were the thing that might have got us out of some [ __ ] let me
tell you from my example all right so very much the same as yours but switch the parents so i came from
africa i was born in africa came to the uk my dad had like a pretty good job but my mom you could all call it a gambling
addiction she had this she has both gambling addiction on one hand because she played
there was probably a thousand lottery tickets if i opened any drawer in our house okay but on the other hand she she was
she was she couldn't stop starting businesses to the point that the reason why we were so poor we never
had birthdays or christmases or went on holiday at all ever period was because my mom spent all the money trying to become a millionaire
by starting these businesses they'd all fail within six months because she can't read or write and my dad was the unconditionally
loving calm supportive won't leave you even though you're an absolute [ __ ] parent right so there's one yeah so in my house i
think when i think about why i am the way i am now i think money was such a big problem
that in our house it was the cause of so much pain mm-hmm same that i grew up valuing it so much and the thing that
would get you it which would to me would be like you know my what i thought was happiness was like hard work ambition like my
parents worked so hard that they wouldn't even be that in the house when i went to bed or when i woke up and so i value hard work and ambition
because my parents taught me it because it was the cure to our problems right so and especially as immigrants
right there's a different there's like an immigrant vibe i get you yeah i get you don't we don't even have to talk about i
just get you so like this is part of the reason why i think in relationships when someone doesn't have those values when they
The bullshit of being an entrepreneur
don't value hard work and ambition i'm like what the [ __ ] is wrong with you yeah there's probably something wrong with me
i don't think there's anything wrong with you i think i i'm i'm not going to sit here and think
there's something wrong with me not wrong it's like it's the result of my traum my traumatic childhood experience maybe i
wouldn't change it for the world do you know what it is i swear to god i think it's it's the fact
that okay so a lot of people
when we moved to england i was never allowed to like go to stay over other friends houses my dad
is super strict like i couldn't even wear skirts around him absolutely not forbidden and so when i
did used to go to my other friends houses like english culture it was a completely different vibe like
their family was different like their moms and dads were different and then when i'd come to my house it
was different and i didn't understand it so my dad has always wanted me to marry an albanian
man it's like his dream he's like please marry an albanian man you two will be amazing together like
this and i'm like dad i don't care what he is so long as i'm in love
and it happens to be that the guys i've been with have been english and the cultures are completely
different and it it i don't understand like sometimes when they do things i
don't understand examples like okay so in my household mediterranean loud
proud like very like good really yeah super loud i am super loud i love it
but you know you come to my house and my mum will have dinner ready for you my mom will buy you slippers to make you
feel like home you know and she'll she'll welcome you hug you kiss you on each cheek
but then when i'd go to jack's families for example as much as they were so loving so caring it just wasn't the same
like you'd have dinner different times or and i didn't understand it because i've been brought up in a family where
everything's together like togetherness and everyone's got each other's backs and everyone's solid so
to have a different culture thrown into the mix sometimes it does clash and it does like
cultures are different but that doesn't mean one culture is better it just means it's different
so it's up to you whether you want to learn both cultures and and meet in the middle it would be
easier if i went for an albanian guy because their cult culture is the same and i've been brought up in that culture
but obviously jack's culture is completely different so i've had to kind of like
you know find the middle find that that middle ground i guess i don't know
what you call it but find that balance are you scared that you might not ever
meet the right person all the time i'm all the time scared i'm 26 years old and as women we're told
we have a time frame if you're not 30 you have kids you're too old if you if you have kids at 40
what kind of mum are you all this bloody [ __ ] around us all the time see how much pressure that adds as
a woman all the time so much pressure you got to get married you got to have kids you got
to be a mom you got to be a mum before 30. oh that's when i like
breathe out so much pressure and it petrifies me it honestly petrifies me because a lot
of people around me in my industry are married or i'll have children or have like
a fiance and i had that and i almost think to myself i had that and i let that go
and sometimes you you think do you know and this is probably i'm asking this question again for my own reasons so
you do you ever consider the fact that you might be too busy being entrepreneur no you're never too
busy for someone you love i don't think that's the case i don't think um
i'm too busy you think you're what you're doing with with your businesses and as an entrepreneur might prevent you um being
uh aware and forming a healthy relationship when the prospect arises
do you know what i think it is when you have a nine to five you clock out you come home you switch
off you don't clock out you're working constantly even if you're in this room
you're still at the back of your head thinking about your business you're thinking about something you need to do something
to check off something you need to approve something to expand on so it's it's so guilty for me to say
this i feel bad saying it but i could be in a room with you and i'm thinking about my companies constantly and someone who has a nine to
five doesn't understand that because it's like you're switched off at five
and sometimes i feel bad saying i do kind of wish i can switch off at 5 p.m
but i just can't and i think it's not necessarily i'm too busy at some constantly thinking
even if i'm in the room with you i'm constantly thinking about what i have to do you can make someone feel pretty lonely just by being even if you're sat next to
them yeah you're often you know yeah i often say i say like when i'm with somebody my aim isn't for them to ever understand
me it's just to understand that they don't understand yeah because i think i'm like too difficult to understand if i'm quiet for an hour it
doesn't mean i don't love you it means that i've just got an email so true and it's just [ __ ] me and i actually don't want to always share
things at home because you're offloading yeah you're offloading and i don't want to be back because i could offload 24
7. oh trust me so can i sarah's always like oh here we go again um but it's
true like you know your phone is buzzing off constantly you could get a dm by someone you could
you could get a message an email and it's like oh [ __ ] really and you're just sitting watching a movie
with your partner tell me about that part of being an entrepreneur i think that's why i really started the podcast in the first place was
i want to hear about the [ __ ] of running a business the unexpected unpredictable
life-shifting [ __ ] that happens yeah your life is you breathe and you
live your businesses i think this is something people don't understand you live and you breathe your companies they are
your babies no one and nothing can get in the way and no one understands that they see the
money the success the followers the this the that the blingy cars whatever the hell you want to see and
let me tell you the reality you don't have much time you suck at relationships
you don't have many friends and the friends that you have you don't really see them um when you do have time to yourself
you never switch off ever you are the biggest self-critic ever
you constantly think that you could be doing better and that pressure is insane mentally and physically it
drains you and um another thing is that i really just want to say um if you think a life of an
entrepreneur is so glamorous this is the first time i've put on jeans
in i would say i'm blessed i feel privileged i don't know how long but i don't live
in jeans i live in sweats and sliders so if it sucks so much it doesn't suck and you know what i'm trying to say yeah
i know exactly what you're saying but i'm also here to to try and help people understand multiple perspectives because people say
okay so you've criticized you know you've talked not criticized but you've talked about the downsides right why'd you still do it because you could
My battle with depression
just say do you know what i killed it hang up your your gym yeah your active wear clothes
oh your shoes i don't know what people would say and you could say that's it i'm done why don't you
oh no why not gosh the feeling i get when i
when i see someone's transformation nah that fills me up like
that fuels me when i see a transformation when i see someone who
had um a mental a mental health disorder or an eating disorder and has is now thriving
do you know that is so unexplainable that nothing else
matters i'd rather not have a relationship to be frank with you
i really am not that fast so long as i can continue to help as many women as
possible for me that's enough and that's why i don't stop is there an endpoint in all this i hope
not okay there's no like mountain top there's no no i i think that
you know you're you're told in life that you need to go to school you need to go to university you need to achieve this
right so then you achieve this and you are not satisfied so you need to
achieve this and then this and then this i don't have
goals for financial status for awards for anything like that
i had maybe two goals and i've achieved one of them which i won't share because it's
actually very top secret but you'll see it next year okay um but
if you have these um tangible goals i'm thinking now what it is i'm like you finally married an
albanian man i'm like what oh yes daddy i did no no
i didn't i didn't no i'm not married nope that's actually very depressing thank you
um but no it's like you you goals are like you you know when you
wrote in your diary i want a range rover right you got a ranger or what then just total anti-climax
yeah well i want a million dollar house cool what then you're lonely in your house
your house is so big you don't know what to do with it by the way my house is not so big i don't want to do it i need more
space but you see what i'm saying so i don't have those types of goals because they're not attainable
is there a point in when you're building the businesses you run where you had your worst ever day because i
can think about the worst days that i've had in business what was the what was the one that sprung to mind straight away
oh god um okay so when i'm i'm a woman in tech right so
with an app there's complications that you are not even prepared for there's maybe a bug maybe this maybe
that so obviously when this lawsuit was happening to get my app back um from the developers from
the old developers it was a third party company and when we transferred it to brand new
servers that are obviously you know pretty much ours um
because servers are just so huge but um i didn't know anything about tech when i
started now you speak to me tech i know tech language okay so it's actually i'm very proud
because for someone who literally didn't understand what the hell the server was i was like what's the first time you heard about it there's a bug did you
think oh lady bird i honestly don't like it's embarrassing but when the transition happened the
Somethings going to have to give in my life
whole app went right shut down and imagine when you know when instagram shuts down people
like oh my god instagram sucks like fu instagram okay but
this is my company now so when it shuts down it's like i can't i can't i can't pay
for my employees i can't pay for my office i can't do this i can't do that when it shut down my whole face shut
down with it i was like [ __ ] what do i do now this is it we lost 10
000 subscribers in one day okay you times 10 000 by 13.99
yeah it's a lot of [ __ ] money a lot of money in one day gone gone that was probably the one of the
worst days and i just sat back and i looked at jack and i just said to him
what the [ __ ] do we do now jack b and jack he was like don't worry
we'll gain them back on don't worry why are you stressing this is what happens well would you be while we're stressing
idiot what do you mean he's like chill out but um
yeah that was probably the worst day and i just remember i i lost so much weight right i lost
i would say i was 56 kilograms i went down to 49 in like 56
yeah i went down to 49. seven kilograms yeah but i went down to 49 so can you
imagine in what space of time um three weeks to four weeks i couldn't keep anything on i wasn't
eating i wasn't sleeping i lost everything then me and jack parted so
and i was still producing videos still producing content still how long was the up down for it was down
for three days three days and i was still producing content going on instagram don't worry
guys like we'll still get out there i wasn't eating wasn't sleeping wasn't doing anything i just broken up the person i was going to
marry i was in a house with my dog the house that i built with the man i was supposed
to be with i didn't know what the hell i was doing anymore at that point i thought i thought i should give up not gonna lie
but yeah i was like this is it now no no i'm giving up i've got my law degree i'm
gonna go back to doing that this is just too much stress and then i did and i just kept going
just kept going something inside me was like you just have to keep going please don't give up please don't give up chrissy
you talked about um your own battles with mental health um over the years i think i think i read
that you you said you'd suffered with depression at various stages yeah early on can you
tell me about that yeah huge like i mean
a lot of people see a very picture-perfect image on instagram which
i'm to blame just like everybody else you want to you want to showcase the best bits of you nothing wrong with that you keep doing
you if that works you keep doing you but i have been in such
dark places that i couldn't i couldn't picture wanting anyone
to feel what i felt in those places even someone i resent not that i resent anyone but i
wouldn't even want that for them these dark places suck you in so much that you honestly start to contemplate
whether you just want to stop feeling that feeling period like just be done with it
and i'll never forget i was laying in bed one day and i was so
depressed so depressed that i just thought to myself it'd be so much easier if i wasn't here
that's so much easier just quit just leave
and i cried myself to sleep and i woke up the next morning and it almost felt like in my dream i'd made it happen
if you know what i'm trying to say without saying it and i just thought
i need to stop because i cannot go on like this and i think when i try and explain to
people i've i know those dark places i've been in those dark places they don't believe me because they see me for
the person i am today they don't see the person that fought so hard to be
where i am today mentally not even about the success the business is mentally that's the most important thing up here
this is the most important thing you can have all the money in the world all the businesses in the world you can
have 300 employees multiple companies who gives a [ __ ] about that if you up
here are so not okay so yeah i've been through dark places but
i've also picked myself up multiple times and i've had to brush my shoulders off and get [ __ ] done
and that's why i keep saying to every single person out there you have to do this for you do this for
you this is the the biggest and most important thing i can say to you
and now that you have you know you've built this empire this little fitness empire which is rapidly growing do you ever find
yourself in those dark places even today yeah not as bad um
but i find myself um i find myself wondering if
i'll ever have like a somewhat normal life so like what we discussed
will i ever find someone again will i be in love will i get married will i have children like i want
children i want to be married i believe in those things i want those things but sometimes i wonder if those things
are going to happen for me and i do wonder i just maybe need to stop overcomplicating things in my
mind but i can't switch off and maybe the only way i know to switch off is just to quit
you see what i'm saying it's a vicious circle but if i quit i'll be so angry at myself for quitting it's like
ongoing it's constant it doesn't stop so um and do you think part of
that fear comes from the fact that you believe the way you are now and how you live and work now and how
obsessive you are now is probably not like conducive or um
it's probably not going to allow that other all those other things you want to yeah to come true right so like you
think well something's going to have to give at some point is that i do i'm not going to i i literally think like that i'm not gonna lie like
so when when toner scope was built um we i didn't i honestly
didn't realize it would grow the speed it did with little to absolutely no marketing expenditure
so everything's been hyper organic in the space of 12 months we now have a team of 22
people when it was just me and jack 12 months ago 22 people an office in
in in london we know what the rent is like in london it's off the chain um 120 growth
you know month by month it's rapid growth we've just launched a brand new trainer
um who is like insane and um i keep saying to myself okay when
i get to this point i can relax and i say that to sarah all the time
i keep saying i keep mentioning sarah but but because she is the one person that knows me probably better than my own
blood because she's with me everywhere i go and she is the person i speak to about a lot of things
so i always say to okay when i get to this point with tone and scope i can breathe and bless her she's like
yeah yeah she knows in her head i want more and i want more but it's not i want more it's that i
believe we can do more and i believe we can do more and strive for more so when does it end
when does it end it doesn't end that's what i'm trying to say so you have to make peace with it
you have to make peace with the fact that it's not supposed to end but you also have to make peace with the
Are you scared of death
fact that you need to make maybe some self self self-adjustments and and be a bit
critical with yourself because if you're going in a relationship and constantly thinking that that person should be on your level
that's that's my problem i need to deal with that's not their problem you know it's not fair on them how'd you
deal with that i think it i think it takes time i think you're not sure are you
no i'm not sure about your body language oh god i figured that one out it's okay
to not have it figured out right i don't have it figured out and i'm someone who doesn't like not having things figured out
right yeah yeah i get that um but i do think i need to stop being so mean
it's this balance right between trying to figure it out now because you kind of want to be able to have a plan and have
you know but then also realizing that you shouldn't overthink this thing and that you should maybe just you've
literally made me feel in this podcast like i'm the most impossible person to be with i'm not i'm just asking the questions oh
no no i can't lie i'm not going to lie just to make myself sound good no it's it's a very important part of being
a successful person that it has this crazy neurotic obsessive brain yeah i do ambitious and that's but also
has these other things they want and life is a drop at you you can't have everything at the same time so what we're talking about now is like
compromising how you reach that compromise in your life if possible i'm in the same place i have no idea how
that's gonna happen but do you do you want kids i do want kids do you want to get married um i'm not so concerned about
the concept of marriage but i want to have a long-term partner because i want to have kids and so i'm willing to commit long-term
if it's a marriage if it's signing some other piece of paper if there's no paper i like don't really care too much about the whole marriage
thing if it matters so much to the partner i'll do it but i don't i was saying on
the last podcast no i see what you mean i don't have a great case for why the law or or a religion should be involved
in love i don't think it has a great track record with love yeah so i'm like i think that's an idea which we all as a society need to just
reconsider yeah what you mean like i'm gonna my closing statement on this point is we are all so different you are
different from me only a little bit but then like you're different from your assistant and i'm different from mine and
my friends from school so logically you would think the answer to how we form our romantic connections
would also be unique and different like and i think at any time in life where the script tells you everyone has to go
through this door when you are a different shape it's like putting a triangle in a square
like of course i think that's when you have to question things so i got kicked out of school because i just stopped going dropped out of university after one
lecture and i've tried to navigate my life my way through life just rejecting the things that i meant to just accept
blindly and marriage is one of them where i'm like can i achieve all the things i want to in a relationship without that
paper yeah and i put on my linkedin last week i said um i basically said to the world i think marriage is
a concept we need to reconsider for everyone someone proved me wrong and one guy commented he said i've been
in a marriage for 45 years we love each other we've done this i said could you have done that without the marriage
yes okay then yeah so but you would do it if she or i don't know he whatever maybe
but then i need to be honest here because you know if they really wanted to get married i'd ask them why they really wanted to
get married i'm not gonna lie i am the same like for me a piece of paper doesn't define my love for you
okay let's talk about this then so why do you why do you want to get married do you know what it is like this is me
being a woman i just really want to dress we can do the wedding like that's marriage is different from a
wedding in a ceremony someone said that on my post yeah i guess yeah i mean look
my my dream wedding would genuinely be like on the beach having like burgers and beers with the
closest friends and families running in the ocean i don't want it like a big fancy party i feel like you just described
your dream day yeah literally if you could do that like this week but if i said to you because you're
so busy if i said to you what's what do you want to do right now i bet anyone and you'd say you know what i'd
love to be on the sofa and just eat my favorite food for the people i love yeah of course right of course yeah over
going out getting smashed of course that's what i'm saying but a lot of people the only thing is my brain is like go on your laptop and check your
emails see that's what i mean because you're upset because i love it you know what i mean yeah but
what i'm saying is to other people they want a big wedding a big big fuss i hate fuss
i absolutely hate fuss over me and it's so funny because like even my team surprise premier surprise birthday party
i was so awkward i was like don't ever do that again i i hate all eyes on me yes although my
business is built on all eyes on me do you see how that's so contradictory it's the same i used to my previous
assistant um who ended up being my girlfriend long [ __ ] story which we're not going to go into whoa
i don't actually know if sophie so my current assistant sophie's been with me for four years i know she knows this but sophie do you
know this do i do have i ever said to you when it's my birthday or when it's like social change
anniversary to not make a fuss about it and the reason why i say this is because i get so much attention as it is
and so much fuss for like being the founder being the ceo the eyes are always on me you just don't want it you're like no no
no no yeah the same right i'm the same and i always just feel like
oh i don't know so that's why my dream wedding day if that day will come is to just
oh my god 20 30 people max closest friends and families my my dog
there and just to have the person i love and i always say i want to be in a room
full of people and look at the person i love and just me and him understand each other you know what i mean that feeling where you look at them
and you're just like i get you i get you and that's that's what i crave
that's what i want and you're right a piece of paper doesn't define that feeling only
you define that feeling in that person so i don't need a piece of paper you're right um i guess i just want the concept
are you scared of death who me no not at all
hear me no i'm not i'm i'm not are you no i'm not no
i'm not like um i'm scared of not living yes i'm scared of like i really want to
do things i want to explore i want to do things i want to you know my my dream vacation
would be to not have my phone there i don't care about a selfie i don't care about this i just want to be
present in the moment and if i if i told you that you were going to die a week from now what would you so much
what would you regret so much tell me not living just working there you go not living like
as much as i love doing what i l what i do i'm not gonna lie i i've built what i've built telling
people to look after themselves and i forget to look after myself and
that's why when i do train and when i exercise it's the only time i do feel like i'm
doing something really special for myself and i've like i do a lot of skipping right amazing at skipping by the way
thank you i watched you the other day i was like oh my god did you like i thought i was a good skipper no and i saw you like dancing while skipping and
i was like oh she's [ __ ] of course she's doing like a double crossover and i just had to i started to feel really inadequate and
insecure as a man it was fine so i just had it it happens all the time
but you know why i skip why is that uh you have to be [ __ ] present
because if you're not present you get whipped right and when i'm skipping
i literally feel like i can't think about anything else but the rhythm and for someone who's always on switched
on someone who's always doing things you know people always tell me go go meditate do yoga can i [ __ ]
yeah can i [ __ ] i'm like i let you go to meditate and i'm thinking about my my to-do list like but when i'm
skipping i'm so engrossed in it yeah that i'm literally so present in the moment
and it makes me feel alive same thing with training i'm so engrossed in training
and that's why so many women when i say to them just train you're a mom you got to think about your children you're you're a student you've
Having friends as an entrepreneur
got to think about your studies you're trying to trying to make money because you don't know when you're going to pay
your rent just train it's the one moment that you can ignore the entire world
and do something for yourself so i really want to loot background to this
point about if you were to die next week oh you were trying to avoid it yeah i was because you know the answer
yeah but i want to hear the answer because i'm asking this i would feel the same way right maybe
feel awkward my palms are sweating it makes you feel a little bit uncomfortable right it does because i
love my job so much like i love what i do it it i thrive off it
but on the flip side i do wish i was so i'll stop being such an annoying
little [ __ ] and just take some time off for myself you know let's stop being so annoying to yourself chrissy just take
some time off it's okay it's okay to go do things you love doing like traveling obviously right now it's
pandemic but you know what i'm trying to say like travel like maybe take a week off and just
breathe um but i can't i can't i don't know what's wrong with
me i just can't are you the same i'm the same is there something
again i'm just exploring this is there something strange about that where you feel like you know you're saying you're saying i can't it's
like you don't have a choice but at the same time you're telling me that if you were to die next week you would regret not living
yeah oh my god this is such a heavy-laded question um
i feel like i feel like this is the therapy session i needed
but it's it's so true what you've just said you've literally just you've shut me up you've shut me up
because i can't you're like like [ __ ] [ __ ] shut her up but it's true like
i can't stop working because something keeps telling me i can't stop
right now not yet but on the flip side if i was to die next week
i'd regret not taking some time off for myself to do the things that i love doing i love going to museums
no one knows that a lot i literally love looking at things but you think that's a
waste of time i do right now right now yeah and time is
every entrepreneur's biggest asset time is everything how could it possibly
be a waste of time if it's the thing you would regret the the reason why i think this death question is so revealing
is they they do all of these there's a a lady called bonnie ware who was um she
worked with um i think it's called palliative patients which are people that are about to die they've gone home to die and she asked
them the question what are your biggest regrets and she wrote it down and she was doing this for years and she wrote a blog about it
and there's a certain sort of retrospective clarity you'll get in that moment when there is nothing
going forward for your life about how you should have made your decisions in that moment you can imagine
only the things that matter people what that girl said about your hair none of this [ __ ] won't [ __ ] matter
the playground [ __ ] none of it will matter you'll just be left with the things that truly mattered and so putting yourself in that mindset
i call it like deathbed thinking allows you to look at how you're living your life now and see if it's in
accordance with the things that will matter in that like final moment and so
i asked this question because i think the same about me i'm like if you told me today i had four days left to live i'd be like
why didn't i have a better relationship with my family yeah why didn't i go see my niece i don't have a relationship with my brother
well yeah you know i have a [ __ ] relationship with my with my mom in particular yeah i don't see my niece and my two nieces
enough i've probably seen them i know three or four times she's maybe three years old she's only two hours away and so i think these
things about myself and i think okay so but what are you sacrificing have you made a change
because no one's ever asked me that see the question is now you've asked yourself that i think it'll always be there but but it
won't be but no one's ever asked me that so now you've got me thinking oh [ __ ] i need to get sarah to put me holiday because
[ __ ] me i need to live my life but it's like in all honesty i'll probably leave today
and keep doing what i'm doing day in day out until at some point you'll learn this lesson the hard way
facts and you know um recently one of the most important people of my life passed away
the woman that gave me a home you know um you know you know you know my best my
best friend holly who is literally my sister her mom gave me a home when i was homeless
and you know she didn't once mentioned the months she left let me live there
the food i ate the hot water i used not once ever brought it up and i saw her on her
dying bed right and i held her hand and i just kept thinking to myself
nothing matters at this point and you know what holly said to me she goes i would have called you sooner but i was scared you were doing
something and at that point i i it hit me like
i looked down i went never say that again you call me when you need me i'm always there for you but it's the
fact that we've the people around us know how busy we are that they sometimes feel like oh maybe i just shouldn't
the most important people even my mom doesn't know she goes i don't call you babe it's okay i know how busy
you are and i say so no you call me when you want me and you need me and it's not that you've told people not
to call you right it's that they think that you're just so busy that it'll be a
disruption because you've made them feel that way yeah yeah i'm to blame 100
and you know you have to take a step back and you have to realize what matters in life
and that for me that moment there i just realized to
What are you working on?
myself and i messaged every single person i loved the most and i said i don't care how busy i am i'm
always here for you always so that's a real personal moment for your best friend and i'm
i imagine you said earlier that you don't have many friends um i have acquaintances but like
close friends you know like friends no i don't think i don't think a lot of people do that if
you really like ask i don't have many friends yeah like i have people
that are there like acquaintances and i have people that i would genuinely die for those are my friends you know and i can
count them on my hand polly is one of them other people have more friends is that a fair statement
typically yeah sure but i don't really care if you have more friends than me to be honest i'm happy with the people i
have because you have more friends with me doesn't make you more superior or makes you a better person because you have
more people around you it's just you know i'm only 26 i don't know how many friends
i'm going to have at 62. so i have friends do you see what i'm saying
probably less maybe yeah according to the days maybe but at the same time i couldn't
have asked for better friends that i have now and the friends i have now would protect me and look after me and they know i
would do anything for them that's what matters not having a hundred friends i want one
good friend not a hundred random friends so i i asked that question because i think i've definitely struggled to
make and to hold on to friendships because of the way i've been over the last decade in the same way relation like normal
relationships i found that i don't invest enough in my friendships as much as i probably
should okay i'm going to be completely honest um people come and go right
people come and go and it's so bizarre because i know it sounds crazy but i've pretty
much built a virtual community right and i feel like
that's my team even though i may have not met these women physically i feel like they
get me more than the people in my own life is that weird do you think that's weird
you think it's a bit weird don't you be honest i don't know if it's like i speak it's
unusual it's a very curious thing you've just said yeah like
you should i don't know if you've ever seen or maybe not but when i go on a live
workout and i work out with with with hundreds of thousands of women i don't see them they see me but i feel
the energy i i can't explain it to you i i sound crazy right now and people probably
think i'm an absolute crazy psycho weirdo but let them think what they want when i'm like
reading a dm right or when i'm going live for a workout or when i add a new workout on and when i repost people
because you you see i repost a lot of people right um and half the time i don't even tag tony
sculpt i just repost the woman with a sweaty selfie or whatever and
that to me i almost feel like that's enough friends like i have friends for life this is my family my unit my team
my tribe and as crazy as i may sound
i feel like that tribe understands me more than the people in my life so that's when i go on social media and you
see me understand that's me because i feel like we're friends and you get me and
it's crazy because they do get me and i get them they get my sense of humour they get me
trying to dance on camera and be stupid i don't care i sometimes forget i have 2.3 million
followers and i come friends well i sometimes forget right have you seen that i come online and i don't have makeup on
i forget i genuinely forget and i'm like oh [ __ ] my skin's a bit crusty right now
and i just posted that to 2.3 million people what's my crazy ass thinking
and i sit back and i'm like oh okay i don't care but the nature of the internet is that you would of course
you've got 2.3 million people there's a lot of people in there that are hurting themselves and that want to make you feel like [ __ ] too
can i be honest i'm very lucky really yeah i'm very lucky man i
don't get much negativity i don't and when i do
um if like someone's been horrible on a post because i have i have a big
insecurity about my boobs all right like they're they're saggy i'll say it
and cool i've always had a big insecurity about it i remember this one one girl just ripped them to shreds she
was just like ill like they look disgusting and saggy i didn't even see the comment
until i started seeing the community members reply back to her now there's a difference between
replying back to someone and being like you need to stop that was hurtful and then replying back meanly if you're replying back me that's not nice like
you you don't cure hate with hate right so if i see someone being really nasty so i don't like that like i'd rather you
not defend me i don't want that you don't know what that girl's going through just because she's being mean to
me you don't know what she's going through the pain she must be in you don't know but when i see someone
like hey says like you need to chill because that's not nice you don't know what that comment could do to someone
that's a team that's a community that's the family right there
so i'm pretty blessed i don't get as much negativity as maybe other people
i'm pretty pretty blessed touch word that doesn't change um but listen i
i don't know how to explain it to you and i'm gonna sound hella crazy right now but the the community i have man it's
something special like special it's something that
it's it's unexplainable the feeling they give me and that to me is my friends
as weird as i may sound and lonely as i sound so some of the things you're working on right yeah so you've got a book coming
out yes which is exciting tell me about this so exciting so i'm officially an author oh my god
um so my book do this for you how to be a strong woman on the inside and out
is not your average fitness book so i'm pretty sick and tired of 20 day challenges and kind of telling
women that oh my god do this 20 day challenge and you're going to lose 10 pounds oh shut up it's draining jarring stop
i'm going to teach you how to create habits discipline consistency longevity that's what it's about you know all the
programs on the toner sculpt app are some of them are year long
it kind of goes against the typical sales sales script of something with status quo like small effort from you
big results that's what sells right yeah five days you'll lose 100 pounds yeah you know but
that's very honest of you and i think that's real right yeah no you're not you're gonna lose weight of course of course you're gonna lose weight if
you're doing stupid amounts of cardio cutting out specific food groups and you're literally depriving yourself
of course you're gonna lose weight not sustainable is it sustainable no so the way i always say is funny enough
in a relationship if you're constantly just like horrible to someone all the time
is that sustainable not really you have to nourish you have to love you have to care you have to show effort consistency that's what
works same thing with training it's the constant effort you put in day in day out that will make a
difference so it's all about disciplines habits yeah and it's a book that you know what
in all honesty it's a book that i know when someone reads they're going to pass it down right
it's one of those books you read it and it gets you thinking it's a thinking book so i did the audio
book for it as well last week and when i was reading it i was like damn that's good
i was like i know someone's gonna read that yeah yeah listen to it like yeah and it's true
it's a thinking book i ask you what your why is so if i say to you what what is your why why is it that you want to train
i've been over this a lot but uh i mean like the thing that i keep trying to get my myself away from is
having a really extrinsic why that's like i want to look good for summer because when summer ends and i look good
that [ __ ] is done there we go that's a lot of people's why's yeah i want to lose weight for my wedding dress
i want to lose weight for this for an occasion occasion occasionally yeah timeline timeline yeah the occasion comes what then you fall
off a cliff yeah it's not a sustainable why so i teach you how to gain a sustainable why which is fundamentally the most important
foundation you need for fitness then i teach you habits you don't think twice about brushing your teeth why
think twice about your health why think twice about your health your health is the most fundamental and important thing you need
to live you need to get one of them as well and why are you thinking twice about it why are you viewing fitness as a chore
you're viewing your health as a chore that's a shame your body deserves more
whenever you've heard people speak about health like this in a society where women are driven by
fat loss pills and quick quick fad diets and intense workout sessions
it's time to stop it's time to tell you that you need to calm the [ __ ] down
remember your why remember how important your health is and understand that if you have a bad
day it's okay it's okay to have a bad day so that's
what do this for you is all about it sounds amazing i'm gonna read it thank you
um we'll we'll link the pre-order as well in all of the in the podcast and also on the youtube video i wanted to ask you what other things you're working
on i know you just launched a an active wear line that looks pretty awesome they are god has so many issues
with that to begin with but we got there in the end got there in the end honor active um honor active is
fundamentally i was actually building the mission and the vision for it last week um and
one of the things i said is that i don't want it to be a trendsetter why because i don't i don't want
my brand to be something that people just kind of like buy because it's trendy and that's that
i want on active to be something you go back to time and time again so all of our collections have certain
names like the first collection is called classic because you're always going to come back to it it's designed with specific
material that you always come back to it the next collection is called timeless and then our winter collection is called
effortless so it's designed to have a concept that it's your best friend always and forever that it doesn't
matter what year it is you're still going to love honor active because trendsetters they come
and they go you have your 15 minutes fame and then it goes yeah but i want something to be
sustainable if you look at nike lululemon the biggest brands in the world they don't have fancy stuff some of the
best lululemon leggings are the most simplest ones you'll ever find but they're trusted
Outro
and they're loved and that's exactly what i want honor to be i'm not here to start trends
sorry i'm not here to start trends i'm here to ensure that you pick up your leggings
and you trust this product that's my goal for honor active on to
the next business no toner sculpture toner scott was still like obviously my
number one baby in an honor active of course but what we done with toner sculpt um we launched a brand new athlete danielle
wilson i don't know i i clicked on her profile she followed me i was quite uh she loves you oh my gosh she's going to
be so excited yeah she's like oh my god she always reposted and i was like yeah he's all right
i'm joking she's like oh but now she is very special
um because i approached her and the reason why i want to talk about her briefly in this in this podcast is
because i think it's very important she's a 200 pound african-american woman
5 foot 11 not your average fitness guru right
so why would tone and sculpt want her she's not your average fitness guru why would you want
someone who women are scared to think that's what fitness looks like
let me tell you why because fitness for such a long time is not about the
way it looks it's about the way it makes you feel she trains because it makes her feel alive
she's an athlete yeah she trains athletes she is an athlete built like an athlete
that's what i wanted for my brand so when i approached a year and a half ago i
slid into her dms and i was like i am every day inspired by you
and i didn't really think i wanted trainers other trainers on the tone and sculpt out but i what i need you i need
you and on this app and she was like what are you serious like you really
think i should be on the app and i was like hell yeah you need to be on this app you inspire me i know you're gonna
inspire thousands of other women and it's funny because when the whole
black lives matter thing happened five other companies approached her in that month
five other fitness brands and i had a face time with her and i said listen babe if they're
offering you more money and you think it's a better opportunity for you i understand
business is business she goes hell no i'm married to you i'm not going anywhere i'm married to
you she goes but how funny is it that it took something happening
for them to approach me i didn't say anything and i said to her
i'm gonna let you answer that question yourself for yourself oh that that oh that week
my emails were blowing right up black lives matter week i had more speaking requests more invitations
to campaigns than i've ever had in my entire life you know what it is but i'm gonna be honest i'm gonna take the bag
do you know what i mean yeah if you're if you're approaching me because um you think you suddenly have had this
revelation that you need a black person involved fine fine i can't find uh
you know what we're gonna do say no and then like they're gonna go have to go because in this case to find someone else yeah they're not
and in this country when you think about young black successful entrepreneurs
and jamal edwards there's the guy who made sbtv who's been on this podcast it's [ __ ] no one else like that are
you gonna have to start looking at footballers if you want young black and successful and and so yeah [ __ ] and also i can use that platform
as as a way to inspire other people to change their opinions in the same way obama
inspired a lot of naive americans to think that oh my god a black person can be smart and intelligent and clean don't please i
could just so yeah i took the bags every single bag all mine and you know what i i'll keep taking them yeah
no hell yeah hell oh yeah like are you [ __ ] joking me i said i
i looked at danny i said sanya on the on the facetime it doesn't matter where you go it matters what you're going to
represent yeah yeah do you understand that you're going to change a young girl's life by being somewhere
being present being vocal being ambitious do it if the platform that's offering you more money
is bigger do it she was like no i want to be at toner school of course because you yeah but that's
just loyalty that's just her being loyal but it goes beyond bringing another trainer
onto the app it's about representation it's about i'm sick and tired of fitness having
one status quo fitness is not one status quo it's about to help people mentally and physically
if it wasn't for fitness i would not be alive today and that's facts so what's next for chrissy what's next
when you think about the future personally i don't know business
amazing yeah stuff that are coming up beyond um but from a personal
perspective i don't know i really don't know i don't know what's even happening tomorrow in my personal
life are you happy in what sense that's the question for what in one sense in your life are
you happy um i would say i'm really happy in my career and i'm really happy in my community
um from a personal perspective i think i need to just
take a breather and i would say i need to work on my happiness on a personal
perspective a little bit more yeah for sure you're gonna do that
see you're funny because you asked me the questions and you ask if i'm going to do it and then i don't know the answer to that question because i don't
know if i will do it so i don't know i think i just need to i think i just need to be a bit more
patient with myself and a little bit kinder to myself and less self-defensive
listen um i've i've taken a lot of your time and it's been a fascinating conversation i've learned a lot about myself as well
really yeah it's like you know on many of these issues they are they're issues that anybody in the
situation you know both me and you find ourselves in in life where we're running businesses and we're very busy but then
we're also trying to fulfill all of our personal needs at the same time when one of those you know
facets of our life is so all-consuming we feel the same things and we're confused by it we don't have
the answers and as much as we want to have the answers and have control over everything because we are
used to that and we strive for that in our business you know sometimes we have to relinquish control in order to be happy
maybe that's a lot of the answer but thank you so much for giving me your time today but more
importantly for giving me so much honesty um and where can where can people
find you i mean you're everywhere so don't ask questions like you know you've got your book
coming out you've got your app you've got your activewear line i'm sure people will find you and um i just want to say thank you because
there's very few people out there that are a willing to be honest it takes a certain vulnerability to be that honest but it does so much for so
many people and um on behalf of your community on behalf of entrepreneurs like me on
behalf of all of the aspiring female entrepreneurs that are following in your footsteps a
huge thank you because what you're doing it's costing you a lot but it's giving the world even more
so thank you thank you so much
oh
you

Summary:
The podcast episode begins with the host, Stephen Bartlett, expressing gratitude for the positive feedback on the previous week's podcast, emphasizing its life-changing content, which covered diverse topics like depression, anxiety, and burnout. He reflects on how being an interviewer has been an enlightening and educational experience for him, offering personal growth and insights.

In this episode, Bartlett discusses various personal anecdotes, lessons learned, and topics that are significant to him. Key points include:

1. **Means to an End Syndrome**: Bartlett shares his personal struggle with maintaining fitness beyond September each year, exploring the psychological patterns behind his repeated cycle of motivation and burnout. He realizes that his fitness goals were extrinsically motivated, tied to public opinion and summer's end. By shifting to intrinsic motivations (like feeling great, self-discipline, and positive impacts on health), he maintains his fitness routine beyond the usual cycle.
    
2. **Journey Back to Human**: Bartlett delves into how modern solutions for mental health often hark back to simpler, ancient lifestyles. He argues that over-stimulation, poor nutrition, and isolation have led to increased mental health issues. He suggests that re-embracing simple, intrinsic life aspects, like community, nature, and physical activity, can lead to improved mental and overall well-being.
    
3. **Humans Have No Idea What They Want**: Sharing a conversation with a friend, Bartlett discusses how extrinsic motivations and societal constructs often mislead our perceptions of success and happiness. He stresses the importance of intrinsic motivations and the pitfalls of chasing external validations, such as wealth or status.
    
4. **Avoiding Good Opportunities for Great Ones**: Bartlett talks about the challenge of saying no to good opportunities to keep time and energy focused on great ones. He emphasizes clarity on long-term goals, intrinsic values, and a stringent valuation of one's time as crucial factors in decision-making.
    
5. **Skepticism on Marriage and Monogamy**: Bartlett questions the traditional concept of marriage and its alignment with human nature. He shares his thoughts on the institutional aspects of marriage, like legal and religious bindings, and ponders on the naturalness of monogamy, suggesting that societal norms might have influenced our views on these concepts.
    
6. **The Curse of Fitting In**: He concludes by highlighting the joy and success stemming from being true to oneself rather than conforming to societal expectations. He argues that authenticity, rather than fitting in, leads to genuine happiness and self-fulfillment.
    

Bartlett wraps up by encouraging listeners to reflect on being more human and true to themselves as potential keys to a fulfilling life. He invites feedback and engagement from the audience, reinforcing the interactive nature of his podcast.

Transcription:

hello listen before i start i just want to pay a little bit of homage and also a tribute to the guests that i had joined
me last week on this podcast the feedback that i got from that conversation for those that had the
resilience to listen for the full two hours and if you haven't i genuine genuinely implore you too
because the value of that conversation and the diversity of the topics we touched on i genuinely believe are life-changing
i've reflected continuously throughout this week on that conversation we touched on everything from depression to
anxiety to burnout and it's really developed to me you know what one of the things they say is that
the teacher is the person in a classroom that gets the most value from a conversation and in that context
i as the interviewer who got to sit there and listen and prod and think through my own sort of selfish curiosity
i think i got the most value out of that i certainly learned a ton about myself the world and some of the problems that i've had throughout my
life so if you haven't and you do get the time i implore you to go back and check out that episode
and in fact that episode has it's inspired this episode in many ways one of the
things that you guys have said to me in my dms on your stories
in the reviews everywhere my emails you said to me one of the things you enjoy most about this podcast
is when i'm a little bit more raw and when i i'm a little bit less scripted per se
not that i'm ever really that scripted but when i'm a little bit more off the cuff when i talk about my own anecdotes my own life and my own stories and so
this episode this chapter is going to be exactly that it's predominantly centered on my
anecdotes my diary is full of things that have happened to me this week personal stories from my friends and the
lessons that they've taught me the lessons they've taught me about myself about my life and about how to build a
better future so without further ado i'm stephen bartlett and this is the divers ceo
i hope nobody's listening but if you are then please keep this to yourself
How I've FINALLY fixed / figured out why we lose motivation
so for the first point in my diary this week i've literally just written means to an end syndrome let me explain what i
mean every single year i set myself the same goal in february and the goal is simple it's to get in
good physical shape and every year thankfully i achieved that goal until september
and by october my motivation to work out to eat well and to be healthy seems to transform from this like
tangible object that i can hold on to to sand slipping through my hands by january the following year
all hell has broken loose in my diet i'm basically fat compared to how i usually am my my energy is lower my sleep isn't as
good i just don't feel my best anymore then february comes around again and march comes around
and i set myself the same goal to get in shape and the cycle repeats itself this has happened to me i'd say every
year for at least the last five years in a row and i've not been able to understand from a psychological perspective
why this is happening and with all things in life until you become conscious of what's causing you to
behave the way that you are you're merely just a puppet and the puppet master
remains this unknown force this experience you had at some point uh you know a facet of your psychology one
that usually doesn't have your best interests at heart one that usually can't be trusted a puppet master that certainly isn't
working for you he's working for your insecurities or for your for your ego or for trauma that you've experienced
the same cycle unfortunately started to repeat itself this year i mean i started the year fat january
time i was pretty fat compared to how i usually am walking can feel the little rolls on my belly shaking as i walk and i'm wearing
slightly baggier clothes by august i was in the best shape of my entire life right because of an obsessive focus
on the gym i was going seven days a week i was calorie counting one day i did 5 000 calories
and by september my motivation started as it always does to just fall away
i noticed that i wasn't charging my apple watch anymore i noticed that i'd started to miss the gym i started to eat junk food again
this lasted for about two weeks this year but this time i started to be a bit more
conscious about it i told myself what i was doing and i started examining my own psychology and saying literally saying
to myself steve you're doing it that cycle is repeating itself you're eating [ __ ] you're lacking motivation
fortunately i've just written a whole chapter on the topic of motivation for my upcoming book
so i because of the research that i had to do to write that chapter i understand the psychological principles and the forces at play that make someone
motivated or unmotivated and armed with that and my own sort of critical self-analysis which i attained from
being more conscious about what i was doing the fact that i was eating junk food and i'd i could feel my motivation waning
i finally understood why this is happening to me maybe maybe this is happening to me
isn't the best way to describe it why i'm doing this to myself or not doing things to myself that i should be
doing and touchwood i finally overcome it it's november and i'm still working out for the first
time literally in my life i'm still eating well and i'm still focused on my health goals and this is the first year ever that i
can remember in the last five really in the last decade where i've been just as committed to working out now and to being healthy in my entire
life than i was during the summer so let me tell you how i did this and let me tell you what i understood
about my own motivation because i know it's going to speak to you in your own way let me rewind every year around february
march i say the same thing to myself and i set myself the same goal let's just stop there right and take a
look at what i just said because there's a real clue in that first sentence why does this goal pop up in march
the answer quite an obvious one because summer is on the horizon and you've got to ask yourself again you've got to criticize yourself there
and say well why does summer matter well because you know summertime is a time where
we wear less clothes we're a little bit more vulnerable our bodies are on show more and then you can ask yourself okay so why is that relevant well it speaks to
the nature of my motivation my motivation wasn't to work out it wasn't to be healthy because i want
long-term health benefits or to or to feel great about myself as embarrassing as this is to admit my
motivation was so clearly clearly to look good for
summer let's just break that down a second look good for summer looking good
as a goal is measured by just one thing the public's opinion of me ladies opinion of me that's what we call
an extrinsic external goal success of that goal will be achieved when the public think i look
good the next part of that sentence right was for summer the next part of my goal was for
summer which is a measurable time frame so once summer is over
the job is done so the motivation behind that goal was both extrinsic and held within a time frame so when i
dropped that social media pic of me topless in mykonos or wherever i went this summer mykonos and costa rica looking good
during summer and when i got the compliments the likes the followers the praise and when summer passed unsurprisingly
so did my motivation job done my goal my reason my why was attached to summer
and also public opinion and both had been fulfilled so as i pulled into october and i tried to find
the motivation to go to the gym it was gone going to the gym suddenly felt so pointless to me and i had no idea why it
just did even when i managed to get to the gym my workout was quite honestly pathetic it was short it was like
25 30 minutes of me predominantly texting and i didn't know why i just thought i wasn't feeling great
like you know like a boat that had suddenly been unanchored i was now just drifting
unconsciously without intention or real motivation or without conscious realization into
the winter months into bad habits into fat steve and the minute i realized this this year i was able to completely
reset and sort of re-anchor my motivation into things that were intrinsically internally motivating and
without time frames i set myself the goal of going to the gym just because it makes me feel great
and because of the energy it gives me and the positive impact it has on my sleep and because you know i love showing
myself how self-disciplined i am i get a real weird feeling of joy by
going to the gym on a day when i feel like [ __ ] because for me that's kind of overcoming my mind
right it's like beating um the the negative or the the weaker parts of my mind that
are trying to dissuade me from doing something that's in line with my long-term values and honestly also people don't like to
say this but the positive impact it has on my sex life i didn't really know how to say this without sounding like a [ __ ] dick but
i have never been there in bed
and and just generally how good it makes me feel all year round all of these things have
no finish line they're not extrinsically or externally judged by the public they're the opposite of the extrinsic
short-term goals i set myself in march they're intrinsic they are never ending they view life not
just as a bunch of recurring seasons but as one season one season from now until the
day that i die the season of life and that that is the season that it's incredibly valuable
and important to be healthy and to look good for as james clear says you
know we tend to believe that we'll be more successful or happy or prosperous if we put more intensity into our lives
you know like the intensity that i showed in march every year in the lead-up to summer you know like crash diets and sprinting towards our goals at
the expense of everything else staying up for weeks and weeks and weeks on end to revise for that exam but the truth is we don't need intensity
if we have a little bit more consistency had i just stayed in good shape in september october november december and
january if i just gone to the gym maybe twice or three times a week throughout that period and avoided a bit of you know the junk food
which i binged on um periodically through that period i wouldn't even need the intensity for the rest of the year i wouldn't need to
starve myself obsessive in my diet and go to the gym seven days a week sometimes twice a day in fact
intensity for me is often a sign that we lacked consistency in the past and i think
and i've said this a couple of times in this podcast before but until you know right and this is not easy i'm gonna
make this sound like it's an easy thing to do but it requires the same sort of critical self-analysis and
that i've demonstrated that what you would have seen from what i just said is i interrogated my rationale so i said
you know why does it why do i always get motivated in february in march and then i said well because you know someone's around the corner and then why does summer
matter well because other you know extrinsic reasons and if you go down that rabbit hole with humility and with the attention of not defending
your ego but finding the truth then you might understand what's motivating you but until you know what's
motivating you you won't know where you're going or why you're going there or who's steering the ship what force in
your life is steering that ship and i'd predict that 99.9
of your motivations are misguided or somewhat unconscious you don't really know why you're doing
what you're doing i think most of the time you have no idea what the driving force behind your behavior is the same applies
for me but until you do until you have the self-awareness and that humility you need
to interrogate your thinking and the lack of ego to identify why you're doing what you're doing whether it's superficial driven by
insecurities from your childhood because you're seeking validation like i was or other you will never actually be
in control of your life something else is and if your goals are extrinsic
someone else's okay so the next point in my diary i've just written here journey back to human let me explain
Why people are more depressed and anxious (and a cure)
i find it so ironic but somewhat unsurprising if i'm honest that most of the new age techniques that were aimed
to sort of improve our mental health and overall well-being are largely based on
old age principles of how our life used to be tens of thousands of years ago and in the process of writing my book i
i went back over the last i'd say three decades to see how humans and neanderthals lived
their lives to understand why this is it's almost like as we developed as humans and as we
started to rely on agriculture and farming and we stopped living in our tribe it's like we took a wrong turn
and we filled our lives with over stimulation and with like alcohol and caffeine and poor nutrition and
loneliness and convenience right and i think based on the alarming growth in mental health conditions like depression
anxiety addiction and even other conditions like loneliness and i'd say purposefulness right
i think it's time to turn back and the question i guess i often i'm forced to ponder is
what is what is a human being what are we what are we meant to be if we take away
all of this social pressure take away instagram and all of the noise and all of the pressure to conform what are we who are we and how are we
meant to live and infrequently i'll find myself trawling through google
as i did as i you know when i went over to costa rica and i spent the time in the jungle i found myself trawling through google in
history trying to understand humans and it's unsurprising that the natural lifestyle of humans
back then consists of everything that therapists and nutritionists and mindset coaches and psychologists
preach about when you're feeling like [ __ ] today let's start with probably the most
obvious it should be the most obvious and it's definitely a one of the things that's causing depression in a lot of people
it's this lack of human connection back then 10 000 years ago we lived in our tribes surrounded by family and friends and
johanna hari who came on this podcast and is actually coming back on this year that's a little exclusive for you wrote a life-shifting
book called lost connections on this exact point and if there's ever a book i've read in my life and i'm not here to plug your hannah harry just for you know
because he comes on the podcast and stuff like that the reason he comes on this podcast is because his book i'd say in the last
three years has had the biggest single impact on how i see the world right
the fundamental conclusion of that book is we need each other that is non-negotiable i i've read a
bunch of studies and i've seen a bunch of ted talks on youtube where they've done a study over a century and they followed like a hundred
or a thousand people and the people that don't establish meaningful relationships in their lives
die earlier they get more sick and they have a worse quality of life i didn't used to think this stuff right
right i didn't think this was important before i mistakenly thought that if i got rich really really rich everything else would
fall into place so when i at 18 years old my whole life was centered on this north star which was getting filthy rich
at the expense of everything and i sacrificed everything for that and i i gotta be honest because this
that's what this podcast is for i felt that loneliness i didn't actually like weekends because
they were so empty for me i didn't have anything to do i'd i'm sure some of you can relate to this you
know especially you hustle porn stars out there that are running your businesses weekends were just this big [ __ ] void in my life
there was nothing to do so i just went to the office my entire life at that point when i was 18 19 20 was focused on money work business
and after developing this habit of like forced self-induced loneliness for about five
six or seven years it had really really stuck i was a
self-diagnosed recluse one that spent all of his time in the office on my laptop making more money even
though i already had more money than i you know could ever possibly need and at some point thankfully i realized
the never-ending pointless insanity of my situation what was the point in having all of this
money and if i didn't have any meaningful relationships to enjoy it with life is uh it's a multiplayer game it's
not a solo experience and i i got to see how miserable some of my quote unquote successful
friends were by just being behind the scenes in their life one of the i guess the positive things that happened to me when i became
successful quote unquote was i made a lot of successful friends and those friends in many cases were way ahead of me and
and what they did for me is they showed me what my future would look like if i carried on how i was
i got to see behind the scenes behind their lamborghinis behind their mansions and i realized that life had lied to me
you know of course progress and success and striving towards goals matter like of course right it's
it's made me fulfilled to some degree but not at the expense of all the other things not the expensive meaningful and
frequent human connection the other thing that i observe when i when i sort of reflect on on how our ancestors used to live is just
the sheer simplicity of their lives you know they lived together in in caves and these simple huts they were
hunters and gatherers they used basic tools which they had made to track
and hunt birds and wild animals they cooked their prey around a campfire they fished they collected berries and fruits and
nuts their goals were so significantly more intrinsic and survival focused than ours are today
they were focused on taking care of themselves and one another a very simple life it's a very simple purpose
without all of this [ __ ] [ __ ] that we have today without instagram without politics trump fearful news cycles without
two hour work commutes right to get between four white walls to lock ourselves in a cubicle without stress
without traffic without obsessive worrying and notifications and emails and
inbox zero pressures and social pressures and expectations of how your life is meant to be going without all of that [ __ ] a simpler life
which results in a simpler mind which is so frequently the thing that you know
psychologists and therapists prescribe to all of us when we have illnesses today to simplify our lives
but simplifying our lives seems to go against society's mandate that expects you to be
so much that expects career success from you that expects financial success material possessions that expects
psychological perfection that expects physical fitness and health social status to push yourself out of
your comfort zone to climb the ladder to have perfect relationships at the same time to demonstrate the perfect
behavior all while living living in a healthy perfect clear mentally stable mind this level of
like obsessive perfection and you know accomplishment seeking and validation hunting
isn't conducive with simplicity not in the world we live in today absolutely not it's either one or the
other in many respects so instead of living you know a simple life we kind of burn ourselves to the ground
and then we escape off on holiday which is usually based on simplicity which is you know laying down
out in nature and relaxing and doing very little it's like you know there was a quote from a guest that i had on this podcast
a couple of years ago i think it was when i had a chat with the ceo of leon the restaurant chain and he said
you should never cut down the rainforest and then donate to the bees and this is exactly what this strikes me as
you're cutting down your own rainforest in order to donate to your own bees ruining yourself so that you can raise
the funds you need to fix yourself it's like it feels like insanity and i'm super guilty of this i have to admit
so one of the things that i've tried to introduce into my life is a little bit more simplicity scenarios and context that simplify my
life and every day now i go for a walk there and back to the gym and i listen to my music something i didn't do before i just got
an uber and the other thing that's really helped simplify my life is just playing with my dog pets like kids are amazing for
simplifying your world because they live in such a simple world like my dog can spend an hour absolutely amused and
obsessed by like a lucas aid bottle or like pretending he's hunting it's like such a remarkable thing when you
contrast it to the complexity of the world we live in if you're looking to simplify your world briefly
try it if you don't have a dog get a dog but try it try going into their world my niece and
my dog are fascinatingly simple and they're unassuming and they're unpretentious and i want to
live more in that world sometimes and i think this is why some people are also so incredibly obsessed with nature
all this simplicity seems to calm the mind you know it sort of re-centers your soul and the next thing you see if you look
back at our ancestors and how they lived their lives is exactly that they spent literally all of their time in nature that's where they lived they
lived in nature during that i'm going to get this word wrong right but during the mesolithic
period i got it right 12 000 years ago they lived nomadically in camps near rivers and
near other sort of large bodies of water and today like a bunch of dumbass over
developed monkeys we live in these concrete jungles alone between four white walls the time i spent last month for pretty
much the whole month living in the costa rican jungle was the most wonderful tranquil experience of my life it was the most
human experience of my entire life making time in nature has to be a central part of my routine now
it's a really [ __ ] good decision especially for someone like me that lives in a big
busy traffic ridden noisy chaotic city and lastly the key thing i see when i look back at
our ancestors was exercise and nutrition we me you us our generation
are the most inactive sedentary group of humans of all time according to the data our lifestyles are gradually becoming
more and more still more sat down at our desks glaring into these illuminated glass
screens and office blocks we don't need to hunt and gather anymore right like our ancestors did which was a huge source of their physical activity
and exercise because we've got delivery and ubereats some guy will bring me
any food that i want to my door in 25 minutes and i'll be honest with you it's not always good food it's usually you know full of sugar and
artificial substances and things like caffeine which move our mood one way or the other
and also back then we would literally carve and scavenge for the tools that we needed to make our food today
amazon prime that [ __ ] will be here tomorrow i've included this sort of terrifying graph in my book that shows
the gradual decline of human activity i've placed it against the graph of obesity and sugar consumption
and it makes for a pretty alarming read right we're not living like humans anymore we live like lazy gluttonous gorillas he would
increasingly rather go under the knife on a surgeon's table to change our appearance than make a simple lifestyle change not
very human at all is it so no wonder we don't feel so human these days if this is how you're living certainly
how i was living then you should expect to not feel great because you're not living in accordance with your own
natural way of being it's crazy it's crazy that the new age cures for our new age problems all seek to take us
back 10 000 years meditation and digital detoxes are there to still our mind healthy nutrition to cut
out modern junk foods therapy friendships and human connection to read us of the loneliness and to
connect us back to our tribe these feelings of loneliness and anxiety and depression are often according to the science and
my own personal experience nothing more than a calling from our body to get back to our tribes
to be a little bit more human not to find ourselves but to rediscover who we were
who we are as humans and if you're struggling in any way here's some advice give it a go try and
live a little bit more human for me as a sort of mentally busy career-obsessed recluse it fundamentally changed my life
i know that for sure and i genuinely believe that it might be the thing that could have the greatest impact on yours
Humans have no idea what they want
okay so for the next point in my diary i've literally just written humans have no idea what they want which kind of ties a little bit into my first point
but it's very very different i want to tell you a story one of my very very good friends i won't name him
because that doesn't matter and i keep referencing friends on this podcast i'm slowly losing friends so my
my circle is getting a little bit smaller i'm just joking one of my good friends came to my house last week for a little bit of a catch up
and he sat on my my sofa over there and he asked me um a couple of questions about myself and i
turned to him and i said listen how have you been and somewhat instinctively as we all do he replied yeah good and you know
when you're my mate i have to be honest i [ __ ] hate that response give that response to someone in like
business or when you're in a networking event or something like that nobody has been yeah good nobody
life fortunately and to be honest unfortunately isn't that simple definitely not in the middle of a global pandemic where our lives are locked down and
stripped back and have been completely shifted nobody's yeah good so i instinctively replied to him which is a habit i've got
into recently especially with my close friends no how have you really been and almost
instantly literally almost instantly he went yeah yeah i'm pretty burnt out to be honest with you and
that's kind of surprising because you know i'm really lucky and i stopped him there and the reason i stopped him there is because i've just spent the last
month studying the topic of burnout for my book and i wanted to check i wanted to check if he like
pretty much everyone else i've ever spoke to fit into the pattern and the category that almost everybody fits into when
they experience burnout i said to him when you say you're feeling burnt out but you're surprised
because you're lucky what do you mean by lucky and he said well you know because you know i've got all the things ticked off i've got the
money i've got the car i've got the house and then i stopped him again and i said that's why you're burnt out because your own self-confessed
definition of career or life luck and success is extrinsically purely extrinsically motivated
and as i said in last week's podcast on almost every occasion where someone is doing something that they're motivated to do by largely extrinsic or
external reasons whether it's money or status or fame or likes or followers or to obtain like
material objects where the intrinsic internal rewards like joy and personal fulfillment
a sense of purpose or a sense of belonging are limited you will inevitably lose your motivation
you'll struggle to get out of bed and you'll self-diagnose yourself as everybody seems to do as being burnt out and let's just take a
look at the world we're living in right now because it adds a really important layer of context to all of that this pandemic has robbed all of us our
lives and our work of things that made work and our lives intrinsically enjoyable you know that feeling of striving
towards a shared goal the social value of being part of a team in an office that sense of belonging it gives you
the sense of forward motion and progress and purpose and accomplishment and to be honest in our personal lives
socializing and days out and family and friends and travel and this robber the pandemic covert 19
has left most of us with just the work wake up zoom to-do list sleep wake up to-do list
sleep it's left us with just the extrinsic stuff and to be completely honest
the only thing that makes doing a lot of the extrinsic stuff like work worthwhile is the promise of all the intrinsic
stuff socializing community purpose that it promises you that it gives us
but right now it's not giving us that we're largely alone not enjoying ourselves much we don't
know what the mission is we don't know when we're going to be out of this situation so our work feels heavily extrinsic therefore pointless
we're doing it to pay the bills we don't have our colleagues around us anymore that sense of purpose and mission is gone therefore we lack motivation
therefore we feel burnt out the more i've tried to understand the complexity of humans the more i've realized how simple
predictable and alike we all are and our motivations don't tend to be that dissimilar with
such fragile emotional unconscious beings that think we're strong resilient unique
and in control we're not we're all going through this [ __ ] together making the same mistakes predictably
because we all have a very very similar innate psychological wiring and the same psychological factors are
running the show our working lives have been completely knocked out of balance and the work is just that now it's work
social chain my company the company i founded and recently resigned from you know it was renowned for its culture
for its sense of community for the sense of purpose and that intrinsic pleasure it gives the people that work there for
the joy of you know the dogs in the office we had about 10 of them to be honest we had a happiness team that would make sure every day when
you're in the office you're feeling good therapists that were there for you in the office every single day we had this sense of mission and purpose
that we were building this business and forward motion and uh it was going great because the business was growing it still is but it
was growing and that gives you purpose as well but when a pandemic and a lockdown strikes all of that stuff
is taken away all that intrinsic stuff the enjoyment is taken away and something that was fundamentally
designed from the ground up to give you as much joy as a job could possibly give you becomes a bunch of people alone in their boxer
shorts on their own little islands doing their to-do list every day chatting once in a while on zoom or over
whatsapp or in shared company groups work becomes work nothing more that combined with the lack
of structure that everyone has in their day now results in long ass working hours and that has a huge impact on your sleep and
and all of these things and all the other problems sends you straight into a place of purposelessness low motivation
and when all that happens we we say it's burnout and i think everybody's experiencing a bit of burnout right now
you know every year at christmas uh come it's widely known according to the data
companies experience the highest amount of staff turnover because you know as those sort of new year's resolutions and all the introspection
occurs people decide they want to go work somewhere else they want a new challenge they want something else for their lives and we always see the same thing as
social chain and this year we saw that behavior happen a few months into the pandemic
quite a few people quit more than we've ever had in the middle of the year ever before and part of me knows that this is
because social change pretty much every company lost some of its intrinsic value that community and purpose and fun
and when it loses it and when all you have is the extrinsic like paying the bills a lot of people go looking for pay rises and if you've worked at social
channel i'm telling you you can get a pay rise it's got a good brand people want people that have worked at social chain and when people to
start to sort of enjoy their work less they arrive often at the conclusion that social change is maybe part of the issue maybe social
change is the reason i'm not enjoying my work as much so they go in search of that purpose somewhere else and people have been
leaving other companies and in their droves to be honest and wanting to come to social chain and people have left social chain wanting to go
elsewhere and this is something that's happened not in social chain alone across every business across the whole country so if you're feeling like [ __ ]
in your job if you're feeling a bit burnt out if you're lacking motivation you're feeling i know stagnant this is probably a large part of the
reason but going back to the conversation with my friend which is where this this started before i went off topic there's another important layer to
address here my friend like me had a relatively psychologically
rough start to life with family issues and issues with his peers it robbed something from his self-worth
in the same way it did for me it made him insecure in the same way it did for me and listen bro i know you're
listening to this because this guy he's one of my very good friends he never misses an episode he always gives me great feedback i know you're
listening to this right it takes one to no one everything i'm saying about you could be
said about me too i too as everyone knows grew up with insecurities that made me try and ball out on social media they
made me buy all the champagne and every night club i went to made me pull up in sports cars right in his case it's made him particularly
intent on showing the world that he is worthy and that he is successful the clue of course is in the fact that when i asked him to
define what luck or success meant to him he said a bunch of material things something some insecurity taught him as
it taught me that his success would be judged by the outside world's opinion of him and as i said in a previous episode of
this podcast the thing that invalidates you as a kid whether it's sort of lack of self-worth or a lack of affection or
a lack of a sense of belonging will be the thing you seek validation from when you're an adult and you know failure when both he and i were
young was not being worthy not feeling as worthy as our peers me for my own reasons and
him for a bunch of different reasons and because that was our definition of failure that
was the thing that failed us that's what you know that was the the worst part of our lives then our definition of success now
is the opposite think about it if failure then was not feeling externally valid or valuable or worthy
success now is feeling externally valid worthy and valuable so we we both got big cars nice houses
lots of champagne and we proceeded to tell and show the world all of it i guess subconsciously in the
hope that it would validate us and we designed our lives to focus on achieving extrinsic externally motivated goals like money success
status and the science is clear on this and my own personal experience it couldn't be it could be clearer on this particular
topic according to the science you will experience less joy more despair increase your chances of depression anxiety
and sign yourself up for a hamster wheel existence where nothing is ever enough of anti-climax and of
lack of purpose and if you design your life where your north star is all of this sort of extrinsic meaningless [ __ ]
you're designing out all of the things that actually internally matter like meaningful relationships the two are kind of
mutually exclusive the things that you enjoy for you for your own reasons for your own internal
sake meaningful hobbies and passions and subsequently the chance of being fulfilled happy and free from all the mental
health issues that will inevitably show up if you live in such an externally driven way you know at 18 years old
as a lot of you will know i wrote in my diary that my goal was to buy a range rover um
i wrote there in my diary that a range rover would be my first car that was my goal and that was a goal
that was born out of insecure naivety i guess
definitely a lot of insecurity and it was a goal written because i wanted to impress people and i wanted girls to sleep with me
right a goal born out of the fact that i wanted to be validated and fulfilled and i thought somewhere in me that a
range rover would make me feel secure in myself i got the range rover it was my first
car mission accomplished it impressed people but when you think about it it didn't make
me feel secure in myself all it did was highlighted
but i wasn't it was the consequence of insecurity so paradoxically the day i achieved my
goal wasn't the day that i bought the range rover it was the day three years later when i
sold it when i no longer felt that i needed it that was the point where i was securing
myself and that was the goal i was trying to achieve and you know going back to my friend for
a second you know he's just to give you a context of how he's working he runs his own business but he works alone
very similar to how a freelance would work doesn't have like a team of people around him just kind of working alone at home at the moment
and you know the world has done just a phenomenal job of glamorizing the idea of being your own boss and being a
freelancer but nobody seems to talk enough about how miserable this often is and let's just factor all of the things that
i've touched on on in this podcast up till this point about you know extrinsic goals and the things that make
life meaningful you know the joy of working in a team of people with a shared mission on work that you intrinsically enjoy
doing with as much intrinsic motivation as possible all of this stuff is often the absolute
antithesis of freelance work where you often work alone without a team on someone else's project for
someone else's purpose just for the extrinsic reason of money or paying the bills right
on top of that you have all of the other [ __ ] being on japan no work life balance no work life separation no clock
off time i'm gonna call this freelancer depression we're gonna try and make this a thing freelance and depression
it's something that people who evangelize about being your own boss and going alone and all of the freelance lifestyle never
seemed to mention that much and to be fair this pandemic has made us all freelancers to some degree it's
robbed us all of that intrinsic rewarding stuff i i guess i just want to i just want to tell you one more thing
now that i've left social chain and i'm technically unemployed i was i sat on the sofa it was actually
yesterday with my it's actually yesterday night before i recorded this podcast with my assistant and she turned to me and she asked me a question she said do you miss all the
travelling and the chaos of your old life and i said to her like what do you mean what do you mean and she said well you
know you used to be up at 3am every day running all over the world pitching and speaking on stage and for a second i paused and reflected
and the thought of doing any of that stuff now [ __ ] repulsed me
i couldn't think of anything worse but i mean this is a big but i absolutely
used to love it i absolutely used to love it made me so fulfilled but now you couldn't pay me to do that and the
reason for this the reason for this sort of monumental shift in my mind is because when i was at
social chain i was working with people i loved attached to a shared meaningful purpose and a mission and we were building
something amazing together when you remove that and ask me if i want to run around the world catching five flights a week and living in hotels
50 weeks a year it seems totally bizarre and repulsive and pointless it seems like such a sacrifice for nothing i would
hate to do that and it brings me back to the moment in my life where you know i think i've talked about this on the
podcast before where i was technically freelance for the first time it was after i was 21 years old i just exited my first startup wall park
and i hadn't started social chain yet i was being paid i've got to be honest with you about 70 grand a month by companies all over the world
to help them as a consultant run their businesses to advise their marketing and i was in this i was in um i turned
to my mate dom in our penthouse apartment in manchester on the 20 we own three floors up there i'm not bragging i'm just providing a
bit of context which i think is important and i told him exact quote if i go downstairs right now and i send this one
email i'll make 20k straight away and i just can't find the [ __ ]
motivation to do it and i don't know why it's 20k that's what i said to him verbatim exactly and the reason
was because at that point even at the point where i was making 5k a month consistently something as extrinsic as a little bit
more money was not motivation enough it would have no intrinsic material
impact on my life so the cost of walking down some stairs and writing an email felt greater than the reward
but when i you know when i think about the moment i went from being a freelancer to when social change started
i was working with people i loved on a shared meaningful mission to build something [ __ ] a flight of stairs i was flying to the ukraine at
2am on the off chance that someone might work with us and i did that like a dog for
seven or eight years i didn't have a motivation problem when i was a freelancer it wasn't a motivation problem right as
people often sort of self-diagnose it wasn't a lack of motivation that stopped me walking down the stairs in my
penthouse and sending that one email that would make 20 grand i had a purpose problem and the same applies to the conversation i had with
my pa you know when i think about sprinting around the world pitching speaking living in hotels and sacrificing my life now
it feels so [ __ ] pointless because i've left social chain so i'm i guess i'm detached from the
purpose and the mission that i had then and i i finally understand for the first time in my life
why people who looked at my life back then and often said to me you know how did you do it you know why did you
sacrifice everything are you crazy when do you sleep all of these questions um are you okay i used to get asked all the
time um how did you find the motivation all the time to to run the business and all of these things why you know sleeping in the
office in the weekends why did you work so hard it all makes sense now because when i look back
without the attachment to that mission that i had then to me it it looks bizarre i'm asking old stephen
why the [ __ ] did you do all of that because right now i can't feel that purpose so all i can feel is the sacrifice
but i guess that's that's how you behave i guess that's how you behave when you have a deep sense of purpose in the work you're doing so i guess my conclusion is
this the answer to loving your work and being as being the best at it which i think
that i eventually became within my company is working with people you love striving towards a shared worthwhile goal
for your own intrinsically rewarding reasons and if you can do that i think you'll also do a pretty good job
of avoiding burnout you'll do you'll do the work of your life for sure like i did at social chain
and you'll remain fulfilled the whole time that little insight helped me so i
really hope it helps you and so the next point in my diary is one that i haven't fully developed yet my
Key to success: Avoiding good opportunities so you have time to devote to great opportunities.
thinking on so i'm kind of hoping i can do this out loud with you together what i've written is one of the hardest things in life is to avoid a good
opportunity so that you have time to devote to great opportunities and since i've left social chain and i'm now
technically unemployed but i have a great reputation i have a great track record um i gotta be honest my inbox every day
is full of just amazing opportunities but the amount of time that i have every day has remained the same
i have the same 24 hours and i'm being bombarded with offers and jobs and opportunities to do
this and that and the other and i know that if i choose to accept any of those opportunities i'm doing it at the expense of something
else which i've talked a lot about in this podcast and so one of the real challenges and
one of the real sort of talents that i'm trying to foster in myself is being so clearly attached to my long-term values and goals and where
i want to go and who i want to be that i'm able to look at a really good opportunity
whether it's financial or you know other or status or whatever it might be or for my personal brand or whatever it might be
and say no now and and to do that you have to have real faith
in yourself but you also have a have to have a real attachment to who you want to become and your long-term
goals and it's something that i'm genuinely struggling with because never in my life as i said have i had more
people in my inbox asking me to become directors and ceos of their companies and offering me shares to come and help them
and so i just wanted to share a few things which i which i have written in my diary about how i make the decision
and whether to take an opportunity or to not it's fairly fairly simple the first one as i said
is by being super clear on the person that i want to become in the future and the first check i can do is is doing
this opportunity going to move me closer or further away by costing me time to becoming that person
and the next one which i consciously ask myself all the time now is if i become that person that i want
to become in the future by remaining loyal to that sort of long-term image of who i want to become and my values
will this opportunity come back around and for about 90 of the opportunities about 95 percent
it will definitely come back around in even greater abundance and value if i become the person i want to become
and the last thing i do is i attribute a financial value to an hour of my time and i've read a lot about this naval's
talked about this at length as well and philosophers and you know people that i respect in the business world have told me about this
as well what you want to do is think of a really big number for me it's about ten thousand pounds
i say to myself that one hour of my time is worth ten thousand pounds and my rationale for that is based on
what i was able to create with my time historically so you think about social change in the business and what it became and how much it's worth
when i go through and think about how much each year added to that value i can quite
comfortably say you know a year of my time is worth say 10 million or 20 million quid and when you
think from that framework and when you really attribute huge amounts of value to your time you're able to cut things
out quickly that don't meet that value it's something that i genuinely recommend everyone does i'm not saying attribute 10k an hour to
your time but even if it's a thousand dollars start there say my time one hour of my time is worth a thousand
dollars and if you think through that lens i swear to god the opportunities that
will come to you the ones that you'll accept will be of significantly more value and ultimately that means you'll spend
more of your time more of your hours on things of higher value and then that's what your life will become high value
give it a try the next point in my diary i understand is quite a controversial one um i've just written marriage monogamy
Why I don't think marriage is the right answer.
and me listen and i've spent a lot of time in this podcast talking about relationships and my views on marriage and the
relationship struggles that i've had and before i say what i'm going to say i want to appreciate the fact that this is
a completely nuanced subjective topic but here's my thinking i'm 28 years old
and i don't know i don't believe that marriage is the right answer a couple of reasons let's just start
with some fundamental principles pretty much every every way that i think is based on first principles i don't think for a star
that the law and that religion have a great track record on pretty much anything historically and i think that
marriage is a construct that's been passed down from one generation to another throughout our society without real
interrogation because we've all done that and i can literally predict um the dms that i'm gonna get which
which tell me that i'm naive and that i don't understand which like listen probably true right but that's the whole
point of like me scrolling in my diary i like this to be a two-way thing where you can just message me and say steve you're an idiot
and you do you guys do you i get the messages you don't understand the world fine that's probably true i know it's true i don't understand
everything and that's part of the reason i'm doing this but getting back to the point um for me the concept of marriage
when you look at the fundamentals of signing and assigning this commitment and going to a church and the
legal and religious ramifications of some marriages it just feels really insecure it's like
if i love someone why do i need a contract why do i need to go to church why do i need to get the law involved if i
love someone what has any of that got to do with courts and contracts if i love someone
and if i'm secure enough to believe that they love me too that they won't they won't leave me
and sometimes i think it's a bit like trapping a cat in a corner because when you're in a marriage and when you're in a situation which feels kind
of imprisoned or like you can't leave um i think issues might become somewhat magnified
right you know the worry and the anxiety of not being able to leave because of that rain or that contract or because of
the way you set up your life i actually think it might make issues bigger than they are and it's something that i've really
pondered you know i have a track record in my life of really like interrogating stuff i interrogated
school to the point that i stopped going in university to the point that i went to one lecture and decided that it was a completely broken concept and i'm
starting to do the same with marriage and people will hear different things when i say this right largely based on
their own opinions in life and their own experiences and this comes from my own experience probably largely largely from the experience of watching
a very dysfunctional toxic marriage that my parents had and i'm not saying marriages can't be brilliant some of my friends have the
best marriages some of their parents have the most amazing marriages too i'm just saying as a one-size-fits-all
concept i think it needs a little bit of questioning um i i'm all down for the commitment i
think i'm still developing my ideas there on monogamy but the commitment part isn't the thing i have issue with it's the like marriage part the law the
contract and all that nonsense i want to talk about monogamy too because oh this is going to be controversial but
um i'm also not completely convinced that we're meant to be monogamous
i'm not completely convinced that we're meant to have one partner like i'm down for it because i understand the way that the world is
wired at the moment um but this might be the most controversial thing i've ever saw in
this podcast but i think if we all i think of a huge
amount of us are honest with ourselves and this is based on the behavior we exhibit we would probably sleep with someone
else that was smoking heart we don't because we value the relationship and we don't we know that the relationship is worth
more than a one-night stand with someone else and we're mature enough to
understand the consequences of our actions but i think if you were to anonymously poll people
and say listen would you sleep with someone else that was hot if it had no material impact on your marriage
i think if we're being honest with ourselves a lot of us would but i think 99.9 of us wouldn't want our partner sleeping
with someone else and this all of this speaks to the fact that i'm not sure as humans
as men as women we are innately meant to be monogamous i think that
society has played a huge role in that i also think that over the the coming
decades i think you'll see real shifts in this probably not with me because i'm not going to get to the point where i i'm
down with someone i love sleeping with someone else if i'm completely honest but i think it's broken
i think marriage is broken i think like university it's broken you know if if i told you there was tvs for sale at
a shop on a corner but 50 of the tvs failed you wouldn't go and buy a tv and it's the same for marriage
50 of marriages fail and if you think about the concept of marriage it's till death do us part but 50 of the
time it's not till death does this part it's till that girl slides in your dms and you meet her and
you bang her and then you you know your marriage falls depart or that guy slides in your dms and you go for a coffee with him and your boyfriend
finds out and your husband finds out he dumps you the concept seems broken and i but i don't know the answer i don't know
what the alternative is i know that it's going to have to be commitment-centric but i feel that maybe when it comes to
my life i'm not going to seek marriage i might try and create some kind of new age urane arrangement with my partner where we're
committed to each other where we have the party the celebration which i think is [ __ ] awesome by the way but we don't sign all the contracts and
we remain as two separate you know independent humans that have come together in the middle through love
without religion or without the law it's just an idea some of you will
disagree let me know what you think in the comments section below or let me know what you think in my inbox or my
my twitter because this is a super controversial topic and it's one that we're going to be talking about i think next week with a very um awesome
person who is also developing his opinion on this i don't want to give the the
don't let the cat out the bag on this one but trust me next week is going to be one hell of a conversation the last point in my diary this week is
Why you should NOT "Fit in".
kind of linked to a lot of the stuff that i've said throughout this conversation this chat today about
extrinsically living your life through society's image of how you should be living i've just written that fitting in is a
curse and the more you can be you the more happy you will be the more you fit into society
the less free you actually are i think about my time in school and you know and we've all had that
experience in school where we want to wear the clothes everyone's wearing we got our hair cut the same way we listen to the music that is cool to
listen to and how like trapped that way of living is in fact what i've come to learn as i've gotten
older and as i've gone through life and i've become my own person and i've taken some of these shackles off is the closer i've gotten to being steve
who steve actually is the weirdo that i naturally am and that you naturally are the
expressing myself in a way that is true to myself in the words that i want to without worrying about who's going to cancel me or judge me
or my friends or friends might say you know fake friends whatever the more happy i've become the more successful i've become it's made
this podcast interesting right because i am myself there's this isn't acting this is what i think and how i feel every
week and i don't think about the impact of it the closer i've got into not fitting in
to being who i am the more happy i've become and i think it's just something to really reflect on because
there's so much of our lives that are sort of imprisoned by this idea of conformity and fitting in and being one
of the girls or being one of the lads or you know wearing those clothes or those shoes or being you know
being socially accepted and almost on every occasion i can't think of one reason or one instance where that is an
intrinsic intrinsically motivated thing to do and so the science says as we've talked
about in this podcast that will lead you to the despair the lack of joy the depression anxiety and and in many cases to mid-life crises
when you realize that you've been living your life on someone else's terms for someone else's reasons i'm on a mission whether it's through
this podcast which is my diary my thoughts or whether it's through everything else that i produce do or the work that i
pursue whether it's how i dress whether it's through the diary of a ceo live show that i'm doing to really [ __ ] be me to think for
myself and thinking for yourself isn't easy we think it is and this goes back to the point of us thinking we're in control
and getting to the bottom of what your motivations really are i'm really really trying my my very very
best at all times to just be steve and if there's anything that's had
a bigger impact on my success my happiness it's exactly that
isn't it weird when we think about our goals for the future we often say that we want to be x we
want to be like x person we want to be like x thing when really we shouldn't aspire to be more like our
idols we should be aspiring to be even more ourselves the unfiltered uncaring
unassuming intrinsically motivated version of ourselves maybe that's the secret maybe this whole
podcast is has led to that conclusion maybe this whole series is about that maybe that's what life is about maybe
that's the meaning of life maybe the meaning of life is exactly that you start
in the womb you pop out life tells you you are something it tells you to conform in the classroom on the
playground and maybe we're not just on the journey to being more human
but we're on the journey to being ourselves maybe that's what it's all about
being more human and being more like yourself

Transcription:

you've made a great decision and i say this as impartially as i possibly can but this
podcast is it's really the reason why i started the diver ceo it's to hear these kinds
of stories from these kinds of people and i've got to be honest with you i spent about a year asking this person to
come on this podcast and have a conversation with me today's guest is dr aria and he's been
on the podcast once before he's a a world renowned high performance coach and he works with some of the world's most accomplished
athletes actors and everyone in between as they try and reach a mindset state that is
conducive with success with happiness and with overall fulfillment but he's not here to talk about that
today he's here to talk about something very very different something
uncomfortable something unimaginable so without further ado
i'm stephen bartlett and this is the diary of a ceo i hope nobody is listening but if you
are then please keep this to yourself [Music]
The Story
sometimes in life you have these unbelievable somewhat cruel coincidences that occur
that it's hard to make sense of and last time you came on this podcast i would define it as for me anyway
a pretty cruel coincidence because we had a conversation um to do with life
generally and and success and the mindset and psychology and all the things that you're an expert on and for whatever reason that day
i decided that i wanted to spend 30 minutes talking about marriage cheating love
and asking you these um very personal questions about monogamy which i've
never done before with any guest ever and which i really had no place or reason to ask you more than anyone else
and it just feels to me for what we're going to talk about in part today that that was a bit of a
cruel coincidence and you know one of the questions i asked you was um do you believe in monogamy and then i
asked you can you love someone and cheat on them and when i listened to that podcast back
i now noticed um why you laughed because it wasn't you laughed yeah and
it wasn't a normal laugh it was like a real belly laughing right yeah like a bit of a nervous belly laugh
yeah after we came off air on that podcast you told me something and uh it
even gives me goosebumps now thinking about what you said and it gave the whole team in the room who
overheard our conversation goosebumps as well so
after our 30-minute conversation about marriage monogamy and cheating and love what did you say to me
i told you a story yeah and that was uh about two weeks earlier i'd been
traveling back from london home and i got out of the train station
and my wife picked me up and we got into the car and we had planned to go and have a
brunch at my favorite little spot they do amazing corvo's rancho sauce i was very excited and she said let's go
straight home i've made sandwiches and she doesn't make great sandwiches so i said no no i think the brunch is a
better option and she said no there's something that i need to tell you and i said is it bad and she said yes
and i said is that about the marriage and she said yes and then we began to
drive back and i had the sinking feeling in me
and we drove for about five minutes in silence and then i went to put my hand
on her lap and she said don't don't touch me because you won't want
you after i've told you what's happened and that's whenever it drops and i
remember that 10-minute drive back home then felt like an eternity i was just looking out the window and we
got home we got into the house into the kitchen and i was standing
by the kitchen table hands rested on it and i said what's happened and she said
i've been having an affair with a man from work
and i remember just tears began to stream i didn't move completely motionless tears began to
stream and then she said and that's not all and she said i'm pregnant with this child
and in that moment i felt like i lost a lot you know i'd
lost my wife i'd lost the life we created i'd lost the dog
our home her my parents-in-law her family everything that really held dear if
someone said what makes a meaningful life i would have described these things and it felt like they'd just been snatched
away just came crumbling down like a house of cards didn't fast forward two
weeks and steve said and i remember because the first thing
no no it's fascinating because the first thing you asked was you're married right and i do this
high-pitched laugh and i go yes and then and then the conversation
blow down and and it's themes i'd really thought about can you love someone and cheat on them
does monogamy exist is it natural are we set up to live a life where we're
in one relationship with one person only and so with the past
18 months it's been a process and some of these themes have been very real to
me i just as i reflect on that conversation and when i played it back um after you told me so we come off air
we stood next to the table and the microphones and you you explained to me what's happened yeah i'm first time in my life completely
speechless and the thing that blew me away even more so than what you'd said to me
was your ability to be so calm and rational and objective in the answers you gave
and even when i listen back now although there was that laugh which was a bit of an indication um
you were able to speak about someone betraying you or being deceitful with a
level of calmness and apparent um emotional uh sort of restraint that i i just
admired so much from someone that was right in the middle of the emotional hurricane and had just been victim of
that act and um you said that you know about the topic of monogamy
how did that change your opinion and and also the subsequent 18 months of processing on the topic of monogamy
[Music] so as a quick aside i like that analogy and we touch upon it briefly about the
hurricane and and it's funny actually because a friend of mine showed me a book about a week ago and it was
different personality profiles depending on the day that you'd been born on and whenever we looked mine up there's a
little meditation at the end a summary and it said the stillest part of the
hurricane is its center and that essentially has been uh a philosophy
that's guided my life where sometimes there's a storm and it's horrendous and it's raging but
if you can cultivate that sense of stillness and calmness and clarity deep
within you no matter what life throws at you you will be okay because the second part
of whenever i was told that news and and the tears were streaming and i felt that sense of loss
and overwhelming sadness it was a remarkable moment where in that
instant and i can only describe it as a whisper i heard a whisper within me
as if it was resonating from my heart that all will be well forwards all will be
well all will be well and i knew even then i knew whenever
you know this tumultuous emotion i knew everything's going to be okay i will get through this i'm going to
have to walk through the desert and i'm going to have to endure a horrific amount of an emotional level
but it's all going to be fine how did you know that i think it's something that i've
cultivated over over 10 15 years and that's why i do what i do now because i want to help other people to reach that
stage and and it began on a journey of um buddhist exploration and understanding
the nature of life and i came to this realization that life
involves suffering there's no promise that it's going to be happy-go-lucky
and really pleasant all the time really horrific things happen in life and on one level there's
no way that we can ever rationally explain it away sometimes bad things happen but it
doesn't end there it's a bit like that line that someone once said to century whenever you're suffering don't
ask god why am i suffering ask god where are you taking me
and so i've developed this ability to
begin to view my life as though it's happening to someone else as though the experience the thoughts
the emotions are are something that i can almost take it back on and have perspective
and i can see it and i can feel it but i know that my thoughts that isn't just who i
am my emotions isn't just through my and that's a temporary experience and and throughout my life no matter
what has happened even whenever it's been brutal it's often shifted being a new
trajectory and there's been a new meaningful life ahead of me and i
knew even then she's going to be okay she'll be okay it's going to be a tough road for her to but she'll be okay
and it's gonna be a tough road for me to you but i will be okay anger so many people in that situation
whether rightly or wrongly just because of the way that they are yeah would have reacted with anger and for some reason you were both
calm in telling me you're calm now and the this remarkable thing which i
i think i i struggle to understand a little bit is one of your first concerns was her
well-being versus your own why
because i loved her and i was in the practice of of placing her
emotional well-being and her happiness on the same level of mine if not sometimes
first and foremostly but at least so on an equal playing field and and i was just so in that habit and
that was the toughest thing to let go of the thing that i still struggle with today and i'm still
it's the one part that i realized the other day that i still had a fear of upsetting her
or her not being okay and so that's something which just
just really developed and and was so ingrained and it's interesting on the point of
anger if you said like your wife partner for 10 years married for five
has an affair and is pregnant with another man's child how will you react i would have said anger i would i'd be furious but it wasn't
there at least not initially it was this overwhelming sense of sadness it was just that sense of loss of knowing that
again that she's potentially done something that she might regret for a long time and i don't want anyone to go
through that experience where they feel like they've [ __ ] up hugely even if the the future
is positive in that moment my senses there will be regret or at least shame
and so it was a sadness because i was connected to the loss the sense of loss
of losing things i held dear feels like you're living outside your body a little bit i guess that's what
self-awareness is or at least emotional awareness awarenesses because you're being able to see that situation which
is utterly horrific for anyone yeah um from as you say from like a bird's eye view
as if you've like yeah looking down on it and that's allowing you not to just feel your own emotions but to feel
empathy towards theirs yeah and i think i think that's the path in my eyes that's the path to
enlightenment and i'm not saying that i am enlightened but i think we're all on that path i'm all progressing through it
and for me that's what awareness is it's being able to experience internally your thoughts and your
emotions and externally what's happened as if it's happening to someone else
you're like holding them out in front of you and analyzing them right but if you're not holding them out in front of you and it's happening within
you then you are just almost like a passenger on a roller coaster whereas holding them out in front of you kind of
makes you the the conductor or the roller coaster or at least uh able to yeah understand and if you can
understand then you can address and you can overcome totally i love it whenever you're holding it really close to you
you're fused with it anything that happens instantly will provoke a reaction whether or not it's
emotional or behavioral but when you hold it in front of you there's a bit more space now you still
experience it it was a brutal couple of months i cried every day
uh for maybe three months for hours hours i would i would walk and i'd
process what happened and if you want we can talk about that at some point um about my process of
moving through it but yes it was i'm not going to say it wasn't um emotionally painful but
i wasn't defined by that pain and that was just a part that i was experiencing let's talk about that so a lot of people
Processing the emotions
experience grief in many forms and this somewhat feels like this the central emotion you described as a loss it feels like a
form of grief yeah what was your process for moving from you know finding out
that it happened to where you are today where you're you know you've quote unquote processed
it i imagine as much as you might have been able to at this stage yeah
some yeah what was your process where i think people often um
catch themselves in a in a counter but productive cycle is whenever they try and avoid
experiencing what they're experiencing they try and shun it lock it away put it in a box disconnect from it
deny it and they just focus on the future and where i'm going and they might try and rationalize it uh this happened because
of x or because of y and then they try and forge ahead and i think it comes back to bite them at some
point the simplest truth is that we can only ever experience
one moment at a time and i remind myself of that i don't need to think about right now
the financial separation the divorce what it means about friends or family or or will i
meet someone again or how long will it be or what will my life look like or where am i going to live so many
different factors that could be overwhelming i just decided to deal with one moment at a time all i need to do
is deal with this one moment and what is this one bringing me and accepting and welcoming it sounds
strange but welcoming whatever comes up and so whatever emotion came up i didn't
try and push it away or shunt it or deny it or negate it i let it i let it sit and that's why i
cried so much because there was so much sadness did you write down the emotions you're experiencing
so i didn't write down the emotions but what i did in the next step is so the first step
was awareness and accepting whatever emotions i felt and i'm seeing that they come and then
they go you know that there'd be moments where i'd be laughing with my brother and then crying a minute later and then
talking about something else the second step was reminding myself of
reality because i was so ingrained in
in an internal model of what life looked like i have a strong
stable marriage in which my partner subconsciously uh you know implicitly i
believe is faithful we're meant to be together we're going to be together for the next 50 60 years until one of us dies
we're going to have children together that was my internal model
and i had to rip it apart i had to take it down i had to dismantle it and i had to remind myself of the
reality of the situation i had to accept it i had to accept it's over it's not going
to change there's no going back the final nail is in the coffin
and you need to take that on board and i'd also write any i'd write down
reminders of of what had happened and i also wrote down
any insights i had about the situation that i could remind myself of and i wrote down how i wanted to handle
this process um i can actually read a few out if you want please
please i've got um so i i literally would just write them down on my phone um and so afterwards i began to split
them up into different sections but this one was for the process hold yourself to the highest
standard choose actions that you can be proud of
how you get through this process is more important than how quickly you get through this process because for
me it was important that i still lived with personal integrity that i didn't
that i wasn't warped or changed or um consumed with
vengeance or acted in ways that was out of spite or out of emotion i wanted to
be able to look back on this in 12 months 18 months time and still feel good about it have a clear conscience still able to put my
head down and feel as though i handled that to the best of my ability with god you can get through this you
can become stronger wiser more caring more compassionate and more loving
and that's another thing that actually the deepest moments of suffering can actually be opportunities
for growth even if you don't want it there's something there that that you can learn and can grow from you don't need anything
from her anymore um and there and then different reminders
you have nothing to feel bad about you aren't responsible you have nothing to feel guilty about
nothing because there were moments where my mind would almost begin to in a way play a trick on me and begin to
try and create reasons um to feel bad or to try and create
shame and at those times while i would accept what came up i decided not to pursue that line of
thinking because that didn't fit whenever i was calm and clear this came to me and so i'd write
down whatever came to me whenever i was in a place of wisdom then when the emotion hit
and i'm not seeing clearly and i've got on a clouded lens this little baby became my best friend
because i'd go back to and i'd remind myself and then it would reshift my mental paradigm i have this um before
please do keep your phone open because i want to hear the rest of this all right but i have this um analogy i make in moments where i
experience a very similar thing but i'm going to say one example yeah it's it's the closest i can come to
resonating with what your experience is i was dating this girl and i broke up with her and three days
later i find out that she's had sex with someone else right and i can only the way that i described
it was i'm flying on this plane and i'm the pilot
and then suddenly when i fight when i when i look down and hear the news that she's just slept with someone
somebody else yeah it was like terror stormed the cockpit and they chucked the [ __ ] rational
pilot out and they were threatening to crash the whole [ __ ] thing and my whole objective as the pilot is
to get back into the cockpit before they crash this plane into the side of a mountain because if they crash the plane i'm [ __ ] and so yeah what i wanted to do
was lose my integrity yeah i wanted to crash the plane i wanted to get her back take revenge tell her she's
a this this and this and this and this and it was this because i've got to a place of where i'm able to hold
situations out in front of me a little bit more than i ever was you know in the past i was at war with myself
yeah it was the terrorists on one end telling me to crash the plane and the pilot saying you've been here before you know you
just need to keep the plane in the air until you yeah yeah and and i and i'm going for a run i'm like steve go to the gym
go for a run yeah clear your head i'm at the gym the terrorists that you know and i'm like i'm going to finish i'm going to finish
back in and then i'll come back yeah and the crazy conclusion to all of this was my friend called me
and said a few things to me about um why she did what she did yeah my
friend said to me remember steve you rejected her she really really really likes you and she's
done this as a way to make herself feel better for the rejection that you gave her and it sounds like such a pathetic thing
to say but what it made me realize in that moment was much of the reason why the terrorists had stormed the cockpit was
my ego was bruised and the thing that coached those terrorists out the cockpit was my friend massaging my ego again
and and letting me know that some of those stories we sometimes tell ourselves when we get rejected about
why we got rejected yeah weren't true it's not because you're not enough
it's in fact because of something you've done and that was the reason why i managed to take control of the cockpit i did nothing
i didn't punish her in any way didn't even mention it and it was and so yeah um but please two things come to
me there uh one is this uh emotion of anger so fascinatingly nine to five percent of
the emotion for me was sadness five percent was anger and the anger struck early on it was the first
night and i remember my brother had come over and was staying with me and i
woke up in the middle of the night the night of that day that she told me and
it was like my body was burning i haven't experienced anger like that
before it was it was almost like i was a flame i was uh just infused with rage
and i began and i really feel for my brother having to witness this but i was just
moving up and down shouting as loudly as i could my wife my house
my wife my house and for five minutes it was like a supernova it just was
just seething and then it burnt out
and i cried and i fell asleep and and the next day and then the anger didn't really come much it would come now and
again but what i realized was the anger was intimately attached to my
ego the anger came whenever i was attached to my ego and i'm very fortunate that i'm able to detect from my ego
the majority of the time but when i didn't that's when it hurt because it came
about my wife as if i own her as if there's ownership as if
it's a part of me i don't own her she's free my house
i didn't even own the house the mortgage company did you know but as soon as we link it to ourselves and make it about us
yeah then it it's it's a place of vulnerability because you're getting inflicted it's like
getting stabbed in the heart you feel that but it's an illusion because we are not
our ego you know we can see our ego and have a relationship to our ego but once we're fused with it we're in trouble
and the other part of it is that because i don't want to come across like a saint like
i didn't have dark thoughts or you know i wasn't angry and i just handled it with grace the entire time
but i operate from a principle that the mind has a mind of its own and i think we talked about it last time
but essentially your mind will populate your head with thoughts automatically
you're not asking for them it'll just come up with judges evaluations assessments predictions about the future
past memories imagine scenarios you know if i said okay steve don't
think about anything right now just for 10 seconds have a complete blank mind and i'm going to say a word but don't
think about anything okay so we'll just do it now don't think about a thing birthday okay right
so even though you were attempting not to think about your mind came up with it automatically and from my
perspective we are not our thoughts we have thoughts our mind comes up with thoughts but
that's not me i am the observer of the thought now why is that important because my
mind should come up with really brutal thoughts what thoughts like torturing the guy
really yeah getting in a car finding him shooting in the back of the van and doing this elaborate
elaborate of of what i would do to him absolutely because my mind was thinking about about
seeking vengeance justice justin justice and it was like a hollywood movie and
somehow no one found out i went back along the date you know
and so yes you can have those or whenever i was in deep pain
the thought of ending my life popped into my head i didn't have any intent i wasn't making any plans i didn't
want to kill myself but my mind wanted a way out of the pain
it was suffering and it wanted an end to it and what is one option killing yourself and so when i've got a
different relationship though with these thoughts when i think about torturing someone or i think or when my mind comes up with
a thought of torturing someone or my mind comes up with the thought of [Music]
taking my life there's no judgment i don't think oh
that means i must want to do it or that means that i will do it or that means i'm a bad person
or that means that i'm evil it just means my mind
i think what is my mind trying to do is it's trying to solve a solution and it's probably struggling to cope and
it's trying to find a way to make me feel better nia on this podcast who came on this podcast talked about how the mind is
actually you know people think we're in the search of pleasure but the mind is programmed to avoid discomfort yeah so we're
constantly in trying to seek you know avoid it and that's why we procrastinate because we've got a big project which is yeah we might not feel competent to
complete or you know we're a bit there's a feeling of discomfort around it so we go and wash the dishes we'll do the hoovering yeah um on the on the you mentioned
wanting to torture this man well i know right so like a moment of the mind having
what my mind did steve you want to clarify you didn't want to your mind wanted to i'm a peace loving kind of guy
but i wanted to know how do you feel about him
so it's really interesting i um
this stage the the process went awareness and acceptance uh how i wanted
to handle the process and then at some point i realized
i needed to find forgiveness
i'm quite a simple person and i don't i don't like having a lot of
items or objects or physical possessions and i don't like having a lot of emotional baggage either
i want to travel light you know i want to travel so lightly i could pass through the eye of a needle so to speak and the weight
of anger or resentment or
[Music] the feelings of betrayal
were weighing me down and i wanted to forgive her and i wanted to forgive him and honestly you could view
as ultimately selfish because it's not going to impact their life but it's going to make mine a lot easier
and during lockdown i was in california and i was lucky because in santa barbara
where i was staying the mayor didn't close the beaches because there's a lot of families there
and he said as long as you uh socially distance it's fine and i'd run along the beach and i had
this process where i would say out loud
i would imagine her and i would say i forgive you i'm sending you my love and i wish you
all the best for the future and i processed so much by that at that point because i've been able to
understand and see her situation and in my mind i have an idea of how it
was created and why it unfolded and so there was compassion there and i
was able to reach that really relatively quickly that that was easy the hard part was with him
because i didn't know him i didn't know his personality his
background who he was he could be a great friend and an excellent son or
[Music] potentially a very loving partner
but all i knew about him was that he was prepared to take certain actions
and so whenever i tried it with him and i'd say i forgive you
it was like there was a knot and a wince and i'm like and i would say and i'm sending you my
love
i don't wish you all for the future but you're still imagining pulling up in that van and jumping out and
blindfolding [Music]
and so but i would just notice that i don't know the tension there and and actually i will say this was a
year after i'd heard the news i didn't try and do this initially i think it would have been
uh premature to have attempted this whenever i wasn't in a space where i had
a lot more clarity and groundedness and and and process the emotion the emotion wasn't being clouded
at this point now what am i holding on to and for a matter of weeks five six weeks
i was running two three times a week and i would just try that try that process and then one day it was
it was remarkable i was running along and i said i forgive you
and it was nothing and then i said and i'm sending you my love and i felt
easy and i said and i wish you all the best for the future and i could tell that i meant it for them or
their baby you know for them to gather the family and i felt at peace
and it's a bit like that saying my yoke is easy my burden is light now genuinely it sounds strange but
i don't really feel anything for them it's almost as if you know if you came to me and said um
i've got a friend called mike and he's going through a
really difficult time he was involved in a really complicated emotional relationship um would you mind sending out positive
thoughts to him and sing a prayer for him i'd say sure like he hasn't ever done anything to me i don't have any
connection with him no problem it's almost that sort of relationship now where they're just other people on their
journey and i had that shared history with with my wife which i look upon
fondly particularly the first eight years we had a wonderful marriage for a long time but there's no
emotional tinge there's it's like an emotional umbilical cord i'm almost imagining it it's a letting go yeah it's
a letting go and so that was that was a part that for
me because i think there comes a time where you have to say okay i process it i've processed it
how long do i want to hold on to it for now and that's becomes my own choice do i want to carry this
and let it define me or do i want to finally let it go and see it float down the river
and i think you know even you're someone that has a remarkable ability to practice like self-awareness
and you know you have that sort of like emotional awareness as well and it's good to hear i think for everybody
listening to this that even your process to from finding it out
to you know being emotionally unattached to the matter to the point that you can forgive both of
them wasn't linear at all it was up it was down it was up it was down and it was
long and i think people sometimes um think that their experience of rejection or deceit
or you know um any of these things is uniquely bad because their process
to recovery per se isn't linear and it's long and it feels like the more
i've talked about this topic and the more people i've met and you know from hearing your experiences that in fact is the only way out and i
actually think realizing that that's the only way out will make your process out of that deceit or betrayal
feel normal and natural and okay and therefore acceptable and
and i think that's a really important point that you've made through the story you've told absolutely
and each person's journey will be unique and there will be peaks and troughs and
it'll wax and wane and i'm very aware that it's possible
that my journey happened over a relatively short period of time because of
my history my background as a psychologist as a high performance expert this is the area that i deal with
it's about developing emotional resilience it's how do you help people to cope with high stakes environments when they've
lost a sense of balance in their life when they're struggling in the relationships whenever they
experience something in life which throws them how do you get back up this is what i've been trained to do for
15 years isn't it weird that life sent you this challenge yeah when you think about
your experience isn't it it must be a part of you that because i think i would i would think to myself
life is testing me to see if i can deal with the worst and still maintain the values and
principles that i spouse like yeah it it sounds this will sound really odd
uh but i almost felt at times i thought in a way i'm so lucky because i'm so lucky that
i am where i am when this happened if this had happened 10 years ago i would have been in a vastly different
space why because i struggled 10 years to cope
with what life gave me on an emotional level and i would react out of the emotion so
i'd experience it and then i would just react and essentially that's when we
make terrible decisions oh you crashed the plane oh we crashed plane if you look at nasa
um astronauts they prepare for uh the sequence of events leading up
to launch and they run through that over a hundred times from putting on the kit traveling down
to the launch space to what could go wrong and they rehearse and they run it through
and it's a way of being able to stay calm whenever there is uncertainty or
turbulence or danger or threat because that's whenever that's the
person you really want to be whenever there's an emergency like we talked about in the podcast you want to be the person that still
has an air a pocket a space of clarity that isn't affected so that even though
you're experiencing all these emotions on a very physical level
deep down you're still grounded you can take it and so from where i was
i did feel as though i'm fortunate that life is thrown at me
something that in my mind was one of the worst things that i could experience there's lots of worse things without
shadow of a doubt but it was a big one um and find a way to move through and
incredibly it's informed even even my work because in the last
year again whether it's coincidence or not i don't know the number of clients i've
been working with on relationship issues has gone up exponentially and it's
issues centered on a loss of connection a loss of intimacy betrayal confusion how do you
how do you stay true to who you are in a relationship with someone else where you feel like there's a shift or
you wake up one day and you're in a space where you don't know how you got there where
you become like best friends living together rather than the passionate lovers you were 10 years ago you talked there a second
about the calm that astronauts are trained to develop and how crucial that is to making good
decisions i i saw this quote the other day and it said when emotions go go up intellect comes down yeah and um i was
thinking about just them as you said that i was thinking what are the factors that make somebody
not calm and then i thought and they kind of answered myself okay so it's we talked about the ego playing a big role and so i guess my
conclusion there is the people who will struggle to maintain their calm in situations like that
that are so personally associated are those with the lowest self-esteem and the most fragile ego and it feels like the work
that you've described that you've done over the last 10 years is really like building your self-esteem and really
in some respects a separation from ego yeah you've nailed it one we know
on a neural level so we know from neuroimaging studies that when we experience emotion
the prefrontal cortex they part the brain responsible for judgment decision making impulse control
planning goes offline it shuts down so we don't have access to that
creativity the wisdom that we have usually
and again absolutely i think the journey for me the journey of of life involves developing a robust
sense of self a sense of self that is unshakable
that is immovable that still experiences life and the whole gamut of emotions and and
the beauty and loveliness of life and also the darkness and the destruction of life
but isn't impacted on an essential level by it and i think that's the journey and
that's the journey that i work on with clients no matter what the outwardly symptoms
are it could be weight gain it could be relationship dysfunction it could be struggling to experience
that sense of contentment or fulfillment in life even though i have everything that life says i should have
it could be feeling like i'm i'm lacking or i'm just not doing enough or i'm not being enough but it all comes back to that stronger
sense of self and this um you know horrific experience
Adapting my opinion of marriage and monogamy
what has it done to your opinion of monogamy because i'm sure i'm guessing
from what you've said the way that you planned your life ahead you thought when you you know when you went walked
down the aisle and you said those words till death do us part you then planned the next 60 years of your life and how your life was going to
pan out and when you said those words at the end of the at the altar you were totally convinced
yeah totally convinced that this person was the other person your soul mate
um how do you feel about all of those concepts now like soulmate and monogamy and until death do his part
experience led me to a position where i began to question my deepest assumptions about monogamy about marriage about
lifelong relationships and in the same way i began to take a step back
and reflect and contemplate i became very aware that there is a
social script for relationships and it generally goes the conventional model is boy meets girl
it's not even boy meets boy your girl meets girl there's a first date a first kiss uh a period of courting at some point
um there will be sex meeting the parents hopefully not at the
same time eventually the relationship becomes
exclusive and engagement marriage children until death do us part and i realize
that that is a social construction it's a conventional model based on assumptions
that monogamy is natural that marriage is a human universal
and that any structure other than the nuclear one is
aberrant and so then i began to think okay well what are the different
what are the different elements so on the one hand we can take and we touch upon it briefly uh
a evolutionary perspective and we are apes it's not just that we've
descended from apes we are apes we're one of the five
homo sapiens or one of the five surviving species of great apes along with orangutans bonobos gorillas
and and chimpanzees and yet at some point we
separated from that psychologically and actually the fine print that distinguishes humans
from other great apes has been described by primatologists as wholly
inadequate it's it's a fabrication and at some stage we began to see
ourselves as special and unique and above nature and exempt from our
[Music] primal history because we descended from hypersexual ancestors so if
the homoline age has been around for two million years modern humans have been around for 200
000 years and about 10 000 years ago there was a shift in
going from hunter-gatherers to settled communities because of the advent of agriculture now
up until 10 000 years ago the data now suggests that we actually
lived by fiercely egalitarian principles everything was shared food shelter
water child care and even sexual partners
casual sexuality was the norm for our prehistoric ancestors for 95
of the collective experience of our lineage that is what we experienced
and it wasn't it wasn't based on meaningless random relationships they were relationships that reinforced
uh a social pattern that that we needed to survive it minimized
our risk and it reinforced social ties but then with the advent of agriculture
we began to settle we had then we had land we had
uh domesticated animals and for the first time private property
came into play and suddenly there was a change and there's even a change in the status of
women because when we look at the human female up until that point was on with an equal playing field they
were as responsible for the hunting and the cooking and making decisions about where they were
going to settle and then it changed and the female became the property of the man something that
he had to maintain and keep and actually the reason that property came into play is because we
weren't moving so it did matter what happened to our resources we were accumulating and biological paternity
for the first time became crucial
and so on on a natural evolutionary level
[Music] monogamy didn't exist we didn't live in long-term monogamous
relationships then we bring in marriage and if we fast forward about five and a
half thousand years in about 2350 bc
and in mesopotamia we're the first marriage between the union between a man
and a woman and over the next few hundred years it spread the ancient romans greeks
hebrews they began to adopt this widespread practice but marriage had a dif had a very different meaning across the
ages in the um fifth century with anglo-saxons it was about
securing trade ties it was a diplomatic tool in the 11th century marriage was about
financial economic and political advantage
and as early as the 12th religion be became involved and and roman catholicism tied it to
sacrament and it to being a sacred experience related to experiencing god
then about 500 years ago thomas cranmer came up with the modern day marital vows
that we read out today and he was architecture of english protestantism
and then up until 1858 divorce was rare
marriage was something which was lifelong and it wasn't really questioned but then it became a legal process that
you could apply to do and it was still still relatively uncommon because it was expensive and
women had to prove aggravated adultery bestiality sodomy cruelty and then
the divorce gates really opened up in 1969 with the divorce reform act and marital breakdown could be could
then be cited so whenever we begin to take a different lens and we see the journey
that it's taken and then we ask well where are we today since 1975
there's been a drop in marriages by about 30 more people are now opting to cohabit
than they are to get married divorce statistics in england and wales are at 42
you could arguably say that this system is collapsing that it is beginning to crumble
and they don't even take a cultural lens yeah and if i'm talking too much just no it's fascinating super fascinating so
culturally um the spanish word esposas means wife and handcuffs
we joke about the wife being the ball and chain
a friend got married got married got engaged last week and the talk amongst the boys was this
is the beginning of the end of your sex life yeah but women don't fare any better
you know 43 of american women report sexual dysfunction viagra sales are increasing every year
they're just record highs year upon year bonus through the [ __ ] reef
not that i would know yeah a friend told me yeah um
the porn industry takes in about 57 to 100 billion dollars worldwide
a u.s report showed that americans spend more at strip clubs than they do at broadway
off-broadway non-profit and regional theaters the ballet jazz and the opera
collectively we look at the church and there have been hundreds of roman
catholic priests admitting to thousands of sex crimes in 2008 they paid out 436 million
dollars to victims of sexual abuse a fifth were under the age of five
and these aren't that's not to mention the forgotten victims and we have to ask yourself one
how did we get here two how was that story constructed and three is marriage
giving us what we want and is it realistic and is it feasible
so number three where am i with that yeah yeah i'm still touring i'll be totally
honest with you i can say it i can imagine okay so i can
imagine that on the one hand i can imagine being in a relationship with with a woman and and being with
that one woman for the rest of my life i can also imagine being
with someone in a relationship and having more than one sexual partner
but but if if it was flipped around and someone asked me
would you want your partners to be with other men yeah i'd say hell no of course like it
just seems yeah it that is not something because i'm so strongly programmed
against that even though that's potentially the biological heritage i can't imagine being with someone who's
with us with other people i wouldn't want to be in that situation and i'm aware of the acute hypocrisy
contained within it yeah i think everyone feels the same way to some degree i think people that tell you otherwise are probably talking [ __ ]
because they're playing defense against not wanting to happen to them to some degree right but yeah um it's a and i think it's an ideal
situation for yourself but not for the person you're wit with from your perspective i read this book a long time ago called the mystery
method um by one of the world's number one pickup artist and i don't know if this is true but
what he was saying was men are programmed in a way that seeks um the woman to be faithful for
them because the risk the evolutionary risk was if i impregnate you as my wife um or no so if i if i'm committed to you
as my wife and then you are you cheat on me and get pregnant with someone else's child
i will then spend my resources my energy my time raising someone else's um child and then
my genetics won't pass on that person's will and essentially if you think about it from
an evolutionary perspective i then wouldn't have existed if i didn't have that concern
about making sure my sperm was the one that reached the egg i so you think about it from an
evolutionary perspective you wouldn't exist if your ancestors
hadn't done a brilliant job of making sure their sperm hit the egg and one of the ways of doing that was
making sure it wasn't another guy's sperm hitting the egg yeah by being territorial by being whatever and on the other side from the woman's
perspective the book talks about how you know if a woman got eight months pregnant um tens of thousands of years
ago she can no longer hunt and gather for herself so really she has to find a partner that isn't going to abscond that
isn't going to bounce especially once they've had sex and so the book kind of talks about some of the
the reasons why you know in society we typically think women are more in search of a relationship and are
trying to you know get a guy more than men are typically um is because
from an evolutionary perspective they would have died on the savannah in africa or whatever if
if the guy had sex with them impregnated them at a time when we didn't have birth control got them eight months pregnant and then
bounced yeah and and i don't know how true that is yeah it's something that i've believed because i've read this book for some
time so that's the dominant traditional understanding of
human sexuality because whenever you look at other species yes it's about essentially
an aggressive alpha male than uh being with a
female and knowing that their offspring is being continued through that lineage
there's an alternative which has come out more recently where i know there was a paper published
in science in 2015 that actually showed that what separated
humans from other great apes was our social organization yeah about 10 000 years ago we started
living up next to water and in camps exactly yeah so and then we were a tribe essentially i've read about that
and up until that point though it's very possible that we had uh
multiple sexual partners but biological paternity was less of a concern because our
structure was such that so what we found out now is we didn't used to live with our close relatives we actually
created social ties with other individuals and so we're set up in such a way that
the focus wasn't ever on individual survival it was on group survival group identity
group welfare and the reason is it's the group that keeps you alive anyway
and so it's very possible that then there was a shift which happened
actually with this advent of private property because that's whenever eternity would matter
because there's some hunter-gatherer communities that believe when multiple men have sex with a
female that it's to collectively because you have to think where does our
understanding of the sperm and embryo come from that's very recent it's a very recent biological
understanding our ancestors wouldn't have known that and there are some beliefs where collectively the men contribute to
the production of the child that actually it's almost like an amalgamation of the different man then creates that
child and that child becomes part of the group as opposed to that one person's child and this is the thing just to like
challenge that thinking say that there was one man in the group that was slightly better and making sure he was the one that
inseminated the female yeah he his genes would pass on yeah his his genetics would pass on as
being slightly better for whatever reason and inseminating a woman and uh
therefore in the next round of you know the next generation he would have a slight advantage pretend that that the kid of that man would have
a slight genetic predisposition for being good at that which would increase the probability that they would pass on
again and again and again and it seems like that that those genetics and that ability to be good at
intimidating whether it's through being territorial or being stronger or being more persuasive or being more you know more of a peacock yeah um
through generations over the space of a million years from the chimps that would create a scenario where we are programmed
to be through our psychology and our behavior and our peacocking good at you know yeah winning yeah
even through slightly more malicious methods or yeah and then there's also the social
conditioning and the ideas of of marriage of monogamy of romanticism
of what that means and and i think what i'd really come particularly
through my work with clients is seeing that where people find themselves in trouble is when there's enmeshment
whenever there's too much when there's too much closeness when actually the identity of one person
is submerged with the identity of the other and there's no space that happen to you
in your marriage where you became more like her
it's incredible that you ask that i have a little announcement to make and
if you're watching this on youtube you might have seen a little clue as to what i'm about to say when we brought this podcast back and we
decided that we were going to do it every single week on monday we also decided that we wanted to find a sponsor
and a partner to help support the growth of this podcast so that we can take it all over the world we can produce the
video format we can hire a big team and we can make sure it gets out to as many people as possible
and so here's what i did i thought of a couple of companies that i really really love and companies that
i've used for many many years and i've been an avid customer of and one of those companies
in fact the first company i contacted was this one hule and if you if you don't know what huel is then you must
have been living under a rock per se but huel has been a huge part of my life for
about four years i first started drinking huel four years ago when i first moved to new
york and i was running social chain and the reason i did was because i was frequently
missing meals i and if you if you know me personally you'll know how true this is i will wake up in the morning
and i'll rush through my day meeting meeting meeting meeting speaking on stage flying somewhere and i'll get to about 9 00 pm and i
wouldn't have eaten a single thing and there's no you know nutritional expert in the world that will tell you
that's a good thing and what then happened was i was binge eating at nine or ten o'clock and when i say binge eating i mean like two
large domino's pizzas to myself and so then i discovered this thing called heal about four years ago and for
me huel is a nutritionally complete drink which means that i don't have to spend hours preparing food which i
wouldn't do anyway hence why i was skipping meals it means that i get all the good stuff i need to perform and have a good diet
but i can have it in like 20 seconds and as someone that values time so so much
heal was a godsend i've been a customer for i think four years i've had my subscription with you for four
How I Lost an intrinsic part of who I was
years so when i was looking for someone to sponsor the podcast i contacted the ceo who's been on the
podcast before julian and has built this staggering company i sent him an email i said listen julian
i would love you to sponsor my podcast because i can actually talk about your product authentically
and he said to me because you've had a subscription with you for the last three four years and i know you're a customer
he was up for doing it so i thank you and um every week on the podcast i'm going to talk about different
things to do with huel to do with time saving to do with diet and nutrition and of course we're
going to get julian back on the podcast at some point their company is doing unbelievable things in the uk
if you've not seen and sort of kept up with the progress if you'll i highly recommend you do because it's one of the most exciting companies we've seen in
the uk in a long long time and it's an absolute honor and a privilege to to have them sponsoring
the director ceo the perfect company to be on this podcast because you know it's a company that is so in line with
some of my central values did that happen to you in your marriage where you became more like
her it's incredible that you ask that whenever we first met
she was the sensible one she was very prudent very pragmatic very level
headed she made very safe sensible choices in life in general and she was known in
that way i was a bit more of a rogue i was uh
a little bit more mysterious it was probably a sort of you know hint of mischievous
of um spontaneity yeah of playfulness and and there's an idea in
psychology that we all that we seek in the other person a part of ourselves
that we've lost and so there was almost that um that
attraction there it created that chemistry it drew us in together i think she was
looking for that excitement and and in a way that safe danger i was actually looking for stability and
groundedness and over time it connected us and brought us together but over time
a remarkable thing happened and that is just like you said i began to become
more like her i became became safer and i actually lost
an intrinsic part of who i was i lost the
the wild child that's in me i lost the part that's a bit more dangerous it's a bit more risky that it doesn't always say something
which is politically correct and i became almost like a sanitized clean version of who i was
and that's not the man that she met and that's not the man that she fell in love with
and on one level it it worked in terms of a stable love
there was reliability there was dependability there was relatability
but it crushed the desire there was a slow suffocation of that desire over the last
couple of years and so i believe that
one day she woke up and she sensed that loss of connection
which i also sense too and that loss of intimacy and she was scared and when the mind is
scared it comes up with thoughts is this it am i gonna have to live like this for
the next 10 20 years will i ever get that chemistry or that connection back
what if it never comes back and when we're afraid we're then seeking
that that part of ourselves that we've lost and so it's almost
less about the other person and more about us it's less about turning away from our
partner and more about turning away from a part of ourselves it's less about finding another person
and more about finding another part of ourselves in which we feel alive and i think the fear would have been
wildly tempting wildly exciting it would have been
all the things it would have given her a lot of the things that we had in the beginning that she missed and suddenly it was back
and even the structure of an affair is such that you can't
have the other person and the forbidden is erotic and it's set up in such a way that it
just perpetually creates desire because it has to be secretive it can't be long
lasting for long periods of time there's continual space now if
fire needs air desire needs space
and we found ourselves in a situation in which we're seeing each other every day i used to be traveling i used
to be working away a lot more we would have pockets where we'd be apart and in that pocket even if you're
away for a day or a couple of days there's a sense of loss on a very micro level
and then a sense of excitement of the person coming back and reimagining that life together
and so going back to your point i did i change and that song that's something
which i've learned from i've cha i changed and i became
like a squeaky clean version of me and
and she ironically ended up turning towards what she'd lost that's something you
regret i could feel regret in the way that i said it there
yes yeah being being honest if i could have if i could have changed on one level if
i could have changed that if i'd been aware of that and i'd and i'd seen it coming
then i would have wanted you to stay true to who i am and that's the
path i'm on now and i'd be curious to hear your thoughts but i
i want to live in line with my truth and it's like john 8 32 the truth will
set you free and i believe that when we're living in line with our truth it saves you and whenever we neglect
our truth it destroys you yeah and so if i if i'd if i'd been able to
stay truthful i think it would have been a very different trajectory i don't because the relationship worked
on multiple levels and we and and it did we had a wonderful um time together for
for eight years but it's a little bit like putting a frog in boiling water it
was in cold water and the desire is the frog it's alive you don't notice the heat there were
unknown factors that were at play and it was a dance it was both of us
there's no it we're we both contributed to that situation i think she wanted me to be that stable
dependable reliable person without realizing that on a subconscious level she actually
was attracted to the man that i was and i wanted to make her happy and didn't want her to
be the kind of person that creates tension or or or there being too much grit but
actually tension is what creates fire at the same time and so the rough edges were a part of
who i was and i didn't need to get rid of them it's so crazy it's almost quite contradictory the typical narrative you
My Ideal relationship structure
hear about relationships is especially from you know dare i say it um women movies and on instagram is
there's this conversation around can i change him um and it's and it seems typically that
people want to change that or they they hold out hope or they want to change their partner in some way
to make them more like the image they have of that person yes but in fact what you're describing
is the thing that ends up saving the relationship is a finding someone that
you love for the way that they are and you're attracted to the way that they are but then both
parties having a resilience to change um to some degree but because of that
understanding that you formed your relationship on the basis of this person being like this
and then but then you say okay so over time people change and in fact in
the last podcast we did there's a quote where you said change is the only constant so both of you are going to change
anyway and you talk about the spiritual psychological change that both parties go on
and again this kind of draws it back to the conversation around monogamy is you know you're going to change anyway like you 10 years ago
versus you now is probably a little bit more stable and a little bit more you know solid and a little bit more
rational in your thinking um and because as you said in the last podcast change is a constant
how do you form a how can you guarantee that death will do you part when change
might do your part first and this kind of brings us back to the conversation around monogamy which is
i guess it's my question to you is like if you what do you suspect now
if not marriage is going to be the way that you know when you meet
someone what do you suspect what's your hypothesis on how that relationship will be constructed for me personally yeah i've
got mine yeah yeah yeah but mine kind of i can tell you mine if
you want first yeah yeah okay so one kind of
so it was interesting what you said there about um space being
the air to a flame right yeah and for me that's so critical earlier on when you're talking about
marriage yeah one of the factors you you were talking about was how where marriage came from as a social construct
yeah and how it centers on like you know you know religion and god and all of these things and one of
the things that i think is also really important to understand is as a general first principles rule if
people are different and we all are different every single human being on this earth is different then the solution should be different
like the the glove we fit is different we have different size feet and different size hands so the solution to love
or whatever that is as binary as it sounds should therefore be bespoke to who you are and the life
you're living in for me i live a life where i'm i get my fulfillment out of the podcast and my work and that's it's
such a big part of my wiring i can't change that it's the way that i am i'm different from my brother and he's only a couple of months older than
me i'm completely different and so as it relates to love and me having a bespoke
solution to when i meet someone and i when i have kids or i want to you know want them to be my partner um the
solution should also be bespoke and so i look at the situation that would be right for me and it is one
that's really really reliant on space yeah i love being on my own i am happy
there i love having time to myself to reflect to think um to work on my projects space is such
a big thing for me so marriage and the idea of moving in with someone and then being you know on top of me
seven days a week for the next 60 years is a is something that i almost can't understand i'm not
sure if i'm like psychologically [ __ ] up and that's why i can't deal with that but i love this idea as the founder of
huell said on this podcast of treating my relationship with my romantic partner in the same way
that i treat my relationship with my best friend my best friend seems to get on perfectly well and we and i can't see a divorce
ever coming you know what i mean yeah because we have that space and we have the the middle ground that we meet upon
which is the relationship but we have a fundamental amount of space
um which we both need like in fact my best friend moved in with me in lockdown for a month and yeah uh
you start to piss me off so [ __ ] loud like clean up after
yourself how lowly do you choose we had an argument i remember we are going over something stupid like a video game or something um so i'm
going to conclude the point i know for me that space and the lack of being on top of each
other is something that would be a fundamental part of the relationship i have i'm willing to commit because i actually can't see a world
where i would allow them not to or that i'd be happy with them not even the word allow it's like permission right it's
like such a [ __ ] thing to say but i can't see a world where i would be okay with them
not committing to me so i i'm gonna have to concede there and i think i'll figure that out hopefully if we can keep the sex good
so space and commitment i hate the idea of marriage i don't think religion or the law have
any and should have any involvement on the topic of love i think they'd have a terrible track record religion with
homosexuality and and the you know the history it has on love and the law i didn't see why a court would have
anything to do with how i feel about someone so i hate the idea of marriage some kind of commitment
that offers me space with the right person where we both understand that at some point we might grow out of each
other and when we do um that's fine and i'm going to conclude with one point which you actually said in the last podcast
which was when i asked you about monogamy and about committing to someone for life you said to me
um don't view it like that just ask yourself the question every single day yeah today am i happy to spend today
this day with this person in this relationship if the answer is yes fine yeah if the answer is known then there's
something that needs to be addressed yeah thanks for sharing that
don't use it
i've actually got a photographic memory absolutely it doesn't work for it um what i know for for me
is there's definite similarities in that realistically i can't see myself being
in a non-monogamous relationship and if i was with someone that would be the person i would be with
in the past though in our last podcast when he asked me about the definition of love
that hasn't changed in that i believe that love is fostering that emotional and
spiritual growth of someone else but what has changed is what i've realized
in order to distinguish though between a partner that you're with and a partner that you have connection
and chemistry and intimacy with there has to be that physical intimacy
which which is maintained and which is and will wax and wane but which can still be
a light because whenever it dies it irrevocably shakes the foundation of the
relationship and i don't think i put enough importance on that
i almost had like a zen-like view of marriage as opposed to appreciating and
it was it was funny it was a um someone was speaking to him and they were saying from a male
perspective females want the new man during the day to be kind
sensitive loving and they want a and tie them up in the evening
and it but you know it got me thinking because what if the same ingredients that lead
to a long-lasting loving relationship or monogamous
marriage stability dependability relatability safety protection caregiving
what if these are the same ingredients that kill desire because what i think is true is that
and i should just speak for myself what i potentially find attractive in
the bedroom might be the things that i actually stand against during the day
there might be power and there might be dominance and that doesn't match up with how i see myself
during the day and so then you reach this conflict and i think what i began to do was i
began to become the new man and only the new man
and actually what i want to do more often is to tap more into
and there's this great philosopher called usher who says a lady in the streets
and a freak in the bed and it's like i and i heard that lyric maybe eight years ago and i literally say it
to my friends all the time when i'm talking about the type of partner that i want and it's matching up exactly what you
said the civility and the class with the lack of class and
the freakishness and the and it's it's hard to find and maintain the
balance yeah um i found yeah and because sex can be really
a journey of somewhere that you go and so then there has to be that trust and that safety there and at
times it might be about uh letting go of responsibility and surrendering
it might be about taking control and being dominant but it's an understanding what it means
to you and at what times they should unfold and and be allowed to live so your imagination can live because
when it doesn't and then it just becomes an act or something that you should do
or a way of having children then we begin to feel lost and that's you
know what's happened with a lot of clients i've seen and so going back to how i would want to
imagine the situation is yes it'd be a monogamous relationship with with another um with a woman and
i would want to try and stay true to who i am and still keep keep that whole version
of me and that's what i've learned keeping and i've gone back to that the wonderful thing is would i you know you ask me what do i
regret it the reason also why i don't regret it because i'm not holding on to it it's because the changes have happened
and i've trusted that it was meant to be and i was meant to unfold that way and i'm much more in tune with who i am now
so i finally got my motorbike license i bought my triumph bonnie uh
yesterday and i'm doing the things which and i realized because i'm drawn to more
of a sense of risk and danger and actually activities where i have to be consumed within that moment and be
present and i'm getting back in touch with who i am and how i want to live my life and what i want to stand for and it's on me
to maintain that with the next person i'm with another thing i learned was the space
because where we went wrong is whenever we didn't have the space and actually i realized i really enjoy
living alone i love that freedom my other relationships are very important to me with my brother and my best friends
and so i don't know yet what that will look like
but it will definitely involve more space and and also that sense of adventure and
spontaneity because that's what i enjoy i want to travel i want to see different countries and i've i can set my life up where i'm doing
that potentially with another person or still pursuing my passions
and that is a safe relationship relationship where that person knows that i love them and
i'm there for them but i won't always be but then kids comes in the same room
[ __ ] up this whole fantasy like do you know what i mean because then we'll deal with that in podcast three yeah
but that's that's the bit where i'm like okay it's all wonderful and perfect i was just thinking then my last three
relationships they've all lived in another country and it's and it's probably the reason why it works is because
i can walk around here my boxing shorts all day just like drinking my heel you know eating my partner or whatever
and um being myself and then we come together when they come there or i go there a week yeah wonderful love it
great and then i go back and have my you know my bachelor lifestyle you know um
but yeah like i i think um kids is a is a really
a topic which we would be like intellectually dishonest if we did it didn't
yeah address because there's there'll be people listening to this and i think okay well that's all well and good but when you become a father or a mother
you have to be there for your kids yes and there's not a lot of science that says it's not good to be there for your kids right so yes and in
the same way that we can start to though make sure that we clarify between what the science says
and then what the script is because absolutely we know that
uh children will have better emotional outcomes and even physical development and
situational success whenever they are brought up with a sensitive caregiver someone who is responsive to
their needs someone who hears them can hold them give them safety but also permission to
build to travel and come back and who's invested in that child
but i'm not aware of studies that say that the parents have to be living
in the same home in the one house 12 months of the year and be their lives to be set up in a certain
way and i don't know what the answer is yet and i'm not at that stage yet but i
would be curious whenever i am at that stage to begin exploring and it might not be
as radical as is envisioned at a certain point in time but there might be enough space or
enough still spontaneity or adventure or playfulness even on an internal level or in the way that
you set your life up where both partners have that space and still are able to maintain that
passion isn't it crazy how much of life's misery and failure and um unhappiness
Why unhappiness stems from conformity
stems from either trying to conform to the conventional way or the script as you say yeah or trying
to fit into or even sometimes answer an invalid question we talked a little bit about
this on the last podcast where i said you know i think so many people live their lives trying to answer invalid questions like
what number is orange is what i said last time and in the same way you know the question are you in love
presumes a yes just by asking it i'm forcing you to to say yes yeah or no i'm also presuming
that we've agreed upon the definition of in love which again is just a [ __ ] amazing because no one's ever told me what that
is no you're not born and they go okay god goes by the way if you ever feel this that's love okay and you go okay
got you right because i you know the word is so loosely i love peanut butter i love my dog i love my girlfriend i love my wife i
love my mom and it's like so what is it different it's such a [ __ ] confusing complex nuanced thing love
and we're forcing it into this yes or no yeah and people will like that they'll ruin good things because
they they they feel pressured or they're unsure if this is it yeah and
um i just i just wanted to kind of leave that point there in a sense of like that idea of like you know
i know so many people listening to this will will be unknowingly programmed by convention and
it's like the first principle thinking and the ability to question why you're
doing what you're doing and then i guess lastly to have the
fearlessness or the courage to potentially interrogate and then reject it um
that can literally save you in every facet it saved me like go to university get a job do this and i
i stopped going to school because i thought it was a lot of [ __ ] dropped out of university after one lecture started a business
and i am as i've said on this podcast before i'm the happiest person i know i've reached a level of success at
ridiculously young age i managed to like write us write a news story write a new script for how life can be lived
and um people admire me and listen to this podcast basically only because not because i'm
smarter than anyone else or anything else it's fundamentally if you go back to where it started was because i
for some reason was willing to question the script and then had the as they call it
fearlessness for me it wasn't for me the biggest fear was [ __ ] following the script clearly right but had the perceived fearlessness to
say well this doesn't make sense um yeah how does that resonate with you
two things come to mind one is that like you said before the solution in my
mind will be bespoke because we're trying to take a one-size-fits-all solution a panacea and
apply it to everyone and and we're all unique and it's important i think for the each to
begin to become aware of the emotional resistance we have to considering
possibilities outside of the conventional nuclear family unit and just begin to
think about what that might mean and and where where we might be able to
see change and the second part is to ask yourselves what do i think i have to have in order
to be happy so in relationships often people think marriage
children in business it could be x revenue y set up
zed lifestyle and then we can ask what will that give me
why will it make me happy because below will be the emotional need so it could be in relationships this
could be because i want affection physical intimacy a sense of belonging
stability for something else it could be status to be accepted by others not to be
judged but isn't just a yeah isn't the actual
truth based on that so on that point of marriage people thinking that they think marriage will make them happy
they've never experienced marriage before right so where have they got that idea from it's i think the actual the fundamental
truth is because they told me it would make me happy yeah we've been sold that story but what do people really
want what are they wanting out of the marriage if you go deeper there will be an emotional need that they're trying to
meet through the marriage that they think their marriage will provide the solution to but like you're saying it doesn't
well it can but it might not and so what people might actually want
is emotional connection or companionship you know if you said describe the
marriage the ideal marriage to me they might say well we're happy and we're there for each other and i have a confidant or a best
friend or i have a lover it's understanding those different parts when we've broken that down
and understand what we're what we're actually yearning for or searching for we can then ask can i meet those needs
in a slightly different way that doesn't necessarily prescribe to the conventional model and that's
first principle thinking in essence which is exactly back to like the fundamental yeah
yeah which is how yeah yeah and which is what i said before is what i love about your mind because you take it back to
your first principles and then that's whenever you potentially become you know i just threw things yeah
that's it's such a i i wish the school taught kids how to think in that way because when i if the first
principles just go back to the university point for me where i want to be i want to start a business and be a millionaire that's what
my stupid ass brain was thinking at that point right so this piece of paper who am i going to
show that to if i'm self-employed yes good point i don't want you to show it to myself everyone else everyone else around me is
sleeping on their desk and hung over and i'm going to have the same stamp that they all have
but that's actually probably going to work against me and i swear to god this isn't i'll tell you
if it was hindsight [ __ ] i was thinking that i've got this vivid memory of my first day at university and my last
um of looking over and this girl bits up being sat on my right and she was drunk and sleeping on the desk and i didn't get into a good
university because i got expelled from school so i didn't really take my exam seriously either again because of the same thinking um
but i remember thinking i'm gonna go i'm gonna get the same trophy as her is that how is that going to help me if
we both show everybody and i just think and then you've got it was boring as [ __ ] like i've been running businesses
since i was 14 day one they were like make a poster i swear to god the lesson my last lesson in my first year at
university was make a poster and i thought this isn't gonna in terms of the information part that's
not gonna give me the information and it was that and i walked out there i walked into the business office
and i spoke to the head of the business at the university and i said i'm going to defer for her for a little while she said cool fill out this piece of
paper and you can defer i never even filled it out and never went back turns out i actually hadn't properly registered for university either like as
i was meant to so i didn't really have to defer and that was it and you know i wanna i
wanna move on because you spent a lot long time talking about this topic i you said earlier on that you spent lockdown in california yes which is uh you know
i'm jealous you don't know and and it cuts both ways you don't know
what's going to happen in the next moment we have a projection of the way that we think our life will
unfold and often we become tied to it and bound to it and any deviation we can see as a
failure of some sorts but actually sometimes life has other plans for us
and when we don't know what's going to happen i think it keeps that freshness you keep fresh eyes and you stay
grateful for what you do have while you have it on the other hand
we don't know what's going to happen and it could all be taken away from us at any point and i've got a good friend of mine and
his father uh just had a stroke a couple of days ago and they now know the outcome is he
won't be around 10 days goes walking in in south ken and five minutes after i passed and was
coming back there was um barriers put up and
a uh refuse collector had been walking out in a bus and knocked him down and in an instant
his life was over and i just imagined that i could be completely wrong but i could i imagined gosh he might have a family
he might say goodbye to his wife and the kids in the morning and he went off to work and he had no idea and she had no idea
and and the things that were really that might have been niggling or causing arguments don't matter now like
none of that matters now and and i didn't see what was going to happen coming and and i you know i lost it on
one level i lost a lot and it makes me really appreciate what i had but then on another level that wasn't
the end to the story and then it was as if life said you're
on this path and i'm going to shunt you into a new trajectory
and that's the path you're meant to be on this is where you're meant to be going and i believe that it's a part of my path and it was meant to unfold this way the
universe is unfolding as it should and it's a lesson for me to continually trust and that's why that voice came up
in the very beginning in my heart saying all is well because i know on a deep level that all is well
it's just about trusting sometimes letting go of our ideas and living in this moment
i can think of a better ending listen i i don't even you know thank you
so much for so many reasons because what you've done today on one hand will probably be selfish
selfish as i as you move forward and realize that the release of your truth and talking
about it and processing it with people is always liberating but on the other hand it's incredibly
selfless because there are so many people that are going to going to have less pain deal with their pain
better and understand themselves and hopefully be a little bit more self-aware because you had the guts
and the um and the you know the humility and lack of ego to share what is an incredibly emotional
um touching personal um experience and so thank you so much it's helped me
you know and i have no doubt that the hundreds of thousands of people that listen to this it's going to help them in the same way
um if people want to find you and they want to talk to you about this and i'm sure
there will be a lot of them you know the podcast was big back then it's much bigger now right how do they find
you what's the best way to reach you so on instagram it says at dr.underscore aria
or my website which is drhyphenaria.com and what kind of services do you offer
people that are going through you know various predicaments so i do one-to-one coaching so
right now everything's done digitally but essentially it's identifying what aspect of your
life right now is critical for you to resolve and then helping you with the psychology
and the mindset to be able to work through that or work
with that so it could be emotional resilience it could be sustainable weight loss it could be
relationships it could be taking your business to the next level in terms of how you
view yourself as an entrepreneur um it might be fears loss of intimacy
impostor syndrome whatever issue is actually there for you i'll
check if it's something that we can approach from a mindset point of view and that's where my expertise is and then help you on your journey as you
then have a more empowered mindset so that you're developing that robust sense of self and you're able to
change and adapt and be fluid in your journey and keep on growing essentially
we have um we have such good conversations even off the podcast we met i think last week or the week before
and had just an open conversation about a bunch of things in life so i actually wanted to ask you i've never asked a guest this before but
is there anything that we've missed in terms of the topics that you think are
curious to the relationship we have or pertinent to the relationship we have or um any sort of learnings that
you've garnered from our conversations that you think we should be sharing with people because i feel
somewhat i thought those conversations were so rich that i i you know we talked about so much last time and
um even in our private conversations i just i just wonder if there's anything else any sort of key topics that you
i'm sure there will be like i don't think we've exhausted our conversation we'll be back for a third hour
listen thank you so much for your time i appreciate it i i yeah i appreciate it so so much more than i you know people they give up
so much time and they fly to come and do the podcast but um the what you've given today
i don't think you'll realize how selfless um that act was because of the value it will give to people and this is exactly why i do this
podcast um to hear these kinds of things and to to hopefully make myself better and the listeners
better for hearing it so thank you a million million times over thanks steve thank you

Transcription:

it's very rare that you get to meet entrepreneurs that are following and have followed in the steps

that you followed in in your life and like so whenever i meet people like you and ben francis who

is similar age to me who has like similar life ambitions um i see it as like this really amazing

rare opportunity to learn for myself and to ask honestly like selfish questions and i saw on your twitter i think it was

over the mental health week period you did a tweet where you talked about your experiences with

depression burnout and anxiety and from what i know about your story you experience those things in that

order so i think that's a good place to start which is let's talk about depression and the the role that

depression played in your life and where it came from and how you've overcome or are overcoming all handling depression

Depression - where did it all start?

yeah so interesting actually because um i i realized when i started to talk

about mental health stuff even more interestingly than what you've just said i kind of realized that

i'd been burying another mental health problems actually the the tweet was more depression burnout anxiety

um and insomnia but actually it's really interesting i did a podcast interview with a nutritionist

called rhiannon lambert and when i was preparing for that i was going over my the fact that i'd grown up fat and the

fact that um you know i probably did have an unusual relationship mentally with food and

um suddenly like i was unpacking what had happened in my 20s and i actually had bulimia i used to throw

up for like four to five years not intentionally though this is like quite unusual but that's

how deeply rooted this mental health problem was i would eat something and i would throw a lot of it

up um my friends would like know about this but it wasn't like labelled and i went to you know specialists in harley street to

see what was up and they were like medically you're fine so psychologically there's something there

anyway i haven't done it since i was about 26 or whatever but it suddenly occurred to me a few weeks ago really interestingly

that you know being able to label like the time i got depression the time i got anxiety the time i got

insomnia the time i was burnt out i remembered those moments this one i'd

actually buried as a story right in my head and never i'd never expressed it in my whole life to anyone

publicly at all full stop um and it was a couple of months ago i wrote a newsletter on mental health and

uh and nutrition um and i admitted for the first time then that i'd had bulimia and like what the symptoms

were and how long it had gone on and the fact that i was basically like losing lots of weight getting really skinny and all i saw was someone fat

um and it was so interesting to me like two revelations that came from that one is that um if it's

so uncomfortable right it's for me it's really embarrassing to admit to myself that i was weak enough to have a mental

health condition that bad that i would psychologically throw up when there was nothing biologically

wrong with me um that's really awkward to admit to yourself it's also far more terrifying to admit it publicly

once you've uncovered it and it kind of made me reflect on the fact that um sometimes like these things

are actually just so painfully embarrassing about your personal life that you can even bury it to yourself did you ever understand why you were

bulimic was there because it's a psychological like comorbidity so what was the cause it's really hard to

say what the cause was because i got it after i'd lost weight um so you know by the time i was sort of 21 or whatever i was in perfectly

reasonable shape um but i got it at like 23. um and actually there was a result of it um the

only time i was ever hospitalized it's a really random but hilarious story in its own way

um because i've been throwing up i've been basically like hurting the inside of my throat right and i was at a festival one time and i

had a coughing fit in in hackney and i had a coughing fit at the hospital and i coughed a hole in my

throat literally it's called a pneumomedia steinem it's a very unique

thing to happen apparently and fortunately it was close enough to the royal london hospital to go in there and show them right

and basically what happened to me was my head started to grow so i was with my friends feeling fine other than this

cough and one of my friends just looked at me and was like whoa and i was like what they're like may your head is massive

i'm like i'm not even talking mate maybe a dick no no your head is growing what is going on i was like what and then

everyone else was like oh my god anyway walks to the hospital um it's sort of like five

in the afternoon or whatever because there's a day festival um and there's like you know it's east london there's quite a lot of genuinely

like gang related things people are bleeding everywhere all this stuff and they just see me and they're like that guy's next

and put me and i went into intensive care for like the whole week um whilst they were basically trying to sew up this hole in my throat when you say

your head was your head was growing so oxygen was going uh not going like in my mouth and through my

bloodstream properly somebody was escaping around my head and my brain so it was like an emergency procedure to like like get me on

uh meds and sort me out but it's so interesting because even knowing that that had happened to me i didn't relate the cause

to actually a deeper root cause which was another mental health problem um to be honest with you like i couldn't

say to you what the trigger was beyond this like story you know the things that we grow up with the people

that we grow up with those little you know bullying and things like that i mean you know in some good respects

because i grew up fat i've got a good personality and a sense of humor so i've always been like able to really connect with people because i just never

had it all my way kind of thing do you know this this story about you know um people that are fat having

better senses of humor and being a little bit more you know quote and quite bubbly yeah why why is that i think self-deprecation

can sometimes be like a defense mechanism right and and ultimately you know with these things you're going

to hear them a lot if you grow up you're going to hear it a lot right you're going to go to a new environment someone's going to bully you for the obvious and so

you kind of find a way of coping with it in your own way um for me it's just interesting because

the other mental health um issues that i've had in my life i'm able to trace back usually to a

moment or a thing or reflect on why this one kind of just happened later and then as soon like you know i had it for

a few years but then it just also went away at what age was this so about 23

to about 27. are you old now uh 33. so it was so you had it for 23 to 27 for

about four years and you overcame yeah but like

naturally i wasn't doing anything different i mean i started to learn what foods would make me more sick than others if that makes sense as well

um but i find it super interesting again less so i mean we're cool to know

the trigger obviously but it's almost less so that and more so the fact that um it kind of ran its course as

well was interesting to me and that i buried it right in my head um and actually 27

um you know was the start of like a whole other you know experience in life for me anyway

so it is possible that um you know these things are related to stress and other things

um my entrepreneurship journey started at 24 so it's not completely unrelated but not quite not

not enough to actually label it and say it's for a thing um but then you know the

other the other experiences um that i've had with with mental health a lot clearer so i

think depression is a really complex term um and the only i think it's really

worth saying the only relation that i've got to depression that i'm comfortable talking about

um is after my father passed away and i think that's really reasonable right and so this is

the thing i like because i work so so much with people in mental health and experts i know like depression is also

not something to claim you have when you feel down or you know it's very different like and

obviously there is a spectrum of these things as well but for me my depressive episode was

right after my father passed away because he was on life support for six months and overcame

when they said he's 100 going to die actually survived made it out of the hospital into

recovery home and then someone basically had a cold around him and he died of their cold catching their cold

after the entire recovery process um the truth of the matter is that my depression was actually interestingly

sort of linked with a lack of belief in um a higher power or whatever you

want to call it justice like everything right because in fairness yeah and like my dad was like such a generous spirited guy

he was blind he had all of these things wrong with him anyway and still like was just the funniest nicest

warmest person anyone knows and um the last person on earth to kind of deserve something like that

and so for me the um the experience after he passed away so

he believed in god so when he died i was like that's my connection to god gone

therefore i straight up believe in nothing um you know i think it's really interesting to have conversations with people

intelligent people like yourself when you talk about purpose and vision and these things it's very

hard to imagine that you've got a purpose a vision for anything if suddenly you've switched

and you've switched off and you've said i believe in nothing you did totally destabilized yeah yeah i remember the the feeling of

being i was religious until i was when i was christian until i was 18. and then which i think will surprise a lot of people because i'm a very

rational sort of someone that makes a lot of decisions and things from first principles or logic and then at 18 i lost my faith per se

and it was the most like the two years following that were the two most destabilizing years of my life

as i i became a total obsessive atheist which means i read every book watched every documentary video

and then i got to the point and this is when i realized that i'd overcome my sort of wobble where i no longer cared about

engaging in these debates with people that agreed or disagreed with me and i was at peace with my own beliefs

that um i guess which is like agnosticism if that's a term and the other really destabilizing moment in my

life where i lost my sense of purpose was the day someone offered me about

20 to 30 million um hypothetically to buy my business and 18 year old steve shows up i've

talked about this a few times because he thought we were doing this for money he thought that was the goal

and so i go home that night i remember where i sat like it was yesterday i'm typing rightmove.com looking at

houses at 24 years old and then i'm looking at these houses and i'm getting this real sort of deep sense of um unfulfillment by

thinking well that was that was it that was the game and then like okay so um auto trader boom

boom lamborghini aventador i'm looking at this aventador and feeling like i'd be poorer not in a financial sense but in like a

spiritual sense if i chose to step on what's clearly a hamster wheel

and and that so from that day the day after i didn't know why i was i didn't know

why i was working hard anymore i didn't know why i was building the business and i had to then go in search of a real form of stability in my

life which was you know i love it but i thought i loved it for another reason i thought i loved it for money

but i loved it for connection and for conversations like this and those things but to go back to your point please um

Psychedelics

you're talking about how you lost your sense of sort of stability i guess yeah i lost what i believed in this world

yeah and if you don't have a sense of belief it's really hard to find your purpose and i i would say that i

i went through a few years of that um very important age sorry uh so 24 my dad

died so i mean also similar time to having the yeah i mean i didn't even realize that as

i until i was saying it just now um but so probably related obviously um but

i i went through about three years of not believing um

in anything right like really and you know not very nice about it either um so i

grew up jewish um and i've always said in fairness you know i think judaism is as bad a

religion as all the other religions you know i don't actually personally uh like any one of them

but i do love what they all mean but then you know it's very possible to be wise and not associate yourself with a

religion and what i've learned which i find so interesting is my identity my connection to

spirituality and judaism is a weird one as well because it's like a race and a religion so it's like you can actually be not

religious you can lose your religion but still be the race yeah um and that's that's like an actually it's a positive in a way because it

means you don't have to disassociate from cultural values but you can disassociate yourself from religious ideals

and what actually happened to me was you know i would be relatively difficult

and question people a lot when they would talk to me about their religious beliefs i'd want to dig into them and i'd really

want to challenge the way that they think and why they think these things and how they can defend them but not trying not to be an absolute

[Â __Â ] but just using my own i guess bitterness and my own experience of growing up being told

to believe in something which is very different to finding something and you know when my father passed away

and i didn't have this connection to it anymore i also felt like i didn't have a connection to spirituality or anything

and so it's very weird to have like almost the death of a religion as a human being because that's your death of your

connection to this earth and purpose and everything and it wasn't until i was 27 really um

one of my really good friends told me about um and obviously we've been talking about christian angermeier as well like our mutual friends so this is

a relevant conversation told me about ayahuasca and i'd never heard of it before i didn't even know what it was

um and i went on a retreat with him and um i mean i came back that weekend

completely i mean when i say a 180 i went from the most cynical non-believer in the

whole world negatively so to like without sounding like a complete

[Â __Â ] like positively enlightened and confident never never

more confident of anything in my life um of spiritual realism

and what i believe in and ultimately what i believe in when i have these like fun conversations with people now about

spirituality which is you know what do i believe in i believe in nature i believe in

looking at the beauty of the world and how cycles work which is science right and the way

that my ayahuasca experience actually opened my eyes to believing in something spiritual or greater than myself

was 90 percent of my hallucination was observing what happens in nature with cycles

right birds bees oxygen air soil all of this recycling all the time

for a sustainable system and being like you know that is in itself a scientific miracle but

something greater than us that's always happening throughout time and it was a real shift for me because

a i overcame my depression from that b i suddenly believed in something

even if that's something is nature and when people are like and i get this from christians quite often as well because they're like you know what do you mean

you believe in nature like what is that i'm like i mean it's it's more believable than a guy that walked on water

yeah and when they like get annoyed i'm like i've got nothing against jesus i'm just saying that like believing in nature as ridiculous as

that sound is a profound belief and what's important is it is a belief and having a belief has actually helped

me helped guide me to then work on things like what are my personal values you know which you talked about you know mental

models what do i say yes to a no to in life well you can only figure those things out if you spend time with mental models

first principles thinking about what things mean to you in life and then suddenly

other things start to come into flow and and so i really want to just double down on this ayahuasca experience

what exactly did you do on that experience so ayahuasca is essentially uh and it's

completely natural it's tree sap from the amazon um and it's been practiced for thousands of years and

you know i won't go into like the whole history of psychedelics but i could do because i've read a lot about it um the the reality is it's sacred

so our shamans have like a legal license to practice with it um and they it's a guided experience so

the most important thing to say to anyone thinking about ayahuasca or whatever like it's not something you do at home on

your own at all ever you could do that with mushrooms you can definitely do that with lsd

you definitely do not want to do that with ayahuasca because um in my experience the other

psychedelics are a bit like you can have sort of one foot in this world one foot in that world and ayahuasca is not even in this

plane you're just somewhere else but what's fascinating and very common from people's recollections of ayahuasca

trips is you have a spirit guide called mama ayahuasca that's what everyone calls

her um and in all of my experience of doing it and

i've done it about 12 times now so i almost go back every year by the way it's an incredibly painful experience

and it's very difficult to do and it's not something you look forward to which is why it's like rockish rocket fuel growth um which is

why i do it because you learn all the things about yourself you don't want to hear you don't want to know and you confront the

worst realities and i've learned more in those weekends that i've done this then you know you can learn with therapists

and you can learn yourself so staggering everyone says this to me and it's and you know you mentioned a guy called

christian angermeier context he runs a company called a thai which are are now developing um psychedelics as a way to

cure treatment resistant depression um it's really sort of a groundbreaking company and he sat with me in his

his penthouse just across across the street in fact from where we are now and he was telling me that you can let

you unlock the brain by taking these drugs and you discover truths about yourself which

in many experiences which is similar to what you're describing will have a permanent lasting

transformative impact on the way you see the world and it like corrects your thinking and it's it's

it's crazy crazy for a normal person that isn't in this world or doesn't understand this to think that you can take

a magic mushroom or a drug or a psychedelic or whatever you want to call it and overcome grief there's a great book

by michael pollan called um how to change your mind and in it he talks about this problem with

psychedelics it's a bit like dreams right you're having an ineffable experience so to describe it for people was generally

quite boring what i think is more interesting in a sense is to discuss the outcomes that i've i've got from it

um so the first time you know very quickly because you asked the experience was the hallucinogenic

experience like i said was watching the cycles of the earth develop and were you conscious because right so

you haven't done it yes so you drink it it takes about an hour for me you lie down the pitch blacks fluid

it's like a shot it tastes disgusting but some people like it you lie back um and and the shamans basically start

playing music and it's a completely guided facilitated experience with them if you're having problems they come over they help you if you need to be taken

out the room they look after you it's like you know it's busy night there's noises like a lot of people throw up

how's this for irony i didn't throw up for my first 10 times which everyone was like that's super weird i was like yes especially

considering my history really bizarre um but the

um the experience i saw was the one i needed and there's a really deep insightful experience you get from

psychedelics which you can often go in wanting a thing but it isn't what you need and in this experience what i

wanted was to see my dad and to connect with my dad but it isn't what i got what i got was

um a vision of understanding how everything in this earth is living

in a cycle like a beautiful miracle and so it was less about like seeing micro things and seeing macro things

being in it if it's taking me to a place i don't want to go and a door i'm not ready to open

you can negotiate you can actually say i'm not ready for that yet and sometimes it'll push you and say open it anyway but sometimes it will

actually listen to you and let you go sort of back into your body so it is a really fascinating

experience and what i'd say about it is it's the number one most important thing i've ever done in my life

um and especially because it's not pleasant um the first time i

did it was you know the single most life-changing moment in my life not only got over my depression you know

i went and spent the whole day with my mum the next day explained everything that i'd experienced um you know not a

mum's favorite chat hearing your son talk about psychedelics but certainly is in context of like helping me get over

something she was aware i was suffering from um the single greatest lesson i've learned in ayahuasca is about gratitude

so i was going through a period i think i was 30 potentially it was a few years later and

uh things were going well at the time so my attitude my mindset was i want this i

want that right what's your intention going in well i want this i want that that's like how you answer it because you're not enlightened enough

to understand the psychedelic experience right yeah yeah and you can write it down and come back to and be like that was what i was looking for in this journey

um but actually the lesson i learned so i was asking you know how can i 10x what i do

how can i be more how can i become better how can i have more impact you know me me me me all these questions um i was

instead transported to um like basically i'm not sure where in

the world but a very poor part of the world where there was this like kid like begging

in the street basically and i like became that kid and i became this person like trying to

get water for his family and having to walk miles for it and

50 of my whole entire psychedelic experience that night was literally walking like a mile in this

boy's shoes and it this lesson sort of came to me about you know it isn't always about what you

want and it isn't always about like you know asking for more it's actually about having gratitude for

what you have and when you have enough gratitude for what you already have you will unlock the path to more

and you know there's this thing that i've learned as well which is when you go into experiences it's helpful to have a totem

right so i carry a different stone in for each experience and i have these stones at home anyway i have this stone

by the side of my bed um and every single morning that i wake up the first thing i see is this stone

literally just a pile of crap stone but the point is it's imbued with this message for me and i wake up every day and i'm grateful

for having running water in my bathroom there and that is like an unbelievably poetic

and powerful way to live your life past an experience to wake up in camden town in london being you know

so fortunate like i am but with a real genuine reminder of gratitude as opposed to like waking

up groggy and being like hey i'm grateful for waking up today this is like it means something to me so these little triggers and shifts they

emotionally change something in you but i've learned a lesson the hard way through ayahuasca as well which is

just because you're learning lessons this is like all wisdom right it doesn't matter whether you get it from ayahuasca or you get it from you know your

instagram posts you can read it and it can resonate and you can be like wow that's powerful

without action it means nothing so if you don't create then the steps

to be better based on what you learned you're wasting a very powerful weekend and painful

weekend and i've been guilty of that too i've learned i've learned lessons that i haven't necessarily followed

through with and you know and and sometimes it's because they take bravery

and i feel like i'm not ready for that bravery up and so we were talking about the other day you know with the exactly with personal

branding exactly actually that's actually a good segue on to that topic as well because it's something that i know for a fact a lot of people

Posting online despite what people think

struggle with in different forms and um but in but also specifically with this topic which is

putting yourself out there on the internet um i know this because a lot of people have told me but also

because i've been there right so let's if we rewind a couple of years in my own life

a guy called ash jones says to me you should make a youtube channel i dismiss the idea obviously because i'm

like well people are going to think that i think i'm mahatma gandhi like or like people are gonna think that i think i'm a genius or

that i think i have all the answers so i'm not doing that eventually after two years he sits me down in this room and it took

about eight or nine hours for us to shoot a two-minute video because i couldn't speak i i was

self-conscious and all of these things and i was plagued by that thought that my friends back home who knew me in

school will think oh steve's a [Â __Â ] he's changed what's he doing who does he think he is and that almost imprisoned me it almost

stopped me from doing the thing that actually liberated me made me the most fulfilled i've ever been and by allowing me to be my like true

self and in fact what i wanted to do was be true to myself and um

it felt like i was worried that people would think i was um being something i was not trying to fake

myself and so i guess the question that i have for you is you know a lot of stuff but you've not

you know you've got a great podcast secret leaders you've got a new podcast as well which is centered around your brand heights um

you've struggled to put yourself out there on the internet and social media can you explain why yes i mean such a good question

steve um but also because we connect a lot on this right so you're like my unofficial mentor with a few voice notes where i'm

like he's got a [Â __Â ] point here um

so you know it's i guess i'll put it a slightly different way you know i was listening to one of your early but you sent me this actually your podcast with

with him so what was his name ash jones yeah yeah you told me to listen to an episode which i did and you know he was talking

about the early days of social chain you learned early that you you were bringing in most of the revenue like

steve was bringing in most of the revenue therefore the business decision made lots of sense to center that around you i think when you're doing b2b that makes

loads of sense the challenge i have is um my products are b2c right they're for consumers

and putting as much time and effort and thought and energy into promoting myself is is mental

energy i should be putting into the brand and you know there is i think uh probably a reasonable compromise and

also like all things this is a bit of a developing scenario however um you know it's a very

fair thing to say that i'm not the product this is the product um inside my company we could all agree

that that is like broadly true right we're selling a thing we're not selling me whereas you know going through exactly the same

experience at social chain you guys if you weren't in the room you guys would have come to the same conclusion which is steve's the greatest like part of the

funnel here so we as a company succeed when steve's succeeding so that's the kind of marketing final we should back so you

know i can see you sort of smirking at me because this is the story i tell myself okay fine because i was like this doesn't make

this is the story this is the story that i tell myself it doesn't mean that it's true um

you know then there's another question about platforms right so um you know this isn't a mental health

condition um but i do have imposter syndrome and you know we've talked about this in the

past as well but um you know the first business that i scaled

uh was grabble and which is when we first met yes um and you know that

that was me going into technology and fashion having had no experience previously i was in advertising before

and i love changing industries and i love challenging myself to completely wipe the slate clean and do something new but it comes

with imposter syndrome that's what i've learned about myself right i'm i'm full of the internal monologue of

i'm not good enough no one cares what i think and i don't deserve to be doing this it's someone else's dream

um that doesn't change right in me that that voice is still

there um however you know a really good thing if you're aware if you're consciously

aware of your limitations especially like some of your mental frailties creating steps to improve those things

are helpful so with heights the first thing i did just over 100 weeks ago we started a newsletter

because i was like i'm going to get imposter syndrome so badly in a space of neuroscience and nutrition

not neuroscientists or nutrition like it's going to be awful for me so i'm going to write a newsletter every week

and i'm going to read a science paper every week and i am going to distill that into three minutes because when you read something you learn it once and

when you share it you learn it twice so the process of literally rewriting this was creating neural pathways

and embedding the information into my brain so i was like in a hundred weeks it's actually what i told myself and it's just

been 101 now um in 100 weeks i won't be a neuroscientist or a nutritionist but i will have read over 100 science

papers and i'll know what science says is good for your brain according to journals experts etc which

would be an amazing step to create an amazing habit to build to get over my own mental frailties and

my own story of imposter syndrome so when it comes to social media i feel like i've got the same thing which is

like um when my last company failed and i didn't know what i was going to do

next i looked at like my social media platforms i was like you know where am i going to spend time rather than where am i going to waste time

ultimately right because you can get caught up in this silly game and then thinking personal branding where do i feel

comfortable that would be a good place to start and i chose linkedin and the reason i chose linkedin was because i told myself

a story which i completely believe to be true anyway which is whatever i do next i'm a serial

entrepreneur right as in i'm fine not having any money i'm fine working for other people for free doing all these things but i'm always going to

start something else myself again so if i know that to be true it means i'm always going to hire people

and what do really smart and impressive people want from their boss they want to know who they're working for they want to know what your values are

they want to know what you believe in they want to know what kind of things you share and so i was like linkedin is the only place that could credibly do that for me

right and i actually went from i mean it's not you know that impressive but i went from like 3 000 followers or something to almost

25 000 on the basis of and as you know there's no putting money behind anything in linkedin or anything

literally just by being myself by writing about how i'd failed by writing about what i was working on

next by working and and also all of the things when you know writing about what you're working on next is such a difficult thing to do because it's

probably going to fail as well and it did you know before heights um with three iterations of things that i

was publicly putting out there and getting feedback on and stuff that we had to kill because it didn't have legs um it's a horrible time for an

entrepreneur in between or it can be certainly in between people like what do you do and your identity is in flux and you

know you're like do i talk about this new thing that i've just discovered that might not be a thing in a month preaching here dan i know right exactly

exactly but it's such a complicated answer to give in the now yeah um so anyway like on the personal brand

thing like i decided linkedin was a place i felt comfortable because i can be my authentic self because i am an entrepreneur because i

am someone who is willing to go big and fail and like actually figure out

why and talk about why and i think this stuff is so important um for entrepreneurs to

connect openly and honestly because i absolutely hate and the one thing i will not miss about networking events

is like going to them and everyone talking about them killing it you know that is literally poison in our society it's

nonsense so everyone just talking about how they're killing it stops people from saying actually you know shit's really hard

right now this is the problem i'm dealing with and this is like how it's making me feel if you're able to say that to another

entrepreneur because you've created the container in the environment to be comfortable to do so that person can probably help you and if

you are stuck with the narrative that everything's going amazingly all the time and that's all you're telling people no one can help you

figure it out when you actually could do with the help you know it's the other thing going slightly off piece sorry but

you know my biggest bug bear in entrepreneurship is stealth mode i think stealth mode is like the most

stupid thing that an entrepreneur can claim to be in full stop because as you know ideas are worthless execution is

everything anyone that's ever built a business knows how stupid it is stealth mode is when people say like working on a new business in

finance in stealth mode right i'd love to see i mean not telling anybody yeah i'd love to tell you what my startup is but it's so amazing you'll

steal it so i'm not going to tell you guys all the time all the time so many people

do it and and i i i give the most direct feedback on linkedin probably very similar to you like loads

of people asking my help for loads of things all the time and if i ever see stealth mode on their thing i'm like i don't talk to anyone in stealth mode

fyi stealth mode is such a stupid thing because it's it's it's like how do i describe

like saying i'm afraid of feedback but it's yeah but it's also like saying i've got something that i can't tell you

yeah why did you tell me you had something i know you know just don't start the conversation with me i'm a curious

person what it is but you know you're attention seeking but you don't want to tell it's like it's a weird form of

like i don't know flirtation i don't know um but i want to get to this point about

why you we have this conversation yeah like a week or two ago about instagram and making videos of yourself

and putting your ideas out there what is it that's stopping you doing that you talked about imposter syndrome i guess that kind of relates to the

business side of things more what's stopping you going on instagram putting a video on your instagram and saying

this is what i think these are my ideas comment below if you agree yeah you're it's a great question um

so i guess as a starting point like it's worth saying that i think a very healthy way to approach stuff like this in your life is to to

choose a place build confidence and go on from there so i feel like that's what i did with linkedin i understood that that's the

place where i'd feel least impostery and so i'd start there now you know i picked up on on twitter i

mean twitter is like my favorite platform that's when i spend probably the most time on um but you know it's it's got a very short

half-life so it's kind of impossible to to consistently come up with gems um

instagram you know to me was this place where just beautiful people live young beautiful people live and that's all

anyone's interested in and that's not really my world right i'm interested in challenge i'm interested

in mental health i'm interested in stories um and i interestingly i wasn't finding

that on instagram so i was like what am i doing i don't really belong in this place at all um i'd say like a hundred percent

like inspired by the way that you've approached your instagram like sharing insights because insights and like distilling my thoughts into something

and writing them down that is something that i do i just don't publish them or i was on linkedin

so actually like what i've now started doing on instagram is like literally taking a leaf out of your book after our chat which is going through

some of my high performing linkedin posts that you know might have got one or two thousand likes and being like if

it was popular there i guess it'll be popular let's have a go and trying to get over it now slowly but surely but it's this

constant belief that no one wants to hear what i have to say yes of course and that's what i was getting

at and like where does what are the forces that are

at play which are making it feel like some like psychological discomfort if you are

to tell the world what you think on instagram let's say what in your mind what is it friends back

home is it this particular person sometimes i can think of a particular person and i can think that person from four

years ago is going to think i'm a dick 100 dude like the thing that i've learned which is so interesting is

90 percent of my fear of what people will think is based on my school friends yes who like you know i only speak to a

bunch of them now you know identity is such an interesting thing and you know you have it when you're um you'll be going through it right now

and i empathize right you're not steve from social chain anymore yeah right and that's you know for ages you know i was down from gravel now i'm

down from heights um you know people do that and that's fine but it's important you don't over

compensate that identity for yourself attached to your business because we're all on a path and we're going to go

through a journey and the journey the stories are going to change and when you over attach yourself to a particular

part of the journey is where you can find struggle and that's and on that point you build your life around

that identity so your friends the you me your music your interests and so you you would have collected

through your life a bunch of people who know dan as this exactly and you're gonna have to shed

some of them potentially by by stepping into your new identity 100 and that's a i guess a conflict or a

100 and it's difficult right but as you grow you edit and you know you need to really consider

who you're editing out of your life and who you're welcoming into your life and i think you know there's the the

practical reality that what was good for you five years ago is no good for you right now and frankly you know the highest

leverage decision you can make i'm still terrible at this by the way but the highest leverage decision you can make is picking what to say no to

and the hardest thing you can do is say no to opportunities that you would definitely say yes to so you know that includes friends that

includes saying i don't have time for this friend anymore or this identity this part of my

identity anymore even though i like it i like them i like all this stuff because

frankly there's you know this shedding almost that we do as human

beings um you know the you know in reptile form it's very physical right they're literally shedding a skin

but as humans you don't see this change but it doesn't mean it doesn't happen and we go in these cycles and i think a

lot of you know mental health conditioning is attached to our holding onto the past and refusing

to sort of embrace the future and that's why you know i think it's really important

to set out a clear understanding of your purpose a clear understanding of the things you will say no to and won't say

no to and acknowledging that that changes right so i do an exercise like this every year um and it takes about five or six hours

i do it with my wife it's like a whole massive like briefing document essentially on your vision your purpose your friends

like all of this stuff um spending the time thoughtfully thinking about these things which people do not do enough of

is so important because if you're not reflective and you're not spending time thinking manifesting essentially who you

want to be in the future then i think you're going to miss a massive opportunity to grow

um you know i because you know i work in the brain space now in in brain care neuroscience

you call that neuroplasticity right it's this idea that the brain will grow it's plastic and it's essentially changing in whatever

direction you choose to take it in if you are episode 53 of chapter two we

talked about this on the last episode so it's very relevant oh really okay fine yeah so neuroplasticity is that

um if you are into spirituality like i am then it's called manifestation right

it's spending the time thinking about what you're gonna do and how you're gonna get that and then to put it into like super

business terms if you're into business it's called planning and execution so there are these different ways to

articulate the same point but the point is if you just spend your days going um bit

by bit not really thinking about where you're going to go and what it means to you it'd be very hard for you to make good

decisions and frankly and this i guess actually speaking like personal branding a more popular post i

did recently was about stamina and the things i've learned about rest which is that as a founder and a ceo you learn that

you're not paid for your stamina right you pay yeah you pay mo gorda for sorry not mo

called mo farah for his stamina right he's got to run a [Â __Â ] 10k that's

stamina right that's what athletes are paid for i'm paid for my decision making people

invest in me and they invest in heights for my decision-making abilities and overworking

giving yourself burnout not taking space to rest not listening to what you know to be

true and spending the time planning that's bad decision-making yeah um if you can't do those things for your own

body you know it's like what i said is if you can't be the ceo of your body you do not earn the right to be the ceo

of your company you gotta you've got to look after your mental state and your physical body

first by thinking and finding the space carving out the space to think what does good decisions look like that

fit my purpose and where i'm looking to go and if you can do that and you can answer those things you actually start

to learn things start to add up and and that kind of segues back to the

Burnout

initial tweet where you talked about depression anxiety banner and insomnia so let's talk about burnout then it's a

very um a very popular topic i actually think one of the most listened to episode of this podcast was

the top was the one about burnout and us being a burnout generation and how we've kind of glamorized it we're

optimizing our lives so we can fill it with more things to do did you burn out how did you burn out and you understand

why you burnt out 100 um you know garyvee is a very clever man

um very intelligent but you know he has created a negative impact on society

that he would probably be upset about because he seems to be a lovely man that really deeply cares about stuff from what i can see i believe his authenticity but he

has created hustle culture and hustle porn and you know what i met gary vee had him on this podcast

and you're right i think in every um depiction of him there he's a genuinely

authentic person you meet him and think you are who i thought you were online um

and you're completely right in the sense that because he's being his authentic self which we can't

you know uh um we can't criticize anyone for being in fact that's what we tell everyone to be be

yourself and chat you know and be willing to share it with the world the issue i think as you're pointing out

is his lack of appreciation that

about nuance and that everyone is fundamentally different and everyone's not gary vee i had that problem too when i started

i couldn't understand why people weren't sacrificing their lives to build businesses and working until four in the

morning and sleeping under the desk i thought everyone that wasn't doing that was both an idiot and inferior and wasting their time and

wasting that time and they would never be happy because as far as steve's bartlett's brain could tell him

that was happiness yeah and because like all of the pain that you suffer is part of part of the game and yeah but that stuff

isn't this is the thing right that stuff isn't not true you do have to grow growth is painful and you will have

sleepless nights and all the other bits and pieces that is part of the parcel the thing where we confuse this is it's all mutually exclusive aka

my identity has to be that and only that because that's how gary v and like a few other geniuses in society

have got to the top of their games but here's the thing like there's two

reasons why i had burnout last time the first was because i wasn't happy on what i was working and

running a startup can feel a bit like a cage sometimes so uh unless you're really sure i say this

all entrepreneurs all the time are you sure this is the company you want to build because if it's not you're going to be doing it anyway and

then you are your own bird keeper you have locked yourself in a cage and that's what i did with

grabble i got lucky i found a niche an opportunity

it grew exponentially really quickly millions of downloads had a million monthly active users in our end we had

like a you know even acquisition that failed sadly but you know would have made us millionaires was

a real journey with that company it was fashion for tinder basically yeah exactly and it was a real it was a real

exciting journey but at no point did i enjoy it um really like

not at no point my ego enjoyed it right and we won loads of awards um you know we won the award we wanted

like we were like we just want to be written about in techcrunch and all this stuff and in 2017 we won best mobile startup in europe over depop at the

techcrunch europas we didn't even turn up to that awards to take that award

because i was having such a bad time mentally i didn't even go to the awards of a ceremony my friend picked up that

trophy and took a photo on our behalf i was sitting at home drinking whiskey feeling really terrible about myself

um why because that was living someone else's dream i

didn't care about fashion um what was the force that made you live someone else's dream yeah good question uh a bit of

serendipity in the sense of um you know listening to users going on a bit of a journey and the product sort

of developing and then it getting catching fire before you really have an opportunity to stop and say no that's not really for

me like you were getting dragged you weren't pulling a bit yeah a bit but then at the same time like you know

like everyone i'm scared of failure so i didn't want to be a failure so i wanted to make it work and you know by hook or

by crook i was willing to like push really hard to make it work and you know i look back on my time with grapple and

other than like working hard i was working against my purpose and i could feel it and when people ask me i'm

actually like as you know always to my detriment honest so

i would tell people including the wrong people including investors that you know my heart really isn't in it and like all

this stuff because you know all i had left for authenticity was to be honest in these

conversations with other people you know i've just finished writing my book um not trying to plug it although happy

sexy millionaires happy sexy millionaire available on all bookshelves no it's not pre-order um but there's a chapter in there where i

really investigate burnout and the reason there's topics like self-awareness and burnout which we haven't quite yet properly defined

everyone throws it out there on instagram oh i'm feeling burnt out but nobody's like gone down the rabbit hole to figure out the innate causes or

the psychological or social causes of it so i just wanted to like go as far down as i could go

and i tend to believe the depth that i've got to with my thinking and the research that i've done

is that you typically get um you stand a higher chance of burnout in situations where you are extrinsically motivated um

to do x activity because i view my life and i think about all the things that i do intrinsically like walking i've never

got burnt out walking my dog or playing with my dog you know i've never got burnt out um

like reading books that i love and those kinds of things but when it comes to getting paid to

do something that i don't intrinsically enjoy doing burnout is almost inevitable at some

point not just by now right but then my but then motivation and i started looking at motivation and the spectrum

it sits on of on one end being totally uh extrinsic you're literally doing it because you're forced to

and then on the other end doing it because it's an innate passion an intrinsic passion and all of the things on this end where you

you're paid and you're forced to burn out seems to show up and on the other end when it's it's

intrinsic and you love it and you're doing it for the sake of doing it i never get burned out and my motivation seems to last the course of time so i

wanted to see if that resonates with you yeah but let me tell you something else that's interesting that i'm i'm consciously aware of because i've had

burnout and by the way my experience of it was you know i just couldn't get out of bed for a month really um that was it i basically just

stayed in bed and i just like i couldn't face going to the office i couldn't face leaving my

team in the office yeah and you're lying in bed well i got my co-founder and i just like explained that i'd literally i didn't

know what it was at the time i was like i think it might be depression i didn't know what it was though this is the thing i probably didn't even say those words how did it feel um just like just no

energy whatsoever just like no no ability a bit like when i had corona virus to be honest just like zonked

um not and nothing i was doing was able to make me feel like i was getting the energy

i think the reason why as well was um again i like i'm a helpful guy i really

believe in my greatest superpower full stop is connecting people right i've got infinite numbers of ways i've connected

people eight people have got married that i've introduced you know they say three in heaven but you know i don't quite believe in heaven so

it's irrelevant but point being um you know so many co-founders introduced

i really just believe in the serendipity of creating you know moments where you know that person and that person just should have

that chat and i force it to happen so because of that because i really believe in serendipity as well

um i do try and say yes to people and help them out so what was happening to me at gravel was

we were flying we were like number one in the app store and all this stuff so the inbounds start coming like thick and fast right and so i was like

i can't do this the way i was doing it which is like all over the place i'll go to old street at 6 00 a.m

every single tuesday and wednesday um and between six and nine i'll do like sessions right

if you come meet me between that time and like your 45 minute slot i'll fit you in and then tuesday and

wednesday became tuesday to thursday and then before i knew i was doing it like almost every single day

trying to be so helpful and it was great because i i i get loads of energy from that right like

so much there's you know great quote of you know there's no such thing as altruism because you're ultimately doing it for yourself and i

believe that um however so it's like find your motivation and then turn it but i overdid it and so the result

the net result was like one day i woke up from my alarm trying to do it and i like basically couldn't move and that alarm basically you know kept

going for the next few days and i was like nope i just can't do it i can't go to work i can't get out of bed

it's really like it's really strange time but the thing that's really interesting to

me this time right so i analyzed that as partly burned out and i was trying to do too much to and

not spending enough time on myself not having any rest not being sensible about my personal space

and my life which was stupid but the kind of thing you learned the hard way quite often and then the other thing was obviously

like i was working on a business that i wasn't very happy and i was having more fun meeting these people and helping like make introductions than i was

working my own business now with heights you know very consciously aware of the opposite problem to be true so we just talked

about burnout from some of your insights right one of my fears from heights is you know

i won't see burnout coming because now i'm living my purpose now i am so passionate

i get so much motivation and pleasure from working on heights that i could do

this 24 7 um and i diarize stopping myself right i literally put in

my diary to stop like all my things rest naps peloton

like all of the things like i talked to you earlier about like my shakti meditation these things are in my diary

because if it's in my calendar i'm going to pay attention to it and i'm going to respect it and if i don't i won't respect my own boundaries because i know

that i'm intrinsically a bit of a workaholic and if i'm passionate you can't stop me so i have to stop myself

sure and knowing you know taking preventative measures towards things like burnout

if you are happy um i think has been a really like mature decision that i'm really proud of taking

this time around because it's a bit like the imposter syndrome right how am i going to overcome it i'll write a newsletter every week great i feel way

less like that now same thing burn out i don't feel like i'm going to get burned even though i've been sitting in my bedroom pitching you know

to investors like all of february and march like it's not a great existence because of lockdown and if i said you yeah listen

uh i'm the same i'm a workaholic and all these things i'm an entrepreneur i'm going to build a big business dan what is the one thing i can do to

avoid myself getting burnout what would you say that is you would say is diarizing and scheduling time

to do other things like you know i had near l on this podcast and he talked about he writes the book indestructible he

talks about how he will literally schedule time in his diary to see his to spend some time with his

partner and take his kids for a walk and and those kinds of things is that what you're saying you're saying yeah yeah

i mean i've got um i do have like a list of habits that i've created for myself and you know talking about habit

formation um terrible error everyone makes is like oh i'll listen to dan i'll do all of these you know habits no i

pick like one new one a year to be honest with you my number one mental health hack full stop

um that i say to everyone everyone always asks me my one thing mine's going for a walk um you know spending an hour or so

walking if you can do that without being distracted i mean i listen to podcasts and audio books but

i also go for some where i don't take anything with me and i just go for the walk um that's my number one health hack um

because it's not only good for your brain but good for your body and because it puts you into there's two

things one we live in london actually to be honest like gets way worse of rep about rain than you know you would think because i don't

go out with a raincoat most days um but even if it's raining you still go out and that's a great moment to just be

with the elements and accept that you know things aren't always perfect even the manifestation of rain you know it's a great moment to just go

out and be like things aren't perfect but i owe it to myself for my own rest and for my own space to

do this today and the other reason honestly is because on average i get to listen to about 50

books a year just by doing that one thing so as someone who's like a lifelong learner and happiest when i'm

learning the amount of books that i've devoured by stacking that you know habit onto my daily walk has

been the fastest way to grow yeah and so we talked about burn out there the next thing so and that's that

Anxiety

was during your time at gravel the next thing from that tweet was anxiety yeah so the anxiety and insomnia were

completely linked with each other so a really really fascinating experience

to me the most interesting of all of them really because at the time i got and so at the time i

got insomnia and this is when anxiety starts to build because anxiety does go with it insomnia

very well because uh you start to get scared of going to sleep which builds anxiety you can't really sleep when you've got anxiety so

it's like a self-fulfilling prophecy like every single night so i had insomnia for six months

and my symptoms were i'd go to sleep at midnight but i'd wake up at 2am and at 2am i was wide awake and there

was no going back to sleep whatsoever no matter what i did so this was a time when business was

going well i was pretty happy in life i was getting married um yes my dad had passed away but my mom

had just recovered from cancer so i'd had like the whole fear of her and she's already had it before and recovered once so very unlikely to

recover the second time but she had i have a roof over my head i practice gratitude you know like i am just that archetypal

[Â __Â ] that's just too smug for the world and i just suddenly

couldn't sleep and i was like i don't understand like i have everything that i wanted and i'm not i don't even want much

you know i've worked on that stuff so where has this come from and you know

basically chronic anxiety the feeling of chronic anxiety is lots of sweating lots of self-doubt

um lots of um almost like a bit of a personality change in me you know outwardly i'm

quite confident but you know this experience with anxiety was sort of really making me question everything about what i say

how i feel who i am and you know it was in this cycle where if i'm about

to go to sleep i'm not going to be able to go to sleep because of this you know these feelings of doubt

and stories i'm telling myself and it became this perpetual illness and by the way i tried so many things right because when

you say doubt yeah and the story self-doubt self-doubt about business self-doubt about business self-doubt

about who i am um and about why i'm feeling like this anxiety is such a complicated thing

because um you know there's a great uh i think it's by lao tzu the it's not a perfect um verbatim

quote but he said something like depression is a symptom of sadness for the past we've lived anxiety is obsession and confusion over

the future you're gonna have and that's why like mindfulness and being present is the antidote and i think i really resonate with that

because you know my own depression experience was loss of my father the past my anxiety was like the person

hey was anxiety about the night i night sleep i'm about to not have but also like you know who who am i

going to be what's going to happen how long can i live like this feels like it's self-fulfilling in a way as well exactly so the the truth is i tried all

these different things so like i went to i did therapy i did sleep therapy i used all the apps calm sleepio

i tried you know uh cutting out alcohol i tried drinking much more alcohol like i tried you know

like you name it i'd like not smoked weed for a while i was like right that's it getting a weed habit back you know like anything that you could

possibly do to just like stay zonked but i went to the doctor and he recommended me sleeping pills

but that really irked me i mean we just talked about lost connections johan hurry right um i don't appreciate medication

that will work that night as solving my problem and i'm smart enough to know that it wouldn't solve my problem it would just help me sleep that night

so i've still got those sleeping pills and i never use them and i kept on going for this journey the search for why

this was happening and it led me in the end to a dietitian which i'd never worked with before and by the way i didn't even know what a

dietitian was and heard of nutritionists because isn't that just everyone on instagram um but a dietitian

uh had no idea but it turns out a dietitian is basically a nutritionist with a scientific degree they can work

in the nhs and they work with sick people so if you have a sick problem like insomnia you go to a dietitian and they

will literally tell you medically what they can do to affect your

your experience and she just said to me um she basically asked me about what i was

eating and my habits and like all this kind of stuff and i told her and this is someone who i think i'm quite healthy generally speaking and she just said

um you're basically not getting enough brain food and i was like i don't even know what that means like i don't understand the context of that

statement and she was like well let me put it this way your brain is an organ right

it's 60 fat 90 of the fat in your brain is this one compound called dha and most

people that come to me with essentially mental health problems which is what you currently have have nutritional deficiencies and don't

realize there are three main things that i would recommend in your condition one is omega-3s the other is b vitamins

because again that's for energy so she explained that i'm having a spike at 2 am so i need that spike not to happen i

need to have like much more slow release of b vitamins in my energy supply in my body every day and then the third thing was blueberry

extract because it's an antioxidant and would help make lymphatic system whilst i slept right she's saying this stuff to me i'm like

so skeptical i can't even tell you not only not a supplement taker um but she's now recommending me three supplements and i've been given pills by

the doctor and i'm like i mean like come on how is this gonna be any better so you can imagine my complete and utter

surprise when i took those three things i mean they were very expensive they were like

medically prescribed ones so super potent from you know i think it was whole foods

or planet organic they were pricey but within two weeks i was sleeping like a baby and i wasn't i

wasn't feeling anxiety and when you have a moment like that in

your life and you know this because you're a deeply inquisitive person it makes you stop

and it makes you go hold on a second like this was so simply solved i don't

actually believe it to be true this must be placebo this must be finally my placebo that has caused this

um instead i did what i do i'm quite nerdy i started reading science papers because i kind of you know the one thing

i do hate on instagram is like everyone's a nutritionist everyone's at this everyone's at that i'm like i don't want to listen to some guy that

takes nootropics telling me about like my brain and mental performance i want to see what scientists that don't take any credit

actually have to say about this stuff and i learned that there are thousands literally of

science papers this is why i did the newsletter i knew i'd never run out of content it's like literally the deepest well of content

ever ever ever to do what i'm doing um there were thousands of science papers on all of these ingredients and

how they impact not just your mental health below the baseline so if you're suffering from insomnia if you're suffering from

anxiety even if you've got depression schizophrenia like so many medical papers scientific

journals sorry um about the impact of taking a high supplementation of xyz or obviously

much more food of that particular ingredient and the impact it's had and then when

you're at the baseline all of these examples about nutrition impacting your mental performance so this is things like decision making

focus energy like all of the things you we want in life right no one wants to really be recovering from a mental health problem they want to be

at their baseline and thriving and it just took me by so much surprise because i was like well if this isn't

like if this is so well known in science why didn't i know about it i was working in shoreditch

at a scaling startup like bearded glasses hipster [Â __Â ] like you know keto vegan like yes i've

heard of all of them um all my friends intermittent fast yada yada this is just like common sense brain

food why is that not a thing that people know about why is taking care of your brain not something

anyone's actually talked about clearly and actually found a really meaningful way

to communicate what that stands for and what science papers do really badly

is like you know when i synthesize them there's about two or three sentences that are saying the point but it's just

covered with jargon they're boring as [Â __Â ] um so i was like first step newsletter i will add some

Supplements & brand

emojis and some lols and make it millennial and fun and i will get people to read science papers without even realizing they're necessarily reading

them so every week you'll learn something from a scientific journal which i will link back to that you can click and by the

way no one clicks it and you can learn something that science says is good for your brain every week and that is essentially how the journey

with heights actually started with this like realization that something as

you know when you you know the beautiful moment in life where you can spot an opportunity so big

and actually solved by the power of communication and brand um you know a lot of people say brand

and comms that is not a market strategy that is not defensible

i think those people are idiots and the wrong market because you know my counter to that is do you

think that buddhist monks got everyone meditating or was it calm and headspace do you think that we

love to run because we watch the olympics or is it nike getting in our heads do you think that people around the

world are doing yoga because of like you know some ashram or do we actually think it's lululemon

brands create change in the world that we want to see and brands connect

with human beings and create communities and the power of social media and standing for something

is where brands take something that was always done before anyway stick a tick on a shoe it's still just a

shoe like lululemon like it's just like a little logo an omega logo on pants it doesn't matter the way that

you express what you do and why you do it is the thing that has the power to change and my opinion and my own experience of

being you know in that shoreditch hipster [Â __Â ] area where you just know about things

like early and trends to have never come into contact with something so important that can have such an impact as

nutrition and mental health nutrition and taking care of your brain to me felt like a calling right i've just

suffered for six months i've overcome something this is all i want to do with my life

and so you started heights and so i started heights how's it going great question we launched january the

6th in a pandemic well not in a pandemic yet i have to say you know i saw this on my facebook feed

and um i think i messaged you about investing in the company just because it was beautiful i saw the

branding on the website and the way that you'd done the website and i was like this team get branding and in the direct

to consumer world it's interesting what you were just saying there about comms and like the way that i hear it is like storytelling and

um platforms um enabling um

almost democratizing the access to like build great products now because back in like if we think about nike shelf space

or you think about the the you know the power that the unilevers have you're in fact not the war isn't always

storytelling and brand or comms it's in fact like knowing a guy or price points but in the direct to consumer social

media world brand and comms and storytelling can win and

product design exactly in product design which is a huge part of the story and that for me was beautiful so i i uh i was straight in there to try and

invest in your company and i mean you know you know for a fact that i've been taking heights ever since

january i think yeah yeah december maybe what's your experience been as a customer then i i love it and you know

this is and this is this is where i really this is why i always also really wanted to talk to you today so there is probably

several people on a spectrum of like you know devout um vitamin takers or and then there's

people that don't understand or believe in it yeah i was that yeah and so how do you confront the skepticism because with products like

this it is hard for the user to establish cause and effect and like there's other factors that

might happen in my life that may cause an effect almost in establishable so like say i take my i

take the the heights for one week straight but in that week i have just the worst mental health week because of other

factors how do i know so i guess it yeah it's a great question i think there's two parts to this right

so one is um like supplements deserve a bad rep this is the most important thing to address

first and foremost because when i went i was like why is she giving me this like prescribed stuff i kind of just go to holland and barrow or boots and just buy

the things that she says there um it turns out there's this weird marketing thing in supplements where

you can put a minimum in so there's the amount according to science that will have an impact on your body brain whatever and then there's a marketing amount

which is way lower that you're allowed to put in on that product so if you say like vitabiotics or you know a lot of products there's an

asterisk on those boxes they're legally obliged to tell you tiny small print on the back that

what you're taking is actually a fraction of the daily amount that you're meant to have according to science but marketing wise they can say promotes

healthy this promotes healthy that um you know my favorite story on this is probably uh seven seas the biggest amiga

right because we all grew up as children our parents give us seven cs and you know that's the biggest amiga three brand in the whole entire world

now every single day according to science we're meant to have a minimum like an rda if you will

250 milligrams of omega-3s right you can get it from your food or you can get it from these pills

as a safety net it's essentially what a supplement is right is if you're not getting the food supplement not instead of don't take

supplements instead of eating they're supplements so it's like a safety net now that 250

milligrams the minimum you can put in is 45 milligrams so guess how much seven seas put into

their number one best-selling product 45 on the dot and that means you have to take seven c's for six days straight

just to get one day's worth of the scientific dose you're meant to get but it's all small print and a consumer

doesn't see that and supplements for whatever reason have been able to do that so when we went into our supplement design

right this was the awesome thing me and my business partner joel came from a tech background at this point right we've done user experience

we've done all this stuff and we are very much into this idea of because we're not from this space we're going to win because we are going to

approach this completely differently a we start with community building a newsletter and an audience asking questions to that audience about

what we should do and how we should do it and can we see how they behave so here are the things that we learn most people like a lot of people are

super open-minded about taking supplements starting supplements right the problem with supplements is it can be very difficult

to feel the impact or know they're working and so like a lot of things with prevention and well-being in general it's a commitment to the person you want

to become more so than it is like a medication which cures a problem and you're like oh that got fixed that's great that's

over so you know we got really fascinated by this idea of like how can you help

people build habits with our product design how can we overcome this problem that supplements have the you know in january massive

surge loads of people start but very few people continue if you can get past the hurdle of someone trying something your job as an

entrepreneur is to figure out how to make them a real customer not just a first-time buyer um you know

you talked about that bottle that bottle was designed with our newsletter audience by going into

people's homes and asking them very weirdly and quite often the wives show us what you do with your supplements

and everyone has these supplement cupboards because we neither of us were supplement takers before like we even started this right so we didn't know what normal behavior

was which means you get to ask these great open questions which is where you get the best answers so like everyone has a supplement

covered reason they all look the same and what happens is psychologically and we got told this

the whole time people basically open their cupboards see so many that are like broken promises at the time they promised they

were going to start and didn't continue i feel attacked yeah they feel guilty they feel guilty and they're like well i

can't just take the vitamin c because i said i'd take d i said i take that and everything else and they're always separate so people just give up and you know

there's two things to that there's one there's sort of like guilt about the promises that you were like with the person you wanted to be and then the second is just again you

know it's set and setting or you know out of sight out of mind so but

also for me it's i will complete you completely right i'll commit to what this person that i want to be which is

i'm going to develop this new healthy habit which involves me taking zinc every morning or whatever i do it for three days and if you look

at that you know famously but maybe miss attributed quote from einstein doing the same thing over and over again and insanity yeah and not

getting and getting the same results i'll take zinc for three days and because i can't see a difference

it's much like going to the gym for a lot of people although you do eventually see a difference with the gym and the great thing about when you get to the gym is you get the pump

and you use a little bit of sweat so you think something's going on when i take my zinc

nothing next day nothing no so it's almost like a belief and uh and that's i think what i've

struggled with historically so here's here's the thing so like we hear this kind of stuff with heights and we

we love this because it's like opportunity right it's like challenging opportunity that's how everyone did it well that's

dumb we're gonna do it better so like our first thing was um the number one reason most people do not continue is because they forget

out of sight out of mind so we designed a bottle that passed the wife test that wives were like yes i'd put that on my bedside

table or yes i'd have that out in my living room like you've just done right you've got your bottle there but there's no other supplements there it's because it

looks nice and because it makes you feel good because you're looking after your brain and it's there it's like virtue signaling exactly it's actually signaling to

yourself completely i'm the kind of guy that looks after myself i look after my most important organ and

this is my symbol of doing that so that was like an important first step then you know the capsules themselves

are in like patented clever capsules so you've seen like there's omega-3 on the outside the nutrients on the inside that's

important because we learned that lots of people take supplements at different times of the day ritualizing when you build a habit

is really important so if we could make these that you don't have to have them with food like you do with most supplements

because of the absorption the absorption happens because the dha omega-3 on the outside is fat

when this when this dissolves in your gut the new literally the capsule dissolves the outer capsule with the inner capsule at the same time the

nutrients have been dissolved in fat that is the same effect as what you get from food so those capsules have been designed

also around habits to help people pick a time and you know a lot of people don't eat breakfast right and so they just end up

forgetting their supplements full stop so we did it so that you can start the same time so you get ritualized like

with by having the bottle out and you see it and then the most important part which is communication

so we actually have something like a brain health score essentially it's like an algorithm put together by a couple of neuroscientist phds

and you take it before you start and again we do a 15-day check-in and then before

we send you your next month because it's a subscription through the letterbox before we send you your next month we ask you to take it again

now what happens for most people in the first month let's be real right like you just said you know

scientifically typically speaking this product will last will take three

months for you to feel anything like all supplements so it's a bit of a long game right you have to believe in

that now in the first month for you to feel an impact maybe you will because where your

nutritional levels were coming from and your mental state was coming from but maybe you won't so how can we help nudge you there well we can give you

awareness so yeah so we sent people that this brain health survey right and you know self-administering but it gives you a bit of a baseline

a score at the end of like you know where you are right now and then we start sending you coaching comms like very short emails

and snappy bits of information about how to take care of your brain that you might not have thought about things that are really small little habits that you can

build in and people start to read them they have an unbelievably high open rate because

you've just taken the first step to choosing to look after your brain so from that point on why wouldn't you

read the emails of the thing that's coaching you to do those habits and what we find is in the first 25 days or something

like 90 i think it's more than that like 93 of people have improved their brain health score on a self-administered

basis from paying attention right not from the vitamins not from anything else but suddenly

they're interacting with the brand they're and they're welcoming a brand into their life whose sole focus is about how you can take care of your

brain you've got all these really interesting very very respected people just helping to coach you on your

journey um and that is such an important part of this

because you do have the disbelief in the first couple of months right and people like to be able to see and

measure improvements and that's hard to do instantly with supplements but it isn't hard to affect

how someone feels and help encourage them to make changes in their own lifestyle that will make them feel better that is the brand's

responsibility and that's our responsibilities that's what we work quite hard on so where i'm really passionate about building this brand is

as a community it started as a newsletter community is everything to me bringing people along on this journey of brain care and

understanding why it's important you know the amount of money that we spend on skin care or hair care every day but nothing on brain care the most

important organ in our body is so completely normalized in society to have skin care

and hair care rituals and budgets in households but not for our brains and so you going

How do you find the guts to keep going despite failure?

back to the business side of things um you started grabbing yeah didn't go well yeah and you were an estimation of

it you said you know you struggled with fears of failure and it failed one i was when you were talking about imposter

syndrome and when you and and when you're talking about some sort of confidence issues around putting yourself out there

all of those things seem to sit in contrast to something else you said which is

that you're the type i think this is a not a verbatim quote but you said it earlier on you said you're the type of

person that's just going to keep starting and you know you're going to fail potentially and that seems like someone that's high confidence and very very self-assured

and is not scared at all and then the other side of you seems like someone that is

the antithesis of that so i'm wondering how you you kind of like content because i i do believe that you will

save that god forbid not that i believe in god as you know now um but you believe in forbid

yeah i believe in forbid forbid um heights doesn't go to plan um reaches its lows yeah that's another

way of saying it you will start another business at some point based around something else how do you find the guts

to keep going despite failure and i'm guessing maybe it speaks

to your motivations as to why you wanted to be an entrepreneur in the first place right i'm intrinsically motivated by

growth and learning so the way that i like to think of myself is oh someone else said this to me and i

just i thought it was so poetic and i was so impressed with her for using these words which is like a lifelong intern

um you know this was a founder she'd gone to stanford had a really successful career and then she basically coming to intern at

heights for a few months and i was like you know like i talked to you about i did that in other companies as well but it was

interesting to me to find someone else that did that and i was like i mean like you know i could learn from you rodney the other way around she's like

i'm a lifelong intern everywhere i go i'm a lifelong intern and i'm like i talk about myself as a lifelong

learner but lifelong intern was like even more powerful right i was like wow that's you know it's a real mindset towards you

know um redefining what success is yeah because as long as you're learning well

not you i as long as i am learning i am fulfilled and i think we all have this like one

thing we know to be true about ourselves right um starting a business is super hard right and you know

i'm like i say not a nutritionist not neuroscientist had no experience in the space have never launched a vertically

integrated supply chain like from three different countries our ingredients come to from 10 different countries

because we literally source the highest quality so the omega-3 comes from like canada and the blueberries come from italy like

nuts but all of that stuff it's so exciting to learn and like the

the opportunity to learn all of these things are new gets me out of bed and so the whole like

failing and starting again you know that's got nothing to do with you know confidence or lack of or

anything it's got absolutely everything to do with knowing where i'm in my uh sweet spot

there's a term that i learned years ago that sums it up so perfectly which is icky guy are you familiar with japanese

guy that's me i'm living my icky guy right now what is it guy uh so icky guys japanese term

um basically looks like a venn diagram on a venn diagram right so you're at the center and then the different aspects of things

like you know what makes you happy what makes other people happy what makes you money what makes other people fulfilled

it's like ticking off all of these things and it's like if you can find that where you are in the center and you could say

am i contributing to society yes am i waking up every morning fulfilled yes am

i mentally challenged yes it's like ticking off all of these things it's like this weird flower you should definitely check out for people watching

and listening to this podcast on youtube i will put the ikigai graph on the screen now yeah it's amazing it's

amazing and and you know and i come back to it all the time you know i had my honeymoon in japan because of uh discovering ikigai really because i'm

like so you know i'm very spiritual yeah well i had a spiritual wedding in ibiza and then i

did my my honeymoon in japan and you know it was all it was like hikes and spiritual searches and stuff and

you know there's another fantastic uh japanese proverb which is uh literally translated as fall seven

rise eight but what it means is like if you fall down seven times rise up the eighth and you you we talked about success and failure

just in that moment and you said that i think you immediately defaulted to talking about

the purpose which was you love progression sort of intellectual progression growth

and learning and it almost seems to me that one of the ways to escape from the fear of failure

if you even think about what happened at grabble the faith you describe that as a failure one of the ways to escape from the from

ever failing again is by redefining what success is redefining what failure is and it sounds

like you've almost redefined success now as growth and learning and you and you won't fail at that even if the company

goes down right so this is like it's almost like you've developed a strategy somehow not to be able to fail again because failure

now isn't losing the company it's losing your per losing your way like you did with grabling becoming someone you're not and being

extrinsically motivated and it's exactly that and you know i think the opportunity

that we all have as human beings to be creative is to certainly accept that things are not

going to go on a straight path but you know when when confronted with these

like horrible moments of like things like failure and everyone else thinking that you're a failure

blow gets softened a lot when you get to reflect and think about what you learned you know really interesting experience

that uh joel and i did after failing was we went to uh business psychologists

and we had a facilitated sessions over the course of a week with the this was your fault that was my

fault i take blame for this i blame you for that letting it all out right and then we spoke about you know what

our we did personality tests and we looked at where our crossovers were and we had like for the first time a real clear view of strengths and weaknesses gaps

and could map out some of the poor mistakes and decisions that we'd made that led to failure and

interestingly like you know rehiring in in heights this time the thing that we've had for the last

year before we had any employees was a set of company values and hiring processes and all sorts of

like interview tips and hiring docs based on our values before we hired our first person we must have had them for

nine to 12 months because we were so certain of understanding who we are and what we

stand for being the company values and that those company values lead to hiring the right

people with the right mindset and that those people are the greatest leverage you could have as a founder to do less of the stuff

yourself and enable brilliant people to take it forward um i think that's probably the one of the

most important things i've done in my life with spending time on company values with a business partner by

identifying gaps weaknesses and spending time hearing

my failings from my best friend so much of what was true um that i

demonstrated a lack of focus um i'd been overly honest right so i hadn't picked my moments he's like you

know i appreciate a very like transparent person but you know but you know he's like you know you don't have to like tell an investor to their face

that you don't buy into the business that they've given you money for like you could have a filter if things like that then

this is this this is the behavior was the most hurtful thing he said i think the most the most hurtful thing

that he said was that um you know he felt that i had um not

not contributed 50 50 right and that i had like an almost

irresponsible attitude towards what i was trying to get out of the business compared to what he

needed to get out of the business and that was a really meaningful start for us to decide on the next business too

because what he meant by that was joel is like a very intelligent person so he is motivated

by challenge if something is hard to fix right then he'll find a way to fix it

that is like he'll get up in the morning for that i won't um i'm motivated by making an impact and

feeling like i'm having a difference and telling a story and impacting people and then telling me that you know that made them feel this

way that is like all emotion for me right here's pure like logic and challenge so

by me you know constantly discrediting the work that we were doing by saying things like that right by

being too open and honest about my purpose and not putting on the filter i was literally without care or remorse

making fracturing yeah fracturing what he believes in and his ability to succeed and his ability to tell his own

story about the hard work he put in and i think all of those things were true i'd say that it was

60 40 if i was being brutal to myself 70 30 like you know the success of our last company

on him and to be honest like a lot of the failure was related to me and i personally don't regret any of it and i

really don't believe he does either but being able to say this stuff to each other with a

letter to all out that then also gave me the confidence to say like joel came up with like two or three business ideas

before like heights and we were like figuring out what we want to do i was just like no mate i'm going to do the same thing again i don't care about that thing

yeah but it's really exciting i'm like it's not to me right no one is going to have their health or

mental health impacted that i feel like that's my space that's where i want to be so really really enabled us to just you

know look at my mistakes of the past and my character and say if you want to work with me you know that i'm going to have to work

Relationships

on something i feel purposeful about that otherwise this is non-negotiable for me otherwise we'll repeat history

and you've got another partner in your life which is your uh your wife um when did you get married

what age uh well two years ago i got married two and a half years ago when did you meet her

ah well uh do you know the story at all no i don't know okay fine fine so technically speaking i met her

at 18 on the khosan road for one night uh but i didn't sleep with her uh in thailand okay um in bangkok i

didn't sleep with her but i tried to chat her up and stuff and it was a straight up no right um so she's she was best friends with my business

partner joel's sure best mate a cousin sorry so anyway the point being um that's how we met her originally and

i'd like you know sent some very awkward facebook wall messages when that was a thing like you know trying to chat

over the years it was always annoying um and then at like 30 or 31 like on my birthday um

joel basically reintroduced us and i was like i'm having a party why don't you just come etc and she's older than me right she's two

years older than me so i was a bit like you're 32 i'm 30. you're a bit too old to pick right now your mates are married i literally gave her all the banter i

was like your mates are married you're running out of options i'm still available you know let's do it you're not going to do any of that yeah

she found it hilarious anyway she did she did um come join me at drinks and like the rest is history and actually

our relationship's been super interesting because we spent the first year um not monogamous

um we spent the first year openly so we spent the first year openly communicating that we'll sleep

with other people but they were all like more like one night stands whereas we were like coming back to each other which was interesting because

she's just like hilarious really good fun really funny and so i enjoy hanging out with her but it's

very clear like you're not my girlfriend and she was like great i'm not your boyfriend no problem we did that for a whole year

why were you saying that why were you not um yeah because i like loads of reasons like one is like i'd come out of

a horrible relationship the last time where i i wasn't treated particularly nicely and i just didn't didn't make me want to get

married for sure um and i told my mom and her that i wouldn't get married incidentally um so i was like i don't

believe in marriage and i don't really believe in monogamy and like those are my beliefs i told you about this book sex at dawn i highly

recommend you read it so i had been telling myself the story that this wasn't going to happen so you were rejecting her

kind of in a way and protecting myself absolutely um and you know i think that was mutual for

whatever reason for for a year and actually after a year you know we had that awkward conversation i almost

like where she actually you know said like what are we gonna do like this is getting like a bit silly now you know i'm getting on i'm like 75 now

i need to get married um and um and so i said you know i almost said no

they there and then i said let me sleep on there and i was about to say no but then all my friends were basically like you know she's literally wicked like why

on earth would you do that to yourself like what have you got to lose and from that point of saying yes and

being in a relationship with her i proposed to her the like it's six months later and we got married a year

later so it was actually a really short relationship you're on meeting to marriage you you met when you're 33 now yeah you met her

at 30. yeah so you proposed when you were 31 yep and okay so you've been together for two

years now yeah and so i always find it super fascinating when i meet an entrepreneur that's super

busy and you know in love with their business and their ideas and and is a workaholic on to some degree how they manage to keep

their relationship balanced because i haven't figured it out yet yeah and i

i take the faces that i've gone through different sort of levels of immaturity in my life so the first phase was um meeting great

people meeting a great girl and thinking to myself you need to wrap your life around me

i'm not going to change a thing about myself i'm the most important thing in the world the world revolves around me you're welcome to

join the orbit but i'm not going to change at all didn't go well

unsurprisingly and then like trying to find a little bit of um compromise

somewhere in me um but still being ruthlessly apologetic didn't go well um and now i'm at a place where i'm

currently single completely single and i need the answers i i'm less

i don't want to be one of these [Â __Â ] [Â __Â ] narcissists that i just read about one in the newspaper i won't say any names martin sorrell um

and what i've what i read about people i think it was his ex-wife that described him was very very similar to the behavior

that i'm exhibiting which is this kind of self-centeredness that excludes everybody but ultimately

will run the risk of actually being self-harm when i make myself lonely and miserable um because i don't appreciate the value

of a relationship so i want you to help me with the answer well let me tell you i told myself the

narrative that being in a relationship i don't have time to be in a relationship right

um that's my narrative um being married and all of these things

will close opportunities down to me and my life will be worse for it um and

that's fine those are stories and like everything you know we convince ourselves of all sorts of stories and i do believe in you know finding

um not just the one but ones i really don't believe that there's one person for you in the world i believe

there's many and i think having a spiritual connection with others and you know for some people like a sexual connection

with multiple partners i think that this stuff is totally acceptable a b completely

biological like biologically scientifically more normal for us

than monogamy which is essentially because of christianity in the world

and and frankly you know even though it's not what i do with my wife currently we've had conversations about

you know in five years or in ten years right if we weren't sleeping together because we weren't finding ourselves like you know

sexually attractive or whatever at that point you know would we consider having the conversation like opening up our

relationships huh can i ask you that question yeah yeah i'm not answering it almost now

which is like yes we would we would do that and would you be comfortable with her sleeping with other men that's very different question because

uh right now no future me maybe um logically right logically if i took

emotion out of it absolutely because if i didn't want to at that point sleep with my wife it would not be fair

to deprive her of sex because of how i was feeling and so i think having a maturity towards

your relationships and to all relationships is so important and a lot of

you know what really upsets me like so many people get divorced um one of the most common reasons people

get divorced is because they cheat and you can avoid that by having a conversation like i still love you

and i still think everything i already always did think about you but for whatever reason the sexual

attraction has gone and either we are going to work on that together or we should explore other options and

like everything in life steve the most uncomfortable conversations are the ones you need to have

so i think a really smart way and i would say this because you know i'm

doing it but i think a smart way to approach your relationship is like you approach your business

so you set out a vision for your relationship and you say this is what we want to be

and where we want to be in 50 years what does that look like um you know recently

i did this with my wife we were in portugal we were with some friends i told you i was working in portugal for

a month during lockdown um we were staying in like a villa with some friends and like we'd kind of been okay in lockdown but like now she's

around other people she's being a cervix snappy like kind of [Â __Â ] we were just getting on each other's nerves and i went for like

a long walk on the coast with her and i was just like where's this coming from like five wise right why are you doing that why are you doing that but

why are you doing that right and we got kind of got to the crux of the issue um you know these are things that i'm

annoying about and what i do that irritate her and obviously like these are things you do and it's like okay let's take a break from like

right now the things that are annoying us about each other let's flip the script in 50 years what

are the things that we're going to be saying doing and believing about why we love each other what does that look like

so like literally let's imagine in the future how we are and work back from there so objective right a long happy and

fulfilling marriage so you know you might be familiar with okrs so objectives and key results

we implement them at heights as a startup but also melissa she's the um director of operations for europe

middle east and africa for vice and she put okrs into vice so we're both fan of the system right and

the system is literally this is the objective you're trying to get to these are some measurable key results that would have to happen for us to achieve the

objective so we decided to try and apply this framework to our marriage right what is the objective a long

sustainable happy and fulfilling marriage what are the key results that get us there well we broke them down into mind

body and soul right and from there you get to cascade down these key results right so

they start to say a little bit like okay so mind for me meditation is really important for her you know she doesn't really want to do

it but like from a compromise point of view because she knows that i believe in it and stuff she'll do it with me similarly you know from a mind point of

view she wants to be heard right so how about um you know we will ask each other how our days are

but systematically as a habit right we'll build it as a habit another one was you know we'll teach you some

each other something new every day so we're always growing these kinds of things literally became

a habit tracker list that we fill in in our journal every single night did i teach melissa something new today

did i um ask her how her day was did we have sex were we intimate right were we cuddling

and you know spending time did i have personal space because really important to have space away from your partner these literally become habit trackers

that if you think about it really methodically you know did we exercise for 30 minutes a day these things

if you do them you know the compound gains of the results you get in a marriage if we're literally doing these

things together if i'm asking how her day is and i'm listening if i'm

spending time like learning something new to teach her because i want to and she'll reciprocate the same

it will literally create these moments where we're not in our work and we're not doing other things we're

doing this with each other and they don't have to take very long but they are like things that we've taken personal responsibility for

to achieve it's it's people some people a certain type of person will listen to that and they'll think to themselves

how robotic how robotic and you know i had the same conversation with near il who came on this podcast yeah

and he's the king of this stuff right yeah and he talked about how he literally schedules time to be with his wife and to you know to see the kids and to play

with the kids and a certain type of person listening will think well that takes the specialness and the magic and the

spontaneity out of just like living and being you know free to go in whatever direction and it

also when you listen to that you that you start to think about how

us as humans have over this is potentially a thought over

organized and over routine and really over thought every facet of our life and one of the things that i

have a sometimes a bit of a visceral bad reaction to is like and you would have heard about

all this stuff that you know the 10 habits of highly successful entrepreneurs you got to get out of bed drink the green tea do the yoga write in

your diary do 10 star jumps then call your mum until you love her and and it gets to the point that it's one of mine to be fair

yeah every day if you listen to all of this stuff your day would literally be completely

unconscious it would be what's the next thing in my list of how to be a good human and so how do you kind of contend that

rigidness with creating space for lack of rigidness and just [Â __Â ]

seeing where the wind takes you is a great question in my experience so far this particular bit of rigidness has

created more space not less space for me interesting um and the reason is because if you

think about the opposite of this right so if you don't do some of this stuff if you don't

i mean there's so many examples that are like filling my head right now so if i don't ask my wife how her day is

regularly if i don't exercise regularly if i don't you know meditate every day this is me personally right

okay what are the outcomes of that my wife is not going to feel listened to we might end up in an argument how much not how much time does the argument take

up how much mental energy after the argument's over is going to distract me from all the other things i could do that day right

the things i wish i hadn't said like all of the things right call that day a write-off maybe a couple of days

right that takes up loads of time if i don't meditate every single day i have a very loud mind i'm much slower at

making decisions in general right so it is actually taking up more time to not build that habit in for myself but don't

go for my daily walk personally a i'm not making time to read listen and learn so therefore my

personal growth as a human being is slowing down because i really believe that you know the way that i can build a

better life for myself is funneling wisdom into myself choosing what i read and choosing who i listen to and

choosing what i believe to an extent right i love reading counter views to stuff like i'm a lefty i love

i follow loads of conservatives and right-wing republicans because it's healthy for me but i'm choosing to funnel stuff

into my life so again by not doing that i could be more aimless and more free

and i wouldn't necessarily be following the path to making better decisions as a human being which also speeds things up

if i don't call my mom every day she will call me up and ask me why i don't love her which will make me feel like [Â __Â ]

for three days so i actually find that this stuff in in my you know again not exercising you

know you don't have to ritualize half an hour five days a week like i have in my diary right but if i don't i actually start to

feel achy i start judging myself you think about these things like actually they

create time they don't take away um in my experience and that's exactly what nier said which is that

you know he's he's planning his time so that he has more time to do the things intentionally that he wants to do i my

last question on the relationship point is about bringing your problems home and how you've kind of because this is

one of the big problems i have as well is along with the like selfishness around my business being the most important

thing sometimes is how do you

not bring your problems home but then also like not make her feel lonely when she sat

right next to you by being off with the fairies and you know i was reading um elon's book the book written about

elon musk and it talked about how he would you know come home and be you know a little bit of a recluse even though everyone's around him and he's in

his head and he's just focused on his problems his life he's working incredibly hard to the point he's sleeping on the floor how have you

managed to find the balance in the relationship um is it just the okay ours is there does she unders does

she get it yeah i think i'm lucky like a she gets her and b she enjoys her personal space

and she's super busy as well and she's super busy as well right yeah exactly and we have you know she's got scale up

she's running a big company like she only reports the ceo so she's got a lot of responsibility does sometimes it go in the opposite

direction as well where you're not getting enough out of her in terms of attention no i think we're both really

lucky like we both like our own company and we both like each other's company so you know you can kind of be happy either

way if you're lucky enough to learn what you like and how to be with yourself which takes

quite a lot of learning a lot of us are very dependent on other people um and if i was still completely dependent on my wife's attention and my

wife like in general then i might be like that but i've come to learn you know how to listen to myself how to

make time for myself how to spend time enjoying being on my own as well

and i think that's a really important skill to learn because otherwise i think the answer would be true and i think you know she's got the same

which is you know i'll listen to podcasts about performance and habits and stuff and

she'll listen to case file on repeat oh my god is she a case firefighter oh man if i hear that australian pricks

absolutely one more time oh my god i've listened to every episode there's a uk one called they walk amongst her i'm obsessed with true crime

yeah so is she so obsessed well listen it doesn't work out yeah exactly exactly yeah yeah she makes me watch

true crime stuff on netflix and it freaks me out i have this really bad habit of because i can't sleep without listening to something

yeah so i'll be it'll be 2 a.m in the morning just got in bed with my partner or whoever i'm with

and i'll say do you mind if i just put on a a murder podcast yeah about like a

serial rapist yeah and then like every single i keep asking the question but the answer is always saying

steve babe it's 2 a.m i don't want to listen to a story about a serial rapist right now

while i'm closing my eyes in the dark [Â __Â ] so i i get my phone or my airpod and i put it in one ear where they can't

hear it and that's how i fall asleep yeah so she's exactly the same and she like she you know we actually i mean it's

i find it so interesting you know she will make me watch these things on netflix because she's like but it's so

interesting right but actually they really they actually quite damaged my mental health because you know you see things like you know

but that husband loved that wife so much like why does he end up killing those two daughters and his wife oh you're talking about america

yeah the most recent one but like there's you know all of them you know at the end of the day like why someone goes from you know lovely

and humane and kind and wonderful and all the things i like to believe about people in the world to that terrifies me really so it has it

has and this almost what you've just said then sent my mind back to the start of this conversation about

religion and belief and purpose and and what you know before when i was holding they're usually religious even more

terrifying yeah yeah but this the reason i find it so fascinating is because it gets to the truth in human

beings which is something that i know we're both deeply interested in which is like finding the true nature of humans and in the example we've talked

about there in america murderer that by the way because i'm such a nut i'd read that story i'd watched documentaries on

it three four five years ago so seeing on netflix and their depiction of it was fascinating but there you have

just the perfect perfect example of how um unboxable and unpredictable

human nature can be when forces like infidelity and love and um a normal person the fact that a

normal person can go from being this lovely dad who was quite placid to smothering his own children and an

affair teaches you something valuable about the nature of being human and um and for me that is like awesome

that is awesome oh and and that's why i think i'm so obsessed with those things is they teach you

the lessons in a violent emotional gripping way about the true nature of

being human yeah i mean she feels the same way whereas i'm just like you know it just plays on my mind really

it plays my mind to the idea of like well that could happen to me then that's why because i'm like i'm so kind

loving you know full of you know good energy but so was that guy in that example so was that guy so so is

every review of what that guy was like from all of his friends and everything else so how can that happen to a person and this

is the fascinating thing which for sure he met someone else clearly he was he was he was in a marriage

which had lost its passion yeah a loveless marriage he decided to stay probably for the sake of the kids he

decided comfort over a decision which he probably should have uh made a tough decision which he should have made in the short term for the long

term good and it caught up with him and for me that's like isn't that life where you suppress making a short-term tough decision but

that comes back to exactly what i was saying right which is yeah that comes back to the relation no it comes back to setting

a vision for your relationship and you know having a plan and talking about in advance right you

know if you're really smart you'll talk in advance what happens if one of us cheats what happens in this scenario right what

would happen if we fell out of love and you know there's no point like you know planning the perfect life if you

don't crisis plan the things that happen to all human beings and if you've got a great relationship

with your partner i think it's so valuable to treat it like you would your business which is scenario planning spending some time

talking about what would we do in this kind of crisis and how would we behave because by doing that with my wife like

i you know we've got permission to bring up that horrible conversation right like in theory that that would never happen to me because if i

wanted to cheat on her i'd have the conversation with her and i've got permission to have that conversation because we've talked about it

i thought you meant that like i want to murder you tonight conversation no i probably wouldn't tell

her it'd be a nice surprise um but you know what i mean isn't like you know there's permission in our

relationship to address the difficult things and that's why in some respects you know i treat my marriage like i treat my

business which is you know something that i deeply care about if it's successful

and everything that i put into my life is about making these things successful

to the best of my ability and what i've learned is doing those things from a sense of

vision and clarity and communication and values as well because you're talking about transparency and you know

honesty and exactly i i am as a when i started dating you know i was

like 18 years old whatever i thought that i was looking for i had a checklist if you said steve what's your type i'd be like okay the

brown hair the this that this they want to look like this they want to talk like this and this list was almost like it was

endless right of like little specific superficial things i was looking for in a partner and after a couple of you know bad

relationships and bad experiences and maturity and self-awareness and understanding myself i got close i was like what are the

fundamentals what are the like the unnegotiable things that i can't be without and where i'm at now and i kind of want to get your take

on this and see if it resonates at all with you is i have three things that are like fundamentals that i need

to fill so the first one i've kind of defined as they need to be intellectually stimulating to me which you can say you know

being able to have a conversation being able to um yeah like release my mind or else i'll

almost i feel like i'll get a mental um disorder if i can't release my thoughts because you know we're very

similar people in terms of our cognition the next for me is sexual attraction

i used to think it was like they they're pretty they're hot but i realize that sexual attraction is much different to

be than being pretty in the mind of the world and the third thing is um i would hope that they would make me a

better person and you i'm that's intentionally broad that could be a spiritual thing it could

be helping me become a better ceo in my business better at my podcast or whatever so those are my three things

intellectually stimulating sexually attractive and they make me a better person however you want to define

that what are yours well i have to say sexual attraction is such an important

thing to me in general but what i've learned is and you learn this a lot the more you read about relationships

that is actually something that wanes for everyone doesn't mean it will go and it doesn't

mean you won't be attracted to your wife or your husband or anything like that but it wanes and you as a human being

become less sexual the older you get right that's just biology so

i've learned not to make that one of the most important things on the basis of i wouldn't say it's the most important

thing purely on the basis of um i'm more likely to fall out of love with the

person that i'm with if one like you just said they don't intellectually challenge me

second one again like you said like they have to help me grow in some respect or certainly be with me on the journey

because in a you know in a lot of relationships including my marriage like i am the one forcing a lot

of the growth but i'm like that and i can be quite irritating to be around because like i

just always want more growth more this more that that book this podcast some people just want to chill out and that's good for me as well

right as in that is growth being pushed back and being like exactly dressed stop here you know she's the one who's like you're

doing too much you've got to stop like read this book i read an amazing book called rest by alex song yam ping i think his name

is um brilliant book much better than why we sleep and all the other ones that you would read about this stuff

and really really helped me grow by realizing recharging is such a humongous part

with that third point and like think about it it was a it was one person i was with that would stop me working yeah and she

would make me realize the value of everything else but work so she'd be like let's go to this garden

which is something steve would never usually choose to do yeah but when she took me my life was better

and so i think when people think growth they think oh like clapping at the back when you're i'm like no take me out of my world and

show me something else that'll add value to my life that i wouldn't ordinarily pursue and how much more productive you are as

a person as well when you've got space and time and you've had thoughts there's a reason why thoughts come to us in the shower or on

walks right it's because you're literally scientifically speaking your default mode network your dmn in

your brain is being activated by that moment of rest so you know it is neuroscientifically

true there's loads of studies on it but it's hard in the moment when you're people like us to take the rest and so having like you

know a partner that's there that forces it on you as a culture like you know almost every single evening now i don't do any work

which is so different to me but like last night we watched the mask together right like we will watch something like you know trashy fun

whatever but it's like not work laptop down we're eating dinner we're chilling out and it's like a rule

and you know i have to have a very good reason to break that rule and it's made me a happier healthier person but

you know without that guard rail i would just carry on working and you talked about the sexual point there i want to say a very personal

story that i've never shared before about why that made my made my list and this is a dynamic list that's changing as i mature

i met a girl that was the other two so i met a girl that was the most intellectually stimulating person i've

ever met she was actually a model so she's absolutely gorgeous she's also like a just a genius and she

she challenges me with a sense of like like she doesn't care who

i am or what i've done in my life or what i've achieved um and so that made me a better person

she was an absolute genius and she was gorgeous went to have sex with her after you know two months of you know

fumbling hot air balloons and all of this stuff i'm really hoping she isn't listening but the whole point of this podcast is

to be honest so and it just wasn't there the first time ever in my life and i experienced

what i can only describe as a feeling of like horror um total disappointment not with her or

anything like that but that that was the thing yeah and it felt like such a pathetic thing to stand

in the way of someone that i thought was perfect so and i got out of bed i tried again i tried again i tried to get over a couple

of days and i realized that it wasn't there and i got out of bed and i remember a text my best friend i said i could never see her again because this

is something that i didn't realize is actually so important to to a relationship even though it sounds pathetic when you saw

they weren't good in bed but they were perfect in every other way it sounds pathetic but it was the truth

and that's what made my list my other my other thing is sense of humor yeah so you know one of our company

values is have a sense of humility a sense of humor and humility because we jam sort of too and in the same one but

i believe so strongly in that which is work can be very serious life can be

very serious um but finding moments to connect

and laugh i mean so good for your brain but just so good for your

soul um you know spending every day with my wife in lockdown right

you know just us two etc etc like thank god we make each other laugh you know like we we have we both have a

very similar very dark sense of humor um you know one of our things is actually um

my when we fought on our first date um i brought up my dead dad and how actually one of my favorite

things to do in like social situations is to bring up my dead dad to make other people feel awkward

um just like because it's like kind of funny anyway she was like oh my god i do that about my dad and it turns out that her dad had died like a year after mine

or whatever so we um as like our second date or something we decided to go out on

father's day together without our fathers and everyone else just had their dads around we went to the hoxton hotel

and they came over they're like would you like the father's day menu we're like i know our dads are dead thanks and just literally like found it the

funniest thing that only us two would find so funny right because it's just so uncomfortable for everyone else but

to ask that kind of like dark humor like ways to connect and like weirdness that other people

it's like you're connecting on your pain as well because people [Music]

yeah and like how many of like you know comedy greats are you know coming suffering yeah not just suffering but also coming

from huge places of insecurities as well and that's their platform to bring on so i think those things all really match up

but by 100 i think you know finding someone who makes you laugh and gets your quirks so so so important

because humans are weird um i think it's lovely if you can be your fullest

weirdest self in front of other people are you happy yeah i was thinking about

Are you happy?

this question um the other day someone asked me two answers to that one yes i am happy like the the blunt

answer is yes i'm happy because i'm fulfilled the good question isn't it yeah but i know that's your body body language

yeah because because because the question that i asked back to this person was i am happy but why is happiness so

important like why is that the question you want to ask me like is it does it matter that i am happy

is it binary yeah and is it binary but like why does that matter to you and why does that matter to me

because i think a much better question is am i contributing um you know am i fulfilled

and am i contributing because if i'm doing those things i'll be happy and i know that to be true whereas for

me asking that happy is a bit like you know binary it's yeah and it's like straight to the point and it's like there's nothing really behind that it's

undefined as well undefined and also like really depends on what you're asking me that day i will be like no today i'm not happy to

if you ask me if i'm contributing to society and does that make fulfill me yeah and make me feel like

i'm living my purpose it won't matter what i feel like today are you fulfilled very but i have so

much more to do i i one of the real fascinating things that i've learned um is and i again i've read about this

at length in my book is how binary questions like that are the cause of so much pain and no one

realizes it that the cause of so much like misunderstanding pain and um and anxiety so like another great

example is if i asked you now if i said are you in love and immediately you have a bunch of

problems there first you've got to define in love no one's ever told you what that is they've never shown you it no when you

were born they didn't say okay down if you ever feel like this it's in love you've got it from instagram and movies so you over immediately have to overcome

that and then you have to try and understand if what you're feeling for this person fits into that box and and i think one of it's so crazy

that especially from what i do on instagram and putting myself out there tons of people send me their problems and usually it's because they they're

trying to fit into a binary box and they don't even realize that like steve i'm not sure if this is my passion i'm like that is a super

binary thing it either because have you found your passion that that presumes a yes or no answer

whereas if you say you're like are you feeling fulfilled it's a much more it's an answer that appreciates it's a gradient and not just a gradient but a

gradient that different things impact yeah so you know i mentioned contribution like you know

there's many ways to contribute and you know being outwardly successful or building a company or

you know you know having a high-flying career you know they don't tick that many boxes in terms of contribution a lot of contribution

comes back to what you do for society for what you do for your family for what you do for people that you care about you know

that stuff is a much broader question and it's like a cup that's

never full right so it's nice because it's got different levels and you kind of know deep down if you feel like you're living

your purpose and contributing to the level that would make you proud and you also know when you're not which is great because

again it's not bad that you're not it's just like well i could actually improve some stuff by giving it some focus and i think that's why you've got to

continue to like question the question as much as you try and answer the question sometimes are you scared of dying great

question um why is it a great question great question because um i don't believe in fear of death fear

of death is literally um like illogical because fear of death is what actually makes you

fear of life so if you're scared of dying then you approach your life in a very different

way and actually the greatest fear that we should have is not living your life in a true way so no i'm not at all

scared of dying um it's also really worth saying that like ever since doing ayahuasca like i

100 convincingly believe in things like reincarnation soul

spirits other planes all of the woo-woo crap that just like sounds completely bizarre

for me to think that i would ever say those words it's not even is it from like a scientific perspective you describe

incarnation exactly that's why i believe in reincarnation because i see it everywhere around me um so the reality is i'm not in the

slightest bit scared of death um and i think that that's uh the biggest blessing that i got from doing

ayahuasca was no fear of death um because that's a potent powerful feeling not feeling

like knowledge insight right that's categorically so quick for me to answer that question and no

um it helped me deal with the you know death of my father when my mum got cancer it helped me come to terms with

what might happen to not have her around as well this is life people die so you have to approach it

right you can't pretend that isn't going to happen it's the only thing that's guaranteed so having a philosophical understanding

of what that means to you and then how that impacts your life or maybe holds you back is a terrible thing so it's usually a

fear of death that essentially limits our life in my view i i feel the exact same and the

experience i described to you where i lost my faith in christianity at 18 was also the

exact moment where i um because up until that point i believe that there's heaven and

there's a heaven and hell and that was a [Â __Â ] terrifying thing so for the next two years i went on this search of what the answers were got obsessed with

reading about atheist books and it was actually richard dawkins that said um you can you should really fall in

love with the beauty of of the world and like the true nature of nature he talks about being able to go into a church

and crying even as an atheist because of the beauty and the wonder but also on the point of death he's one

of the questions one of the things he said was a lot of people are scared of death because it's the unknown and they and when you're religious you think it's i'm

gonna burn or i'm gonna be in this place with all these good people that sound kind of boring but when you when i got to the point

where i was agnostic or atheist or whatever you want to call it he said like how did you feel a hundred years ago was that i didn't

didn't feel anything were you scared were you were you fearful no no because i wasn't here and he said that's how

you'll feel then and then like that when i lost the the this idea that i would burn or go to

or you know go to this other place and be judged in some way it all became about now and it was as you described it was this liberating

feeling of then okay well this is it if this is it then i i you know everything is so much more special this isn't an audition

this is the [Â __Â ] show and my life completely changed and i i i i i completely agree i i asked the

question which is a strange thing to ask in like what i don't know what you really want to call this a business podcast because it's so fundamental to me and

because i think the fear of death is so deeply illogical and as you say imprisoning it's like yeah so listen we've had we could talk

for hours and hours and hours um what an amazing conversation i'm so thankful for for you for coming

Are you scared of dying?

on and sharing your insights you know it's interesting because the dan that

didn't want to do personal branding was like oh well you know i have a direct to consumer product and what's my personal brand fit

in that but the most convincing sales pitch for this product was in fact when you talked about

you it's not when you you know you know what i mean yeah and i think that i mean of course like you talking about

the struggles you've had and the agenda and motivations that went into creating

your product is the most convincing thing yeah and that's again why your personal brand and you building it and even why it's having this conversation

is so i think so incredibly important um i always finish this podcast asking one question which i'm sure

Dinner party

you've had before which is about the dinner party we're at a nice table now just imagine there was two other seats at this table who would you

bring to the table and why your arms crossed again yeah sorry i'm just getting into the serious mode like

thinking about this okay um so i think um i think to be honest

i'd want like an ancient philosopher like i'd love like you know just be so cool like marcus aurelius i would say

one big fan of meditations um you know stoic philosophy i read meditations um after my first

business fail someone bought it for me um and i read it again every year it takes like an hour to read and it's just such a great reminder of

you know yes the world is tough and yes the world is [Â __Â ] but everything is what you make of it and

really the world you're living in is all it all exists inside your own mind and once you understand that you can

control a lot of how you feel so marcus aurelius would be one and i would say the second

you know this is pathetic and i'm sorry but you know dennis bergkamp is my all-time hero

i'm laguna um and you know the man was a magician and so classy and such a authentic and

great leader in so many ways and iconic i feel though i hear huh fearful

fearful oh yeah oh the opposite of jesus he won't fly but he does walk on water

crazy when i heard that that he refused to fly yeah yeah you're right yeah yeah yeah totally correct yeah he's got a bunch of uh interesting anxieties yes i

could ask him about that maybe get marcus and well exactly and if i had a third um if you were being generous

to be honest with you okay so yeah um oprah yeah why uh

literally just think she's phenomenal yeah it felt stupid asking why yeah i mean just in every way right as

in i just it's hard to pick a thing but let's just say then because of personal growth media brand

understanding wealth and leveraging your wealth for good and storytelling i mean i could

just go on like you know her list is just ridiculous so a hundred percent oprah

um and uh oh i don't know i feel like i i feel like uh you know once the fourth

seat it's literally sitting sitting where he would be my french bulldog because he started sprinting around attacking uh

imaginary other french bulldog yeah exactly pablo um and then um i'd actually say my

fourth would be lewis hamilton um because i think what he's achieved

even before literally breaking a record like a couple of weeks ago um is so awesome and i love i'm so proud

of the fact that he's british i'm so proud of the fact like obviously even though i'm a white guy i'm so proud of the fact of what he's doing to using

his platform to take a stance actually being political with his message when he knows he has such a big

platform which is a thing that a lot of people choose not to do and choose to back out of so he's a man that stands for morals and

values secondly um he's vegan so you know i like i think it's interesting that he's chosen he's

gotten such a high performance no fail like attitude but is like as a

plant-based person clearly environmentally conscious even if he's in f1 which is obviously debatable but um he's got these like clearly deep

rooted values about how he wants uh the world to be and he is manifesting and living them in being

basically the greatest racing driver that's ever ever lived that's what he will end up as because he just beat schumacher's record

um and he seems like quite a nice bloke just in general like i just like when i

see interviews of him i just like what a relatable guy that says you know he doesn't seem like a

knob superstar at all so i would just love to the reason for him is i just love to talk to him about

mindset and focus because when you think about it that is all you're doing in an f1 car yeah that

is the in my opinion the most focused you can be is driving formula one i don't think there is any other i don't

think i don't think anything tops that so i would love to know how you achieve that kind of level of flow and focus

like week in week out nothing would be more interesting so marcus berkamp oprah and uh sounds like a

wicked dinner yeah hamilton sounds amazing listen thank you so much for your time today it's a pleasure to consider your friend

Outro

people default to massaging the ego or trying to get you know press for

being positive and and untouchable and perfect and i think you've taken a different route which is serving

a much needed uh positive service to to the world so thank you for that as well and pleasure yeah i'm sure

Introduction

i tested positive for the coronavirus and that is why you didn't hear from me last week

i said i was going to do this podcast every single monday we got off to a bit of a rocky start because during last week's podcast i

actually had the virus and i didn't know and it turns out my pa had the virus my cameraman who's over

there also had the virus my whole team around me tested positive for the virus at the same time and none of us knew

and in terms of the experience that i had with the virus i had one or two tricky days there was

one day in particular last week where i had mild flu symptoms and then i started to get this really

bizarre muscular pain in my back and i remember it being three or four a.m in the morning and i'm lying in bed

thinking how do i stop this pain in my back and i ordered um ibuprofen and i think like painkillers on

delivery which were delivered to my door at 4am and that night i remember pulling my pillows off my bed and sleeping on the

floor of my bedroom to try and straighten out my back weird symptoms to get i know um but that's the virus

the symptoms are so unpredictable and crazy my assistant lost her taste and smell which is quite a popular one

jack had a bunch of cold symptoms and things like that as well but thankfully we all recovered and that

isn't always the case and a lot of people especially people that are a little bit more vulnerable and have pre-existing conditions aren't always

that lucky but it made me reflect it made me reflect on the craziness

of the world right now isn't it nuts isn't it absolutely bonkers what's happened over these last seven or eight

months all of the lockdowns all of the restrictions the travel restrictions the the redundancies the the battles the

political battles it's absolutely crazy it's been the most crazy seven months of my life without

exception and hard times as much as they suck in the moment they

teach us important lessons and there's some lessons which i've learned more starkly than others which i

wanted to talk about today the things that i've been writing about here in my diary and i'm going to start

there this week i'm going to share one of the key lessons that i've learnt with you so without further ado i'm stephen

butler and this is the diary of a ceo i hope nobody is listening but if you are then please keep this to

yourself

okay so the first thing in my diary this week is just a lesson that i've learned because of this pandemic and because of all the

The first lesson this pandemic has taught me

restrictions and the lockdowns i've just written in my diary learn how to contrast in the right

direction let me explain what i mean you know i had this moment this week where i started really thinking about

all of the things that i miss and to be honest i keep slipping back into these thoughts you know in the uk and in the us at the

moment what we're seeing is the government start to talk about further restrictions and returning to the lockdowns that we had

in march and every time i hear these stories and i go on twitter and i see the headlines i start to reminisce

over my old life you know and i miss going to the theater i miss how fun my

weekends with my friends used to be i miss you know as a big manchester united fan i miss going to old trafford and watching my team play

i miss new york city which is where i lived before all of this craziness happened and

before they shut the borders and stopped me getting back in i miss speaking on stage i used to

travel around the world speaking to thousands of people in every corner of the globe i miss being in the office

with hundreds of our team members building the business together i miss my old life but i'm sure i'm sure that

many of you listening to this have reminisced over your old life and the things that you miss in the last few weeks and months pretty

you know unavoidably and typically when we do this in a more subconscious way

without really thinking about it we arrive at a place of sadness a place of

self-pity a place of grief at least i know i did you know and i almost honestly

this is kind of embarrassing to admit you'll understand why i think this is embarrassing now that i say it i almost started feeling sorry for

myself and this for the love of god is why you have to

interrogate your own thinking and let me just interrogate exactly what

i've just said to you about all of the things i miss and let me try and reframe all of those things through another perspective

when this global pandemic happened i was a 27 year old guy who was able to go to the theater go to

old trafford and watch my favorite team play whenever i wanted to i lived in a beautiful apartment in new york city

eating at the best restaurants in the world traveling around the world in business class getting paid to speak to thousands of people on stage whilst running a

global business that was full of my friends the thing that took me from that is a

global pandemic which has killed over a million people and it's devastated people's livelihoods it

stripped them of their generational family businesses and it's plunged them into desperation

right now many people can't even pay the bills feed their kids many people can't even

bear the thought of their future meanwhile all of my family are healthy i have work

i have freedom i can feed myself right now there are more people than ever praying for the family praying for

the health praying for the opportunities and praying for the life that i have right now and that you have

right now and then and when you start to think about it like that

it changes things and if you think about it like that you'll probably arrive at the conclusion that 2020

shouldn't make you feel sorry for yourself it should make you feel so unbelievably grateful

and this is the power of contrast when you contrast your life in the wrong direction you can make yourself

miserable like i did you know i was on the verge of wallowing in self-pity because i couldn't go to

the theater anymore because i couldn't go to old trafford and watch my because i didn't get on business class

flights and get to fly to every corner of the world even [Â __Â ] privileged [Â __Â ] like me can make the mistake

right so i can't imagine how easy it is to make this mistake for everybody else when you contrast your life

up as i was doing to the life you had back in march to someone more fortunate than you to

someone that's prettier than you on instagram or to someone that looks more successful than you from the outside you'll quickly

arrive at a place of self-pity and ungratefulness which is the quickest way to unhappiness but if you contrast your life down to

the billions and billions of people that would do anything to be in your shoes that would do anything to have the health of their sick parents back

to have a warm home to have a fridge full of food to have a secure job then you'll arrive at gratitude and

honestly gratitude in my life has been one of the best ways i've ever known to be happy the world we see

and how we see it is a direct result of contrast and the contrast games that you play every day if you

stroll through the corridor of a hospital and you peer into the the wards and you peer in and look at the different patients

what you'll see is people sick and suffering and in some cases unfortunately dying and suddenly because of that contrast

you'll feel so grateful for your good health and we i do this all the time you know i had this problem a couple years ago with one of my ears where i

woke up one day and there was this faint ringing sound in my right ear and at first i thought it was nothing i thought

it would pass but after two days my ear was still ringing i go on google i google it

comes up as something called tinnitus or tinnitus right and it and i'm reading through these forums of people saying

that they've had it for their entire lives it came out of nowhere and it ruined their lives

it stopped them from sleeping it made them depressed it stopped them from focusing it fundamentally changed their lives and

after 10 days of my ear just ringing non-stop faintly i came to terms with the fact

that i was gonna have this for the rest of my life and i couldn't stop thinking about it because when your ears always ringing

it's hard to ignore right and i couldn't sleep properly and i started to worry

and in that moment after two weeks of one of my ears ringing i can't tell you how much i

longed and wished for my normal hearing back for just normal ears for that ringing to

cease and it made me feel so ungrateful that it took an element where my ear

would just ring constantly for me to suddenly feel grateful for my eyesight my ears the fact that i can

walk that i have ten fingers that i can think and that's the way that contrasts work you know the same applies for the

technology in our lives those old nokia brick phones were the best thing ever in a world

that didn't have the iphone in it and your life right now in the midst of the pandemic in what

month are we in october is such an amazing privileged life

in a world where you can't remember your old one the one you had back in march this year taught me that the grass will

always look greener on the other side until you start watering the side that you're on right now and that's really all you can

do contrasting up is just such a deadly sin that we all need to avoid especially in moments like this

we all have to be aware conscious and mindful of how we're contrasting because the world is a crazy place and there's

no guarantee that it's not going to get crazier right and if you continue to contrast up you'll contrast

yourself into depression and despair and misery and self-pity like i nearly did like i nearly did when

i started reflecting on my old life and telling myself all of all of the things that i missed not the things that i have

having control of your contrast can fundamentally change the way you see the world and if it can change the way you

see the world it can change how you feel and if it can change how you feel then

it can change your life let's move on

I have a secret to tell you

i have a secret to tell you and this is the second point in my diary this week it's a secret that i only found out

and started to deeply understand recently when i say recently i mean the last 24 months it's a secret that i

really started to understand honestly being completely honest with you when i got rich and when i got

rich friends and those rich friends pulled back a certain curtain and allowed me to see

behind it i'd always heard about this i'd always heard that there's another curtain i heard joe rogan did a

a podcast with um kevin hart and on the podcast kevin hart talks about meeting jeff bezos and

realizing that there's this other level there's this other curtain which some people have access to

and the more wealthy that i got and the more you know wealthy people that started to to surround me i started to understand

what kevin hart meant and i started to understand what that secret is here is the secret

access to information and information itself that is the real

privilege in this world that's the thing if your rich parent gives you money

that's like them giving you a fish right but if they pull you into the family business and show you how it works

they're giving you a fishing rod money is efficient life and information is a fishing rod and only one of those things

will feed you for a lifetime and when you get to the level that i'm at now and you have access to a new level of information you're

associating with a different level of person you realize how much you didn't know before and you didn't know

because you don't know what you don't know it they are unknown unknowns and so back then i was kind of naive i

just thought i knew everything and where i'm at now i started to wonder

why no one told me this stuff the stuff i know now about wealth and finance and about how these systems work

and you start to realize why the rich get richer and why the poor stay poor information and access to

information obviously there's a ton of systemic issues which are controlling things but for me

information and access to information is the single biggest one when i made my first million i started

studying wealth right and i started studying investing in finance and i started to get really obsessed with how

i could turn the money i had into a lot more money i started speaking to more millionaires

and billionaires i started spending more time with billionaires and i got to see what i refer to to my close friends as

money games the games that they play and how they double triple and quadruple their money just by having certain information and

this is information that most of us don't have we aren't given we aren't let in we aren't allowed to see behind the curtain

and these are games that i never knew when i was broke games they didn't teach you or me in school games that really rich

people have no incentive to teach you because they're too busy playing them the people that sell money and those finance courses on

instagram they aren't rich right they're selling new courses on instagram if they knew a better way to make money they wouldn't be

spending their time selling you courses on instagram but there's another level there's another level of information

which is what i think kevin hart was referring to when he spoke about being able to peer in behind the curtain and you know i'm gonna really

disappoint you here after what was probably one of the biggest build ups that i've ever done on this podcast because i don't have enough

time in the hour or so that we have on this podcast to teach you everything that i've come to learn

and to be honest even if i did i don't think that's the most valuable thing that i could give you in

this hour that we have together today just like money is a fish right me telling you today's information is also

a bit of a fish because things change quite quickly in the world and even if i could tell you everything i knew now

about money games it would at some point expire it would very quickly change i think the

most valuable important fishing rod that i could give you in this hour is in fact a change of mindset

i think if i can get you to realize that your monetary future value and how rich you'll be in

your life is perhaps somewhat equal to the value of the information you have in your brain then maybe maybe just maybe you'll start

to value information and learning and the pursuit of knowledge even more and in the world we live in we

all have access to the to the same information pretty much but most of us still don't understand

the true value of it one of the greatest privileges i think i could ever give to my future kids

is to teach them the value of learning gaining experience acquiring information and

self-education which is something we can all do now because we all have google right we all have the internet we all have social media we will have youtube

you know you're doing it right now some of you that are watching this online i think we tend to over value short-term financial

incentives and undervalue learning opportunities which will give us that long-term value advantage

and all of the young people and even some of the slightly old people that i get a chance to mentor

this is one of the key lessons i try and teach them is to be able to spot short-term value from long-term value

you know and i'm going to go off peace just a little bit here and i'm going to tell you a bit of a personal story um that happened to me actually quite

recently uh and this is the you know this podcast is the home of the truth so make sure you do keep this to yourself i

had a a young person in their early 20s asked to come and work with me and when i say work with me

i don't mean you know in the same building as me i mean with me and because of the lockdowns and the way the world is

all of my sort of real close team are literally working with me in my home or in you know in a small um co-working

space and this was a in my opinion a fairly unique opportunity right because we're gonna be

sat together pretty much every day and they were so persistent that eventually i ended up offering them

a job and i offered them a job on the same salary the same wage that they're earning right now in their current role

and i offered them a guaranteed pay rise in 60 days time and they effectively

turned the offer down because they wanted a little bit more money now and whatever i say from this point

onwards is going to sound petty and biased and bitter i have no other way of saying it i'm just gonna be

honest with you honestly from what i know about their situation and from what i know about where they

wanted to go in their career and as impartially as i could possibly be that was a [Â __Â ] stupid decision just

just purely based on the fact that if you sit next to me or someone that's fortunate enough to have the access to the

level of information that i have access to someone that is willing to give you that information and information that's probably going to

help you fulfill the goals that you have [Â __Â ] a 2k pay rise that information can

quite literally make you a millionaire too and i've seen it make people millionaires you know much of the reason

why i'm sat here as a millionaire is because i got to sit next to people who had gone on the journey that i

wanted to go on and that's what i mean we tend to overvalue the short-term financial

incentives and undervalue the learning opportunities which will give us long-term value knowing how to make spot

the difference and knowing which is which will change your life and sometimes you have to play a long game you have to delay that

gratification you have to hold off on that 2k pay rise because the situation you're in is giving you real long-term value your long-term

future will be better if you make long-term decisions or your life will be slightly better in the

short term if you make short-term decisions but then your long-term future is compromised and that's what delaying gratification is you have to learn to do

that in your careers too i'm gonna close off this point by telling you the easiest simplest change that i've made in my

life to radically radically increase the amount of information and the amount of good quality information that i'm

exposed to one small change but before i tell you we're going to play a little game just imagine for a second that you could

pick up an imaginary phone in front of you and you could just listen in to the world's smartest minds

the world's smartest minds in in fitness in business in finance spirituality and philosophy just imagine

imagine if you could be a fly on the wall as they discuss ideas as they seek to understand the

world and as they talk about what they know and as they play their money games and enrich themselves imagine how transformative

that would be imagine how much that information would change your life it would change your health your happiness and probably your wealth

and imagine if all of that that access to information was free

it is free that's twitter that's social media that's youtube you can literally watch

and listen to the smartest people in the world think discuss and ideate so that's big the question you have to be honest

why the [Â __Â ] do you still follow jenny from 10 years ago who you do not give a f about as she publicly complains to some

customer service rep on twitter about her t-mobile data plan being expensive and slow or

kylie jenner as she publicly advertises the results of her plastic surgery and demolishes your self-esteem in the process all that

clown on facebook that tries to convince you that 5g internet the coronavirus and bill gates were all

part of some illuminati conspiracy theory why are you choosing that information why are you allowing

junk to seep into your mental diet where is that information going to take you

information is the privilege and you have to be the gatekeeper and the unapologetic defender of the

information that you consume i've said this before and in fact it's proven to be so important in my life

that i'm gonna keep saying it until i feel like you're listening to me who you follow online especially if you're

someone that spends hours of day on the internet and social media like i do is the single biggest influence on your life for the love of

god follow better and unfollow faster my trick which i'm going to give to you

is i basically mute everyone 90 of the people on my instagram are muted probably near 95

percent i just don't see their stuff i don't see their stories i don't see their posts because usually it's actually not that helpful to me

50 of the people on my twitter are muted and i'm muting people because just like you there are real world

consequences of you know unfollowing friends and people and family and things like that so i just mute them

it's a nice middle ground where they don't know and they don't need to know right and if i start talking [Â __Â ] online i

give you permission to unfollow me to please subscribe to this podcast but i give you permission to unfollow me too

and this has changed my life honestly it's the simplest thing the simplest decision that has had the single biggest impact

on my life i'm definitely smarter happier and more professionally capable because of it

so if there is a small thing that you can do now to really change the most important influence on your life it's to

go through your social media timelines and every time you see someone who isn't contributing

towards the values or the information that you want to consume boom mew but and here comes a very

important caveat you have to be careful not to unfollow or mute people just because they disagree with your opinion

a few years ago if i saw someone in my timeline that overtly supported like a different political party

or had a completely opposing opinion to mine all just like strongly disagreed with issues that i really care about

i would just unfollow them boom bye felicia and i think i did that because i didn't want to feel the frustration that

i felt when i logged in and saw their posts and tweets and also i didn't want to keep biting and arguing

and debating with them online but when you think about that decision logically it's a pretty terrible

decision all i'm doing by doing that is narrowing my world view and i'm building reinforcing this echo

chamber around me which is full of people who believe everything i already believe

and the fundamental truth that we all have to have the intellectual strength to believe

is that often there really is no right or wrong everything is really just a bunch of perspectives that's what the world is

full of very very few things are a case of right or wrong we'll probably all agree that the sky is blue

but as it relates to the way the world should be run our political opinions how people should be treated there's typically quite a lot of

variants and those perspectives that perfectly agree with yours are actually

the least valuable they're not going to challenge you or broaden your perspective or teach you anything

only the perspectives that differ from yours can do that whether they differ because they're you know a little bit more developed on your

opinions or because they disagree but it's not easy and i'd be lying to you if i pretend

that it was i've genuinely and i this is a weekly battle i've genuinely struggled to keep people on my social media timelines within my

social media bubble that say things i really disagree with and that support ideas that i despise

but i also think if i'm being completely honest with myself i'm better off because of it listen i'm

not i'm not going to let ryan on facebook tell me that 5g internet caused coronavirus but i am going to fill my social bubble

and my circle online with people who honestly disagree people who can respectfully

explain why they disagree and people who view the world differently to me

you know i i hope this is the last time that i make this point on this podcast but it just keeps coming

to the front of my mind so if you've not cleansed your social media following please do it now i really really hope

this is the last time i feel like if i can convince you to do this now today this week

it will be for some of you the greatest thing i was ever able to do for you the greatest

gift i can give you for listening to this podcast also you know turn all the unifications

off all of them but we'll save that topic for another time

Changing the shape of your brain

okay so the third point in my diary is about changing the shape of your brain you can change the shape of your brain

what a load of nonsense over the over the last couple of years i've heard a lot of people people that i respect a

lot including tom bill you who came on this podcast tell me that you can quite literally change the

shape of your brain and at first i'll be honest i thought this was potentially some you know some of that self-development

fluff and nonsense that we read a lot about you know the hocus pocus nonsense [Â __Â ] um and i

thought to myself how could you possibly change the shape and composition of your brain without having some type of evasive

surgery but i hold my hands up it turns out i was wrong and i wasn't just a little bit wrong i was really really

really really wrong over the last few months as i've gone on the journey of writing my book which is coming out called happy sexy millionaire

the unexpected truth about fulfillment love and success which you can get right now on amazon i started to develop a bit of an

obsession with neuroscience and i'm not gonna i'm not gonna go do too deep into the science because you don't necessarily

need to know that stuff but i'm to tell you about some of the things that i learned on that journey and particularly one thing that changed

my life and here it is our brains are malleable just like play-doh and our experiences

determine their shape this process is almost best compared to physical exercise where you know 30 reps today isn't going to

make you super muscular and big right but 30 reps every day for a year will and the same is true for your brain the

science says that whatever you focus your mind upon be anger or self-doubt or fear your brain will eventually

literally change in shape and i sound like i'm talking nonsense i can hear myself saying this it sounds like

some hocus-pocus magic but i promise you this is the truth and listen i'm if you know me you know

i'm just as immune to self-development nonsense and fluff as you are so i only share things with you that i think are

fundamentally true and that's supported by some kind of evidence let me give you an example if you're a compulsive

warrior the science shows that your brain will quite literally change to become a finely tuned anxiety and

worry machine you'll get your brain will become tuned for worry and i've looked through the research i've looked at before and

after pictures of brain scans of people who've overcome worry and addiction and negative thinking about themselves and other more

serious psychological conditions and honestly blew my socks off i've always believed that we are you know we are what we think

but the science shows us that we quite literally from a neurological perspective become what we think you know i read

this great piece online by this neurological expert called brian penny and he has this lab

where they've worked on being able to predict the age of your brain just by looking at it on brain scans

and your brain age is associated with increased mortality risk cognitive decline

increased risk of dementia and overall general poorer physical functioning they can

literally see how a life change that you make a decision you make in your life will change the shape of your brain over a

number of years they can see how a person that gives up x y or zed then has a completely different brain

just a few years later just like how if you stopped going to the gym or you started going to the gym you'd have a completely different body a

few years later and they've identified a number of methods just simple everyday choices and cognitive

tools that science suggests can positively change the shape of your brain i'm just going to tell you about

one of them today and it's the one that fascinated me the most it's called observation without

engagement this is basically what they call self-observation which is a pretty big part of meditation if you've

ever meditated you'll understand this and it really helps you do exactly that it involves like mindfully observing

your thoughts and your feelings and your bodily sensations the best example i can give you is you

know if i asked you to observe right now how how tense your body feels

instantly you might you know take a step back and start focusing on your sore toe or the tightness in your chest or that

headache which you didn't notice before but you can only notice when you start to observe yourself if i ask you to observe your thoughts

and your feelings you can also do that too you might start to think about the things you're worrying about or that

particular unsolved situation in your life or about your family's health because of this virus the things that are going on

subconsciously which you didn't really notice about that big decision on your future which you're procrastinating making

the point is you can take an observer's perspective on your anxious thoughts on your feelings and on your bodily sensations

you don't have to try and live inside of the problem all the time you don't have to live inside of your feelings or your emotions

and when you do this don't try and engage you're not supposed to try and fix it just observe let me give you another metaphor

which i think explains this best it's called the clouds metaphor imagine your thoughts and feelings or bodily sensations

as just clouds that are floating through the sky and sometimes those clouds are dark sometimes they're angry sometimes it's you know raining

and sometimes they're light and sometimes they're calm and thin but you're not the clouds you're the

blue sky who just observes the clouds as they're passing without engaging in them you simply observe and you let them pass you by and

as the 20-something ceo of a big company who knows that every time i look at my emails and my whatsapp in the

morning there's gonna be a ton of unpredictable yet unfortunately inevitable [Â __Â ] not just small

[Â __Â ] severe [Â __Â ] i'm talking ruin your day [Â __Â ] [Â __Â ] that can rear its head from any corner or person

in a global business of 700 people as as that guy this mechanism has quite literally saved

me i really really believe that and from my conversations with dom who's my business partner who's been with me this whole time you know which i

had on this podcast in chapter 10 where he described that running the business made him an alcoholic made him anxious

and made him experience some pretty severe mental health problems i genuinely believe

that this this technique was the fundamental difference between me and him self-observation which is something that

for some reason i've always defaulted to we both had the same intense stressful experience over the last 10 years

but in his words i survived it and he nearly didn't he said right and this is a horrible

thing for me to talk about he said he considered jumping in front of a train and killing himself because things at one point were so

almost unbearable and the difference is here it's in your mind and the mechanisms you rely on to

deal with your portion of unpredictable life [Â __Â ] which is coming your way whether you like it or not i've said in this podcast before that i

viewed the hardest moments in my life as as really a video game i naturally and

again i don't want to take too much credit for this because it's not something that i did consciously i naturally adopted this strange

video game mindset where i would almost see the situation i was in like a game of chess like i was removed

from it when things got really really hard i told myself without thinking about it that this was all just a game yeah like

a like a game of chess and i'm not the pieces on the chessboard because they can be killed i'm the

person responsible for moving the pieces and whatever happens i'll be fine just

like you know like a game of call of duty i'm not the character in the screen running with the gun

the one at danger of standing on a land mine i'm the person holding the controller sat at home and even if i stand on a land mine or

two that's fine i can just restart and rejuvenate and you know go again

and for me this perspective which is very similar to what i've described with this self-observation

was the most liberating thing in my whole career it allowed me to develop my own calm within any form of chaos and it

allowed me to think clearly without being clouded by emotion and if you're a ceo if you're running a business

that's so incredibly important and i genuinely also think that my business partner don was inside the game

he was the pawn on the chessboard he was the soldier running through the battlefield in the call of duty he was taking

the enemy fire so he internalized that pain he internalized the stress and he became the conflict

and honestly nobody can survive that nobody not even me but fortunately for whatever reason i

was removing myself and that helped self-observation isn't just handy for

increasing your like self-awareness it genuinely provides you with a sense of detachment in the most challenging situations you'll find

yourself in instead of being controlled by the situation and the thoughts that come with the situation

and all of those feelings it gave you gives you this ability to hold out in front of you to observe it

and to let it come and to let it go without impacting you too much and the brain research they've done on

this topic completely supports this they've studied the part of your brain that becomes active

when you're drifting from thought to thought and overthinking and worrying and they've seen clearly how this can

have a detrimental impact on your personal well-being and over a number of years the shape of

your brain they've then also observed how that attachment which you can achieve from self-observation and that video game

mindset where you become the sky not the clouds can quiet that part of your brain

and there's one particular study that shows that people who meditate have reduced activity in that part of their brain versus

people that don't meditate and listen when we talk about meditation i was a bit of a skeptic on the whole topic meditation doesn't have to be sitting

with your legs crossed humming to yourself right it can literally just be taking a few minutes out to relax

and pause and for me meditation is usually in the form of a massage it's the time where

i can stop i can pause and i can detach and that for me is crucial crucial

crucial for everybody no matter what walk of life you're in you have to find your paws

and listen this isn't going to stop you getting anxious or worried or stressed but learning the habit of self-observation

and that video game mindset and becoming the sky as i'll call it will allow your problems to come go and

limit the impact they have on you without having to always engage in them and therefore making them worse than they have to be

without making a mountain out of what could have just been a molehill

for the next point in my diary i've just written less answers and more questions you know so much of the the

Less answers and more questions

self-development career progression advice that i got when i was younger told me to speak up more

you know make sure i'm heard and to get my point across whenever i can and i'm telling you the older i've got and the further i've

traveled in the business world the more i've learned that that's really shitty advice in the real world it's

impressive to know an answer of course but it's also impressive to admit that you don't it's impressive to say and to have the

sense of yourself to say i don't know to say you're probably right to say

that's not my area of expertise to say i don't know but i'm going to find out or just to remain silent the least

impressive thing you can do is speak for the sake of speaking we all know people like this and they typically do that because they are insecure

and because they think if they have nothing to say then they're not very valuable we all have this contribution reputation

let me call it a contribution score you won't know what your contribution score is but you'll probably know the score of the people around you the

people in your friendship groups and in your family you'll know that person within your friendship group or a colleague at work

that just seems to speak for the sake of speaking and most of the time when they add something to the

conversation people kind of like roll their eyes and you know and they think to themselves that was a really dumb thing to say

and it gets to the point that before they speak everyone in the room presumes it's going to be something dumb again or

weird or unhelpful or irrelevant i think you'll know that person and that is because their contribution

score is low that is what a contribution score is it really really matters because if you

constantly speak for the sake of speaking or you you know you speak when you're not informed on a topic

people will gradually stop listening to you they will receive your id ideas with a pre-conceived bias

that you're probably going to say something that doesn't matter and so your ideas suffer even if they're good because of that

preconceived bias and that preconceived opinion of what you have to say so even when you do have something valuable to add

everybody will disregard it they'll pre-devalue it before it's even come out of your mouth and that's because just like a credit

score we all have a contribution score and in that case it's because you've ruined yours by always feeling the need

to chime in even when you don't know what you're talking about even when you shouldn't if you don't know the answer to

something at least know the value of admitting that you don't or staying quiet as someone that's you

know had the pleasure and sometimes displeasure of working in boardrooms and in creative brainstorms and in intense investor meetings with

big personalities and sometimes competitive personalities for the last decade i've seen how someone you know can ruin their contribution

score by constantly feeling the need to say something or add something when they don't know the answer and when this isn't their field of

expertise and i've also seen the opposite i've seen people who will sit and listen humbly and just observe and

often learn and the people that walk out of the room with their respect and contribution score intact to always

those that are secure enough to admit that they don't know and to in many cases stay quiet and the ones that lose respect

are those that try and pretend they know something that isn't in their field of expertise or that they know something about

usually because they're insecure and this is why as a general rule for life it's always better to have more questions than you have answers and to

be able to admit when you don't have the answers your contribution score really really matters and i think you come to learn that the

further you go in your career it's the thing that for me made investors believe me you know this this notion i think they

have in their head which is when stephen speaks it's probably something informed and something worth listening to

it's the things that you know makes employees trust you as a ceo it's a thing that as a colleague earns

respect and ultimately if you have the humility to learn to listen in areas that are outside your expertise

it'll be the thing that expands your knowledge and again that that will change your life

What are some of the most important questions you can ask yourself?

and this brings me to the next point in my diary and i've written in my diary what are some of the most important questions

i ask myself regularly and i when i say this i mean in all areas of my life if it's more important to know the right

question to ask them to have the answer what are the questions that you should ask yourself every single day

and um the first one in my diary is which part of this situation can i

control you know as a ceo but just as a human being that's living life like we all are there are so many times where i

encounter a situation of conflict or stress or chaos um and i'm desperate to fix it and i

start committing energy to trying to solve the problem usually and this is something that i've come to

learn there's really only like three or four things that i can control in this situation and if i know what those things are i

can invest my energy in those levers in pulling those levers and that gives me the best chance of

getting out of the situation it also is a great tool for liberating yourself from all of the stress

of worrying about things that are completely outside of your control and that you can do nothing about and i've done this over the last two

years in particular where i will hone in and i will sometimes even write in my diary the two or three things in the

situation i'm in now that i that i can control gives me that clarity it liberates me from stress and it focuses me

on the things that will actually help me get out of the situation i'm in and the second question which i

ask myself religiously at least once a day and is actually held as a permanent point on my to-do list

is what am i avoiding right now this is something that i i dare you to try and ask yourself every

day because for me understanding what i'm avoiding helps me overcome it and as near ielts said on

this podcast we are creatures that seek to avoid discomfort so there's nearly always a reason

why i'm procrastinating or avoiding something and if i can become conscious about that thing and the

psychological discomfort that's making me avoid it it helps me to overcome it and usually the things we

avoid are actually really really important and that's part of the reason they're causing us discomfort so that's a

question that i recommend everybody asks themselves every day make a list of the things you want to ask yourself the first is what part of this

situation can i control and the second is what am i avoiding the third is what would my idols think about

this decision and this is a question which i religiously ask myself when i'm facing a big life choice because i think we all

understand the values and the principles that our idols lived by we study you know we study their lives we

read their books their podcasts whatever we understand the way that they think but when we're in a situation when we're

facing a big decision sometimes we kind of relapse back to our own innate fear-driven

decision-making mechanisms and we lose sight of how our idols the people we want to be like

would make that decision so every time i make a big life decision i almost like interrogate

it against what i know that my idols would do because my idols are my idols

because they have values that i admire and so if i can kind of sense check my own decision-making

against what i think they would do which is sometimes easier than knowing the right thing to do i tend to make a better decision

and the next question i religiously ask myself is what would future steve think of this decision and this question is super handy to ask

yourself whenever you can because future you is going to pay the price for the decisions you make today

so future you is quite a selfish person they want to be they want to have a six-pack they want to be super smart they want to be rich

and that is almost all of our north star our future self and so if you ask yourself genuinely ask

yourself the question what would future steve the happiest version the best version of me

think about this decision i'm about to make to eat this entire double pizza to myself

usually that allows you to see if this decision you're about to make is in line with your values

and the next question that i like to ask myself regularly is if i'm saying yes to this thing then

what am i saying no to i think it was steve jobs who once said that it's only by saying no to things

that you can concentrate on what's important in your life and i love this line because it really helped me to realize the potency of that

question be it in our relationships or our career or in our health or in our mental health um i think it's important and i think we

need to reflect on what we hold most dear now in this moment in order to live a life and to attain a future

that is in line with our values and we need to become aware of how a yes decision is going to prevent us from doing other things

that we also consider to be relatively important it's a question that appreciates that you can't do everything and be

everything and that life is about prioritization prioritizing the things that are most important and so before i say yes to

something i like to consider all of the things that i'm saying no to as a consequence

of that yes it helps me to make better decisions today and it's a sign a signal and a nod

to how much i respect the limited amount of time i have and the last question which i've written

in my diary that i ask myself religiously is a much more direct question which is

does this thing align with my values you know people often make decisions that don't align with their values i know that i do

it every day and there are tons of reasons people do this you know they uh they binge on alcohol

they they smoke 20 cigarettes a day they have big mac you can't have a big mac pizza

they have big mac burgers and domino's pizzas religiously even though they know that their future values of health and being

around to see their kids grow up and those kinds of things are in conflict with those short-term detrimental actions

and often we do this because we don't stop to ask ourselves this simple

question and we don't really stop to think about this simple question which is how does this short-term decision

align with my long-term values next time you're doing something and it doesn't feel quite right and it

feels a little bit naughty ask yourself how it's serving what you value most in life and that

having you know the obsession i have now with continually cross-checking

the decisions i'm about to make versus the person i want to be or the life i want to attain

has been transformative for me honestly it's really really changed my life and i'm going to throw in a bonus question i did say that was the last one

but i'm going to give you a bonus question which i've just i've just been thinking about it's a little bit cliche but i promise you it's

helped me overcome you know some of the most fearful moments of my life the question is what's the worst that

will happen if i attempt this and i remember being really really young 16 years old when someone first asked me to speak on stage

and then 17 and then 18 and then the stage is getting bigger and the audience is getting bigger i remember one day

speaking in barcelona in front of about 10 000 people and being stood backstage and starting to feel a little bit of that

anxiety which we all feel and i i for some reason just like the video game mindset which i've talked

about in this podcast i default to asking myself what is the worst thing that can happen

and i don't just ask myself that question in the cliche way that friend might turn to you and say i genuinely run through the process of

what you know what is the worst thing that can happen i could walk up on stage and as i'm walking on stage

i trip on the first step i fall i smash my face my trousers come down people see my

underwear and my you know my willy and i walk up on stage and then i deliver the worst speech in my life

and people start walking out and throwing stuff at me and i walk off stage and and to be honest it's nearly always the

case that the worst thing that can happen isn't actually as bad as you think we tend to you know before we

confront it and rationalize it that way and look at it in that way we tend to i guess think it's death i

think i think we think we're gonna die and everyone's gonna hate us and and then you ask yourself this sub question which is if the worst thing

that i think could happen happens what is the long-term impact of that on my life

and even if i fell on the step hit my you know hit my eye walked on stage with a bleeding eye and then did the worst speech of my life

it doesn't actually have any long-term impact on my life okay i wouldn't get booked to speak there again but the

the material long-term impact of my life is pretty much nil and so it doesn't make sense to be

fearful because the worst possible outcome has no long long-term impact on your life

and for me that's the question that i really hold dear and it's a question that i still turn to in moments of intense pressure and fear

um fear of failure and i think it's a question that can change your life if you're a very fearful person those

are my questions and i i am i think it's important to have questions and be armed with questions because as i

say in life it turns out that having the questions is much more important than having all the answers

The thing that invalided you when you were younger, will be the thing you seek validation from as an adult

okay so the last point in my diary this week is it's just a sentence and i'm going to read that sentence to you the thing that invalidates you when

you're younger will be the things you seek validation from when you're an adult and this is um this is something that it really took me

about 30 years the 28 years i've been alive to learn um when i was younger as a lot of you will know if you've listened to this

podcast before i came from a background in a family that didn't have a whole lot of

money right we were pretty much bankrupt for my whole um my whole childhood at least the last

part of my my my time living at home we lived in a house that was beat up um the window on the front of our house

was smashed for a good decade so you know you'd get the draught coming in from outside we live my back garden

the grass in the background is about six foot high and there are fridges and tv sets and all kinds of nonsense in

there in fact the back half of my house was actually knocked down because i think at one point my mom thought we had

the money to do a renovation but we didn't have the money so they just the builders just knocked the house down and just left it as a derelict

house so one of the the doors you know which used to go into one of the rooms was actually would just actually take

you outside and we just removed the handle so that no one could really break into our house the front of our house was the same we

had you know the grass was you know a good meter and a half high at times and it was fairly embarrassing um growing up as a

black kid in an all-white school who already felt a little bit different with my curly hair knowing that our

house also looked so marked you know remarkably different and that my life was remarkably different

from a financial perspective we didn't have um christmases and birthdays by the time i was about 10 10 11 years old because

of the financial situation we're in and i know that it created a real deep insecurity within me i remember

christmas days sat in my brother kevin's room on the floor as we joked about the things we were going to pretend we got for

christmas you know like and i have to make i have to to bring context to this right like i know now as

an adult that this was a terribly naive selfish immature way to think

i know now that i should have been looking at all the things i did have which was a loving family two parents that were together and loved

me a roof over my head food on the table i know now that those were the important things but back then

when you're a young little kid who doesn't really understand the world you feel sorry for yourself you engage in self-pity and i did and i

would go to school embarrassed and i would go to school and lie about our financial situation and it

made me insecure it invalidated me you know it was one of the the biggest worries or you know

insecurities i had as a kid and so at 14 years old i started to really really value money money for me

just felt so important the lack of money we had in our life was the reason that i had so much shame it

was the reason that my mum and dad would scream at each other so much about our house and about our finances and

about christmas and about all of these other things and money was the problem so i grew up thinking

and pretty obsessed with attaining money or if i went to university at 18 years old dropped out started a business to try and make loads of money

and then when i finally got money set 21 22 years old i had a really unhealthy relationship

with it and i went to nightclubs and i spent i think one year like 50 60 000 pounds on champagne in a nightclub

at 22 23 years old just to try and impress people and then i went out to the countryside and bought

this seven bedroom mansion with a tennis court at the bottom of the garden and two living rooms and an outhouse and

big gates and a 100 meter driveway just to try and impress people and this

is this is a force in our lives which will ruin our lives if we don't understand it and the thing

that i came to learn after literally like 25 years and after being a puppet you know the

puppet master being this thing that happened to me as a kid after being a puppet that didn't know why he was doing what he was doing but

was just buying these tables and nightclubs and buying material things and trying to show off to people

i came to learn that the thing that invalidated me when i was younger had become the thing that i sought

validation from as an adult and that will be true for you no matter what it is no matter if it's romantic affection no

matter if it's validation no matter if it's money no matter what it is the thing that invalidated you

when you were younger will be this the thing that you seek validation from as an adult and until

you understand what that thing is it risks being the number one thing that can ruin your life i've like gone

through every like corner of my childhood to try and understand the things that made me

feel invalid in order to understand some of the forces that are in play in my life right now as an adult and

honestly it has liberated me i wrote in my diary one day the reasons i'll go broke

and it was pretty much this it was because i was broke when i was a kid and because that

developed a really you know psychological issue with money where money for me became

a plaster it became the thing that would make me feel the opposite to whatever shame is

and i just think it's so important for everyone to to think about the things that happened when they were young

and to understand the forces that invalidated them because if you don't understand them and if you can't make them conscious and

hold them out in front of you and examine them they will control your life subconsciously somewhere

and honestly i've got to be honest do i think i'll ever really overcome this unhealthy relationship i

had with money i don't think i'll ever truly overcome it completely because it is so deeply hard-wired into

me at a time in my life when i was so impressionable and when every emotion

just seemed to cut more and carve into me but that's not really my aim my aim

isn't to overcome it my aim is to become conscious of it and if i can become conscious of it it

has less impact over me and fortunately where i'm at in my life now i don't make those stupid dumb decisions all of the

time sometimes i make dumb decisions like i'm not gonna pretend i'm some [Â __Â ] like profit that you know lives their life

perfectly and always makes decisions that are in line with their values sometimes i do things to impress people

but it's like 99 less than i used to and that's because i'm holding out

my sort of psychological relationship with money in front of me and i'm able to look at it and i'm able

to question myself and interrogate my decisions against this known flaw that i have in my psychology steve

why are you trying to buy a rolls royce you don't really like rolls royces you don't know anything about them because you think oh yeah

because you think it's going to impress somebody because you think somewhere deep inside

of you that child that had nothing will feel more fulfilled if he has that range rover or

that rolls royce or that mansion and whenever i go to make these big

decisions now it's the first thing i think of so i

don't think i've overcome it but i've definitely been able to understand it and if you can understand

it if you can understand the thing that invalidated you and your kid that's as good as overcoming it and that

will help you stop seeking validation from it as an adult

and that that will change your life


summary:
**Introduction** The speaker reflects on his recent experience with the coronavirus, revealing that he and his entire team, including his personal assistant and cameraman, tested positive without initially realizing it. Despite a rough patch with mild flu symptoms and unexpected muscular pain, the speaker recounts managing the situation by ordering painkillers and resorting to sleeping on the floor to alleviate back pain. The unpredictable and varied nature of the virus's symptoms is highlighted, with team members experiencing different issues like loss of taste and smell or cold symptoms. Thankfully, the team recovered, leading the speaker to contemplate the global upheaval caused by the pandemic, including lockdowns, travel restrictions, and economic and political turmoil. He acknowledges the lessons learned during these hard times and aims to share a key lesson in this podcast episode.

**The First Lesson This Pandemic Taught Me** The speaker discusses the importance of contrast and perspective.
