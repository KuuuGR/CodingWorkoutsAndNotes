Transcription:

oh my god eddie hearn what a guy there's very few people no
i'm gonna change that i've never met someone as neurotically obsessed with success
and with winning and with accomplishing things and with living a life in constant forward motion
as my next guest eddie hearn and it's remarkable because when you unpack the reasons for that
obsession and that dedication to being more and achieving more there's quite a fragile vulnerable
insecure story that's something i've noticed with a lot of my guests
and it often makes me think that the most successful amongst us aren't necessarily choosing to be
something's happened to them that's left them with no choice eddie han is one of the most notorious
sports promoters in the world he's the king of boxing in this country he is known for his no context and twitter
page which i'm sure a lot of you have seen but what i wanted to do when i sat down with eddie herm was to get
underneath to get underneath the external sort of braggadocious loud
promoter side of him and to find out even in the case of someone like eddie who is loud who is
successful who is ambitious who is a promoter are the same things true for him that
are true for you the insecurities the vulnerabilities the mental health issues
and how much does he really understand himself my conversation with eddie was incredibly enlightening but it also
wasn't that surprising so without further ado i'm stephen bartlett and this is the diary of a ceo
i hope nobody is listening but if you are then please keep this to yourself
What made you so relentless
you've done a ton of interviews especially over the last couple of weeks and there's this really consistent theme
that i felt in all of the interviews i watched i watched you at cambridge the high performance podcast loads of them and um and then before we came
uh started filming today i had a chat with frank and he fully grasped on you know what he
said to me which i which was also consistent with these interviews is that you are relentless and he was
telling me he's he's had some um i probably shouldn't say this but he was telling me he's i've started having this uh is it
night owl or night night because eddie will text me in the middle of the night and he went i'll tell you one thing
about eddie he is relentless you're what 40 41. 41 years old what's made you
that relentless at 41 years old to the point where you're you're uh pestering your colleagues at 3am in
the morning i don't know really um i think when i when i did the book it was like it was quite a good um sort of
counseling session with myself because i wasn't really great at school i wasn't particularly a
hard worker at school i loved the pound note always and when i wrote the book it just i
started writing about my childhood and what it was like growing up and how i
was molded and i think a lot of it comes down to the fact that i love to win and i'm a why did you love to win i
don't know because with my dad that's what we did so when we played cricket when we played
football when we played table tennis when we sparred with each other it was like for me growing up
you weren't you know i would come back from a match say i played cricket and he would go to me and actually my mum was
the same and he would say to me how many runs you get today son and i would say ah four ah useless come on
next time knock in a fifty right it was never oh well well done son you know you took
part that's what really matters that they taught me taking part is completely and utterly
irrelevant you win and ultimately sport is how i was brought up i was brought up on the
foundations of sport the lessons of sport the winning the losing you know the highs the lows but always
taught that winning was everything so i i'm a failed athlete you know i think any kid growing up would love to
be a sportsman now i played qriket at a very good level but i was never good enough for anything so
this is the next best thing but i think if you're not trying to win in life and win winning
it means something different to everybody success means something different to everybody some people view success as being able
to get their pay packet on a weekend you know be able to you know spend time with her family
and have enough food on the you know make enough money to have food on the table and make sure everything's okay at
home and and be happy you know and have a happy life with no no stress or no drama that's success to
a lot of people but people's interpretation of success is very different and you know for me i i still don't know why
i i i do i know i know why i do this but
like you say i love it i guess that's what it comes down to a passion for what you do and i don't know what the passion is is
it the passion that i love the sport of boxing is it the passion that i want to succeed against you know and
be bigger than my dad i think that's a big part of it as well or is it just that i love to win or is it that i'm a bit sick in the head maybe
all of them the sick and the head point i want to play with that idea a little bit um i write i i write in my book actually
we have the same publisher i wrote in my book that the thing that invalidates you when you're younger becomes the thing you seek validation
from when you're older and what i meant by that is like in my childhood because we didn't have money um and i
was this black kid in a school of 1500 white kids everything that we didn't have became the things that i chased when i was
older or the thing that made me feel somewhat invalid sometimes when i was a kid like you were saying about your dad saying well you lost today became the
thing that i would seek validation from as as a as an adult and i wondered if that resonated with you at all i mean like
well i had a different background i mean my dad was poor became rich and i was born so
i've said before it's not like when you talk about generational wealth we didn't have generational wealth
um i had a dad who was from dagenham was from a council estate his dad was a
bus driver and then i grew up in this sort of nouveau world where this bloke
had made his money and he was you know i take the mickey out of him i suppose he was a bit of a chav you know he was like from dagnam and all
of a sudden he's got ferraris and big cars and we used to have a white limo and a black limo
that would drive like the snooker players around and the fighters around and i was horrible i was obnoxious imagine like
a 14 15 year old kid hanging around with eubank and naz and then you're in the limo with your mates going up to london
or to romford for a night out i mean i'll look back and just cringe but mine was different you know and and
i guess when it comes down to it and you know again from the book and speaking and speaking to people like frank lampard he
went to my school um he was in the year above me at my school i was barry hern's son and frank lampard was
frank lampard's son you know his dad played for west ham he was and it's a different kind of drive
if you can make it flow in the right way you know when you're talking about sort of mindset and and and hustle
where all of a sudden i think so many people with successful parents
end up just doing okay you know but how do you go beyond that how do you
outperform everything that he done and i will and i feel like i've done that in many ways but i will never be able to outperform
the fact that he came from nothing my friends uh my friend is in a very similar position you if i said my
friend's name you'd know the guy okay his dad is a multi-billionaire i know you know him because i've seen you with him before actually in new york
but um his dad is a multi-billionaire and he grew up with living in the shadow and his dad was the same and i had a
conversation with him and he said um it was all i was always trying to be better than my dad he is now
a billionaire himself of his own doing um but it's just it's fascinating that and
he's that dad sounds very similar to what your dad sounds where his dad was tough on him tough on him i think they're tough on
you because they don't want you to be that spoiled kid i mean you always want to
um spoil your kids you know you want to give them the great even now you know i've got two daughters i love to spoil i work hard so i can
give them a great life but i just want them to understand manners respect and discipline these are the
three most important things and he would make sure that i would understand that even by having me working
you know giving me a clout every now and again you know trying to keep because i it must have been frustrating for him
because i was probably all the things that he resented when he was growing up and the
rich kid oh with with parents who had got big house and cars and
and i would have hated me at school you know but he would have looked at me and that's why he was so disciplined with me and you know i was
in his slipstream growing up so i would sit you know we're here now that's that was my house over there
so he would get home from work if he was in the country you know he would always go out and give me a game of football cricket
and then he would go in the office all night on the phone and i would have dinner and i would just sit in the office you know i might have a ball just
throwing up in the air but i would some subconsciously listen to the arguments and you know him losing his temper and and
just listen not because i wanted to learn just because i was there and you're talking there about the
The sacrifices in-order to be successful
sacrifice of his success which is one of them as you've highlighted is less time with
your family you are relentless um everybody says that what is the the cost of being a
relentless person you have to be incredibly selfish you have to you know for me family is the most
important thing but i have to be brutally honest and say i don't let even family get in the way
of things that i have to do you know and that that can make you an [ __ ] and it can make you sound
terrible but i just don't know any way around it there is no way you can be the perfect husband
or the perfect father and run a successful business or you know be a you know
a relentless operator it's impossible because i know because i try to balance both but when you're flying
back from america from a show and you land at seven o'clock in the morning and then you go to manchester for a press conference
and you come home and you just make it to pick them up from school and then you get back and they say dad let's go over the park and
you're just absolutely on empty and your phone's going and you're trying to do another deal and
you know you're pushing the swing and you're going like this trying to send a message at the same time it's impossible you know listen i know
because sometimes my eldest daughter is old enough to say dad please get off the phone
and that's that kills me because that's uh that's bad to hear you know i'm like okay okay but then for 30 seconds later
i'm back just haven't looked down because it's a lifestyle you know and it's impossible to be great
at anything without making sacrifices you know it doesn't matter if you're a fighter if you're a sports when you speak to old
successful people you can't be everything it's impossible you know and and but what you don't want
to do is you don't want to disregard your obligations your family obligations because they are extremely important
but you also need a wife or a partner who's understanding enough to say this is what i know what he's like he
won't stop and that's why when frank talks about the 3 a.m 4 a.m that's because a lot of the time
i'm sort of making up for the hour or two that i've lost out playing with the kids so i'll put them to sleep they'll go to
sleep at nine half nine you know chill out with a wife for an hour she'll go to sleep and then
i'm up and now with the growth in america it means that at 4 p.m 5 p.m the west coast wakes up so i can't
go to bed i can't disappear when it gets to 11 a.m or on the west coast or or midday on
the west coast because they want to speak to me and we want to do business i am much earlier in my career maybe 15
years earlier in my career and um i've struggled with romantic love for the very same reason that for the
last decade i've like slept in the office multiple weekends i've been obsessed um i would
basically sacrifice everything and there became this moment in my life where i think it was maybe the day that
someone tried to buy the company and i thought about what i'd spend it on and i remember going home and i swear on
my mother's life i went on right move and auto trader at the same i had two tabs open and i'm like the lamborghini tinder no
no no no no that's that that always follows the lamborghini so i was looking at this lamborghini in this mansion the
countryside and then i thought if i buy these things i'm trading like this purpose i have this job this you know
for for this lamborghini and this mansion and it felt really really empty and then i thought
that steve you know when you were 18 and you were broke and you had no money 18 year old steve said wrote in your diary that's why it's
called the diversity that you wanted the sports car the million before you were 25. this was what we did it for
and then it threw my head into this like confusion it's like if if it's not that if that's gonna make me feel empty
they call it like um gold medal depression where michael phelps won all the medals and then got depressed um then what's it all for and and then i
thought and then also when does it all end like when does it end well it doesn't end because and actually
you you're always searching this is this is a problem and something you have to be careful of because when you are trying to succeed
and when you're trying to become great actually the great people they never feel content with achievement
and i'm very much like that frank lampard again going back to him he said that when he won the champions league she always dreamed to win in the
champions league and he stood there with a trophy and he felt nothing i mean he felt happy
but definitely not content definitely not i've cracked it that might go back to the sickness you
know that we talked about earlier and when we talk about sickness i mean not probably not medically sick but sick in
the head a little bit to a point where i get it all the time you know we say that you know we wanted to do
you know when aj turned pro we wanted him to be the world heavyweight champion you know he won that great we was in the
ring after jumping up and down as soon as we got out of the ring the ma yeah and then it's like okay we
want to do something you know we've got the klitschko fight okay you go through it 90 000 at wembley you stand there everyone that
was at the event tells you it's a great sporting occasion they've ever been to how do you know uh at the time
amazing in the ring amazing you know and then not even the day after it's i i never i
never go out really and i never drink really after a show because that's probably you know
depressed is the wrong word but you i go back you know i finish the media obligations two three o'clock in the morning go back
to the hotel and that is when i'll sit there get into bed and then obviously you can't sleep because the buzz and the
adrenaline and that's when you just feel a little bit low and empty is that okay
it's over same with what you talk about with phelps it's the highs versus the lows you can't just
experience the highs and then be happy with the lows so you want more and more and more and more and i
i'm my i'm my own biggest critic and i'm also very pessimistic which is strange to a lot of people but
i kind of use it to play tricks on myself to keep myself driven so when i do something or when i plan
something i always say to myself there's going to be problems i think it's going to go wrong i doubt this will
happen you know i don't know why i do it but it just helps me to battle away to overcome everything to get to the place
and then when i achieve something which others might think is great i say to myself that's nothing you've
got a long way to go because i'm scared of sitting back you know with the the cigar on the beach
again i've cracked it you can't touch me you know and we got to a position with uk boxing where
you know we are virtually untouchable but i just don't want to be that guy who takes the foot off the gas i want to
bang every single nail in the coffin you know and then move on to another market and another market another market
but you do get the worry with that mindset is you may look back when you're 80 or 90
and go wow you know look at everything you've done you never really enjoyed it did you i mean i love what i do
but you probably should savor it a little bit more than you do but again it goes back to that mindset of being so
driven you want the next drug success is a drug but you've got to be careful that it
doesn't turn you into an [ __ ] at the same time because how many successful people do you know absolutely
horrible rude no manners obnoxious what's it done do you ever find moments where you think
[ __ ] i was just an [ __ ] then i think that it's just time for people you know you end up being
it's not that you can turn into that if you're not one but
when you become busy it's a bit like you know when people say that oh he's changed of course he's changed his life's
changed you know his responsibilities change his business has changed you can't expect him to say the same
people and you know when you have a group of friends when you all come out of school and sort of going from there and
you're talking every day and the ones that sort of grow [Music]
the friendships are still as strong but you just don't talk to each other every week every day because you've got
your own life you've got your own vision you've got your own plans but you still go for lunch and you get on better than ever and you met but
and it's the ones that say oh he's not no he's don't talk to us anymore i ain't got time mate but this just goes back to the sacrifices
you know if i fall out with friends because of what i'm trying to achieve in
my own personal life and my business so be it i know again that that sounds
you know and it's not about being a bad friend or a bad person but you you can't you can't worry about
other people as long as you're a good person as long as you do the right thing the fact that you don't have time at the moment
but that's when you people might perceive you to be an [ __ ] yeah you talked a little bit about that
Deathbed thinking
about being 80 years old and looking back on your life i'm gonna just play a little uh a little game with you so we've got to imagine um
imagine that what day of the week was i think it's tuesday today tuesday so friday you find out that friday's
your last day on earth my question is and really put yourself there right so friday's your last donut all
the fights coming up aj fury all falls away what do you immediately regret
that's actually something that i've thought about quite a lot and the reason was is um about
four months ago my granddad passed away it was 93 great life you know and when i went to see him in his last
couple of days you know he obviously didn't look great and i looked at him i thought wow life's
crazy in it i said everything that you've done in your life
and now you're laying here about to leave so when you get experiences like that
just you have to be reminded sometimes that this is a game life is a game we're only on borrowed
time right and you can never take yourself too seriously i think that's one thing i do well is i love to have a laugh and i don't
take myself too seriously um in answer to your question
since that moment i've been thinking a lot about if i you know if i went now do you look back
and say i couldn't have done any more i had a great time and i think the answer is yes i mean we could all do we can all do
better but my dad is an inspiration that respect because he's the kind of person that couldn't have squeezed one more
drop out of his life right so i'm quite envious of that he's 73
and who knows how long he's gonna last but i do feel like it's very important that when
you get to whatever stage when god says that's enough for you that you are able to look back and
say i couldn't have done any more. and that scares me a little bit because i want to know exactly what
when you think about more you're saying i could have done more you find out that this friday is your
last day what are the things where you think do you know what because i think that the
that moment like the the death bed moment puts everything in perspective it does but i think in that moment your
emotions are very different to when you're well and fit and on the hustle and just you know so
you don't get a chance to reflect on that kind of moment until you're there yeah and the obvious reflection at that
point is i wish i would have spent more time on my family you know i wish i would have been less focused
probably on work but i'm not a believer in you know the thoughts then
are not the thoughts now and you have to act on the moment you can't live your life saying well blimey when i'm on my
deathbed you might look back in because i don't i don't think you can plan like that you have to do what's in your heart you have to do what feels
right and what feels right for me right now is this sure what what might feel right then is
do you know what should have probably missed a few trips really and just done the school run a little bit more and
and i know that you know you you have to you really have to understand where you are in life this is great for your
mental health as well and your sanity you got to be honest with yourself and and you gotta understand the situation
i know exactly where i'm at what i'm thinking what i'm doing the sacrifices i'm making
what i could do better at what you know but i'm okay with it you know you can't get the perfect
balance but as long as you understand what is going on and you're not deluded
you're not stubborn yeah i know i know i need to do more at home
i know i need to do more school runs i know i need to be less short with the wife sometimes but can you
there's a couple of points here that i think are super interesting so um that death bed moment what i think it's
doing and i've never been there you've not been there but what i think it's doing is it's telling you what actually mattered
because to some degree i think that it's it's like with that hindsight you can say [ __ ]
that person criticizing my hair or my cut or this none of that [ __ ] ever mattered all of that was trivial but the things that
mattered was you say like my niece or my you know so i think that's what that moment so that comes over time how do you now
2017. okay you're a baby yes right when i was 27 what what people thought of me really
mad you know i mean listen i've been working out for 35 years just to stay fat
you know it's going a little bit i could not give her monkeys now at your age oh wait i was
you know i might have been jack the lad i might have been turning out that but deep down you know i'd only take one of the boys
to say you know tell you what edge you're putting on a bit of timber there oh look look you're barnett's creeping back
what what do you mean what do you mean now okay yeah mate i know listen signing the times isn't it so
being comfortable with yourself is the best feeling in life you know it's the best feeling in life and i
think when i was growing up at school i wasn't subconsciously i think i had a massive chip on my shoulder and that's why i was
a bit of a bit of a knob to be to be quite honest but when you get comfortable with yourself it's a
beautiful thing in life it really is you know when you wake up in the morning and you've always got to try for me and look
good and feel good and be the best version of yourself you can be but you do get to a stage and that's actually when you become really powerful
and effective you know it's the same kind of thing you know when you're young and you're courting or you're looking for
a young lady to show you some interest you know when you try really hard and you're sort of on edge and you be
don't really like my hair or oh god you know you know the ones that walk into the bar and just go oh my
you know i know i'm not the best but you know they're the ones that everybody gravitates to anyone with a smile on
their face is always creates so much more energy and flow and the people that
don't and and that's about being comfortable in yourself so i think that it's very difficult with
everything you've achieved at your age to just know where you're going or what you're doing i'm done do you know what i mean i'm i'm married
i've got two kids i've got business i'm struggling to balance everything you know but i'm here you know i'm not
gonna roll back the the years and do this and do that and i know exactly what i'm doing i know exactly where i'm at
i know exactly what i'm focusing on and that life starts to become a lot easier then at your age you know i went to work i left
college after my levels i went to work for five years in sports management companies and event management companies
i was a sports agent on a pga tour in america i had no idea where i was going
i mean i just wanted to be successful i wanted to earn money you know but the mindset of
or the changing mindset over the years is unbelievable i always say to people now what matters to you now you will
look back on when you get to my age and go i can't believe i even used to worry about stuff like that
and that that's important because i i feel like people that are very successful you know you did it at a very young age
very impressive because i think it takes time now when i did the cambridge uh talk the other day
you know you're sitting down with all these young i mean i'm i'm i'm street smart and i can sell
right these people are like yeah i'm jealous of boffins i used to take the mickey out of boffins
i'm jealous of boffins now i find intellectual people fascinating i love talking to them and just trying to learn and absorb and
i'm sitting in this room with people and they're listening to me and i'm thinking you know firstly you must be listening
to me thinking this boat who is he what is he a car used car dealer something like that
and then but i'm i'm talking around i'm saying to you what do you want to do uh
you know what what is success to you they've not got a clue and it's not because they're oxford and
they're deluded it's because that's just it's very difficult that age to understand i don't believe anyone at faulty looks
back at what they were thinking at 20 and said yeah i had this plan i'm there now and this is what i always wanted to do
so it takes time to develop a passion for something and that that is the that's a key word passion because when
we talk about being relentless and we talk about this work ethic you can only have it if you love what
Is ambition choice?
you do and if you have a passion for what you do i don't think you can trick yourself you can but you can't be as good you
know you know you said um earlier that you you feel like you're self-aware of like the the lack
of balance in your life because you've got this real relentless streak you've got this family and you're self-aware of it
do you think as much as you're aware of it do you think deep inside you you really
have a choice or do you think you're being somewhat
dragged by your own ambition because this is what i find fascinating about people successful people is it tends to be the
case that like me i'm aware i need to see my niece more but i just sometimes don't feel like i
have i'm fully in control well i i do it because it's what i want to do
ultimately i mean i do have an obligation you know i do have responsibilities i'm talking about in the workplace sure
you know we've got a fantastic team here but ultimately when we're announcing a show when we're doing a press conference when we do they
want me sure they want their flesh so they roll me out and i'm just like i'm like a traveling salesman right eddie
announcing the show today off you go right here we go bubba back in the car here we go you know what so but i do it because i enjoy it
because i love it because i have an obligation to do it for the business
that my father created and of my responsibility now
is to take that to the next level you know he built this from the foundations from nothing i'm not going to let it just fizzle out
as he goes into his 80s i want to take it to the next level but the difference is is i don't have to
do this you know i'm not looking at this it's my way out um you know i'll just if i just make
some money i can you know i can buy the lamborghini or i could have done that at 21. but imagine the eddie that that doesn't do this
imagine what how do you feel but the same thing it was that was me at school now that was the kid telling the
teachers i don't have to do that you know that runs shivers down me give me some
Finding the work life balance for a relationship
advice on um because you've got you're married and i'm i genuinely even genuinely no it sounds crazy but
i'm like you've managed to crack it seems like because you're married um crack the balance of being relentless on
one end but then managing to find a person or to at least keep them happy to some degree but yeah
i spoke to her but i genuinely i started to think of the the last couple years i'm like how am i going to find someone that understands that i
want to send text messages at 4 am in the morning and that i sometimes don't want to talk to them and that when i'm satisfied i'll
be quiet for seven hours because i've just got an email that i'm thinking about and so i'm like is it that you have to find the right person is it something
you say to them i think they need to know you they need to know
what drives you i mean if you had a conversation with my wife and you said what what is he like
you know she just go well he's just in his own world isn't he i mean the amount of times you know that moment where you get home
and they go right i need to talk to you and you go into the kitchen and they go right now isabella you know i spoke to her teacher
today and um i'm gone right so i'm good i'm going and i'm thinking that contract's gonna
be in at 9pm you know and she goes to me what did i say and i'll go this is cool what is it and she's just
she but it's not like and she'll go listen we have blazing rounds you know you're you know you're so selfish all you care
about is work you know but you again it just gets to a point where you just have to understand
life you just nothing's perfect you know you've got two people that love each other i've known her since you know my 20s
i've i've changed we've both changed a lot over the years but we've changed together and we've grown together
and this is what i do you know and i would have had that conversation with her at some point many years ago to the point saying look
nothing's going to get in my way i i don't mean to sound horrible and i love you and you know i want to spend
the rest of my life with you but you have to understand me you have to understand that this is
extremely important to me not don't say this is the most important thing to me because that'll get you bang
in trouble but this is extremely important to me and i think because she's been around my family because she knows
how important it is to us she kind of just gets it you know and there'll be times where
she'll say did i hear you on the phone last night at five o'clock in the morning i say yeah you know who's doing the
canelo deal or you know aj do or she'll just look at me and go but over
time you know i think they might the most difficult thing is the early stages of dating because it's very difficult
for a woman that they want your attention you know people people sometimes think that women want
uh you know money and you know the nice house and of course everybody does but they don't really
they want your attention and they want your company and they want your time and there are three things that are very difficult to do
when you live that kind of lifestyle so you do have to you know we'll do i'll race back from somewhere and i'll
say right you know tonight let's go for dinner and i'll be naked i don't you know hopefully she don't listen to this i
really don't want to go for dinner tonight but you have to do it and that's what my dad has kind of always taught me
something you've got to do you've got big we're big family people my mum is from from the east end
she's old school as far as they're concerned the man goes out and puts the bread on
the table and the wife looks after the man old old old world that don't exist
anymore but every morning or every night my mum will iron my dad a shirt
and she will put it on his on the door for him in the morning if you want if your wife right say i say
we put her in this room we sat her down with god and he said listen you can decide what happens next with eddie and his career
right so you can we can bring it to an end and he'll spend more time with you what do you reckon she would do she
could make the decision on you your relentlessness and your career how do you honestly think she would make
that i think she because she knows how important is to me i think she would say
no he he he he needs to do it he has to do it but i think the i think the hope is that
there is an end place or an end goal for me yeah but for me i don't
whether in 20 years time we we play this back i don't think i want to be 70
you know maybe even 60 70 80 doing this dealing with problems and
listen maybe i won't even make it that long but for me i definitely have the mindset
of not i want to get in and get out but i do want to get that moment
where i do sit on the beach with a cigar don't even smoke you guys but you know and a whiskey don't even like whiskey
but you know i couldn't imagine the picture at least and go do you know what we've done it
we've done well but walking away is the thing that at the moment would kill me you know to be able
imagine when you wrap up shop and you know this might be i mean for us we've gone from being a family business
you know to having four employees to now all of a sudden having hundreds employees
in in multiple offices around the world we're being approached by for for investment for takeover for
ipos and now we're sort of at that stage of growth where i don't know i just see i see a i see a faster exit
strategy than my dad at least that's what i'm selling to her you know just give me a few more years
just give me a few more but i do want to go and enjoy because i can't say i'm not enjoying myself because i love what i do but i do want
that moment to just you know but it's the walking away you know how do you just one day turn around and you might sell
the business or you know you might float and you take a more of a backseat role that's difficult
because we make our own decisions we're a hands-on business that's what we love we've we've turned down investment and opportunities for years because we don't
wanna i don't wanna ball the directors we we make the decisions and we do what we wanna do because we
love what we do but when you see such growth and you see such interest and you see
the opportunity for you know a much vaster wealth being quite honest
do you want it and if you want it what's the exit strategy because at the moment the exit strategy
for our family is from the day you start working from the day you die you work your nuts off
every single day i mean it's not particularly advanced is it that strategy but that's just what we've always done
mental health big topic you know especially over the last 10 years i think if you go back well 10
years ago and you said the word mental health people think people are crazy right they think like um run away from that person but now it's
become like the opposite it's like oh someone's got you know it's become something of where you'd give someone affection and you take care
of them because the stigma's somewhat changed we know the stats around male mental health
have you ever suffered from any sort of mental health um predicaments
this is my favorite day of the week my all-time favorite flavor of huel
berry i went up to hill's office in tring last week and had another tour around their headquarters and so
pretty amazing they have this massive massive gym as you would you would you would expect but the thing that i didn't realize
about huel was that it's also a vegan product and also i didn't realize their commitments
to sustainability now there's tons of reasons why you might choose to become a hooligan like me i've been drinking here for about three
years long before they um decided to help me with the podcast and to sponsor us but i never realized that element of it
the reason i've always consumed tool is because of convenience right um some people might consume it because
it's nutritionally complete um which i guess is part of the reason i did as well and then some people might
consume it because it's affordable but for me i never because i'm not vegan i never realized it was vegan i never
realized their efforts around sustainability and i never realized it was also gluten-free because again that's not a
problem i have and so on this week's episode of the podcast that's the key message that i wanted to get across
is that if you are vegan and a lot of people don't know this a lot of my friends didn't know this hewl is vegan too um
and this is my all-time favorite flavor which is berry um for me it tastes great um
20 grams of protein i'm currently trying to get in better shape as you i hope some of you have been able to notice if you've seen
the podcast on youtube if you're listening on youtube right now um yeah and i love it and this is why it's so awesome to work with a brand that you
believe in because their impact on the environment is low they are good for you nutritionally it's
super convenient and if you have the berry one it tastes unbelievable so what a what a
win-win-win-win-win for me it was working with you because um i get to tell you guys about something that i would swear by
and i don't have to be dishonest with you um if you look at my fridge right now maybe you should take a look at it it's
pretty much all heal i'm not advocating to have a heal-only diet but
that kind of speaks to the nature of my life and how busy i am and and how many meals i was missing before
i became a heel again have you ever suffered from any sort of mental health um predicaments
Your experience with mental health
i don't think so no i mean i think again depression's one of those things a
bit like yoga and breathing and stuff we were talking about earlier if you would have said to me 10 years
ago listen maybe even five or six years ago so and so suffering from depression
if if your perception of that person is well he's young he's good looking
he's healthy he's rich he's successful how can he be struggling from depression
what a load of rubbish and actually it takes the older generation even longer i mean i think my dad's only just accepted now that it
exists with people because his mentality is what dust yourself down what's the
matter with you and it's that's you know that that's wrong because it is real you know and it does exist um i don't
you know have i had days where i've been feeling incredibly down yeah but surely that's normal you know i don't i
don't see myself suffering from that and i think i think mental health problems and depression i think it comes from
overthinking you know my um my brother-in-law is hilarious he just i've never known
anyone who just overthinks and worries about stuff you know you're gonna be
having a conversation you'll go i've just been thinking about that you know and and if that happens i was thinking you know next year you could be there and
now and then from there it's like whoa whoa whoa what are you doing just when you're struggling mentally
focus on the short term focus on day by day i think sometimes people look at and
this is the same for business when you have a project or a long-term plan there are
so many short-term obstacles and goals to overcome to get there that's why many times you spoke someone
got this idea you know i'm going to be doing this and that and that and then a month later you've not even heard about it oh well what happened was
we launched and then you know the council came in or the regulation board came in and and this other company tried to do this
and and it just it's like no because you didn't focus on the short-term goals all you were worried about
was the house and the lamborghini and you weren't prepared to to tick the boxes to get there so sometimes when i'm a little bit off
or you know it might be traveling a lot and the equilibrium has gone and it's like okay so i'm just gonna write down what i'm
gonna do today and it can be really menial stuff it could be walk the dog you know it could be
finalize a contract could be go to the gym it could be go and get some food you know from
work just to say and and i would tick everyone off really yeah and i would say at the end of the day i would look at it
and i'll go done and that's the momentum back that that's where you get the feeling of accomplishment even even
on tiny things say okay i'm moving in the right direction for me that that is a big help for me he's
short-term focus because once you start worrying about what's going to happen next week or next month or next year
no and you're going to start driving yourself crazy you've just got to say okay this is what i need to do today and
tomorrow i need to do the same thing and then before you know it you'll start making positive changes you'll start achieving because you know
what what you've set the targets you've set yourself you are achieving you're a bit of a philosopher i don't know if you realize because um
there's a great famous philosopher that says uh depression is too much of the past and anxiety is too much thinking too much about the future and
he says the cure is more now and that's pretty much what you've done yeah that's true because you can't worry about things that may or may not happen
and you can't change things that have already happened what you can do is change what is happening today and it's simple to do that again in in
the book i ran a marathon one marathon right because my dad ran loads and he took the mick out i mean i had to do it
and it's the same kind of thing you start the marathon you think 26 miles if you start thinking about
running 26 miles i mean i it did give me anxiety attacks to start with i was thinking
that's just ridiculous i've never done more than 10k and then you train you train you train and you build and then
every mile marker is an obstacle you start off you think 26 miles by me
and you go one two three four five and you're you're okay and then and then you're 12 13 you think i've done half and you get to 18 19 you think
i can't do it anymore and you think just get to 20 get to 2021 and when you see that 20 mile marker
you know and then you get to 20 and you go do you know what i've still got six miles i can't do it and you go 21
22 23 and then when it's all over you can look back but if you start worrying about the future you're going to get out
you're not going to make it do you feel that anxiety sometimes in those big moments where you've got you know some things coming up and you
just can't stop thinking about it um in my business it was actually the first you know i heard this term mental health and
i think at the start i thought nah it's not real and then a couple of years in i see a lot of people i just started
hearing you know friends of mine and stuff going through really bad things i'm like i think it's real and then i got to this point where i was always scared to admit
that it would be real because i almost felt like if i admitted it was real then i'm like welcoming the
possibility into myself of like labeling myself something and then there was one moment where i
had this really big decision to make in new york and i'm laying in the hot tub in manchester and
i just got really anxious and i was anxious for about four days up until the point of the decision
and then i thought that's probably the closest i've come to some kind of mental health predicament is that real
anxious feeling that i couldn't shake i think social media is horrendous as well like
Social media
i've made the decision in the last couple of years years specifically to start ignoring and
blocking out a lot of um you're a celebrity now yeah
but when i was coming through when i was overturning the system the support was unreal and i was really
feeding off that i mean anyone that says you know they're not affected by criticism or they're not
worried about i mean that's a load of rubbish of course you don't like people criticizing you and by the way you love
people patting you on the back and championing you of course it's natural what things get to you though
stuff that people like the personal stuff couldn't give couldn't give monkeys about it's more
about the it's it's more about people when you're putting the work in
something and you're so passionate about something and you're actually working for the good of might be the sport or whatever
it's the people that just you know presume see you completely differently so that's the frustration but over the last
couple of years i just started thinking to myself what are you i was having a conversation with man my old man's on twitter right and he
phoned me at me ago i'm having an argument with this giza on twitter right and he was going on about the snooker in the format
and i said to him i'm like whoa whoa whoa whoa i said are you serious i said who is one who is this boat i
said you imagine someone stopping you on the street and having a pop at you about the snooker format but it also it's it's the
platform that made us what we are it got us to the top you know the interaction with
the fans and the understanding of their mindset so we can't just you know but it's become a toxic place
it really has you know and i worry for i worry for my kids you know sometimes one of them be on
tick tock and she'll put a dance out and someone will come back and say say you know i don't know uh you're ugly you
look really you're stupid you know and it's like we never had that now they i mean we never even had a phone you
know if someone didn't like you they might say something in the playground but that's about it so we live in a world of criticism and i
think it's a negativity but that's what i said to my old man said you imagine like these people
they're all doing it all day i'll put a post out and it's the same ones all the time i don't think you know i mean even um to
the point where someone posted my phone number on twitter right and i've had my phone
number for 25 years same one right and someone posted it and
went give it this is eddie hearn's number give him a call and you know tell him what you think about the pay-per-view
price or whatever it is and my phone was going men's like it was like every literally all day it was just private
number private number and i thought you know what you got to change your number and i thought i can't be bothered so i started
answering a few right and to this day this was a few years ago it's that people still do it and there's
this one guy you've got the same number yeah i can't be bothered to change it right so this guy's private number private
number private number and it's all day right so i pick it up and i go
hello mate and he goes oh bloody hell eddie and i go yeah how you
doing mate and he goes uh um when you're gonna stop ripping us off on
the paper views or something like that right and i go and it and i went to him mate let's have
a serious conversation what are you doing and he goes what do you mean
what am i i said have you got a job and he's like uh yeah i mean i said you haven't have
you and he's like well not not at the moment i said what are you doing
i said how many times have you phoned me today oh i mean the answer was like 40
right i said you can't focus i said all the energy you're putting into phoning me because
you think it's banter or is some kind of accomplishment if i pick up the phone i said put it into
something worthwhile i said because you really waste in your life and he just went quiet and he's like uh
oh come on no eddie what about a few quid off the paper view and i'm like no no mate i'm serious but i want to help you
you've got to you've got to change you know and then you just hung up and i thought [ __ ] okay but it's true
isn't it what are you doing what are you doing i mean all right once might be quite funny you know i'll pick it up and you give me a bit
but all day every day you know because i'd hate to be one of those people that just wakes up every morning
with no fire in the belly with no passion with nothing and there are by the way that's 95 of
the population many people it's why it's so important to me here to create an environment a mattreum for
the for the team where you enjoy being there you know we've got we get food together we've got
a gym we've got a pool we've got we're all traveling away to events we'll have a night out do that because you can't be in a job or a life where
you just flat how am i going to get the best out of you if you don't love what you do and it's very difficult to have that same
passion when it's not your business you know so motivation is important but
I don't like being a celebrity
you know frank said to me he said he said uh you know eddie's a and he's a businessman that's that's
where you came from your dad's a businessman too and with this new age of social media and all the interviews you do on youtube and you are relentless
with the interviews as well by the way and i was when i saw you in new york uh on that rooftop with like the nice
garden stuff yeah you were back to back to back doing those interviews with all these bloggers for three hours
that's helped grow the business it's why most people know matroom especially of this generation but it's
made you a celebrity and frank said to me he said i don't think he's enjoying the celebrity thing you know and i think a
lot of people would be really really surprised to hear that because you know
people would they think that you'd love it they think you love the attention i mean promoters are in the business of attention right
but from a personal perspective apparently you don't like it you don't like the celebrity i then set out to be a celebrity and i
set out to be a businessman i set out to um continue the success that my dad built
but i do recognize that if i am well known if i am a showman if i am a
celebrity it will help me push my events it will help me push the profile
of fighters you know you get to a stage now where the industry haters might say oh well
it's ridiculous he's doing all these interviews you know he's more popular than most of his fighters
you know more popular as a wrong word well known than zombies but that's me you know i look at the success of the ufc i look at the growth
of of that business and dana white and every major fight sport um product has that lead guy
in wwe it's vince mcmahon you know in mma it's dana white and in boxing i guess it's me or you know i want it to be me
so there's a method to the madness and but you know the book
the book was something that i wanted to do because i just thought it was funny that i would ever write a book right how
do you think it's funny no but if you knew me at school and you knew i just it was more like
hodder put it to me during before lockdown and when lockdown come i panicked and i was like
oh and next you know talk about being at home with you kids now i'm at home with my kids and i've got no events
and oh so i was just like for those first two weeks i was just right we launched a fitness show with
sky that people could do at home fight and fit you know i've said to the guys here give me that book deal i'll write it now
let's do the book now and i wrote it in lockdown you know and it was just zooms more zooms more
interviews because i just i was just scared of not having that drive every single day of you know going
out there and and and i didn't enjoy it like an illness he's an illness let's be honest we're
all sick aren't we i mean like you can't do you can't wake up in the night every night
and start writing emails doing contracts texting people right and then wake up at
seven and do the school run and then drive to work and do it all over again every single day unless you're a little bit ill in the
head you can't actually be still like so when you talk tell her about that cigar moment in the future
sitting on that beach i didn't believe you for a second yeah you're probably right but i just i'd like to think that it's at least what i'm telling to miss is
that one day we'll be we'll chill out you know what i mean could you imagine laying on a beach with a cigar like this no emails no nothing
just no fights coming up nothing just meditating no but i think it all depends where you
get to you know it's like when you're building your stack at poker you know the problem with gambling is you never
know when to walk away right and we're not gambling anymore because we're very good at what we do
but life is always a gamble so when you build your stack it's that moment when you say to the
cashier can i get a rack please and you put it in your rack yeah and you
go up to the cashier's desk and you say cash out in for me and i go sue and you walk away and you go yeah
and then you get sit down you're gonna have a nice beer but that moment sucks you said the moment the that moment
doesn't suck but then after again it's the thrill isn't it yeah i like to win i like people
so the thing that would hurt me more is if i turn around tomorrow and win i couldn't have done any more in boxing
i'm out bye what would hurt me more is sitting on the beach not not you know enjoying myself going
now i'm gone all those people that i was fighting again for all those years to become number one they've got no
they're back you know they're back and that's what my dad walked away from boxing because it is the most um aggravating
business an intense business and that's what i'm saying about it all throughout the night because everyone's trying to [ __ ] you
non-stop right so you have to sleep with one eye open and i think he got to a stage where he went i don't want to do this anymore i'm
going to go and do darts where everyone's going to love me do what i mean and i'm jealous of look at that because i saw growing up
this guy that was so intense and who had a bad temper and you know and then all of a sudden once
boxing went he was just chilled out wow i can't believe what's happened to my life so
you know i i hate to let people win and if i left ultimately they would win but i guess
the only time you can walk away is when you're content and will the contentment ever come
at the moment like you say possibly not but who knows you know who knows where we can build to where we can get to
where it might be that moment and again you have to always leave the option open because as i said
your thoughts at 20 are totally different to your thoughts at 30 and 40 and 50. i may get to 50 and we
may be you know i've had another great 10 years and i might go fire's not there anymore i'm done or i
might be saying right now i want to take over music now i want to take over football now you know so it's difficult to say
Selling Matchroom
and with the family businesses they're a very special thing and in the world in the world we live in today
these big global corporations and the public markets growing it's very rare for a family business to withstand the
temptation of acquisitions or going public or whatever what
who can you don't have a son right and uh i'm wondering who continues the
family business if you were to go down that route is it no well that's a good point because that
is the the conversation you know ever since i started to
understand business more for me that that is a natural progression of a family business
to go family business you know investment or acquisition or ipo and that's what you
do because how do you i have i have aspirations for this business to grow
globally and to study staging events in every major territory in the world you know to do that does require
huge investment does it does require you know management it and we can do it but that's not our
speciality our speciality is creating great live events for our broadcasters and fans
okay so my dad has always said to me i will never ever ever
take investment for the business float the business or sell the business and i've always
over the years gone yeah but you know it's gotta we gotta get to it and actually
the the something's quite interesting you know i've been blessed with two amazing daughters of course every man with quite a lot of son didn't
work out that's what god gave me but there is it's an interesting point because
my end goal if i had a son and listen only 41 who knows but i think it would be more
you know here we go again down the line kind of thing with me i would quite like
to end the journey with my dad joe to me to say
look at what we you know not it's gone but look at where we started look at
where we finished because it's very difficult and i take the interest
from you know hedge funds and you know investment funds with unbelievable amount of compliment
to say well you know and the calls are coming in non-stop because they appreciate the model of growth where when we talk
about one sport one promoter one belt you know that mindset it's a carbon copy of the ufc now the
ufc sold 4.6 billion there is no reason why boxing
with with so much more history with so much more credibility with fans and broadcasters
can't replicate that model and actually be even more valuable than the ufc business
and i'm really the only chance it has to do it it's not going to be bob harrem
it's not going to be don king it's not going to be frank warren it's going gonna be me so all of a sudden i've been giving
interviews like that and then the calls are coming well right we want you know and it's like guys we're not we don't need it we're
not if i wanted to go and get funding if i wanted to go and float i'll do it tomorrow but it's a big
it's a big you know head-butting system with me and me and my dad and you know he's starting
to look and i'm just saying we can't just be blind to it it's a natural progression for any
business in terms of growth to look at these models and but is that why you're doing the business
because you know the happiness you've got from this business i i would guess and i run i ran a public
business until recently um much of it aggravation loads you don't necessarily want right quarterly
reported you gotta hit the numbers if you don't then you've got to do something short term that's not necessarily in the long term interest of the business
right so i i i'm almost quite jealous of the setup you have the control you
have you have it in your family and you're happy but but you're someone that almost needs forward
momentum to continue to be to be just growth isn't it you know you know that as a family business you know we we
you know you can see in our financial results we're fantastic you know we're a huge uh family business in terms of the
numbers that we're delivering year on year end yes but at the same time
you're almost capped by the growth and by the numbers within the currents within that setup
yeah you know okay so when you start you turn a break-even business into a
a 5 million ebitda company and then before you know it the aim is 10 and 15 and now we're 30 and you know but
how'd you get to 4 billion why does 4 billion matter that's just the ufc number you know so but
because why it matters is it was never on the agenda it was never
possible it could never be done and i guess it goes back to the competition with my dad where i'm saying
you know i believe you know when you talk about pe ratios and the value of a business yeah we know
what we're worth now but i do believe we have the potential to be worth those kind of numbers
and that would be your success in some respects it's a game it's a game steve it's not i
don't know it's not like i don't i don't think that deeply to i
just see it as a game but when you start thinking deeply it doesn't make you question so yeah it's good point why does
i don't know i i just i live in the moment i live in now i just feel that every day we're trying to expand we're
trying to push the boundaries of trying to do more so would i like to this business to you
know sell or have a value of for [ __ ] right why because it could it's ridiculous we're
just a couple of like he's out of dagnam i'm his son would be a great story yeah but it
it's just it's us against the world because the money would do to be honest nothing the money wouldn't change my lifestyle
at all i'm not i've got a couple of nice cars right i got a nice house i don't want a yacht i don't want to jet
i don't want i mean well i mean we'll talk about it but you know i don't i don't want for anything i'm not
i'm at the age now maybe when i was in my twenties yeah wow yeah private jet he got you
just rent it if you need it so it's just it's just the fact that what we've done i think i think legacy
is um i was talking to freddie flintoff on my podcast and i said i said about
legacy and he went yeah i think legacy's a load of bollocks i actually i disagree a little bit because
you know when you go back to that moment where you're on your deathbed and you might be today or
and when you've achieved something like that you just you put yeah you start laughing you got i can't believe we've done it i
can't believe we've done it and that would be the better kind of memories or the achievement to me you know
can you believe we've done it but you've got to enjoy it at the same time but you know i don't know it's you could you
can debate this all day long because you sit back on the death bed and you say yeah but was i really happy
of course because this is bringing us happiness this is i know that every day i come in here
and i'm smiling and i'm up for it and i'm passionate and i'm full of energy and i've got a drive and a fire in my
bed that's good enough for me my dad comes in every day has been coming here you know into this off into this business for
50 45 years and he's got the same passion the same energy that he did when he
first started the company that's got to tell you something and this is almost somewhat of a contradiction because he's
coming in here every day you're both really really happy you're coming in here with a fire on your belly but then there's this other part of you
that's like but we need the end point yeah he doesn't he doesn't he he
he doesn't want any of that you know he's going ah son we've got the most amazing business you know we're forecasted to just for
continued growth for the next five ten years we've got broadcast contracts locked in
we're untouchable and i'm like yeah but how do we go you know i want offices you
know we have offices in in england in new york in milan in madrid i want offices in sydney in
toronto in mumbai in beijing that that's what i want why because we're not supposed to have it
we were never supposed to be this business i was never supposed to be this kid so it sounds like you're proving something to
somebody maybe but probably to him and if that's what it comes down to
which comes back to your childhood probably and if you prove that to him right you have all these offices around the world
you sell for five billion will that make you happy probably not but i don't know i i i don't think that
rebellion for 5 billion and making a load of money will make me happy it will make me happy to be able to say
i can't believe we've done it you know i can't believe what we've achieved but then you'll need the next thing part possibly
or that might be the the cigar on the beach moment i wrote i wrote this one sentence in my book where i
started to understand the moment i described at the start when someone made me an offer for my business and i looked at it when i was 23 and i
thought we've got 25 million quid [ __ ] and then what i learned in that moment is
my whole life became so confused and i almost fell into like i'd call it chaos and so in my book i write that we live
our lives thinking that we're striving for stability which would be completed goals the cigar um
thinking that stability of stability and that we're trying to escape chaos but what i came to learn was
in fact um our stability is chaos it's the having unanswered goals and
it's the problems and it's the forward motion so our chaos is stability and our
stability the cigar moment would actually feel like chaos yeah it would feel like some kind of text if it wasn't time
if it wasn't time and we don't know when it'll be time yeah but what you just said there is very true because
like any athlete that moment when they're in the chaos is where they
feel most at peace with themselves you speak to any fighter and you say where would you rather be
anywhere in the world and say in the ring and that's the same for us so it's not like i want aggravation but
stick me in it put me in front of problems and and tell me i can't do something
that's where i'm in my moment am i in my moment where i'm sitting at home
you know watching tv no i'm i'm at my best when i'm doing those 100 200 interviews
or i've got problems or a fight's falling through and you know all of a sudden the shit's hit the fan that's when i'm at my
best so and that's where i do feel calm in a way you know at first when you have problems you know it might
be a panic but for me okay this is what we do we go to work now you know and that's that's the same for an
athlete or a fighter that's when they feel calm when you might be watching going
because that's not your your calm that's not your your moment it's their moment i'm fine you know when
aj fights he ain't nervous i'm [ __ ] [ __ ] myself because i can't control it it's not me it's not
what i do but that's what he does you know when when a fight's falling through or it looks like a massive
show's about to be cancelled and other people in here might be oh oh do you think you'll be all right do you think we'll do
well and i'll just lock the door and say right leave me alone and i go to work that's my that's that's no problem for
me you know but but you only become exceptional at things and used to things
when you become familiar with them and when you put yourself in the same position time and time again
it's all about frank you know we we always laugh about him giving his press conferences you know because when i did my first
ever press conference which was audrey harrison against david haye i couldn't stop shaking you wouldn't have known it the time but i put my
hands on the table like this and i and i could i could feel them you know i could i could see them going so i just when i spoke i just put them
underneath my legs like this and just leant forward and you would never have known and when i done the next one a little
bit less and the next one and then within five or six i never needed notes i just speak you
know four hours i couldn't believe it and with frank you know he done one recently and i could see him shaking you know i
was just taking the piss out of him and i just said just keep doing it keep doing it repetition repetition keep putting yourself in situations
steve davis who is my godfather i said to him once how do you you know when you
you talk about sort of sports where millimeters make a difference it's
nothing more than snooker you know i said how do you do not get nervous you know you're about to go down to pot the
blackboard and just little one little jolt and it's all over and he said i have no nerve endings
he said because i've been put in the position time and time again in the end it's just it's second
nature it's just like riding a bike and that's that's what the same with business you have to keep putting yourself in a
position time and time again and you'll keep improving listen thank you for your time today
no it's another counselling session yeah you know i'm going to leave it now and go away you know i think the best the best thing
you can talk about mindset and and mentality and
for hours and hours and hours just keep it simple don't over complicate things don't
overthink things be happy keep smiling that's difficult when you want something so bad and you're chasing it but if you start to
really overanalyze that's when you know things start creeping in just keep it simple
and um you know i said sometimes if things get tough or you know we've got problems and i'll say
tomorrow man he said don't worry he said just wake up an hour earlier tomorrow and go to bed an hour later
i'm thinking that's so that's so and he is the most simple mindset but it works for him because you and the
best thing you can do is be honest with yourself as well just try and understand take a step back and just
think about what is happening in the world and your world right now and if you can understand it you can
deal with it and you can solve it but just think simple thank you
you

Transcription:


Intro
honesty really really matters and i think much of the reason why i started this podcast was to give
the world the much needed honesty it needs but often doesn't get you hear success stories that are glamorized and that are oversimplified
but that's rarely rarely the case this week's guest will give you exactly that raw
unfiltered honesty like you've never heard it before and in some points honestly that might make you
a little bit uncomfortable it made her uncomfortable it made me uncomfortable this week i'm joined by
chrissy chella she's an unbelievable and in my opinion heavily underrated entrepreneur running
multiple multi-million pound businesses she's one of the uk's number one fitness creators
athletes whatever you want to call her she's an author her book is coming out in january
she has a remarkable story one that starts from very very humble beginnings as an immigrant that was
bullied on the playground in the uk and what you'll find out about her is inspiring it's captivating
it's real one of the most amazing conversations i've ever had on this podcast and i'm so glad that we can bring you
her story in this way told with total honesty without further ado i'm stephen bartlett
and this is the dire rover ceo i hope nobody is listening but if you are then please keep this to yourself
as i did a little bit of research on you and i got to sort of uncover your story and i got to
stalk you a little bit on social media um the more and more that i observed and sort of looked
past your instagram feed the more i saw a pretty remarkable
entrepreneur and business person and one of the thoughts that came to my mind and you know this podcast is all about
speaking the truth and being honest was this question which is do you think that you get the credit you
deserve as an entrepreneur that's the question
Justifying myself as a woman
um it's not about me i haven't built a community about me i've built a
community about helping other women and i think that
it's never fully been about me and the credit that i get is seeing other
women thrive and succeed and come together and that for me is enough credit i don't
need an award i don't need someone to say oh my god you're the best business woman in the world for me when i see or when i read another
woman's story that for me is enough i don't need anything else
so yeah i do so because i was when i i was watching some of your stories on instagram and you you run an office right
of people you run multiple businesses right and i typically think that people
are very very quick to arrive at judgement when they see a pretty young lady who's worked out on
instagram who has a big following and they t and this is just being completely honest they tend to come to judgments very quickly a conclusion a
conclusion yeah and that that conclusion and that narrative or that image that they form of that person i've come to learn is usually severely
wrong 100 it is and you know it's funny you say that because i've also been on multiple dates with people
and you know they see my instagram following and they automatically assume that oh it's because you get your ass
out that's that's that's why you make money or it's because you get your ass out that's why you've built what you've built
and the truth is if i did that and if that was the fundamental reason then i wouldn't have
a team of 30 people in one company and building another company that sells out every time we
restock it goes past being a pretty face or a pretty picture it goes past being a nice body it's
about the message that you have it's about what you want to truly truly put out in the world and i
think if people make that conclusion it says more about them than it does to me does it make you feel though
and i want you to be really honest here how does it make you feel i think okay like i'm gonna be complete honestly
i think it's one thing to be judged and it's another thing to be judged as a woman
okay so why is it that when you see a handsome man you don't come to a conclusion that he
only got what he got because he's handsome why is that as a woman i have to justify myself more
i have to explain myself more all the time it's draining i shouldn't have to
explain myself my face my body all of this stuff it's just external you know and
i think that can i swear on this question
i smell my youtube all the time some people get offended and i'm like listen this is this is who i am something else yeah no it pisses me off
it pisses me off but at the same time it's like it feeds me right you know it feeds me like piss me
off even more because that's how i thrive you you saying to me i can't do something you saying to me that i only
got there because of this and that it pushes me more to achieve more
and yeah i mean it's their problem not mine i guess there's a lot of you know let's just for
a second imagine that that judgment of you was correct and that you'd got here because you were pretty or whatever or you're
you know you have a great physique or whatever it was um what would they be missing what is
the truth why why did you get here because there are lots of very pretty people out there right
yeah um but for some reason you made it here and i've seen your businesses i've looked
into them you have pretty phenomenal businesses and you're running big teams of people in big
offices so like there's two kind of thoughts to this but i think the central question that i'm trying to answer for myself is what is it about
chrissy that differentiated you your approach your message and the way that you
connect with people from all of these other people that are trying to do what you're doing
i think in all honesty if i'm if i'm answering that question from a personal perspective
i've always been 100 honest and transparent with who i am you're not gonna find a hidden secret or
some nasty surprise like this is who i am you literally either take it
or you leave it and i'm not going to try and be anything else
to fit in for anybody else you know and for me when i started my fitness
journey when i you know moved countries to england i never felt like i had a sense of home
i never felt like anybody understood me so to be blessed with a platform where i
can build a community and bring women together globally you know this is this goes beyond
me this is about bringing women together that have been abused that have had you know
mental disorders eating disorders such bad things you couldn't even imagine what
women have gone through and have told me to bring them all together and to create this
tribe you know that for me is like i think that's what people see
yeah and i think that's what people believe i want to do because i genuinely do want to do that
and you know one of the things that sorry to interrupt there but i really wanted to one of the things you said was about you
being yourself and i asked you that question actually with a bit of a preconceived idea of what the
answer would be and when i watch you on instagram the feel that i get from you versus
pretty much everybody else other than one other person i've got to be honest and he sat in this chair and he's actually coming back is joe wicks like when i met joix
he is the guy you meet off off off air or whatever is the same guy and
he's so [ __ ] genuine and all he cares about is like genuinely helping people but the reason i said to
joe i said i think the reason you're so successful is because you are yourself and
you will share it all and when i was watching you on instagram and watching some of your videos you cater to the 99 of people's lives
which is the real [ __ ] yeah i saw your video this week you did on your story you're waking up and you're saying
listen i don't want to wake up today and most people don't admit that because you know a lack of perfection is sometimes
perceived as weakness so i wondered how that resonated with you in terms of the importance of your success originating from chrissy
being her truer self yeah you're you can only be the best version of yourself right
and i think if you start trying to be something else soon enough it will come out or you'll start to fall through the
cracks or it will slip something will slip and you can only uphold that image and
you know that presence for so long before it really just [ __ ] up so the only thing you can do is be the
best version of yourself and this is what i tell people all the time it's never been about other
people's perceptions of you it's always been what you think about yourself and if you
truly truly believe in yourself you won't want to be anybody else you
want to you won't want to be fake you wouldn't want to be trying to please everyone my job isn't
to please everyone were you always at that point no tell me about that oh my god no i mean
i remember when i was in a relationship i was 16 years old i was like i'm gonna marry this person i'm so in love like this is it uh and then he cheated
on me and i was like oh [ __ ] this is not it it's his name no he does not deserve the air time i'll
tell you that much but i was heartbroken and i was trying so hard to please this
person you know i was trying so hard even in school i know it sounds petty but i was trying so hard to fit in
all the time all the time i remember like this is so this is not
cute on my end i'ma be honest with you i remember being at school and i'm foreign okay like
i'm mediterranean we're hairy okay and i had a no i had a moustache and the
girls used to rip me for it and i was so sad i was like oh my god why am i not like
these pretty english girls like i don't understand like i used to feel so shitty about myself
constantly trying to like fit in and then when i got cheated on i was like oh my god it must be because i'm not pretty enough
it must be because i'm not sexy enough [ __ ] that that's draining what do you
mean i constantly have to be something else for someone else i'm never gonna be happy and i i wasn't
happy for such a long time so yeah i just i just fully like expose
my moustache story there so let's take us from mustache to self-confidence
um what was that journey and what changed your uh your your self-esteem and your self-confidence what helped you
get that confidence in yourself i think for me it was can we just i think that
should be the podcast title master no no seriously even sarah doesn't know that
i used to have him no guys i'm gonna be honest with you okay like i don't give a [ __ ] i had a
moustache growing up okay and all the girls used to rip me the [ __ ] up they used to be like uh
your man your boy like honestly [ __ ] [ __ ] man and i ate my school
dinner for six months in a toilet because i didn't have any friends do you think that experience is part of
the reason you are who you are today 100 like honestly it's pretty impossible to to break me
Building my confidence with the gym
and when you've broken me understand that you've really like broken me down because it takes a
lot now was that we talk about the mustaf mustache thing is if it was this trivial thing but i'm guessing what
you're saying is you were bullied in school yeah but at the same time it's not like i was constantly bullied like i think
i don't know a lot of us go through awkward stages in school trying to make friends trying to be with a cool gang trying to do this try and do that then
you almost become like mean as well because you're so hurt by everybody else that you only yeah so
i think you know like i remember walking into sixth form one time and a
lot of personal things happened in my life and no one wanted to be around me at that point
and i just hated everyone around me and i was full of anger constant anger
and hate you know and i didn't want to be that person anymore especially after being cheated on i didn't want to be that
person anymore and i remember being on the train one day because i used to work in potter's bar
at the time um in this little men's boutique like retail shop and i was coming back home
and i remember like the penny dropped and i was like i can try so hard to be sexy and cool
and all this stuff other people but i'm not doing anything for myself and that's where the quote do this for
you comes from because i signed up to the gym that day
and then i'll walk straight back out and then go back for two months i'm not gonna lie to you i was signed up and like i'm
gonna do this i'm gonna do this i know what to do signed up didn't come back for two months i was actually actually hanging
back i don't know what to do why didn't you go because i was scared i was like who i was like who do you
who do you think you are crazy trying to be like a fitness girl you don't know what you're doing you know
this was like six years ago you don't know what you're doing go back home relax right relax chill go
to work study relax at some point you must have changed your mind yeah i did i did and evidently i did and
i was like uh okay now i need to do this like what am i doing i'm so lethargic i'm tired all the time i'm
not strong i was never like um overweight or underweight i was just tired all the time and drained
especially mentally so when i got into the gym i remember looking at the leg press machine and i
was like what is this transformer i don't know what the [ __ ] to do with this machine
and everybody else around me seemed to kind of know what to do and then there was like
men there and the women were on the cardio machines and the men were at the weights i didn't care about the cardio machine i
was so intrigued by the weights i was like what why do men go there what is that about
men that go there and women go there i want to go there and i didn't know how to use weights i
didn't know what i was doing i was training i didn't have anything like no one was on instagram at the time
no one was teaching the way social media has literally opened up a book full of information
and free content and we didn't have that at the time i started you know i didn't
know what i was doing it's how did you i learned you learned i just learned i
just was like you know what i'm just going to do this and i kind of i kind of got addicted to
the feeling of how completing a workout made me feel
and i started going again and again and i started learning because what was it doing for you going
it was giving me my therapy therapy from what from life from
my reality from the fact that i was so depressed or with who i was and
so angry at the world and everything the world had done to me
and the only time i felt like i could escape was at the gym which is so crazy
because the gym is like a chore for people i've got a [ __ ] train today but i went there and i escaped
it was therapy and no one could take that feeling away from me
not an ex-boyfriend that cheated on me not a mean girl at school not a horrible boss no one
isn't it funny that so much of you know when you speak to people that have achieved great things
it all seems to have been sparked by like an earlier catalyst of being bullied or feeling insecure and or
inadequate in some way i see the same in myself the reason why i am successful without a shadow of a doubt is because
the feeling of being broke and being inadequate in the area that i lived in and having all the windows on my house
smashed for a decade and the grass being six foot high and but living in all of these around all of these white people zero black people at
my school other than my brother and my other brother that feeling of inadequacy put pressure on me for like 15 16 years
and so my obsession as i wrote in my diary 18 was i'm gonna have uh a million pounds
before i'm 25. i'm gonna have a range river is going to be my first car right couldn't even drive yeah it's so funny i did the same
right i swear and it's so funny you say it was the only black man in your school because i was the only foreign guy on
mine i was trying to contend with this whole idea of having curly hair i was like i i started relaxing it when i was 12 so
it'd be straight and it and and i look back and i think if i hadn't have gone through that in the way that i had you wouldn't be where
you were not a [ __ ] shadow of a doubt and and it's like that pressure releases at some point
in different ways i could have ended up in prison right my my friend said my best friend said to me at 18 he said
steve and i remember where i stood when he said he said you're either going to be a millionaire or you're going to be in prison and i hit me like a ton of bricks
because he was telling the truth i cared so much about escaping from that pressure and from that life that it was going to
channel itself into something so tell me about your diary what did you write your day oh god i remember so funny right
i remember i wrote down and i will never ever forget i wrote down i'm going to be someone one
day i wrote i wrote that down and then i remember you went you have blackberries yeah all right
back in the day and i used the right of my blackberry and i just believed it
and anyway when i went to the gym and kind of figured it out along the way um i fell in love with someone
at the gym like i was going he's now my ex-fiance by the way everyone we're no longer together but he
is a very important person in this story because when i met him i was at rock
bottom but i was also trying to find my feet and i was becoming more confident in
myself and that confidence confidence did grow and attract the person that i was
supposed to be with at the time right because i do believe your your vibe and energy attract the people that you have
around you right and i remember he was driving me to work one day because i was waitressing
and i looked at him and i said i don't know why i started instagram at this point had like 50 000 followers i started
instagram in all honesty i started it just to see how i looked doing exercises
and hollywood recorded me and i was like oh my god i'm gonna break my back i don't know what i'm doing i need to fix
my form but somehow people started loving it and anyway
he was driving me to work and i go jack i don't know why but i feel like we're gonna achieve something
by helping women and generally said to me he goes yeah whatever man you get to work i'll come
pick you up i was like no i feel it and i started crying
crying streams of tears he's like what's wrong with you i was like no i believe
it i don't know what it is this is feeling i can't explain never had that feeling before and
here we are today what do you think that feeling was belief where did that belief come from
me i just believed in me so much that no one not even
you know the person i was with could sway me another way and i do think a lot of that comes from
persevering in the gym and growing that discipline and growing evidence right yeah that you
could right yeah because when you're when you start doing something good for yourself training was good for
me right you start to build these disciplines and habits and consistencies
and they transfer in other aspects of your life it's like a domino effect so
i started becoming more disciplined at university i didn't need 10 cans of red bull to stay awake i was
focused um i would excel all the time and it wasn't because i put in extra
hours it was because i was so hyper focused where i was with who i was i was present
and if it wasn't for the gym i wouldn't be able to have done that so your ex fiance yeah jack
do you think you would have met him had you not built the confidence within yourself or
started to build a confidence within yourself that the gym had given you do you think you would have been ready quote-unquote to have that relationship
with him at that time if you were the old chrissy no um and if i did if i was with someone
at the time i wasn't so confident it would have been the wrong person because you attract the energy that you
have you attract what you believe in yourself if you're constantly negative about yourself if you're constantly just
trying to make yourself believe you're you're just not worthy you're always going to attract that
and don't get me wrong there was like dates in between jack obviously
when i wasn't with him by the way i mean no i mean like after the guy that cheated on me i had like went through
i went for a phase i went through dayton and it's always the wrong guy i was the wrong guy and then it was i realized it's because
i'm trying to find happiness in other people constantly trying to find happiness of people and then when i started focusing
on myself he came along
you know a lot of women when they're in the situation where they're lacking confidence or self-worth or they're
feeling like something is missing will and this isn't just women this is men as well yeah right
they'll think that the answer is a romantic solution yeah right is it no it's not um
i've been there i've done that and obviously i'm speaking from personal experience you could find someone that really helps you you know you could
genuinely find someone who inspires you motivates you pushes you
and that's so remarkable and if you do find that person don't let them go you know but unfortunately if you have
so much self-hatred you are never going to be satisfied in the relationship that you
are in because you constantly have to find that person to give you that happiness you're constantly waiting for that
person to do something for you stable right it's unstable it is a lot of dependency
and um i think that the most rel most important relationship you're ever going to have is going to be with yourself
because when you go to bed at night and you're in your own little thoughts up here right that's you and you that's you and
you so you've got to fix that up here first before you go trying to find a a person to share your life with you
know and you know so you end up you know
jack ends up proposing yeah you you build a business together which is a topic in and of itself which you're
you're still working together with him on now yeah and then at some point you both decide
in a very you know i've listened to your story so you decide in a very amicable mature way that this situation
isn't making both of you right happy yeah and there was a sentence you said where you said um
you and jack grew apart which i found quite curious and i find it curious because on this podcast we've we've been
talking a lot about monogamy for whatever reason and this idea in fact the last guest we had on dr arya
who was you know who people have been really really blown away about um he he was cheated on by his partners you
know and he found out in a really horrific way that she was pregnant with another man yeah i listened to that okay and so on
that sentence about growing apart this makes me ask you the same question about monogamy if it's
possible for you to meet someone and grow apart you know especially you know because everybody's growing in some way
um what are your thoughts on monogamy having been almost to the altar with someone what are your
Growing Apart from my ex
thoughts on monogamy and i can i be honest i mean
please you never have to ask permission again to be honest i've never said this ever and i'm a
little bit nervous to say this but i when i was with jack
i thought that that was my person and i genuinely felt it in my heart and
my soul i never questioned it once right and we grew apart and that's because
a lot of people don't know what was going on behind the scenes last year when i launched toner sculpt with jack we had a lawsuit against
us you know no one really knew about that you know 50 grand in lawsuits trying to
get our app that we we built just to be ours and then build it from the ground up that's why we had
to refurbish and relaunch the programs because everything is now built home grown in our offices with our
technology right and do you know how much pressure that adds to a relationship i can't imagine and you're going home
and you're like what do you mean you don't do this what do you mean you didn't do that hating each other resenting each other
because you think they're to blame he thinks you're to blame i think he's to blame right and it's going to take a
very very special person to fit into the shoes that jack left
you know he is such an incredible man in every aspect works hard is caring is
loving as ambitious is everything a woman would want in a man unfortunately we grew apart
and it is unfortunate because i genuinely loved him and still do love him
unconditionally i'd give him my kidney if he needed it and it would take someone very very special
and confident to fill that space up and i'm not gonna hold my breath
does that make sense i'm not gonna hold my breath i'm gonna you know let's just see where it goes
you think it's possible um i think it's possible i think anything's possible
i just think that it's gonna take someone with a hell of a lot of confidence and someone
that understands that i don't need anything else but effort
and time from them i don't need your money i don't need your gifts i don't need so you're saying
you think that jack's shoes will be difficult to fill and it's almost like you're setting his shoes
as the standard of what you're looking for in the future so it kind of begs the question well you've got two feet that fit those
shoes perfectly jacks so why isn't he filling those shoes
i think if anyone turns around and says to you that i work with my partner and we run a
company of 30 people and hundreds and thousands of subscribers and you know an
ever growing company and we're so in love i i really literally will look at them
and be like how did you make that happen working and being romantically involved
with someone is difficult because let me tell you something when
you come home from work you're coming home from work with the same person what do you think you're
going to speak about when you get home work what do you think you're going to speak about
um after you have sex work the work i'm being honest like
you you live and you breathe your company jack is an entrepreneur and himself jack is a co-founder jack built this
with me right yeah so if i'm going through all those things as an entrepreneur as a
co-founder he is as well i don't know if you're answering the question chris but i am answering the question it
doesn't work it doesn't work because you work together yes it doesn't work together it would have probably worked
isn't that a shame when i when i um when i first met jack i have never felt
that way about someone before and i never once questioned our relationship or i never once questioned
whether i didn't want to be with this person and it's funny because when we hire new people at tone and scope they obviously
know mine and jack's relationship and a lot of employees tend to get a bit nervous
they're like are the co-founders going to be better are they going to be nasty to one another and you know what they always say it's
insane how much respect and love they have for one another it's actually a bit worrying how much respect and love we have for
one another and had we not had tona sculpt we would have 100 be married by now
probably expecting a first child is jack in a relationship i don't know we don't speak about stuff
like that i don't know if he's in a relationship okay so here's another thing
jack's made it pretty clear he's been like i don't know who i'm gonna find that's
like you and you said the same to me today and i've said the same thing about him um and another thing is i've been
with him for five years right i was with him for five years i still work with him in a normal situation you break up
and you go separate ways go separate ways you don't speak you don't see unless you're stalking each other
which i would because i'm a weirdo so i'd stalk you for a bit until i got over you but what i'm saying is i see
him every day so it's like how can i ever forget about you you're always there
i speak to you every day i'm on the phone to you every day we make executive decisions together
every day i still go to you for advice every day but why is i don't look at you
and want to kiss you right do you no i don't i don't
i don't not not right now anyway but i don't
to be in a relationship you have to have that flair come on you have to have that spark that
you you make me feel some type of way and i know over time it will pass
and whatever but it sounds so weird but i see him almost like a best friend but then
everyone always tells you to marry your best friend so maybe have i got relationships all wrong
right so i don't know i don't know but all i'm saying is the
person that i'm with and next with or whatever they don't necessarily have like they're
not competing because that's horrible you don't want to compete kind of somewhat unavoidable though especially
in chrissy's brain but at the same time it's like jack
was is the most genuine person like would always take care of me always
listen always put me first would always want me to to succeed it was every check check check check check but why
are we not together i don't i me myself i still don't have a
a fundamental reason as to why you know i read the comments and people
were like of course she would leave jack now she's got like millions of followers and has got money
of course she was she's gonna go marry a rich arab man i was like what you clearly don't know me you
clearly don't know me but um i don't have a rich arab man as a
boyfriend by the way i just want to clear that up but i don't know if jack's dating i i don't know
what he's doing all i all i do know is that i want him to be so happy could
you imagine life without him oh no well that question just took my
breath away a bit no i couldn't no i turned around tomorrow said he said i'm leaving the business i'm moving
no i'd be absolutely heartbroken i'd be i'd be absolutely grieving
i couldn't imagine life without jack but then again don't they say the most
important person in your life as a business owner is your business partner you almost speak
special bond you always speak to them more than you speak to the partner you go to bed with but it's also and the
reason i asked that question is i remember asking myself that question about my business partner many years ago and i'm embarrassed and i thought to
myself what if they died and it was like well then there's no point me doing this business anymore
which is a really weird thought i had i thought well then they were such a fundamental part of the purpose and the journey
and i it made me question you know why i'm actually doing this and i think with jack i think it's probably
true that um a huge part reason why you do this business is because of him you've been
through so much together yeah i couldn't imagine doing it with someone else yeah but i also can't imagine doing it
without him and you've been through hell and back together with jack right yeah and that strengthens the relationship like
you know so much been through so much with jack um you do five years with someone shit's
gonna happen shit's gonna hit the fan is it is it a possibility to be back with him
I hate talk about my success
um like i've always said you can never say never and anything is possible however
if jack was to find someone right and say oh like chrissy you know out of
respect he would have to sit me down because we work together and be like i'm with someone now
and if i see that that girl is treating him so well and looking after him in all honesty
that's all i hope would you be a little bit jealous probably i mean i'm not gonna lie probably would
but and would you then question the decision oh no i'm not the type of
person that if if if i if i don't have you no one else can on you know me and that's just weird
i mean you'd go home that day and start thinking oh i would go home and be like oh like damn you'd set reminders off
like alarm bells will start going off i absolutely don't regret ending it i've learned more about myself in the
year and a half of parting ways with jack than i did in five years of being with him facts i don't regret ending it would i
feel some type of way if he were he was with someone else you'd be absolutely lying to yourself if you said
no come on mate like we buddy was about to get married
we own a company together of course you'd feel some type of way but would i be jealous no would i be happy if he was
happy hell yeah i would because his happiness makes me happy is
in the future a possibility of me being with him again i don't i don't know how can i how can you possibly answer
that question when the possibility of me parting ways with him five years ago was
not even a vision i can't answer that question but if he was to find someone and be
truly happy and in love and she was a good egg i'd be happy and it's possible to be happy for someone
but also for it to suck at the same time 100 but that's only because you just feel some type of way but deep down you
just want them to be happy i think he will find someone i think he's going to find someone who's really
genuine are you smiling i wasn't smiling you're smiling no i wasn't smiling i think you
are i think you were smiling i think you felt some type of way by saying that no i really do i swear i
but yeah i've been honest enough now till now to like lie but but if when he does right
when he does which he will i just want one thing from that girl if you're listening out there to jack's
future wife i just don't want her to sway he's a mind on our business
does that make sense yeah oh leave tone and sculpt you don't need it anymore
that's horrible like don't interfere don't need to get involved love all right look at you but it's true
like i'm sorry but when i'm with a guy if he starts telling me what to do with my company
or if he starts telling me or it's me or jack i'd be like yeah get a grip it's jack
if you give me an ultimatum i don't want to be with you you know what this thing so i was i was
thinking about this earlier and i've got some friends i wouldn't call them necessarily friends but people that i know personally
and they would hate because they're so insecure as men they would hate the idea of dating
someone as self-made and successful as you mm-hmm and it's a certain type of insecure man
i'm laughing because i already know already been there really yeah certain type of insecure man
that really is seeking to control that would would not like a chrissy because
you can't be controlled you can't be controlled through gifts through x and you've been there yeah i've been
there i've done that like you know i remember one time
go for it sarah was like yeah sarah was my pa she's like yeah open up
but i remember one time when i was speaking to this guy you know after jack and i was going to a
lathe this was one of the biggest photo shoots for tone and scott this was you know to refurbish the entire app and everything
like brand new look brand new everything so much money went into this i think nearly 90 grand in production that's a
lot of money [ __ ] to the money [ __ ] ton of money yeah i mean i can put down two mortgages
for that yeah so as you can see like what but when we do things we do things right i tone and sculpt and that's facts um
so i remember he sat down he was like i don't know i just feel a bit you going
i said what do you mean what do you think i'm gonna do go and go and you know
go crazy with other men in la i'm going to work oh i don't know i don't know really
insecure and i found myself thinking it was me
i was like wait a minute and then i sat back and i was like no that's you you're insecure that's a problem that's
not my problem when la had the best time ever with my team we had the most incredible time
you know met the most incredible people came back most incredible campaign and i felt good but had i let that
man sway me maybe i i may have been a bit vulnerable
at the time and let's say he did sway me what if i changed my eye and didn't go that could have happened
was he intimidated by you and your success do you think at the beginning yeah 100
let's be honest i'm 20 oh my god i'm 26. i'm 26. i was still 24. i'm
26 years old and you are killing the game i'll say it because i know you're too humble
no i no no no no no no no i said it it's fine you didn't you
say whatever you want but it's not even that it's you know when you're 26 years old and maybe you have a few things
um people start to obviously feel a bit like you know i think it was
people start to feel like they should have them i say something when you talk about your success i get
awkward don't i i'm super awkward and i'll can i just say an observation and i think this is
a society problem not you problem men aren't like that no they're not i love coming up on here
and saying how much money they're making and how much they're killing it how many x wins that they've achieved um you
don't seem to be as comfortable talking about your success and i feel like that's a reflection of the society we live in
uh honestly it's not even that it's me i'm very awkward with stuff like that like can i be honest i don't even check my
bank accounts i let my account and deal with it i i i don't i i think for me i stay so
tunnel vision and the vision so i wake up in the morning the first thing i do is check
my mentions and dms and go on my community pages in that forum that's literally the first
thing i do and if i start thinking about how am i going to make a billion how am i going
to do this i'm going to do that i don't know it becomes a bit suffocating to the vision that you have
um and i was really number driven at the beginning not financially but on instagram followers
and followers the more followers it means i'm amazing the more likes it means i'm fit enough to be here
you know and i got so obsessed i used to almost like not think i was good enough unless i got a certain amount of likes
or followers and i completely lost sight of why i'm doing what i'm doing you know now i don't even check the
likes i get i don't even check the the my statistics my team do i don't check it because i don't care
what i care about is that comment that a lady saying to me oh my god this has helped me so much
this has made me so confident that feeds my energy if i start thinking
how am i going to get 100 million how am i going to juice that will come i'm confident it will
come but it's not my fundamental you know and it's going to be focusing
on something else yeah i'm focused on something else and it's not that society has made me feel uncomfortable to talk about my success
Are you hard to date
it's that i've you can speak to any of my team like i just don't care about it can i be honest
with you like i am not thriving to
i don't know i'm not i'm not thriving to have the biggest house or the fanciest car
i mean i even said to you like i don't have a fancy car a fancy house by the way and you were like i don't care yeah you
know like i don't really care about stuff like that i never i never have been like that
and it's not that i'm trying to be humble it's like i literally don't give a [ __ ] i don't care about a fancy car never
have done on the things that you do care about you talked about these comments and these dms you get um
i imagine you know because i get a couple dms as well you get a lot not a couple you get a lot
and uh how how does it feel to have that sort of responsibility when someone messages
you something so deeply personal and that they're seeking advice or guidance or they're just
sharing a problem with you how does that feel in terms of well how does it make you feel um
when can i message sometimes because you know what to say because i'm not qualified to deal with
certain situations but at the same time the contradiction with me is like you're giving that advice
something yeah and i just want to acknowledge the person but i know i can't so and it would be almost irresponsible for me to try and solve
their problem 100 you're not there to fix someone's problems yeah but but i think the value that i can bring is
just by like listening and acknowledging but you know there's a spectrum right so you have on one end i love what you do
in the other end you have people that are suicidal or that are you know and um it's it sometimes it's a lot i
had this one video go viral 30 million views and it was about depression and i got 8 000 dm's that week from
people on that spectrum and i just didn't know what to do i was like because when you read them some people
are really really suffering and they've come to me because clearly in some cases one girl that said she'd
barricaded herself in a room in egypt and she was on the verge of suicide like
she didn't feel like she could speak to anyone else and sometimes a stranger yeah is the the most safe place to you
know how does it feel that that has kind of made me emotional no it didn't i did the funny thing to that i remembered
that instantly this girl barricaded in a room in egypt who would watch this video and had reached out to me to for me to
give her the answer she's looking for in her life which i'm not qualified to give right all i can do is
be a friend in that in that situation um but but i'm sure you get messages that are you know yeah i get um messages
every day thousands and um so there's two things that i've started
to do one of the biggest teams we have at tone and sculpt is the customer support team right
and by the way this isn't because we get influxes of emails it's because we have a person for each
social facebook community manager instagram all of this stuff and the reason being is we don't need
them it's because i want every single person to be heard and what you just said that
is exactly what i think as well you want to be a friend i call my community familia
i always use that word i always say you're my sisters you're my familia
because at the end of the day i'm not here to fix your problems but i'm here to listen to your problems i'm here to be the friend that you may
think you don't have in in your reality you can't fix someone's problems you
can't offer you know mental health advice because if you say something wrong god forbid anything happened but you can
listen you can make feel make someone feel like they're part of something and that's the best thing i can do you
know yeah and you know i was i was thinking then as well about the previous topic we had i rarely switched back
but before you came here today there was a question i actually wanted to ask you about because i only ask questions because i am
curious myself sure and i'm trying to i think the reason i ask these questions is i'm trying to find similarities in some way
between a you know a person on your journey and a personal mind the question is are you hard to date
today was one of those days in my life where i'm filming this podcast with chrissy i've got a ton of things going on i've got tons and tons of emails
i'm sprinting around and like usual in my crazy crazy world i am neglecting my nutrition something that i
i have done for probably the last decade and this is why huel sponsored this podcast and why i've
been a huge customer for about three years and why when i was looking for a partner to work with on this podcast hill was the
company that came to mind it's a company that helped me with my nutrition and for me to stay sort of
nutritionally complete as is huel itself despite the fact that i have a crazy
crazy unfi predictable unforgiving schedule and um i love it and it's it's such a
pleasure to get to have a podcast and to have a partner in huel and then julian who is the founder and ceo
where i can talk about it and the benefits it gives to me in such an authentic way if you've not tried huel and you are
someone that frequently neglects your diet whether it's through busyness whether you forget to have meals because
of whatever's going on in your life i implore you just to try it just to check it out um they and heal
comes in many different like shapes and sizes there's the powder they've got like the savory meals now and they have the bottles
and for me i've always loved the bottles um so it's yeah it's a pleasure that
you'll sponsor this podcast and support us in this mission and they're the reason that we're going to be scaling this podcast up
big time i was just chatting to um chatting to some of the production crew that worked with me and jack and dom
and i was saying that um now we have a partner on the podcast we can really take this up a level
Your parents
you've seen me taken up one level this season already we're gonna take it up even further and that's in terms of production in terms
of the guests in terms of what we can invest into this into this um piece of content so thank you to huel check it
out try the chocolate flavor let me know what you think if you are a hula gun right and um i appreciate you listening
back to the podcast the question is are you hard to date
um oh [ __ ] yeah i think so i think i am i'm not gonna lie
like okay so here's the thing right i'm super loving when i'm with you i'll do anything for
you like i'll look after you i'll make you feel special
it's gonna be like but if you like it but no no like honestly like even i
i can honestly say like even sarah and my pa will tell you like i fall hard in love yeah
i head over heels for someone i'll fall so hard for you um but i also fall so
hard out of love for you oh [ __ ] that's the issue of me and that's
facts and i hate that about myself so much it's the one thing i hate the
most about myself i'm a switch you do something to annoy me or you do something to kind of like
it's bad it's not healthy like i people think i'm superwoman i've got my
own problems this like i want my own issues i feel so in love
with someone and then if i don't see that same level of love back i'm like [ __ ] this [ __ ] self-defense
yeah i do think in relationships i'm really i'm really defensive and you know what i can't believe i'm
admitting all this but yeah i i would say i am and i think that um what are you defending yourself from
i don't know okay why are you are you hard to date yeah okay so so are you defensive
christy this is all about your diary well come to me no i want to know what you're defending yourself from
because you you literally said if i didn't get the same type of love back
okay okay so you're obviously very motivated you're very inspired you're very like
driven right thanks you're welcome i'm the same like i just want to keep going
i want to grind i want to grind so if i see someone kind of just not doing the same
infuriates me like i'm almost like how can you not have passion for something how can you not
have a try for something and then it leads me to believe that hold on a minute if i did have the same
person that had the same level of drive would we be compatible maybe i do need someone a little bit
more like low-key because then it will make me feel a bit calmer when i'm home it's all over the gap i don't know what
i want women don't know what they want stop asking women what we want we don't know what we want
we don't know what we want but what i can say is i think sometimes when we overthink
things especially me i overthink relationships all the freaking time i think sometimes
it's a good idea to just take a step back and just relax a bit because if someone is genuinely there
for you willing to listen willing to take care of you and willing to always always put effort
in stop being a [ __ ] pretty much you know i i
me personally i'm i'm difficult to stay i'm not gonna lie i'm not gonna lie i don't even feel bad
saying that i felt quite free saying that like i'm i'm difficult today so no one said you should feel bad no i
i am and i i feel bad for the guy but so i really want to dig into that because i can
really really relate and that's why i started laughing because i've gone over the same predicament in my head thinking maybe i need someone
that's super ambitious and has loads of passions and there's a flagship person and then i thought but then maybe they'd drive me crazy because you know and then
so i flip-flop and usually when i'm with one i think i want the other same and then yeah and then when with
that i'm like nope yeah that's literally me yeah i'll
like maybe we can figure this out today i honestly can't and i think you know what it is
i think it's because we are people that are constantly switched on yeah like
neurotic obsessive obsessive like with work with this with that i'm not obsessive in a relationship
like if someone tries to tell me what to do with my life i'd be like no way and i couldn't imagine ever
trying to tell someone what to do with their life like if you want to do whatever you do whatever you want to do that's your life
you live it the way you want to live it um so because i'm obsessive with my life and my career
i'm constantly switched on so if someone around me isn't i almost feel
like i don't know she doesn't think they're a bum
oh my god i think that's true
it's true yes i know it's so true and then do you find yourself
feeling a bit lazy yeah but also i i'm like steve don't tell him because you're
passing your own world view and your own values onto someone else who doesn't want it yeah and you
shouldn't be trying to change people out here you accept them oh my god that is me i'm literally like
what do you mean you don't want to be ambitious in life what do you mean you don't have a passion what do you mean and i go crazy in my
head and this is happening in my head whilst i'm looking at the meat do you know what i mean like let's say
i'm like let's say we're we're at dinner i'm having a full-on-blown conversation in my head like what do you mean i'm not
ambitious what do you mean you don't want this and he's just chilling you know you're not doing anything wrong and then i have to let you take a
breather and be like what am i doing i can't i can't push that on to someone i can only push that onto myself i need to
chill out connected to this maybe maybe not your parents hard working oh my god so hard working
um came from another country came from another country um immigrated at the back of the lorry
you know i immigrated back of banana lorry yeah and um i remember we landed in
france and my family got arrested because we were immigrants and they separated us so they put
me my my brother in one room my dad in another room he could see him through the glass and i remember crying and crying and
crying like dad dad dad i didn't know what's going on i was four years old but i still remember that i'll never
forget the the prison room was turquoise i'll never forget that and when we came
to this country my mom and dad worked hard my mom worked three jobs my dad worked
as a hb1 lorry driver every single night you know every penny they had they saved
they saved they saved um my dad had a pretty bad gambling problem
The pressure on women
i'm gonna be honest my mum was constantly trying to like fix that problem and
i've never actually mentioned that ever before ever and as much as i love my dad with
my entire heart and and i want nothing more for him to be happy it caused a lot of strain on my mum
like trying to feed her family trying to like work hard trying to save trying to take us on holiday you know
um so to save money and then to have the person you love gambling away it's like
what's the point like i don't understand why i'm with this person but in my culture you don't leave the man you're
with you're stuck with them but my mum even though he was like that my mum
loved and loves my dad so much it's pretty bizarre because that would be enough to take
anyone off but she just believed in him he doesn't do any more believed in him and nourished him and
loved him so much and together they grew better um
so for me if i have a man and he like places a bet on something
it triggers me to think he's going to be gambling and i'm like oh my god no sorry out he's put one bet down and i
think he's canvased you know what i mean it's crazy so i asked that question for a reason gone
um because we've we've established that we have very much similar traits and relationships that we
we tend to really value hard work and ambition and it tends to be the case
that the value we attribute to hard work and ambition probably comes from a childhood where um
hard work and ambition were the thing that might have got us out of some [ __ ] let me
tell you from my example all right so very much the same as yours but switch the parents so i came from
africa i was born in africa came to the uk my dad had like a pretty good job but my mom you could all call it a gambling
addiction she had this she has both gambling addiction on one hand because she played
there was probably a thousand lottery tickets if i opened any drawer in our house okay but on the other hand she she was
she was she couldn't stop starting businesses to the point that the reason why we were so poor we never
had birthdays or christmases or went on holiday at all ever period was because my mom spent all the money trying to become a millionaire
by starting these businesses they'd all fail within six months because she can't read or write and my dad was the unconditionally
loving calm supportive won't leave you even though you're an absolute [ __ ] parent right so there's one yeah so in my house i
think when i think about why i am the way i am now i think money was such a big problem
that in our house it was the cause of so much pain mm-hmm same that i grew up valuing it so much and the thing that
would get you it which would to me would be like you know my what i thought was happiness was like hard work ambition like my
parents worked so hard that they wouldn't even be that in the house when i went to bed or when i woke up and so i value hard work and ambition
because my parents taught me it because it was the cure to our problems right so and especially as immigrants
right there's a different there's like an immigrant vibe i get you yeah i get you don't we don't even have to talk about i
just get you so like this is part of the reason why i think in relationships when someone doesn't have those values when they
The bullshit of being an entrepreneur
don't value hard work and ambition i'm like what the [ __ ] is wrong with you yeah there's probably something wrong with me
i don't think there's anything wrong with you i think i i'm i'm not going to sit here and think
there's something wrong with me not wrong it's like it's the result of my traum my traumatic childhood experience maybe i
wouldn't change it for the world do you know what it is i swear to god i think it's it's the fact
that okay so a lot of people
when we moved to england i was never allowed to like go to stay over other friends houses my dad
is super strict like i couldn't even wear skirts around him absolutely not forbidden and so when i
did used to go to my other friends houses like english culture it was a completely different vibe like
their family was different like their moms and dads were different and then when i'd come to my house it
was different and i didn't understand it so my dad has always wanted me to marry an albanian
man it's like his dream he's like please marry an albanian man you two will be amazing together like
this and i'm like dad i don't care what he is so long as i'm in love
and it happens to be that the guys i've been with have been english and the cultures are completely
different and it it i don't understand like sometimes when they do things i
don't understand examples like okay so in my household mediterranean loud
proud like very like good really yeah super loud i am super loud i love it
but you know you come to my house and my mum will have dinner ready for you my mom will buy you slippers to make you
feel like home you know and she'll she'll welcome you hug you kiss you on each cheek
but then when i'd go to jack's families for example as much as they were so loving so caring it just wasn't the same
like you'd have dinner different times or and i didn't understand it because i've been brought up in a family where
everything's together like togetherness and everyone's got each other's backs and everyone's solid so
to have a different culture thrown into the mix sometimes it does clash and it does like
cultures are different but that doesn't mean one culture is better it just means it's different
so it's up to you whether you want to learn both cultures and and meet in the middle it would be
easier if i went for an albanian guy because their cult culture is the same and i've been brought up in that culture
but obviously jack's culture is completely different so i've had to kind of like
you know find the middle find that that middle ground i guess i don't know
what you call it but find that balance are you scared that you might not ever
meet the right person all the time i'm all the time scared i'm 26 years old and as women we're told
we have a time frame if you're not 30 you have kids you're too old if you if you have kids at 40
what kind of mum are you all this bloody [ __ ] around us all the time see how much pressure that adds as
a woman all the time so much pressure you got to get married you got to have kids you got
to be a mom you got to be a mum before 30. oh that's when i like
breathe out so much pressure and it petrifies me it honestly petrifies me because a lot
of people around me in my industry are married or i'll have children or have like
a fiance and i had that and i almost think to myself i had that and i let that go
and sometimes you you think do you know and this is probably i'm asking this question again for my own reasons so
you do you ever consider the fact that you might be too busy being entrepreneur no you're never too
busy for someone you love i don't think that's the case i don't think um
i'm too busy you think you're what you're doing with with your businesses and as an entrepreneur might prevent you um being
uh aware and forming a healthy relationship when the prospect arises
do you know what i think it is when you have a nine to five you clock out you come home you switch
off you don't clock out you're working constantly even if you're in this room
you're still at the back of your head thinking about your business you're thinking about something you need to do something
to check off something you need to approve something to expand on so it's it's so guilty for me to say
this i feel bad saying it but i could be in a room with you and i'm thinking about my companies constantly and someone who has a nine to
five doesn't understand that because it's like you're switched off at five
and sometimes i feel bad saying i do kind of wish i can switch off at 5 p.m
but i just can't and i think it's not necessarily i'm too busy at some constantly thinking
even if i'm in the room with you i'm constantly thinking about what i have to do you can make someone feel pretty lonely just by being even if you're sat next to
them yeah you're often you know yeah i often say i say like when i'm with somebody my aim isn't for them to ever understand
me it's just to understand that they don't understand yeah because i think i'm like too difficult to understand if i'm quiet for an hour it
doesn't mean i don't love you it means that i've just got an email so true and it's just [ __ ] me and i actually don't want to always share
things at home because you're offloading yeah you're offloading and i don't want to be back because i could offload 24
7. oh trust me so can i sarah's always like oh here we go again um but it's
true like you know your phone is buzzing off constantly you could get a dm by someone you could
you could get a message an email and it's like oh [ __ ] really and you're just sitting watching a movie
with your partner tell me about that part of being an entrepreneur i think that's why i really started the podcast in the first place was
i want to hear about the [ __ ] of running a business the unexpected unpredictable
life-shifting [ __ ] that happens yeah your life is you breathe and you
live your businesses i think this is something people don't understand you live and you breathe your companies they are
your babies no one and nothing can get in the way and no one understands that they see the
money the success the followers the this the that the blingy cars whatever the hell you want to see and
let me tell you the reality you don't have much time you suck at relationships
you don't have many friends and the friends that you have you don't really see them um when you do have time to yourself
you never switch off ever you are the biggest self-critic ever
you constantly think that you could be doing better and that pressure is insane mentally and physically it
drains you and um another thing is that i really just want to say um if you think a life of an
entrepreneur is so glamorous this is the first time i've put on jeans
in i would say i'm blessed i feel privileged i don't know how long but i don't live
in jeans i live in sweats and sliders so if it sucks so much it doesn't suck and you know what i'm trying to say yeah
i know exactly what you're saying but i'm also here to to try and help people understand multiple perspectives because people say
okay so you've criticized you know you've talked not criticized but you've talked about the downsides right why'd you still do it because you could
My battle with depression
just say do you know what i killed it hang up your your gym yeah your active wear clothes
oh your shoes i don't know what people would say and you could say that's it i'm done why don't you
oh no why not gosh the feeling i get when i
when i see someone's transformation nah that fills me up like
that fuels me when i see a transformation when i see someone who
had um a mental a mental health disorder or an eating disorder and has is now thriving
do you know that is so unexplainable that nothing else
matters i'd rather not have a relationship to be frank with you
i really am not that fast so long as i can continue to help as many women as
possible for me that's enough and that's why i don't stop is there an endpoint in all this i hope
not okay there's no like mountain top there's no no i i think that
you know you're you're told in life that you need to go to school you need to go to university you need to achieve this
right so then you achieve this and you are not satisfied so you need to
achieve this and then this and then this i don't have
goals for financial status for awards for anything like that
i had maybe two goals and i've achieved one of them which i won't share because it's
actually very top secret but you'll see it next year okay um but
if you have these um tangible goals i'm thinking now what it is i'm like you finally married an
albanian man i'm like what oh yes daddy i did no no
i didn't i didn't no i'm not married nope that's actually very depressing thank you
um but no it's like you you goals are like you you know when you
wrote in your diary i want a range rover right you got a ranger or what then just total anti-climax
yeah well i want a million dollar house cool what then you're lonely in your house
your house is so big you don't know what to do with it by the way my house is not so big i don't want to do it i need more
space but you see what i'm saying so i don't have those types of goals because they're not attainable
is there a point in when you're building the businesses you run where you had your worst ever day because i
can think about the worst days that i've had in business what was the what was the one that sprung to mind straight away
oh god um okay so when i'm i'm a woman in tech right so
with an app there's complications that you are not even prepared for there's maybe a bug maybe this maybe
that so obviously when this lawsuit was happening to get my app back um from the developers from
the old developers it was a third party company and when we transferred it to brand new
servers that are obviously you know pretty much ours um
because servers are just so huge but um i didn't know anything about tech when i
started now you speak to me tech i know tech language okay so it's actually i'm very proud
because for someone who literally didn't understand what the hell the server was i was like what's the first time you heard about it there's a bug did you
think oh lady bird i honestly don't like it's embarrassing but when the transition happened the
Somethings going to have to give in my life
whole app went right shut down and imagine when you know when instagram shuts down people
like oh my god instagram sucks like fu instagram okay but
this is my company now so when it shuts down it's like i can't i can't i can't pay
for my employees i can't pay for my office i can't do this i can't do that when it shut down my whole face shut
down with it i was like [ __ ] what do i do now this is it we lost 10
000 subscribers in one day okay you times 10 000 by 13.99
yeah it's a lot of [ __ ] money a lot of money in one day gone gone that was probably the one of the
worst days and i just sat back and i looked at jack and i just said to him
what the [ __ ] do we do now jack b and jack he was like don't worry
we'll gain them back on don't worry why are you stressing this is what happens well would you be while we're stressing
idiot what do you mean he's like chill out but um
yeah that was probably the worst day and i just remember i i lost so much weight right i lost
i would say i was 56 kilograms i went down to 49 in like 56
yeah i went down to 49. seven kilograms yeah but i went down to 49 so can you
imagine in what space of time um three weeks to four weeks i couldn't keep anything on i wasn't
eating i wasn't sleeping i lost everything then me and jack parted so
and i was still producing videos still producing content still how long was the up down for it was down
for three days three days and i was still producing content going on instagram don't worry
guys like we'll still get out there i wasn't eating wasn't sleeping wasn't doing anything i just broken up the person i was going to
marry i was in a house with my dog the house that i built with the man i was supposed
to be with i didn't know what the hell i was doing anymore at that point i thought i thought i should give up not gonna lie
but yeah i was like this is it now no no i'm giving up i've got my law degree i'm
gonna go back to doing that this is just too much stress and then i did and i just kept going
just kept going something inside me was like you just have to keep going please don't give up please don't give up chrissy
you talked about um your own battles with mental health um over the years i think i think i read
that you you said you'd suffered with depression at various stages yeah early on can you
tell me about that yeah huge like i mean
a lot of people see a very picture-perfect image on instagram which
i'm to blame just like everybody else you want to you want to showcase the best bits of you nothing wrong with that you keep doing
you if that works you keep doing you but i have been in such
dark places that i couldn't i couldn't picture wanting anyone
to feel what i felt in those places even someone i resent not that i resent anyone but i
wouldn't even want that for them these dark places suck you in so much that you honestly start to contemplate
whether you just want to stop feeling that feeling period like just be done with it
and i'll never forget i was laying in bed one day and i was so
depressed so depressed that i just thought to myself it'd be so much easier if i wasn't here
that's so much easier just quit just leave
and i cried myself to sleep and i woke up the next morning and it almost felt like in my dream i'd made it happen
if you know what i'm trying to say without saying it and i just thought
i need to stop because i cannot go on like this and i think when i try and explain to
people i've i know those dark places i've been in those dark places they don't believe me because they see me for
the person i am today they don't see the person that fought so hard to be
where i am today mentally not even about the success the business is mentally that's the most important thing up here
this is the most important thing you can have all the money in the world all the businesses in the world you can
have 300 employees multiple companies who gives a [ __ ] about that if you up
here are so not okay so yeah i've been through dark places but
i've also picked myself up multiple times and i've had to brush my shoulders off and get [ __ ] done
and that's why i keep saying to every single person out there you have to do this for you do this for
you this is the the biggest and most important thing i can say to you
and now that you have you know you've built this empire this little fitness empire which is rapidly growing do you ever find
yourself in those dark places even today yeah not as bad um
but i find myself um i find myself wondering if
i'll ever have like a somewhat normal life so like what we discussed
will i ever find someone again will i be in love will i get married will i have children like i want
children i want to be married i believe in those things i want those things but sometimes i wonder if those things
are going to happen for me and i do wonder i just maybe need to stop overcomplicating things in my
mind but i can't switch off and maybe the only way i know to switch off is just to quit
you see what i'm saying it's a vicious circle but if i quit i'll be so angry at myself for quitting it's like
ongoing it's constant it doesn't stop so um and do you think part of
that fear comes from the fact that you believe the way you are now and how you live and work now and how
obsessive you are now is probably not like conducive or um
it's probably not going to allow that other all those other things you want to yeah to come true right so like you
think well something's going to have to give at some point is that i do i'm not going to i i literally think like that i'm not gonna lie like
so when when toner scope was built um we i didn't i honestly
didn't realize it would grow the speed it did with little to absolutely no marketing expenditure
so everything's been hyper organic in the space of 12 months we now have a team of 22
people when it was just me and jack 12 months ago 22 people an office in
in in london we know what the rent is like in london it's off the chain um 120 growth
you know month by month it's rapid growth we've just launched a brand new trainer
um who is like insane and um i keep saying to myself okay when
i get to this point i can relax and i say that to sarah all the time
i keep saying i keep mentioning sarah but but because she is the one person that knows me probably better than my own
blood because she's with me everywhere i go and she is the person i speak to about a lot of things
so i always say to okay when i get to this point with tone and scope i can breathe and bless her she's like
yeah yeah she knows in her head i want more and i want more but it's not i want more it's that i
believe we can do more and i believe we can do more and strive for more so when does it end
when does it end it doesn't end that's what i'm trying to say so you have to make peace with it
you have to make peace with the fact that it's not supposed to end but you also have to make peace with the
Are you scared of death
fact that you need to make maybe some self self self-adjustments and and be a bit
critical with yourself because if you're going in a relationship and constantly thinking that that person should be on your level
that's that's my problem i need to deal with that's not their problem you know it's not fair on them how'd you
deal with that i think it i think it takes time i think you're not sure are you
no i'm not sure about your body language oh god i figured that one out it's okay
to not have it figured out right i don't have it figured out and i'm someone who doesn't like not having things figured out
right yeah yeah i get that um but i do think i need to stop being so mean
it's this balance right between trying to figure it out now because you kind of want to be able to have a plan and have
you know but then also realizing that you shouldn't overthink this thing and that you should maybe just you've
literally made me feel in this podcast like i'm the most impossible person to be with i'm not i'm just asking the questions oh
no no i can't lie i'm not going to lie just to make myself sound good no it's it's a very important part of being
a successful person that it has this crazy neurotic obsessive brain yeah i do ambitious and that's but also
has these other things they want and life is a drop at you you can't have everything at the same time so what we're talking about now is like
compromising how you reach that compromise in your life if possible i'm in the same place i have no idea how
that's gonna happen but do you do you want kids i do want kids do you want to get married um i'm not so concerned about
the concept of marriage but i want to have a long-term partner because i want to have kids and so i'm willing to commit long-term
if it's a marriage if it's signing some other piece of paper if there's no paper i like don't really care too much about the whole marriage
thing if it matters so much to the partner i'll do it but i don't i was saying on
the last podcast no i see what you mean i don't have a great case for why the law or or a religion should be involved
in love i don't think it has a great track record with love yeah so i'm like i think that's an idea which we all as a society need to just
reconsider yeah what you mean like i'm gonna my closing statement on this point is we are all so different you are
different from me only a little bit but then like you're different from your assistant and i'm different from mine and
my friends from school so logically you would think the answer to how we form our romantic connections
would also be unique and different like and i think at any time in life where the script tells you everyone has to go
through this door when you are a different shape it's like putting a triangle in a square
like of course i think that's when you have to question things so i got kicked out of school because i just stopped going dropped out of university after one
lecture and i've tried to navigate my life my way through life just rejecting the things that i meant to just accept
blindly and marriage is one of them where i'm like can i achieve all the things i want to in a relationship without that
paper yeah and i put on my linkedin last week i said um i basically said to the world i think marriage is
a concept we need to reconsider for everyone someone proved me wrong and one guy commented he said i've been
in a marriage for 45 years we love each other we've done this i said could you have done that without the marriage
yes okay then yeah so but you would do it if she or i don't know he whatever maybe
but then i need to be honest here because you know if they really wanted to get married i'd ask them why they really wanted to
get married i'm not gonna lie i am the same like for me a piece of paper doesn't define my love for you
okay let's talk about this then so why do you why do you want to get married do you know what it is like this is me
being a woman i just really want to dress we can do the wedding like that's marriage is different from a
wedding in a ceremony someone said that on my post yeah i guess yeah i mean look
my my dream wedding would genuinely be like on the beach having like burgers and beers with the
closest friends and families running in the ocean i don't want it like a big fancy party i feel like you just described
your dream day yeah literally if you could do that like this week but if i said to you because you're
so busy if i said to you what's what do you want to do right now i bet anyone and you'd say you know what i'd
love to be on the sofa and just eat my favorite food for the people i love yeah of course right of course yeah over
going out getting smashed of course that's what i'm saying but a lot of people the only thing is my brain is like go on your laptop and check your
emails see that's what i mean because you're upset because i love it you know what i mean yeah but
what i'm saying is to other people they want a big wedding a big big fuss i hate fuss
i absolutely hate fuss over me and it's so funny because like even my team surprise premier surprise birthday party
i was so awkward i was like don't ever do that again i i hate all eyes on me yes although my
business is built on all eyes on me do you see how that's so contradictory it's the same i used to my previous
assistant um who ended up being my girlfriend long [ __ ] story which we're not going to go into whoa
i don't actually know if sophie so my current assistant sophie's been with me for four years i know she knows this but sophie do you
know this do i do have i ever said to you when it's my birthday or when it's like social change
anniversary to not make a fuss about it and the reason why i say this is because i get so much attention as it is
and so much fuss for like being the founder being the ceo the eyes are always on me you just don't want it you're like no no
no no yeah the same right i'm the same and i always just feel like
oh i don't know so that's why my dream wedding day if that day will come is to just
oh my god 20 30 people max closest friends and families my my dog
there and just to have the person i love and i always say i want to be in a room
full of people and look at the person i love and just me and him understand each other you know what i mean that feeling where you look at them
and you're just like i get you i get you and that's that's what i crave
that's what i want and you're right a piece of paper doesn't define that feeling only
you define that feeling in that person so i don't need a piece of paper you're right um i guess i just want the concept
are you scared of death who me no not at all
hear me no i'm not i'm i'm not are you no i'm not no
i'm not like um i'm scared of not living yes i'm scared of like i really want to
do things i want to explore i want to do things i want to you know my my dream vacation
would be to not have my phone there i don't care about a selfie i don't care about this i just want to be
present in the moment and if i if i told you that you were going to die a week from now what would you so much
what would you regret so much tell me not living just working there you go not living like
as much as i love doing what i l what i do i'm not gonna lie i i've built what i've built telling
people to look after themselves and i forget to look after myself and
that's why when i do train and when i exercise it's the only time i do feel like i'm
doing something really special for myself and i've like i do a lot of skipping right amazing at skipping by the way
thank you i watched you the other day i was like oh my god did you like i thought i was a good skipper no and i saw you like dancing while skipping and
i was like oh she's [ __ ] of course she's doing like a double crossover and i just had to i started to feel really inadequate and
insecure as a man it was fine so i just had it it happens all the time
but you know why i skip why is that uh you have to be [ __ ] present
because if you're not present you get whipped right and when i'm skipping
i literally feel like i can't think about anything else but the rhythm and for someone who's always on switched
on someone who's always doing things you know people always tell me go go meditate do yoga can i [ __ ]
yeah can i [ __ ] i'm like i let you go to meditate and i'm thinking about my my to-do list like but when i'm
skipping i'm so engrossed in it yeah that i'm literally so present in the moment
and it makes me feel alive same thing with training i'm so engrossed in training
and that's why so many women when i say to them just train you're a mom you got to think about your children you're you're a student you've
Having friends as an entrepreneur
got to think about your studies you're trying to trying to make money because you don't know when you're going to pay
your rent just train it's the one moment that you can ignore the entire world
and do something for yourself so i really want to loot background to this
point about if you were to die next week oh you were trying to avoid it yeah i was because you know the answer
yeah but i want to hear the answer because i'm asking this i would feel the same way right maybe
feel awkward my palms are sweating it makes you feel a little bit uncomfortable right it does because i
love my job so much like i love what i do it it i thrive off it
but on the flip side i do wish i was so i'll stop being such an annoying
little [ __ ] and just take some time off for myself you know let's stop being so annoying to yourself chrissy just take
some time off it's okay it's okay to go do things you love doing like traveling obviously right now it's
pandemic but you know what i'm trying to say like travel like maybe take a week off and just
breathe um but i can't i can't i don't know what's wrong with
me i just can't are you the same i'm the same is there something
again i'm just exploring this is there something strange about that where you feel like you know you're saying you're saying i can't it's
like you don't have a choice but at the same time you're telling me that if you were to die next week you would regret not living
yeah oh my god this is such a heavy-laded question um
i feel like i feel like this is the therapy session i needed
but it's it's so true what you've just said you've literally just you've shut me up you've shut me up
because i can't you're like like [ __ ] [ __ ] shut her up but it's true like
i can't stop working because something keeps telling me i can't stop
right now not yet but on the flip side if i was to die next week
i'd regret not taking some time off for myself to do the things that i love doing i love going to museums
no one knows that a lot i literally love looking at things but you think that's a
waste of time i do right now right now yeah and time is
every entrepreneur's biggest asset time is everything how could it possibly
be a waste of time if it's the thing you would regret the the reason why i think this death question is so revealing
is they they do all of these there's a a lady called bonnie ware who was um she
worked with um i think it's called palliative patients which are people that are about to die they've gone home to die and she asked
them the question what are your biggest regrets and she wrote it down and she was doing this for years and she wrote a blog about it
and there's a certain sort of retrospective clarity you'll get in that moment when there is nothing
going forward for your life about how you should have made your decisions in that moment you can imagine
only the things that matter people what that girl said about your hair none of this [ __ ] won't [ __ ] matter
the playground [ __ ] none of it will matter you'll just be left with the things that truly mattered and so putting yourself in that mindset
i call it like deathbed thinking allows you to look at how you're living your life now and see if it's in
accordance with the things that will matter in that like final moment and so
i asked this question because i think the same about me i'm like if you told me today i had four days left to live i'd be like
why didn't i have a better relationship with my family yeah why didn't i go see my niece i don't have a relationship with my brother
well yeah you know i have a [ __ ] relationship with my with my mom in particular yeah i don't see my niece and my two nieces
enough i've probably seen them i know three or four times she's maybe three years old she's only two hours away and so i think these
things about myself and i think okay so but what are you sacrificing have you made a change
because no one's ever asked me that see the question is now you've asked yourself that i think it'll always be there but but it
won't be but no one's ever asked me that so now you've got me thinking oh [ __ ] i need to get sarah to put me holiday because
[ __ ] me i need to live my life but it's like in all honesty i'll probably leave today
and keep doing what i'm doing day in day out until at some point you'll learn this lesson the hard way
facts and you know um recently one of the most important people of my life passed away
the woman that gave me a home you know um you know you know you know my best my
best friend holly who is literally my sister her mom gave me a home when i was homeless
and you know she didn't once mentioned the months she left let me live there
the food i ate the hot water i used not once ever brought it up and i saw her on her
dying bed right and i held her hand and i just kept thinking to myself
nothing matters at this point and you know what holly said to me she goes i would have called you sooner but i was scared you were doing
something and at that point i i it hit me like
i looked down i went never say that again you call me when you need me i'm always there for you but it's the
fact that we've the people around us know how busy we are that they sometimes feel like oh maybe i just shouldn't
the most important people even my mom doesn't know she goes i don't call you babe it's okay i know how busy
you are and i say so no you call me when you want me and you need me and it's not that you've told people not
to call you right it's that they think that you're just so busy that it'll be a
disruption because you've made them feel that way yeah yeah i'm to blame 100
and you know you have to take a step back and you have to realize what matters in life
and that for me that moment there i just realized to
What are you working on?
myself and i messaged every single person i loved the most and i said i don't care how busy i am i'm
always here for you always so that's a real personal moment for your best friend and i'm
i imagine you said earlier that you don't have many friends um i have acquaintances but like
close friends you know like friends no i don't think i don't think a lot of people do that if
you really like ask i don't have many friends yeah like i have people
that are there like acquaintances and i have people that i would genuinely die for those are my friends you know and i can
count them on my hand polly is one of them other people have more friends is that a fair statement
typically yeah sure but i don't really care if you have more friends than me to be honest i'm happy with the people i
have because you have more friends with me doesn't make you more superior or makes you a better person because you have
more people around you it's just you know i'm only 26 i don't know how many friends
i'm going to have at 62. so i have friends do you see what i'm saying
probably less maybe yeah according to the days maybe but at the same time i couldn't
have asked for better friends that i have now and the friends i have now would protect me and look after me and they know i
would do anything for them that's what matters not having a hundred friends i want one
good friend not a hundred random friends so i i asked that question because i think i've definitely struggled to
make and to hold on to friendships because of the way i've been over the last decade in the same way relation like normal
relationships i found that i don't invest enough in my friendships as much as i probably
should okay i'm going to be completely honest um people come and go right
people come and go and it's so bizarre because i know it sounds crazy but i've pretty
much built a virtual community right and i feel like
that's my team even though i may have not met these women physically i feel like they
get me more than the people in my own life is that weird do you think that's weird
you think it's a bit weird don't you be honest i don't know if it's like i speak it's
unusual it's a very curious thing you've just said yeah like
you should i don't know if you've ever seen or maybe not but when i go on a live
workout and i work out with with with hundreds of thousands of women i don't see them they see me but i feel
the energy i i can't explain it to you i i sound crazy right now and people probably
think i'm an absolute crazy psycho weirdo but let them think what they want when i'm like
reading a dm right or when i'm going live for a workout or when i add a new workout on and when i repost people
because you you see i repost a lot of people right um and half the time i don't even tag tony
sculpt i just repost the woman with a sweaty selfie or whatever and
that to me i almost feel like that's enough friends like i have friends for life this is my family my unit my team
my tribe and as crazy as i may sound
i feel like that tribe understands me more than the people in my life so that's when i go on social media and you
see me understand that's me because i feel like we're friends and you get me and
it's crazy because they do get me and i get them they get my sense of humour they get me
trying to dance on camera and be stupid i don't care i sometimes forget i have 2.3 million
followers and i come friends well i sometimes forget right have you seen that i come online and i don't have makeup on
i forget i genuinely forget and i'm like oh [ __ ] my skin's a bit crusty right now
and i just posted that to 2.3 million people what's my crazy ass thinking
and i sit back and i'm like oh okay i don't care but the nature of the internet is that you would of course
you've got 2.3 million people there's a lot of people in there that are hurting themselves and that want to make you feel like [ __ ] too
can i be honest i'm very lucky really yeah i'm very lucky man i
don't get much negativity i don't and when i do
um if like someone's been horrible on a post because i have i have a big
insecurity about my boobs all right like they're they're saggy i'll say it
and cool i've always had a big insecurity about it i remember this one one girl just ripped them to shreds she
was just like ill like they look disgusting and saggy i didn't even see the comment
until i started seeing the community members reply back to her now there's a difference between
replying back to someone and being like you need to stop that was hurtful and then replying back meanly if you're replying back me that's not nice like
you you don't cure hate with hate right so if i see someone being really nasty so i don't like that like i'd rather you
not defend me i don't want that you don't know what that girl's going through just because she's being mean to
me you don't know what she's going through the pain she must be in you don't know but when i see someone
like hey says like you need to chill because that's not nice you don't know what that comment could do to someone
that's a team that's a community that's the family right there
so i'm pretty blessed i don't get as much negativity as maybe other people
i'm pretty pretty blessed touch word that doesn't change um but listen i
i don't know how to explain it to you and i'm gonna sound hella crazy right now but the the community i have man it's
something special like special it's something that
it's it's unexplainable the feeling they give me and that to me is my friends
as weird as i may sound and lonely as i sound so some of the things you're working on right yeah so you've got a book coming
out yes which is exciting tell me about this so exciting so i'm officially an author oh my god
um so my book do this for you how to be a strong woman on the inside and out
is not your average fitness book so i'm pretty sick and tired of 20 day challenges and kind of telling
women that oh my god do this 20 day challenge and you're going to lose 10 pounds oh shut up it's draining jarring stop
i'm going to teach you how to create habits discipline consistency longevity that's what it's about you know all the
programs on the toner sculpt app are some of them are year long
it kind of goes against the typical sales sales script of something with status quo like small effort from you
big results that's what sells right yeah five days you'll lose 100 pounds yeah you know but
that's very honest of you and i think that's real right yeah no you're not you're gonna lose weight of course of course you're gonna lose weight if
you're doing stupid amounts of cardio cutting out specific food groups and you're literally depriving yourself
of course you're gonna lose weight not sustainable is it sustainable no so the way i always say is funny enough
in a relationship if you're constantly just like horrible to someone all the time
is that sustainable not really you have to nourish you have to love you have to care you have to show effort consistency that's what
works same thing with training it's the constant effort you put in day in day out that will make a
difference so it's all about disciplines habits yeah and it's a book that you know what
in all honesty it's a book that i know when someone reads they're going to pass it down right
it's one of those books you read it and it gets you thinking it's a thinking book so i did the audio
book for it as well last week and when i was reading it i was like damn that's good
i was like i know someone's gonna read that yeah yeah listen to it like yeah and it's true
it's a thinking book i ask you what your why is so if i say to you what what is your why why is it that you want to train
i've been over this a lot but uh i mean like the thing that i keep trying to get my myself away from is
having a really extrinsic why that's like i want to look good for summer because when summer ends and i look good
that [ __ ] is done there we go that's a lot of people's why's yeah i want to lose weight for my wedding dress
i want to lose weight for this for an occasion occasion occasionally yeah timeline timeline yeah the occasion comes what then you fall
off a cliff yeah it's not a sustainable why so i teach you how to gain a sustainable why which is fundamentally the most important
foundation you need for fitness then i teach you habits you don't think twice about brushing your teeth why
think twice about your health why think twice about your health your health is the most fundamental and important thing you need
to live you need to get one of them as well and why are you thinking twice about it why are you viewing fitness as a chore
you're viewing your health as a chore that's a shame your body deserves more
whenever you've heard people speak about health like this in a society where women are driven by
fat loss pills and quick quick fad diets and intense workout sessions
it's time to stop it's time to tell you that you need to calm the [ __ ] down
remember your why remember how important your health is and understand that if you have a bad
day it's okay it's okay to have a bad day so that's
what do this for you is all about it sounds amazing i'm gonna read it thank you
um we'll we'll link the pre-order as well in all of the in the podcast and also on the youtube video i wanted to ask you what other things you're working
on i know you just launched a an active wear line that looks pretty awesome they are god has so many issues
with that to begin with but we got there in the end got there in the end honor active um honor active is
fundamentally i was actually building the mission and the vision for it last week um and
one of the things i said is that i don't want it to be a trendsetter why because i don't i don't want
my brand to be something that people just kind of like buy because it's trendy and that's that
i want on active to be something you go back to time and time again so all of our collections have certain
names like the first collection is called classic because you're always going to come back to it it's designed with specific
material that you always come back to it the next collection is called timeless and then our winter collection is called
effortless so it's designed to have a concept that it's your best friend always and forever that it doesn't
matter what year it is you're still going to love honor active because trendsetters they come
and they go you have your 15 minutes fame and then it goes yeah but i want something to be
sustainable if you look at nike lululemon the biggest brands in the world they don't have fancy stuff some of the
best lululemon leggings are the most simplest ones you'll ever find but they're trusted
Outro
and they're loved and that's exactly what i want honor to be i'm not here to start trends
sorry i'm not here to start trends i'm here to ensure that you pick up your leggings
and you trust this product that's my goal for honor active on to
the next business no toner sculpture toner scott was still like obviously my
number one baby in an honor active of course but what we done with toner sculpt um we launched a brand new athlete danielle
wilson i don't know i i clicked on her profile she followed me i was quite uh she loves you oh my gosh she's going to
be so excited yeah she's like oh my god she always reposted and i was like yeah he's all right
i'm joking she's like oh but now she is very special
um because i approached her and the reason why i want to talk about her briefly in this in this podcast is
because i think it's very important she's a 200 pound african-american woman
5 foot 11 not your average fitness guru right
so why would tone and sculpt want her she's not your average fitness guru why would you want
someone who women are scared to think that's what fitness looks like
let me tell you why because fitness for such a long time is not about the
way it looks it's about the way it makes you feel she trains because it makes her feel alive
she's an athlete yeah she trains athletes she is an athlete built like an athlete
that's what i wanted for my brand so when i approached a year and a half ago i
slid into her dms and i was like i am every day inspired by you
and i didn't really think i wanted trainers other trainers on the tone and sculpt out but i what i need you i need
you and on this app and she was like what are you serious like you really
think i should be on the app and i was like hell yeah you need to be on this app you inspire me i know you're gonna
inspire thousands of other women and it's funny because when the whole
black lives matter thing happened five other companies approached her in that month
five other fitness brands and i had a face time with her and i said listen babe if they're
offering you more money and you think it's a better opportunity for you i understand
business is business she goes hell no i'm married to you i'm not going anywhere i'm married to
you she goes but how funny is it that it took something happening
for them to approach me i didn't say anything and i said to her
i'm gonna let you answer that question yourself for yourself oh that that oh that week
my emails were blowing right up black lives matter week i had more speaking requests more invitations
to campaigns than i've ever had in my entire life you know what it is but i'm gonna be honest i'm gonna take the bag
do you know what i mean yeah if you're if you're approaching me because um you think you suddenly have had this
revelation that you need a black person involved fine fine i can't find uh
you know what we're gonna do say no and then like they're gonna go have to go because in this case to find someone else yeah they're not
and in this country when you think about young black successful entrepreneurs
and jamal edwards there's the guy who made sbtv who's been on this podcast it's [ __ ] no one else like that are
you gonna have to start looking at footballers if you want young black and successful and and so yeah [ __ ] and also i can use that platform
as as a way to inspire other people to change their opinions in the same way obama
inspired a lot of naive americans to think that oh my god a black person can be smart and intelligent and clean don't please i
could just so yeah i took the bags every single bag all mine and you know what i i'll keep taking them yeah
no hell yeah hell oh yeah like are you [ __ ] joking me i said i
i looked at danny i said sanya on the on the facetime it doesn't matter where you go it matters what you're going to
represent yeah yeah do you understand that you're going to change a young girl's life by being somewhere
being present being vocal being ambitious do it if the platform that's offering you more money
is bigger do it she was like no i want to be at toner school of course because you yeah but that's
just loyalty that's just her being loyal but it goes beyond bringing another trainer
onto the app it's about representation it's about i'm sick and tired of fitness having
one status quo fitness is not one status quo it's about to help people mentally and physically
if it wasn't for fitness i would not be alive today and that's facts so what's next for chrissy what's next
when you think about the future personally i don't know business
amazing yeah stuff that are coming up beyond um but from a personal
perspective i don't know i really don't know i don't know what's even happening tomorrow in my personal
life are you happy in what sense that's the question for what in one sense in your life are
you happy um i would say i'm really happy in my career and i'm really happy in my community
um from a personal perspective i think i need to just
take a breather and i would say i need to work on my happiness on a personal
perspective a little bit more yeah for sure you're gonna do that
see you're funny because you asked me the questions and you ask if i'm going to do it and then i don't know the answer to that question because i don't
know if i will do it so i don't know i think i just need to i think i just need to be a bit more
patient with myself and a little bit kinder to myself and less self-defensive
listen um i've i've taken a lot of your time and it's been a fascinating conversation i've learned a lot about myself as well
really yeah it's like you know on many of these issues they are they're issues that anybody in the
situation you know both me and you find ourselves in in life where we're running businesses and we're very busy but then
we're also trying to fulfill all of our personal needs at the same time when one of those you know
facets of our life is so all-consuming we feel the same things and we're confused by it we don't have
the answers and as much as we want to have the answers and have control over everything because we are
used to that and we strive for that in our business you know sometimes we have to relinquish control in order to be happy
maybe that's a lot of the answer but thank you so much for giving me your time today but more
importantly for giving me so much honesty um and where can where can people
find you i mean you're everywhere so don't ask questions like you know you've got your book
coming out you've got your app you've got your activewear line i'm sure people will find you and um i just want to say thank you because
there's very few people out there that are a willing to be honest it takes a certain vulnerability to be that honest but it does so much for so
many people and um on behalf of your community on behalf of entrepreneurs like me on
behalf of all of the aspiring female entrepreneurs that are following in your footsteps a
huge thank you because what you're doing it's costing you a lot but it's giving the world even more
so thank you thank you so much
oh
you

Summary:
The podcast episode begins with the host, Stephen Bartlett, expressing gratitude for the positive feedback on the previous week's podcast, emphasizing its life-changing content, which covered diverse topics like depression, anxiety, and burnout. He reflects on how being an interviewer has been an enlightening and educational experience for him, offering personal growth and insights.

In this episode, Bartlett discusses various personal anecdotes, lessons learned, and topics that are significant to him. Key points include:

1. **Means to an End Syndrome**: Bartlett shares his personal struggle with maintaining fitness beyond September each year, exploring the psychological patterns behind his repeated cycle of motivation and burnout. He realizes that his fitness goals were extrinsically motivated, tied to public opinion and summer's end. By shifting to intrinsic motivations (like feeling great, self-discipline, and positive impacts on health), he maintains his fitness routine beyond the usual cycle.
    
2. **Journey Back to Human**: Bartlett delves into how modern solutions for mental health often hark back to simpler, ancient lifestyles. He argues that over-stimulation, poor nutrition, and isolation have led to increased mental health issues. He suggests that re-embracing simple, intrinsic life aspects, like community, nature, and physical activity, can lead to improved mental and overall well-being.
    
3. **Humans Have No Idea What They Want**: Sharing a conversation with a friend, Bartlett discusses how extrinsic motivations and societal constructs often mislead our perceptions of success and happiness. He stresses the importance of intrinsic motivations and the pitfalls of chasing external validations, such as wealth or status.
    
4. **Avoiding Good Opportunities for Great Ones**: Bartlett talks about the challenge of saying no to good opportunities to keep time and energy focused on great ones. He emphasizes clarity on long-term goals, intrinsic values, and a stringent valuation of one's time as crucial factors in decision-making.
    
5. **Skepticism on Marriage and Monogamy**: Bartlett questions the traditional concept of marriage and its alignment with human nature. He shares his thoughts on the institutional aspects of marriage, like legal and religious bindings, and ponders on the naturalness of monogamy, suggesting that societal norms might have influenced our views on these concepts.
    
6. **The Curse of Fitting In**: He concludes by highlighting the joy and success stemming from being true to oneself rather than conforming to societal expectations. He argues that authenticity, rather than fitting in, leads to genuine happiness and self-fulfillment.
    

Bartlett wraps up by encouraging listeners to reflect on being more human and true to themselves as potential keys to a fulfilling life. He invites feedback and engagement from the audience, reinforcing the interactive nature of his podcast.

Transcription:

hello listen before i start i just want to pay a little bit of homage and also a tribute to the guests that i had joined
me last week on this podcast the feedback that i got from that conversation for those that had the
resilience to listen for the full two hours and if you haven't i genuine genuinely implore you too
because the value of that conversation and the diversity of the topics we touched on i genuinely believe are life-changing
i've reflected continuously throughout this week on that conversation we touched on everything from depression to
anxiety to burnout and it's really developed to me you know what one of the things they say is that
the teacher is the person in a classroom that gets the most value from a conversation and in that context
i as the interviewer who got to sit there and listen and prod and think through my own sort of selfish curiosity
i think i got the most value out of that i certainly learned a ton about myself the world and some of the problems that i've had throughout my
life so if you haven't and you do get the time i implore you to go back and check out that episode
and in fact that episode has it's inspired this episode in many ways one of the
things that you guys have said to me in my dms on your stories
in the reviews everywhere my emails you said to me one of the things you enjoy most about this podcast
is when i'm a little bit more raw and when i i'm a little bit less scripted per se
not that i'm ever really that scripted but when i'm a little bit more off the cuff when i talk about my own anecdotes my own life and my own stories and so
this episode this chapter is going to be exactly that it's predominantly centered on my
anecdotes my diary is full of things that have happened to me this week personal stories from my friends and the
lessons that they've taught me the lessons they've taught me about myself about my life and about how to build a
better future so without further ado i'm stephen bartlett and this is the divers ceo
i hope nobody's listening but if you are then please keep this to yourself
How I've FINALLY fixed / figured out why we lose motivation
so for the first point in my diary this week i've literally just written means to an end syndrome let me explain what i
mean every single year i set myself the same goal in february and the goal is simple it's to get in
good physical shape and every year thankfully i achieved that goal until september
and by october my motivation to work out to eat well and to be healthy seems to transform from this like
tangible object that i can hold on to to sand slipping through my hands by january the following year
all hell has broken loose in my diet i'm basically fat compared to how i usually am my my energy is lower my sleep isn't as
good i just don't feel my best anymore then february comes around again and march comes around
and i set myself the same goal to get in shape and the cycle repeats itself this has happened to me i'd say every
year for at least the last five years in a row and i've not been able to understand from a psychological perspective
why this is happening and with all things in life until you become conscious of what's causing you to
behave the way that you are you're merely just a puppet and the puppet master
remains this unknown force this experience you had at some point uh you know a facet of your psychology one
that usually doesn't have your best interests at heart one that usually can't be trusted a puppet master that certainly isn't
working for you he's working for your insecurities or for your for your ego or for trauma that you've experienced
the same cycle unfortunately started to repeat itself this year i mean i started the year fat january
time i was pretty fat compared to how i usually am walking can feel the little rolls on my belly shaking as i walk and i'm wearing
slightly baggier clothes by august i was in the best shape of my entire life right because of an obsessive focus
on the gym i was going seven days a week i was calorie counting one day i did 5 000 calories
and by september my motivation started as it always does to just fall away
i noticed that i wasn't charging my apple watch anymore i noticed that i'd started to miss the gym i started to eat junk food again
this lasted for about two weeks this year but this time i started to be a bit more
conscious about it i told myself what i was doing and i started examining my own psychology and saying literally saying
to myself steve you're doing it that cycle is repeating itself you're eating [ __ ] you're lacking motivation
fortunately i've just written a whole chapter on the topic of motivation for my upcoming book
so i because of the research that i had to do to write that chapter i understand the psychological principles and the forces at play that make someone
motivated or unmotivated and armed with that and my own sort of critical self-analysis which i attained from
being more conscious about what i was doing the fact that i was eating junk food and i'd i could feel my motivation waning
i finally understood why this is happening to me maybe maybe this is happening to me
isn't the best way to describe it why i'm doing this to myself or not doing things to myself that i should be
doing and touchwood i finally overcome it it's november and i'm still working out for the first
time literally in my life i'm still eating well and i'm still focused on my health goals and this is the first year ever that i
can remember in the last five really in the last decade where i've been just as committed to working out now and to being healthy in my entire
life than i was during the summer so let me tell you how i did this and let me tell you what i understood
about my own motivation because i know it's going to speak to you in your own way let me rewind every year around february
march i say the same thing to myself and i set myself the same goal let's just stop there right and take a
look at what i just said because there's a real clue in that first sentence why does this goal pop up in march
the answer quite an obvious one because summer is on the horizon and you've got to ask yourself again you've got to criticize yourself there
and say well why does summer matter well because you know summertime is a time where
we wear less clothes we're a little bit more vulnerable our bodies are on show more and then you can ask yourself okay so why is that relevant well it speaks to
the nature of my motivation my motivation wasn't to work out it wasn't to be healthy because i want
long-term health benefits or to or to feel great about myself as embarrassing as this is to admit my
motivation was so clearly clearly to look good for
summer let's just break that down a second look good for summer looking good
as a goal is measured by just one thing the public's opinion of me ladies opinion of me that's what we call
an extrinsic external goal success of that goal will be achieved when the public think i look
good the next part of that sentence right was for summer the next part of my goal was for
summer which is a measurable time frame so once summer is over
the job is done so the motivation behind that goal was both extrinsic and held within a time frame so when i
dropped that social media pic of me topless in mykonos or wherever i went this summer mykonos and costa rica looking good
during summer and when i got the compliments the likes the followers the praise and when summer passed unsurprisingly
so did my motivation job done my goal my reason my why was attached to summer
and also public opinion and both had been fulfilled so as i pulled into october and i tried to find
the motivation to go to the gym it was gone going to the gym suddenly felt so pointless to me and i had no idea why it
just did even when i managed to get to the gym my workout was quite honestly pathetic it was short it was like
25 30 minutes of me predominantly texting and i didn't know why i just thought i wasn't feeling great
like you know like a boat that had suddenly been unanchored i was now just drifting
unconsciously without intention or real motivation or without conscious realization into
the winter months into bad habits into fat steve and the minute i realized this this year i was able to completely
reset and sort of re-anchor my motivation into things that were intrinsically internally motivating and
without time frames i set myself the goal of going to the gym just because it makes me feel great
and because of the energy it gives me and the positive impact it has on my sleep and because you know i love showing
myself how self-disciplined i am i get a real weird feeling of joy by
going to the gym on a day when i feel like [ __ ] because for me that's kind of overcoming my mind
right it's like beating um the the negative or the the weaker parts of my mind that
are trying to dissuade me from doing something that's in line with my long-term values and honestly also people don't like to
say this but the positive impact it has on my sex life i didn't really know how to say this without sounding like a [ __ ] dick but
i have never been there in bed
and and just generally how good it makes me feel all year round all of these things have
no finish line they're not extrinsically or externally judged by the public they're the opposite of the extrinsic
short-term goals i set myself in march they're intrinsic they are never ending they view life not
just as a bunch of recurring seasons but as one season one season from now until the
day that i die the season of life and that that is the season that it's incredibly valuable
and important to be healthy and to look good for as james clear says you
know we tend to believe that we'll be more successful or happy or prosperous if we put more intensity into our lives
you know like the intensity that i showed in march every year in the lead-up to summer you know like crash diets and sprinting towards our goals at
the expense of everything else staying up for weeks and weeks and weeks on end to revise for that exam but the truth is we don't need intensity
if we have a little bit more consistency had i just stayed in good shape in september october november december and
january if i just gone to the gym maybe twice or three times a week throughout that period and avoided a bit of you know the junk food
which i binged on um periodically through that period i wouldn't even need the intensity for the rest of the year i wouldn't need to
starve myself obsessive in my diet and go to the gym seven days a week sometimes twice a day in fact
intensity for me is often a sign that we lacked consistency in the past and i think
and i've said this a couple of times in this podcast before but until you know right and this is not easy i'm gonna
make this sound like it's an easy thing to do but it requires the same sort of critical self-analysis and
that i've demonstrated that what you would have seen from what i just said is i interrogated my rationale so i said
you know why does it why do i always get motivated in february in march and then i said well because you know someone's around the corner and then why does summer
matter well because other you know extrinsic reasons and if you go down that rabbit hole with humility and with the attention of not defending
your ego but finding the truth then you might understand what's motivating you but until you know what's
motivating you you won't know where you're going or why you're going there or who's steering the ship what force in
your life is steering that ship and i'd predict that 99.9
of your motivations are misguided or somewhat unconscious you don't really know why you're doing
what you're doing i think most of the time you have no idea what the driving force behind your behavior is the same applies
for me but until you do until you have the self-awareness and that humility you need
to interrogate your thinking and the lack of ego to identify why you're doing what you're doing whether it's superficial driven by
insecurities from your childhood because you're seeking validation like i was or other you will never actually be
in control of your life something else is and if your goals are extrinsic
someone else's okay so the next point in my diary i've just written here journey back to human let me explain
Why people are more depressed and anxious (and a cure)
i find it so ironic but somewhat unsurprising if i'm honest that most of the new age techniques that were aimed
to sort of improve our mental health and overall well-being are largely based on
old age principles of how our life used to be tens of thousands of years ago and in the process of writing my book i
i went back over the last i'd say three decades to see how humans and neanderthals lived
their lives to understand why this is it's almost like as we developed as humans and as we
started to rely on agriculture and farming and we stopped living in our tribe it's like we took a wrong turn
and we filled our lives with over stimulation and with like alcohol and caffeine and poor nutrition and
loneliness and convenience right and i think based on the alarming growth in mental health conditions like depression
anxiety addiction and even other conditions like loneliness and i'd say purposefulness right
i think it's time to turn back and the question i guess i often i'm forced to ponder is
what is what is a human being what are we what are we meant to be if we take away
all of this social pressure take away instagram and all of the noise and all of the pressure to conform what are we who are we and how are we
meant to live and infrequently i'll find myself trawling through google
as i did as i you know when i went over to costa rica and i spent the time in the jungle i found myself trawling through google in
history trying to understand humans and it's unsurprising that the natural lifestyle of humans
back then consists of everything that therapists and nutritionists and mindset coaches and psychologists
preach about when you're feeling like [ __ ] today let's start with probably the most
obvious it should be the most obvious and it's definitely a one of the things that's causing depression in a lot of people
it's this lack of human connection back then 10 000 years ago we lived in our tribes surrounded by family and friends and
johanna hari who came on this podcast and is actually coming back on this year that's a little exclusive for you wrote a life-shifting
book called lost connections on this exact point and if there's ever a book i've read in my life and i'm not here to plug your hannah harry just for you know
because he comes on the podcast and stuff like that the reason he comes on this podcast is because his book i'd say in the last
three years has had the biggest single impact on how i see the world right
the fundamental conclusion of that book is we need each other that is non-negotiable i i've read a
bunch of studies and i've seen a bunch of ted talks on youtube where they've done a study over a century and they followed like a hundred
or a thousand people and the people that don't establish meaningful relationships in their lives
die earlier they get more sick and they have a worse quality of life i didn't used to think this stuff right
right i didn't think this was important before i mistakenly thought that if i got rich really really rich everything else would
fall into place so when i at 18 years old my whole life was centered on this north star which was getting filthy rich
at the expense of everything and i sacrificed everything for that and i i gotta be honest because this
that's what this podcast is for i felt that loneliness i didn't actually like weekends because
they were so empty for me i didn't have anything to do i'd i'm sure some of you can relate to this you
know especially you hustle porn stars out there that are running your businesses weekends were just this big [ __ ] void in my life
there was nothing to do so i just went to the office my entire life at that point when i was 18 19 20 was focused on money work business
and after developing this habit of like forced self-induced loneliness for about five
six or seven years it had really really stuck i was a
self-diagnosed recluse one that spent all of his time in the office on my laptop making more money even
though i already had more money than i you know could ever possibly need and at some point thankfully i realized
the never-ending pointless insanity of my situation what was the point in having all of this
money and if i didn't have any meaningful relationships to enjoy it with life is uh it's a multiplayer game it's
not a solo experience and i i got to see how miserable some of my quote unquote successful
friends were by just being behind the scenes in their life one of the i guess the positive things that happened to me when i became
successful quote unquote was i made a lot of successful friends and those friends in many cases were way ahead of me and
and what they did for me is they showed me what my future would look like if i carried on how i was
i got to see behind the scenes behind their lamborghinis behind their mansions and i realized that life had lied to me
you know of course progress and success and striving towards goals matter like of course right it's
it's made me fulfilled to some degree but not at the expense of all the other things not the expensive meaningful and
frequent human connection the other thing that i observe when i when i sort of reflect on on how our ancestors used to live is just
the sheer simplicity of their lives you know they lived together in in caves and these simple huts they were
hunters and gatherers they used basic tools which they had made to track
and hunt birds and wild animals they cooked their prey around a campfire they fished they collected berries and fruits and
nuts their goals were so significantly more intrinsic and survival focused than ours are today
they were focused on taking care of themselves and one another a very simple life it's a very simple purpose
without all of this [ __ ] [ __ ] that we have today without instagram without politics trump fearful news cycles without
two hour work commutes right to get between four white walls to lock ourselves in a cubicle without stress
without traffic without obsessive worrying and notifications and emails and
inbox zero pressures and social pressures and expectations of how your life is meant to be going without all of that [ __ ] a simpler life
which results in a simpler mind which is so frequently the thing that you know
psychologists and therapists prescribe to all of us when we have illnesses today to simplify our lives
but simplifying our lives seems to go against society's mandate that expects you to be
so much that expects career success from you that expects financial success material possessions that expects
psychological perfection that expects physical fitness and health social status to push yourself out of
your comfort zone to climb the ladder to have perfect relationships at the same time to demonstrate the perfect
behavior all while living living in a healthy perfect clear mentally stable mind this level of
like obsessive perfection and you know accomplishment seeking and validation hunting
isn't conducive with simplicity not in the world we live in today absolutely not it's either one or the
other in many respects so instead of living you know a simple life we kind of burn ourselves to the ground
and then we escape off on holiday which is usually based on simplicity which is you know laying down
out in nature and relaxing and doing very little it's like you know there was a quote from a guest that i had on this podcast
a couple of years ago i think it was when i had a chat with the ceo of leon the restaurant chain and he said
you should never cut down the rainforest and then donate to the bees and this is exactly what this strikes me as
you're cutting down your own rainforest in order to donate to your own bees ruining yourself so that you can raise
the funds you need to fix yourself it's like it feels like insanity and i'm super guilty of this i have to admit
so one of the things that i've tried to introduce into my life is a little bit more simplicity scenarios and context that simplify my
life and every day now i go for a walk there and back to the gym and i listen to my music something i didn't do before i just got
an uber and the other thing that's really helped simplify my life is just playing with my dog pets like kids are amazing for
simplifying your world because they live in such a simple world like my dog can spend an hour absolutely amused and
obsessed by like a lucas aid bottle or like pretending he's hunting it's like such a remarkable thing when you
contrast it to the complexity of the world we live in if you're looking to simplify your world briefly
try it if you don't have a dog get a dog but try it try going into their world my niece and
my dog are fascinatingly simple and they're unassuming and they're unpretentious and i want to
live more in that world sometimes and i think this is why some people are also so incredibly obsessed with nature
all this simplicity seems to calm the mind you know it sort of re-centers your soul and the next thing you see if you look
back at our ancestors and how they lived their lives is exactly that they spent literally all of their time in nature that's where they lived they
lived in nature during that i'm going to get this word wrong right but during the mesolithic
period i got it right 12 000 years ago they lived nomadically in camps near rivers and
near other sort of large bodies of water and today like a bunch of dumbass over
developed monkeys we live in these concrete jungles alone between four white walls the time i spent last month for pretty
much the whole month living in the costa rican jungle was the most wonderful tranquil experience of my life it was the most
human experience of my entire life making time in nature has to be a central part of my routine now
it's a really [ __ ] good decision especially for someone like me that lives in a big
busy traffic ridden noisy chaotic city and lastly the key thing i see when i look back at
our ancestors was exercise and nutrition we me you us our generation
are the most inactive sedentary group of humans of all time according to the data our lifestyles are gradually becoming
more and more still more sat down at our desks glaring into these illuminated glass
screens and office blocks we don't need to hunt and gather anymore right like our ancestors did which was a huge source of their physical activity
and exercise because we've got delivery and ubereats some guy will bring me
any food that i want to my door in 25 minutes and i'll be honest with you it's not always good food it's usually you know full of sugar and
artificial substances and things like caffeine which move our mood one way or the other
and also back then we would literally carve and scavenge for the tools that we needed to make our food today
amazon prime that [ __ ] will be here tomorrow i've included this sort of terrifying graph in my book that shows
the gradual decline of human activity i've placed it against the graph of obesity and sugar consumption
and it makes for a pretty alarming read right we're not living like humans anymore we live like lazy gluttonous gorillas he would
increasingly rather go under the knife on a surgeon's table to change our appearance than make a simple lifestyle change not
very human at all is it so no wonder we don't feel so human these days if this is how you're living certainly
how i was living then you should expect to not feel great because you're not living in accordance with your own
natural way of being it's crazy it's crazy that the new age cures for our new age problems all seek to take us
back 10 000 years meditation and digital detoxes are there to still our mind healthy nutrition to cut
out modern junk foods therapy friendships and human connection to read us of the loneliness and to
connect us back to our tribe these feelings of loneliness and anxiety and depression are often according to the science and
my own personal experience nothing more than a calling from our body to get back to our tribes
to be a little bit more human not to find ourselves but to rediscover who we were
who we are as humans and if you're struggling in any way here's some advice give it a go try and
live a little bit more human for me as a sort of mentally busy career-obsessed recluse it fundamentally changed my life
i know that for sure and i genuinely believe that it might be the thing that could have the greatest impact on yours
Humans have no idea what they want
okay so for the next point in my diary i've literally just written humans have no idea what they want which kind of ties a little bit into my first point
but it's very very different i want to tell you a story one of my very very good friends i won't name him
because that doesn't matter and i keep referencing friends on this podcast i'm slowly losing friends so my
my circle is getting a little bit smaller i'm just joking one of my good friends came to my house last week for a little bit of a catch up
and he sat on my my sofa over there and he asked me um a couple of questions about myself and i
turned to him and i said listen how have you been and somewhat instinctively as we all do he replied yeah good and you know
when you're my mate i have to be honest i [ __ ] hate that response give that response to someone in like
business or when you're in a networking event or something like that nobody has been yeah good nobody
life fortunately and to be honest unfortunately isn't that simple definitely not in the middle of a global pandemic where our lives are locked down and
stripped back and have been completely shifted nobody's yeah good so i instinctively replied to him which is a habit i've got
into recently especially with my close friends no how have you really been and almost
instantly literally almost instantly he went yeah yeah i'm pretty burnt out to be honest with you and
that's kind of surprising because you know i'm really lucky and i stopped him there and the reason i stopped him there is because i've just spent the last
month studying the topic of burnout for my book and i wanted to check i wanted to check if he like
pretty much everyone else i've ever spoke to fit into the pattern and the category that almost everybody fits into when
they experience burnout i said to him when you say you're feeling burnt out but you're surprised
because you're lucky what do you mean by lucky and he said well you know because you know i've got all the things ticked off i've got the
money i've got the car i've got the house and then i stopped him again and i said that's why you're burnt out because your own self-confessed
definition of career or life luck and success is extrinsically purely extrinsically motivated
and as i said in last week's podcast on almost every occasion where someone is doing something that they're motivated to do by largely extrinsic or
external reasons whether it's money or status or fame or likes or followers or to obtain like
material objects where the intrinsic internal rewards like joy and personal fulfillment
a sense of purpose or a sense of belonging are limited you will inevitably lose your motivation
you'll struggle to get out of bed and you'll self-diagnose yourself as everybody seems to do as being burnt out and let's just take a
look at the world we're living in right now because it adds a really important layer of context to all of that this pandemic has robbed all of us our
lives and our work of things that made work and our lives intrinsically enjoyable you know that feeling of striving
towards a shared goal the social value of being part of a team in an office that sense of belonging it gives you
the sense of forward motion and progress and purpose and accomplishment and to be honest in our personal lives
socializing and days out and family and friends and travel and this robber the pandemic covert 19
has left most of us with just the work wake up zoom to-do list sleep wake up to-do list
sleep it's left us with just the extrinsic stuff and to be completely honest
the only thing that makes doing a lot of the extrinsic stuff like work worthwhile is the promise of all the intrinsic
stuff socializing community purpose that it promises you that it gives us
but right now it's not giving us that we're largely alone not enjoying ourselves much we don't
know what the mission is we don't know when we're going to be out of this situation so our work feels heavily extrinsic therefore pointless
we're doing it to pay the bills we don't have our colleagues around us anymore that sense of purpose and mission is gone therefore we lack motivation
therefore we feel burnt out the more i've tried to understand the complexity of humans the more i've realized how simple
predictable and alike we all are and our motivations don't tend to be that dissimilar with
such fragile emotional unconscious beings that think we're strong resilient unique
and in control we're not we're all going through this [ __ ] together making the same mistakes predictably
because we all have a very very similar innate psychological wiring and the same psychological factors are
running the show our working lives have been completely knocked out of balance and the work is just that now it's work
social chain my company the company i founded and recently resigned from you know it was renowned for its culture
for its sense of community for the sense of purpose and that intrinsic pleasure it gives the people that work there for
the joy of you know the dogs in the office we had about 10 of them to be honest we had a happiness team that would make sure every day when
you're in the office you're feeling good therapists that were there for you in the office every single day we had this sense of mission and purpose
that we were building this business and forward motion and uh it was going great because the business was growing it still is but it
was growing and that gives you purpose as well but when a pandemic and a lockdown strikes all of that stuff
is taken away all that intrinsic stuff the enjoyment is taken away and something that was fundamentally
designed from the ground up to give you as much joy as a job could possibly give you becomes a bunch of people alone in their boxer
shorts on their own little islands doing their to-do list every day chatting once in a while on zoom or over
whatsapp or in shared company groups work becomes work nothing more that combined with the lack
of structure that everyone has in their day now results in long ass working hours and that has a huge impact on your sleep and
and all of these things and all the other problems sends you straight into a place of purposelessness low motivation
and when all that happens we we say it's burnout and i think everybody's experiencing a bit of burnout right now
you know every year at christmas uh come it's widely known according to the data
companies experience the highest amount of staff turnover because you know as those sort of new year's resolutions and all the introspection
occurs people decide they want to go work somewhere else they want a new challenge they want something else for their lives and we always see the same thing as
social chain and this year we saw that behavior happen a few months into the pandemic
quite a few people quit more than we've ever had in the middle of the year ever before and part of me knows that this is
because social change pretty much every company lost some of its intrinsic value that community and purpose and fun
and when it loses it and when all you have is the extrinsic like paying the bills a lot of people go looking for pay rises and if you've worked at social
channel i'm telling you you can get a pay rise it's got a good brand people want people that have worked at social chain and when people to
start to sort of enjoy their work less they arrive often at the conclusion that social change is maybe part of the issue maybe social
change is the reason i'm not enjoying my work as much so they go in search of that purpose somewhere else and people have been
leaving other companies and in their droves to be honest and wanting to come to social chain and people have left social chain wanting to go
elsewhere and this is something that's happened not in social chain alone across every business across the whole country so if you're feeling like [ __ ]
in your job if you're feeling a bit burnt out if you're lacking motivation you're feeling i know stagnant this is probably a large part of the
reason but going back to the conversation with my friend which is where this this started before i went off topic there's another important layer to
address here my friend like me had a relatively psychologically
rough start to life with family issues and issues with his peers it robbed something from his self-worth
in the same way it did for me it made him insecure in the same way it did for me and listen bro i know you're
listening to this because this guy he's one of my very good friends he never misses an episode he always gives me great feedback i know you're
listening to this right it takes one to no one everything i'm saying about you could be
said about me too i too as everyone knows grew up with insecurities that made me try and ball out on social media they
made me buy all the champagne and every night club i went to made me pull up in sports cars right in his case it's made him particularly
intent on showing the world that he is worthy and that he is successful the clue of course is in the fact that when i asked him to
define what luck or success meant to him he said a bunch of material things something some insecurity taught him as
it taught me that his success would be judged by the outside world's opinion of him and as i said in a previous episode of
this podcast the thing that invalidates you as a kid whether it's sort of lack of self-worth or a lack of affection or
a lack of a sense of belonging will be the thing you seek validation from when you're an adult and you know failure when both he and i were
young was not being worthy not feeling as worthy as our peers me for my own reasons and
him for a bunch of different reasons and because that was our definition of failure that
was the thing that failed us that's what you know that was the the worst part of our lives then our definition of success now
is the opposite think about it if failure then was not feeling externally valid or valuable or worthy
success now is feeling externally valid worthy and valuable so we we both got big cars nice houses
lots of champagne and we proceeded to tell and show the world all of it i guess subconsciously in the
hope that it would validate us and we designed our lives to focus on achieving extrinsic externally motivated goals like money success
status and the science is clear on this and my own personal experience it couldn't be it could be clearer on this particular
topic according to the science you will experience less joy more despair increase your chances of depression anxiety
and sign yourself up for a hamster wheel existence where nothing is ever enough of anti-climax and of
lack of purpose and if you design your life where your north star is all of this sort of extrinsic meaningless [ __ ]
you're designing out all of the things that actually internally matter like meaningful relationships the two are kind of
mutually exclusive the things that you enjoy for you for your own reasons for your own internal
sake meaningful hobbies and passions and subsequently the chance of being fulfilled happy and free from all the mental
health issues that will inevitably show up if you live in such an externally driven way you know at 18 years old
as a lot of you will know i wrote in my diary that my goal was to buy a range rover um
i wrote there in my diary that a range rover would be my first car that was my goal and that was a goal
that was born out of insecure naivety i guess
definitely a lot of insecurity and it was a goal written because i wanted to impress people and i wanted girls to sleep with me
right a goal born out of the fact that i wanted to be validated and fulfilled and i thought somewhere in me that a
range rover would make me feel secure in myself i got the range rover it was my first
car mission accomplished it impressed people but when you think about it it didn't make
me feel secure in myself all it did was highlighted
but i wasn't it was the consequence of insecurity so paradoxically the day i achieved my
goal wasn't the day that i bought the range rover it was the day three years later when i
sold it when i no longer felt that i needed it that was the point where i was securing
myself and that was the goal i was trying to achieve and you know going back to my friend for
a second you know he's just to give you a context of how he's working he runs his own business but he works alone
very similar to how a freelance would work doesn't have like a team of people around him just kind of working alone at home at the moment
and you know the world has done just a phenomenal job of glamorizing the idea of being your own boss and being a
freelancer but nobody seems to talk enough about how miserable this often is and let's just factor all of the things that
i've touched on on in this podcast up till this point about you know extrinsic goals and the things that make
life meaningful you know the joy of working in a team of people with a shared mission on work that you intrinsically enjoy
doing with as much intrinsic motivation as possible all of this stuff is often the absolute
antithesis of freelance work where you often work alone without a team on someone else's project for
someone else's purpose just for the extrinsic reason of money or paying the bills right
on top of that you have all of the other [ __ ] being on japan no work life balance no work life separation no clock
off time i'm gonna call this freelancer depression we're gonna try and make this a thing freelance and depression
it's something that people who evangelize about being your own boss and going alone and all of the freelance lifestyle never
seemed to mention that much and to be fair this pandemic has made us all freelancers to some degree it's
robbed us all of that intrinsic rewarding stuff i i guess i just want to i just want to tell you one more thing
now that i've left social chain and i'm technically unemployed i was i sat on the sofa it was actually
yesterday with my it's actually yesterday night before i recorded this podcast with my assistant and she turned to me and she asked me a question she said do you miss all the
travelling and the chaos of your old life and i said to her like what do you mean what do you mean and she said well you
know you used to be up at 3am every day running all over the world pitching and speaking on stage and for a second i paused and reflected
and the thought of doing any of that stuff now [ __ ] repulsed me
i couldn't think of anything worse but i mean this is a big but i absolutely
used to love it i absolutely used to love it made me so fulfilled but now you couldn't pay me to do that and the
reason for this the reason for this sort of monumental shift in my mind is because when i was at
social chain i was working with people i loved attached to a shared meaningful purpose and a mission and we were building
something amazing together when you remove that and ask me if i want to run around the world catching five flights a week and living in hotels
50 weeks a year it seems totally bizarre and repulsive and pointless it seems like such a sacrifice for nothing i would
hate to do that and it brings me back to the moment in my life where you know i think i've talked about this on the
podcast before where i was technically freelance for the first time it was after i was 21 years old i just exited my first startup wall park
and i hadn't started social chain yet i was being paid i've got to be honest with you about 70 grand a month by companies all over the world
to help them as a consultant run their businesses to advise their marketing and i was in this i was in um i turned
to my mate dom in our penthouse apartment in manchester on the 20 we own three floors up there i'm not bragging i'm just providing a
bit of context which i think is important and i told him exact quote if i go downstairs right now and i send this one
email i'll make 20k straight away and i just can't find the [ __ ]
motivation to do it and i don't know why it's 20k that's what i said to him verbatim exactly and the reason
was because at that point even at the point where i was making 5k a month consistently something as extrinsic as a little bit
more money was not motivation enough it would have no intrinsic material
impact on my life so the cost of walking down some stairs and writing an email felt greater than the reward
but when i you know when i think about the moment i went from being a freelancer to when social change started
i was working with people i loved on a shared meaningful mission to build something [ __ ] a flight of stairs i was flying to the ukraine at
2am on the off chance that someone might work with us and i did that like a dog for
seven or eight years i didn't have a motivation problem when i was a freelancer it wasn't a motivation problem right as
people often sort of self-diagnose it wasn't a lack of motivation that stopped me walking down the stairs in my
penthouse and sending that one email that would make 20 grand i had a purpose problem and the same applies to the conversation i had with
my pa you know when i think about sprinting around the world pitching speaking living in hotels and sacrificing my life now
it feels so [ __ ] pointless because i've left social chain so i'm i guess i'm detached from the
purpose and the mission that i had then and i i finally understand for the first time in my life
why people who looked at my life back then and often said to me you know how did you do it you know why did you
sacrifice everything are you crazy when do you sleep all of these questions um are you okay i used to get asked all the
time um how did you find the motivation all the time to to run the business and all of these things why you know sleeping in the
office in the weekends why did you work so hard it all makes sense now because when i look back
without the attachment to that mission that i had then to me it it looks bizarre i'm asking old stephen
why the [ __ ] did you do all of that because right now i can't feel that purpose so all i can feel is the sacrifice
but i guess that's that's how you behave i guess that's how you behave when you have a deep sense of purpose in the work you're doing so i guess my conclusion is
this the answer to loving your work and being as being the best at it which i think
that i eventually became within my company is working with people you love striving towards a shared worthwhile goal
for your own intrinsically rewarding reasons and if you can do that i think you'll also do a pretty good job
of avoiding burnout you'll do you'll do the work of your life for sure like i did at social chain
and you'll remain fulfilled the whole time that little insight helped me so i
really hope it helps you and so the next point in my diary is one that i haven't fully developed yet my
Key to success: Avoiding good opportunities so you have time to devote to great opportunities.
thinking on so i'm kind of hoping i can do this out loud with you together what i've written is one of the hardest things in life is to avoid a good
opportunity so that you have time to devote to great opportunities and since i've left social chain and i'm now
technically unemployed but i have a great reputation i have a great track record um i gotta be honest my inbox every day
is full of just amazing opportunities but the amount of time that i have every day has remained the same
i have the same 24 hours and i'm being bombarded with offers and jobs and opportunities to do
this and that and the other and i know that if i choose to accept any of those opportunities i'm doing it at the expense of something
else which i've talked a lot about in this podcast and so one of the real challenges and
one of the real sort of talents that i'm trying to foster in myself is being so clearly attached to my long-term values and goals and where
i want to go and who i want to be that i'm able to look at a really good opportunity
whether it's financial or you know other or status or whatever it might be or for my personal brand or whatever it might be
and say no now and and to do that you have to have real faith
in yourself but you also have a have to have a real attachment to who you want to become and your long-term
goals and it's something that i'm genuinely struggling with because never in my life as i said have i had more
people in my inbox asking me to become directors and ceos of their companies and offering me shares to come and help them
and so i just wanted to share a few things which i which i have written in my diary about how i make the decision
and whether to take an opportunity or to not it's fairly fairly simple the first one as i said
is by being super clear on the person that i want to become in the future and the first check i can do is is doing
this opportunity going to move me closer or further away by costing me time to becoming that person
and the next one which i consciously ask myself all the time now is if i become that person that i want
to become in the future by remaining loyal to that sort of long-term image of who i want to become and my values
will this opportunity come back around and for about 90 of the opportunities about 95 percent
it will definitely come back around in even greater abundance and value if i become the person i want to become
and the last thing i do is i attribute a financial value to an hour of my time and i've read a lot about this naval's
talked about this at length as well and philosophers and you know people that i respect in the business world have told me about this
as well what you want to do is think of a really big number for me it's about ten thousand pounds
i say to myself that one hour of my time is worth ten thousand pounds and my rationale for that is based on
what i was able to create with my time historically so you think about social change in the business and what it became and how much it's worth
when i go through and think about how much each year added to that value i can quite
comfortably say you know a year of my time is worth say 10 million or 20 million quid and when you
think from that framework and when you really attribute huge amounts of value to your time you're able to cut things
out quickly that don't meet that value it's something that i genuinely recommend everyone does i'm not saying attribute 10k an hour to
your time but even if it's a thousand dollars start there say my time one hour of my time is worth a thousand
dollars and if you think through that lens i swear to god the opportunities that
will come to you the ones that you'll accept will be of significantly more value and ultimately that means you'll spend
more of your time more of your hours on things of higher value and then that's what your life will become high value
give it a try the next point in my diary i understand is quite a controversial one um i've just written marriage monogamy
Why I don't think marriage is the right answer.
and me listen and i've spent a lot of time in this podcast talking about relationships and my views on marriage and the
relationship struggles that i've had and before i say what i'm going to say i want to appreciate the fact that this is
a completely nuanced subjective topic but here's my thinking i'm 28 years old
and i don't know i don't believe that marriage is the right answer a couple of reasons let's just start
with some fundamental principles pretty much every every way that i think is based on first principles i don't think for a star
that the law and that religion have a great track record on pretty much anything historically and i think that
marriage is a construct that's been passed down from one generation to another throughout our society without real
interrogation because we've all done that and i can literally predict um the dms that i'm gonna get which
which tell me that i'm naive and that i don't understand which like listen probably true right but that's the whole
point of like me scrolling in my diary i like this to be a two-way thing where you can just message me and say steve you're an idiot
and you do you guys do you i get the messages you don't understand the world fine that's probably true i know it's true i don't understand
everything and that's part of the reason i'm doing this but getting back to the point um for me the concept of marriage
when you look at the fundamentals of signing and assigning this commitment and going to a church and the
legal and religious ramifications of some marriages it just feels really insecure it's like
if i love someone why do i need a contract why do i need to go to church why do i need to get the law involved if i
love someone what has any of that got to do with courts and contracts if i love someone
and if i'm secure enough to believe that they love me too that they won't they won't leave me
and sometimes i think it's a bit like trapping a cat in a corner because when you're in a marriage and when you're in a situation which feels kind
of imprisoned or like you can't leave um i think issues might become somewhat magnified
right you know the worry and the anxiety of not being able to leave because of that rain or that contract or because of
the way you set up your life i actually think it might make issues bigger than they are and it's something that i've really
pondered you know i have a track record in my life of really like interrogating stuff i interrogated
school to the point that i stopped going in university to the point that i went to one lecture and decided that it was a completely broken concept and i'm
starting to do the same with marriage and people will hear different things when i say this right largely based on
their own opinions in life and their own experiences and this comes from my own experience probably largely largely from the experience of watching
a very dysfunctional toxic marriage that my parents had and i'm not saying marriages can't be brilliant some of my friends have the
best marriages some of their parents have the most amazing marriages too i'm just saying as a one-size-fits-all
concept i think it needs a little bit of questioning um i i'm all down for the commitment i
think i'm still developing my ideas there on monogamy but the commitment part isn't the thing i have issue with it's the like marriage part the law the
contract and all that nonsense i want to talk about monogamy too because oh this is going to be controversial but
um i'm also not completely convinced that we're meant to be monogamous
i'm not completely convinced that we're meant to have one partner like i'm down for it because i understand the way that the world is
wired at the moment um but this might be the most controversial thing i've ever saw in
this podcast but i think if we all i think of a huge
amount of us are honest with ourselves and this is based on the behavior we exhibit we would probably sleep with someone
else that was smoking heart we don't because we value the relationship and we don't we know that the relationship is worth
more than a one-night stand with someone else and we're mature enough to
understand the consequences of our actions but i think if you were to anonymously poll people
and say listen would you sleep with someone else that was hot if it had no material impact on your marriage
i think if we're being honest with ourselves a lot of us would but i think 99.9 of us wouldn't want our partner sleeping
with someone else and this all of this speaks to the fact that i'm not sure as humans
as men as women we are innately meant to be monogamous i think that
society has played a huge role in that i also think that over the the coming
decades i think you'll see real shifts in this probably not with me because i'm not going to get to the point where i i'm
down with someone i love sleeping with someone else if i'm completely honest but i think it's broken
i think marriage is broken i think like university it's broken you know if if i told you there was tvs for sale at
a shop on a corner but 50 of the tvs failed you wouldn't go and buy a tv and it's the same for marriage
50 of marriages fail and if you think about the concept of marriage it's till death do us part but 50 of the
time it's not till death does this part it's till that girl slides in your dms and you meet her and
you bang her and then you you know your marriage falls depart or that guy slides in your dms and you go for a coffee with him and your boyfriend
finds out and your husband finds out he dumps you the concept seems broken and i but i don't know the answer i don't know
what the alternative is i know that it's going to have to be commitment-centric but i feel that maybe when it comes to
my life i'm not going to seek marriage i might try and create some kind of new age urane arrangement with my partner where we're
committed to each other where we have the party the celebration which i think is [ __ ] awesome by the way but we don't sign all the contracts and
we remain as two separate you know independent humans that have come together in the middle through love
without religion or without the law it's just an idea some of you will
disagree let me know what you think in the comments section below or let me know what you think in my inbox or my
my twitter because this is a super controversial topic and it's one that we're going to be talking about i think next week with a very um awesome
person who is also developing his opinion on this i don't want to give the the
don't let the cat out the bag on this one but trust me next week is going to be one hell of a conversation the last point in my diary this week is
Why you should NOT "Fit in".
kind of linked to a lot of the stuff that i've said throughout this conversation this chat today about
extrinsically living your life through society's image of how you should be living i've just written that fitting in is a
curse and the more you can be you the more happy you will be the more you fit into society
the less free you actually are i think about my time in school and you know and we've all had that
experience in school where we want to wear the clothes everyone's wearing we got our hair cut the same way we listen to the music that is cool to
listen to and how like trapped that way of living is in fact what i've come to learn as i've gotten
older and as i've gone through life and i've become my own person and i've taken some of these shackles off is the closer i've gotten to being steve
who steve actually is the weirdo that i naturally am and that you naturally are the
expressing myself in a way that is true to myself in the words that i want to without worrying about who's going to cancel me or judge me
or my friends or friends might say you know fake friends whatever the more happy i've become the more successful i've become it's made
this podcast interesting right because i am myself there's this isn't acting this is what i think and how i feel every
week and i don't think about the impact of it the closer i've got into not fitting in
to being who i am the more happy i've become and i think it's just something to really reflect on because
there's so much of our lives that are sort of imprisoned by this idea of conformity and fitting in and being one
of the girls or being one of the lads or you know wearing those clothes or those shoes or being you know
being socially accepted and almost on every occasion i can't think of one reason or one instance where that is an
intrinsic intrinsically motivated thing to do and so the science says as we've talked
about in this podcast that will lead you to the despair the lack of joy the depression anxiety and and in many cases to mid-life crises
when you realize that you've been living your life on someone else's terms for someone else's reasons i'm on a mission whether it's through
this podcast which is my diary my thoughts or whether it's through everything else that i produce do or the work that i
pursue whether it's how i dress whether it's through the diary of a ceo live show that i'm doing to really [ __ ] be me to think for
myself and thinking for yourself isn't easy we think it is and this goes back to the point of us thinking we're in control
and getting to the bottom of what your motivations really are i'm really really trying my my very very
best at all times to just be steve and if there's anything that's had
a bigger impact on my success my happiness it's exactly that
isn't it weird when we think about our goals for the future we often say that we want to be x we
want to be like x person we want to be like x thing when really we shouldn't aspire to be more like our
idols we should be aspiring to be even more ourselves the unfiltered uncaring
unassuming intrinsically motivated version of ourselves maybe that's the secret maybe this whole
podcast is has led to that conclusion maybe this whole series is about that maybe that's what life is about maybe
that's the meaning of life maybe the meaning of life is exactly that you start
in the womb you pop out life tells you you are something it tells you to conform in the classroom on the
playground and maybe we're not just on the journey to being more human
but we're on the journey to being ourselves maybe that's what it's all about
being more human and being more like yourself

Transcription:

you've made a great decision and i say this as impartially as i possibly can but this
podcast is it's really the reason why i started the diver ceo it's to hear these kinds
of stories from these kinds of people and i've got to be honest with you i spent about a year asking this person to
come on this podcast and have a conversation with me today's guest is dr aria and he's been
on the podcast once before he's a a world renowned high performance coach and he works with some of the world's most accomplished
athletes actors and everyone in between as they try and reach a mindset state that is
conducive with success with happiness and with overall fulfillment but he's not here to talk about that
today he's here to talk about something very very different something
uncomfortable something unimaginable so without further ado
i'm stephen bartlett and this is the diary of a ceo i hope nobody is listening but if you
are then please keep this to yourself [Music]
The Story
sometimes in life you have these unbelievable somewhat cruel coincidences that occur
that it's hard to make sense of and last time you came on this podcast i would define it as for me anyway
a pretty cruel coincidence because we had a conversation um to do with life
generally and and success and the mindset and psychology and all the things that you're an expert on and for whatever reason that day
i decided that i wanted to spend 30 minutes talking about marriage cheating love
and asking you these um very personal questions about monogamy which i've
never done before with any guest ever and which i really had no place or reason to ask you more than anyone else
and it just feels to me for what we're going to talk about in part today that that was a bit of a
cruel coincidence and you know one of the questions i asked you was um do you believe in monogamy and then i
asked you can you love someone and cheat on them and when i listened to that podcast back
i now noticed um why you laughed because it wasn't you laughed yeah and
it wasn't a normal laugh it was like a real belly laughing right yeah like a bit of a nervous belly laugh
yeah after we came off air on that podcast you told me something and uh it
even gives me goosebumps now thinking about what you said and it gave the whole team in the room who
overheard our conversation goosebumps as well so
after our 30-minute conversation about marriage monogamy and cheating and love what did you say to me
i told you a story yeah and that was uh about two weeks earlier i'd been
traveling back from london home and i got out of the train station
and my wife picked me up and we got into the car and we had planned to go and have a
brunch at my favorite little spot they do amazing corvo's rancho sauce i was very excited and she said let's go
straight home i've made sandwiches and she doesn't make great sandwiches so i said no no i think the brunch is a
better option and she said no there's something that i need to tell you and i said is it bad and she said yes
and i said is that about the marriage and she said yes and then we began to
drive back and i had the sinking feeling in me
and we drove for about five minutes in silence and then i went to put my hand
on her lap and she said don't don't touch me because you won't want
you after i've told you what's happened and that's whenever it drops and i
remember that 10-minute drive back home then felt like an eternity i was just looking out the window and we
got home we got into the house into the kitchen and i was standing
by the kitchen table hands rested on it and i said what's happened and she said
i've been having an affair with a man from work
and i remember just tears began to stream i didn't move completely motionless tears began to
stream and then she said and that's not all and she said i'm pregnant with this child
and in that moment i felt like i lost a lot you know i'd
lost my wife i'd lost the life we created i'd lost the dog
our home her my parents-in-law her family everything that really held dear if
someone said what makes a meaningful life i would have described these things and it felt like they'd just been snatched
away just came crumbling down like a house of cards didn't fast forward two
weeks and steve said and i remember because the first thing
no no it's fascinating because the first thing you asked was you're married right and i do this
high-pitched laugh and i go yes and then and then the conversation
blow down and and it's themes i'd really thought about can you love someone and cheat on them
does monogamy exist is it natural are we set up to live a life where we're
in one relationship with one person only and so with the past
18 months it's been a process and some of these themes have been very real to
me i just as i reflect on that conversation and when i played it back um after you told me so we come off air
we stood next to the table and the microphones and you you explained to me what's happened yeah i'm first time in my life completely
speechless and the thing that blew me away even more so than what you'd said to me
was your ability to be so calm and rational and objective in the answers you gave
and even when i listen back now although there was that laugh which was a bit of an indication um
you were able to speak about someone betraying you or being deceitful with a
level of calmness and apparent um emotional uh sort of restraint that i i just
admired so much from someone that was right in the middle of the emotional hurricane and had just been victim of
that act and um you said that you know about the topic of monogamy
how did that change your opinion and and also the subsequent 18 months of processing on the topic of monogamy
[Music] so as a quick aside i like that analogy and we touch upon it briefly about the
hurricane and and it's funny actually because a friend of mine showed me a book about a week ago and it was
different personality profiles depending on the day that you'd been born on and whenever we looked mine up there's a
little meditation at the end a summary and it said the stillest part of the
hurricane is its center and that essentially has been uh a philosophy
that's guided my life where sometimes there's a storm and it's horrendous and it's raging but
if you can cultivate that sense of stillness and calmness and clarity deep
within you no matter what life throws at you you will be okay because the second part
of whenever i was told that news and and the tears were streaming and i felt that sense of loss
and overwhelming sadness it was a remarkable moment where in that
instant and i can only describe it as a whisper i heard a whisper within me
as if it was resonating from my heart that all will be well forwards all will be
well all will be well and i knew even then i knew whenever
you know this tumultuous emotion i knew everything's going to be okay i will get through this i'm going to
have to walk through the desert and i'm going to have to endure a horrific amount of an emotional level
but it's all going to be fine how did you know that i think it's something that i've
cultivated over over 10 15 years and that's why i do what i do now because i want to help other people to reach that
stage and and it began on a journey of um buddhist exploration and understanding
the nature of life and i came to this realization that life
involves suffering there's no promise that it's going to be happy-go-lucky
and really pleasant all the time really horrific things happen in life and on one level there's
no way that we can ever rationally explain it away sometimes bad things happen but it
doesn't end there it's a bit like that line that someone once said to century whenever you're suffering don't
ask god why am i suffering ask god where are you taking me
and so i've developed this ability to
begin to view my life as though it's happening to someone else as though the experience the thoughts
the emotions are are something that i can almost take it back on and have perspective
and i can see it and i can feel it but i know that my thoughts that isn't just who i
am my emotions isn't just through my and that's a temporary experience and and throughout my life no matter
what has happened even whenever it's been brutal it's often shifted being a new
trajectory and there's been a new meaningful life ahead of me and i
knew even then she's going to be okay she'll be okay it's going to be a tough road for her to but she'll be okay
and it's gonna be a tough road for me to you but i will be okay anger so many people in that situation
whether rightly or wrongly just because of the way that they are yeah would have reacted with anger and for some reason you were both
calm in telling me you're calm now and the this remarkable thing which i
i think i i struggle to understand a little bit is one of your first concerns was her
well-being versus your own why
because i loved her and i was in the practice of of placing her
emotional well-being and her happiness on the same level of mine if not sometimes
first and foremostly but at least so on an equal playing field and and i was just so in that habit and
that was the toughest thing to let go of the thing that i still struggle with today and i'm still
it's the one part that i realized the other day that i still had a fear of upsetting her
or her not being okay and so that's something which just
just really developed and and was so ingrained and it's interesting on the point of
anger if you said like your wife partner for 10 years married for five
has an affair and is pregnant with another man's child how will you react i would have said anger i would i'd be furious but it wasn't
there at least not initially it was this overwhelming sense of sadness it was just that sense of loss of knowing that
again that she's potentially done something that she might regret for a long time and i don't want anyone to go
through that experience where they feel like they've [ __ ] up hugely even if the the future
is positive in that moment my senses there will be regret or at least shame
and so it was a sadness because i was connected to the loss the sense of loss
of losing things i held dear feels like you're living outside your body a little bit i guess that's what
self-awareness is or at least emotional awareness awarenesses because you're being able to see that situation which
is utterly horrific for anyone yeah um from as you say from like a bird's eye view
as if you've like yeah looking down on it and that's allowing you not to just feel your own emotions but to feel
empathy towards theirs yeah and i think i think that's the path in my eyes that's the path to
enlightenment and i'm not saying that i am enlightened but i think we're all on that path i'm all progressing through it
and for me that's what awareness is it's being able to experience internally your thoughts and your
emotions and externally what's happened as if it's happening to someone else
you're like holding them out in front of you and analyzing them right but if you're not holding them out in front of you and it's happening within
you then you are just almost like a passenger on a roller coaster whereas holding them out in front of you kind of
makes you the the conductor or the roller coaster or at least uh able to yeah understand and if you can
understand then you can address and you can overcome totally i love it whenever you're holding it really close to you
you're fused with it anything that happens instantly will provoke a reaction whether or not it's
emotional or behavioral but when you hold it in front of you there's a bit more space now you still
experience it it was a brutal couple of months i cried every day
uh for maybe three months for hours hours i would i would walk and i'd
process what happened and if you want we can talk about that at some point um about my process of
moving through it but yes it was i'm not going to say it wasn't um emotionally painful but
i wasn't defined by that pain and that was just a part that i was experiencing let's talk about that so a lot of people
Processing the emotions
experience grief in many forms and this somewhat feels like this the central emotion you described as a loss it feels like a
form of grief yeah what was your process for moving from you know finding out
that it happened to where you are today where you're you know you've quote unquote processed
it i imagine as much as you might have been able to at this stage yeah
some yeah what was your process where i think people often um
catch themselves in a in a counter but productive cycle is whenever they try and avoid
experiencing what they're experiencing they try and shun it lock it away put it in a box disconnect from it
deny it and they just focus on the future and where i'm going and they might try and rationalize it uh this happened because
of x or because of y and then they try and forge ahead and i think it comes back to bite them at some
point the simplest truth is that we can only ever experience
one moment at a time and i remind myself of that i don't need to think about right now
the financial separation the divorce what it means about friends or family or or will i
meet someone again or how long will it be or what will my life look like or where am i going to live so many
different factors that could be overwhelming i just decided to deal with one moment at a time all i need to do
is deal with this one moment and what is this one bringing me and accepting and welcoming it sounds
strange but welcoming whatever comes up and so whatever emotion came up i didn't
try and push it away or shunt it or deny it or negate it i let it i let it sit and that's why i
cried so much because there was so much sadness did you write down the emotions you're experiencing
so i didn't write down the emotions but what i did in the next step is so the first step
was awareness and accepting whatever emotions i felt and i'm seeing that they come and then
they go you know that there'd be moments where i'd be laughing with my brother and then crying a minute later and then
talking about something else the second step was reminding myself of
reality because i was so ingrained in
in an internal model of what life looked like i have a strong
stable marriage in which my partner subconsciously uh you know implicitly i
believe is faithful we're meant to be together we're going to be together for the next 50 60 years until one of us dies
we're going to have children together that was my internal model
and i had to rip it apart i had to take it down i had to dismantle it and i had to remind myself of the
reality of the situation i had to accept it i had to accept it's over it's not going
to change there's no going back the final nail is in the coffin
and you need to take that on board and i'd also write any i'd write down
reminders of of what had happened and i also wrote down
any insights i had about the situation that i could remind myself of and i wrote down how i wanted to handle
this process um i can actually read a few out if you want please
please i've got um so i i literally would just write them down on my phone um and so afterwards i began to split
them up into different sections but this one was for the process hold yourself to the highest
standard choose actions that you can be proud of
how you get through this process is more important than how quickly you get through this process because for
me it was important that i still lived with personal integrity that i didn't
that i wasn't warped or changed or um consumed with
vengeance or acted in ways that was out of spite or out of emotion i wanted to
be able to look back on this in 12 months 18 months time and still feel good about it have a clear conscience still able to put my
head down and feel as though i handled that to the best of my ability with god you can get through this you
can become stronger wiser more caring more compassionate and more loving
and that's another thing that actually the deepest moments of suffering can actually be opportunities
for growth even if you don't want it there's something there that that you can learn and can grow from you don't need anything
from her anymore um and there and then different reminders
you have nothing to feel bad about you aren't responsible you have nothing to feel guilty about
nothing because there were moments where my mind would almost begin to in a way play a trick on me and begin to
try and create reasons um to feel bad or to try and create
shame and at those times while i would accept what came up i decided not to pursue that line of
thinking because that didn't fit whenever i was calm and clear this came to me and so i'd write
down whatever came to me whenever i was in a place of wisdom then when the emotion hit
and i'm not seeing clearly and i've got on a clouded lens this little baby became my best friend
because i'd go back to and i'd remind myself and then it would reshift my mental paradigm i have this um before
please do keep your phone open because i want to hear the rest of this all right but i have this um analogy i make in moments where i
experience a very similar thing but i'm going to say one example yeah it's it's the closest i can come to
resonating with what your experience is i was dating this girl and i broke up with her and three days
later i find out that she's had sex with someone else right and i can only the way that i described
it was i'm flying on this plane and i'm the pilot
and then suddenly when i fight when i when i look down and hear the news that she's just slept with someone
somebody else yeah it was like terror stormed the cockpit and they chucked the [ __ ] rational
pilot out and they were threatening to crash the whole [ __ ] thing and my whole objective as the pilot is
to get back into the cockpit before they crash this plane into the side of a mountain because if they crash the plane i'm [ __ ] and so yeah what i wanted to do
was lose my integrity yeah i wanted to crash the plane i wanted to get her back take revenge tell her she's
a this this and this and this and this and it was this because i've got to a place of where i'm able to hold
situations out in front of me a little bit more than i ever was you know in the past i was at war with myself
yeah it was the terrorists on one end telling me to crash the plane and the pilot saying you've been here before you know you
just need to keep the plane in the air until you yeah yeah and and i and i'm going for a run i'm like steve go to the gym
go for a run yeah clear your head i'm at the gym the terrorists that you know and i'm like i'm going to finish i'm going to finish
back in and then i'll come back yeah and the crazy conclusion to all of this was my friend called me
and said a few things to me about um why she did what she did yeah my
friend said to me remember steve you rejected her she really really really likes you and she's
done this as a way to make herself feel better for the rejection that you gave her and it sounds like such a pathetic thing
to say but what it made me realize in that moment was much of the reason why the terrorists had stormed the cockpit was
my ego was bruised and the thing that coached those terrorists out the cockpit was my friend massaging my ego again
and and letting me know that some of those stories we sometimes tell ourselves when we get rejected about
why we got rejected yeah weren't true it's not because you're not enough
it's in fact because of something you've done and that was the reason why i managed to take control of the cockpit i did nothing
i didn't punish her in any way didn't even mention it and it was and so yeah um but please two things come to
me there uh one is this uh emotion of anger so fascinatingly nine to five percent of
the emotion for me was sadness five percent was anger and the anger struck early on it was the first
night and i remember my brother had come over and was staying with me and i
woke up in the middle of the night the night of that day that she told me and
it was like my body was burning i haven't experienced anger like that
before it was it was almost like i was a flame i was uh just infused with rage
and i began and i really feel for my brother having to witness this but i was just
moving up and down shouting as loudly as i could my wife my house
my wife my house and for five minutes it was like a supernova it just was
just seething and then it burnt out
and i cried and i fell asleep and and the next day and then the anger didn't really come much it would come now and
again but what i realized was the anger was intimately attached to my
ego the anger came whenever i was attached to my ego and i'm very fortunate that i'm able to detect from my ego
the majority of the time but when i didn't that's when it hurt because it came
about my wife as if i own her as if there's ownership as if
it's a part of me i don't own her she's free my house
i didn't even own the house the mortgage company did you know but as soon as we link it to ourselves and make it about us
yeah then it it's it's a place of vulnerability because you're getting inflicted it's like
getting stabbed in the heart you feel that but it's an illusion because we are not
our ego you know we can see our ego and have a relationship to our ego but once we're fused with it we're in trouble
and the other part of it is that because i don't want to come across like a saint like
i didn't have dark thoughts or you know i wasn't angry and i just handled it with grace the entire time
but i operate from a principle that the mind has a mind of its own and i think we talked about it last time
but essentially your mind will populate your head with thoughts automatically
you're not asking for them it'll just come up with judges evaluations assessments predictions about the future
past memories imagine scenarios you know if i said okay steve don't
think about anything right now just for 10 seconds have a complete blank mind and i'm going to say a word but don't
think about anything okay so we'll just do it now don't think about a thing birthday okay right
so even though you were attempting not to think about your mind came up with it automatically and from my
perspective we are not our thoughts we have thoughts our mind comes up with thoughts but
that's not me i am the observer of the thought now why is that important because my
mind should come up with really brutal thoughts what thoughts like torturing the guy
really yeah getting in a car finding him shooting in the back of the van and doing this elaborate
elaborate of of what i would do to him absolutely because my mind was thinking about about
seeking vengeance justice justin justice and it was like a hollywood movie and
somehow no one found out i went back along the date you know
and so yes you can have those or whenever i was in deep pain
the thought of ending my life popped into my head i didn't have any intent i wasn't making any plans i didn't
want to kill myself but my mind wanted a way out of the pain
it was suffering and it wanted an end to it and what is one option killing yourself and so when i've got a
different relationship though with these thoughts when i think about torturing someone or i think or when my mind comes up with
a thought of torturing someone or my mind comes up with the thought of [Music]
taking my life there's no judgment i don't think oh
that means i must want to do it or that means that i will do it or that means i'm a bad person
or that means that i'm evil it just means my mind
i think what is my mind trying to do is it's trying to solve a solution and it's probably struggling to cope and
it's trying to find a way to make me feel better nia on this podcast who came on this podcast talked about how the mind is
actually you know people think we're in the search of pleasure but the mind is programmed to avoid discomfort yeah so we're
constantly in trying to seek you know avoid it and that's why we procrastinate because we've got a big project which is yeah we might not feel competent to
complete or you know we're a bit there's a feeling of discomfort around it so we go and wash the dishes we'll do the hoovering yeah um on the on the you mentioned
wanting to torture this man well i know right so like a moment of the mind having
what my mind did steve you want to clarify you didn't want to your mind wanted to i'm a peace loving kind of guy
but i wanted to know how do you feel about him
so it's really interesting i um
this stage the the process went awareness and acceptance uh how i wanted
to handle the process and then at some point i realized
i needed to find forgiveness
i'm quite a simple person and i don't i don't like having a lot of
items or objects or physical possessions and i don't like having a lot of emotional baggage either
i want to travel light you know i want to travel so lightly i could pass through the eye of a needle so to speak and the weight
of anger or resentment or
[Music] the feelings of betrayal
were weighing me down and i wanted to forgive her and i wanted to forgive him and honestly you could view
as ultimately selfish because it's not going to impact their life but it's going to make mine a lot easier
and during lockdown i was in california and i was lucky because in santa barbara
where i was staying the mayor didn't close the beaches because there's a lot of families there
and he said as long as you uh socially distance it's fine and i'd run along the beach and i had
this process where i would say out loud
i would imagine her and i would say i forgive you i'm sending you my love and i wish you
all the best for the future and i processed so much by that at that point because i've been able to
understand and see her situation and in my mind i have an idea of how it
was created and why it unfolded and so there was compassion there and i
was able to reach that really relatively quickly that that was easy the hard part was with him
because i didn't know him i didn't know his personality his
background who he was he could be a great friend and an excellent son or
[Music] potentially a very loving partner
but all i knew about him was that he was prepared to take certain actions
and so whenever i tried it with him and i'd say i forgive you
it was like there was a knot and a wince and i'm like and i would say and i'm sending you my
love
i don't wish you all for the future but you're still imagining pulling up in that van and jumping out and
blindfolding [Music]
and so but i would just notice that i don't know the tension there and and actually i will say this was a
year after i'd heard the news i didn't try and do this initially i think it would have been
uh premature to have attempted this whenever i wasn't in a space where i had
a lot more clarity and groundedness and and and process the emotion the emotion wasn't being clouded
at this point now what am i holding on to and for a matter of weeks five six weeks
i was running two three times a week and i would just try that try that process and then one day it was
it was remarkable i was running along and i said i forgive you
and it was nothing and then i said and i'm sending you my love and i felt
easy and i said and i wish you all the best for the future and i could tell that i meant it for them or
their baby you know for them to gather the family and i felt at peace
and it's a bit like that saying my yoke is easy my burden is light now genuinely it sounds strange but
i don't really feel anything for them it's almost as if you know if you came to me and said um
i've got a friend called mike and he's going through a
really difficult time he was involved in a really complicated emotional relationship um would you mind sending out positive
thoughts to him and sing a prayer for him i'd say sure like he hasn't ever done anything to me i don't have any
connection with him no problem it's almost that sort of relationship now where they're just other people on their
journey and i had that shared history with with my wife which i look upon
fondly particularly the first eight years we had a wonderful marriage for a long time but there's no
emotional tinge there's it's like an emotional umbilical cord i'm almost imagining it it's a letting go yeah it's
a letting go and so that was that was a part that for
me because i think there comes a time where you have to say okay i process it i've processed it
how long do i want to hold on to it for now and that's becomes my own choice do i want to carry this
and let it define me or do i want to finally let it go and see it float down the river
and i think you know even you're someone that has a remarkable ability to practice like self-awareness
and you know you have that sort of like emotional awareness as well and it's good to hear i think for everybody
listening to this that even your process to from finding it out
to you know being emotionally unattached to the matter to the point that you can forgive both of
them wasn't linear at all it was up it was down it was up it was down and it was
long and i think people sometimes um think that their experience of rejection or deceit
or you know um any of these things is uniquely bad because their process
to recovery per se isn't linear and it's long and it feels like the more
i've talked about this topic and the more people i've met and you know from hearing your experiences that in fact is the only way out and i
actually think realizing that that's the only way out will make your process out of that deceit or betrayal
feel normal and natural and okay and therefore acceptable and
and i think that's a really important point that you've made through the story you've told absolutely
and each person's journey will be unique and there will be peaks and troughs and
it'll wax and wane and i'm very aware that it's possible
that my journey happened over a relatively short period of time because of
my history my background as a psychologist as a high performance expert this is the area that i deal with
it's about developing emotional resilience it's how do you help people to cope with high stakes environments when they've
lost a sense of balance in their life when they're struggling in the relationships whenever they
experience something in life which throws them how do you get back up this is what i've been trained to do for
15 years isn't it weird that life sent you this challenge yeah when you think about
your experience isn't it it must be a part of you that because i think i would i would think to myself
life is testing me to see if i can deal with the worst and still maintain the values and
principles that i spouse like yeah it it sounds this will sound really odd
uh but i almost felt at times i thought in a way i'm so lucky because i'm so lucky that
i am where i am when this happened if this had happened 10 years ago i would have been in a vastly different
space why because i struggled 10 years to cope
with what life gave me on an emotional level and i would react out of the emotion so
i'd experience it and then i would just react and essentially that's when we
make terrible decisions oh you crashed the plane oh we crashed plane if you look at nasa
um astronauts they prepare for uh the sequence of events leading up
to launch and they run through that over a hundred times from putting on the kit traveling down
to the launch space to what could go wrong and they rehearse and they run it through
and it's a way of being able to stay calm whenever there is uncertainty or
turbulence or danger or threat because that's whenever that's the
person you really want to be whenever there's an emergency like we talked about in the podcast you want to be the person that still
has an air a pocket a space of clarity that isn't affected so that even though
you're experiencing all these emotions on a very physical level
deep down you're still grounded you can take it and so from where i was
i did feel as though i'm fortunate that life is thrown at me
something that in my mind was one of the worst things that i could experience there's lots of worse things without
shadow of a doubt but it was a big one um and find a way to move through and
incredibly it's informed even even my work because in the last
year again whether it's coincidence or not i don't know the number of clients i've
been working with on relationship issues has gone up exponentially and it's
issues centered on a loss of connection a loss of intimacy betrayal confusion how do you
how do you stay true to who you are in a relationship with someone else where you feel like there's a shift or
you wake up one day and you're in a space where you don't know how you got there where
you become like best friends living together rather than the passionate lovers you were 10 years ago you talked there a second
about the calm that astronauts are trained to develop and how crucial that is to making good
decisions i i saw this quote the other day and it said when emotions go go up intellect comes down yeah and um i was
thinking about just them as you said that i was thinking what are the factors that make somebody
not calm and then i thought and they kind of answered myself okay so it's we talked about the ego playing a big role and so i guess my
conclusion there is the people who will struggle to maintain their calm in situations like that
that are so personally associated are those with the lowest self-esteem and the most fragile ego and it feels like the work
that you've described that you've done over the last 10 years is really like building your self-esteem and really
in some respects a separation from ego yeah you've nailed it one we know
on a neural level so we know from neuroimaging studies that when we experience emotion
the prefrontal cortex they part the brain responsible for judgment decision making impulse control
planning goes offline it shuts down so we don't have access to that
creativity the wisdom that we have usually
and again absolutely i think the journey for me the journey of of life involves developing a robust
sense of self a sense of self that is unshakable
that is immovable that still experiences life and the whole gamut of emotions and and
the beauty and loveliness of life and also the darkness and the destruction of life
but isn't impacted on an essential level by it and i think that's the journey and
that's the journey that i work on with clients no matter what the outwardly symptoms
are it could be weight gain it could be relationship dysfunction it could be struggling to experience
that sense of contentment or fulfillment in life even though i have everything that life says i should have
it could be feeling like i'm i'm lacking or i'm just not doing enough or i'm not being enough but it all comes back to that stronger
sense of self and this um you know horrific experience
Adapting my opinion of marriage and monogamy
what has it done to your opinion of monogamy because i'm sure i'm guessing
from what you've said the way that you planned your life ahead you thought when you you know when you went walked
down the aisle and you said those words till death do us part you then planned the next 60 years of your life and how your life was going to
pan out and when you said those words at the end of the at the altar you were totally convinced
yeah totally convinced that this person was the other person your soul mate
um how do you feel about all of those concepts now like soulmate and monogamy and until death do his part
experience led me to a position where i began to question my deepest assumptions about monogamy about marriage about
lifelong relationships and in the same way i began to take a step back
and reflect and contemplate i became very aware that there is a
social script for relationships and it generally goes the conventional model is boy meets girl
it's not even boy meets boy your girl meets girl there's a first date a first kiss uh a period of courting at some point
um there will be sex meeting the parents hopefully not at the
same time eventually the relationship becomes
exclusive and engagement marriage children until death do us part and i realize
that that is a social construction it's a conventional model based on assumptions
that monogamy is natural that marriage is a human universal
and that any structure other than the nuclear one is
aberrant and so then i began to think okay well what are the different
what are the different elements so on the one hand we can take and we touch upon it briefly uh
a evolutionary perspective and we are apes it's not just that we've
descended from apes we are apes we're one of the five
homo sapiens or one of the five surviving species of great apes along with orangutans bonobos gorillas
and and chimpanzees and yet at some point we
separated from that psychologically and actually the fine print that distinguishes humans
from other great apes has been described by primatologists as wholly
inadequate it's it's a fabrication and at some stage we began to see
ourselves as special and unique and above nature and exempt from our
[Music] primal history because we descended from hypersexual ancestors so if
the homoline age has been around for two million years modern humans have been around for 200
000 years and about 10 000 years ago there was a shift in
going from hunter-gatherers to settled communities because of the advent of agriculture now
up until 10 000 years ago the data now suggests that we actually
lived by fiercely egalitarian principles everything was shared food shelter
water child care and even sexual partners
casual sexuality was the norm for our prehistoric ancestors for 95
of the collective experience of our lineage that is what we experienced
and it wasn't it wasn't based on meaningless random relationships they were relationships that reinforced
uh a social pattern that that we needed to survive it minimized
our risk and it reinforced social ties but then with the advent of agriculture
we began to settle we had then we had land we had
uh domesticated animals and for the first time private property
came into play and suddenly there was a change and there's even a change in the status of
women because when we look at the human female up until that point was on with an equal playing field they
were as responsible for the hunting and the cooking and making decisions about where they were
going to settle and then it changed and the female became the property of the man something that
he had to maintain and keep and actually the reason that property came into play is because we
weren't moving so it did matter what happened to our resources we were accumulating and biological paternity
for the first time became crucial
and so on on a natural evolutionary level
[Music] monogamy didn't exist we didn't live in long-term monogamous
relationships then we bring in marriage and if we fast forward about five and a
half thousand years in about 2350 bc
and in mesopotamia we're the first marriage between the union between a man
and a woman and over the next few hundred years it spread the ancient romans greeks
hebrews they began to adopt this widespread practice but marriage had a dif had a very different meaning across the
ages in the um fifth century with anglo-saxons it was about
securing trade ties it was a diplomatic tool in the 11th century marriage was about
financial economic and political advantage
and as early as the 12th religion be became involved and and roman catholicism tied it to
sacrament and it to being a sacred experience related to experiencing god
then about 500 years ago thomas cranmer came up with the modern day marital vows
that we read out today and he was architecture of english protestantism
and then up until 1858 divorce was rare
marriage was something which was lifelong and it wasn't really questioned but then it became a legal process that
you could apply to do and it was still still relatively uncommon because it was expensive and
women had to prove aggravated adultery bestiality sodomy cruelty and then
the divorce gates really opened up in 1969 with the divorce reform act and marital breakdown could be could
then be cited so whenever we begin to take a different lens and we see the journey
that it's taken and then we ask well where are we today since 1975
there's been a drop in marriages by about 30 more people are now opting to cohabit
than they are to get married divorce statistics in england and wales are at 42
you could arguably say that this system is collapsing that it is beginning to crumble
and they don't even take a cultural lens yeah and if i'm talking too much just no it's fascinating super fascinating so
culturally um the spanish word esposas means wife and handcuffs
we joke about the wife being the ball and chain
a friend got married got married got engaged last week and the talk amongst the boys was this
is the beginning of the end of your sex life yeah but women don't fare any better
you know 43 of american women report sexual dysfunction viagra sales are increasing every year
they're just record highs year upon year bonus through the [ __ ] reef
not that i would know yeah a friend told me yeah um
the porn industry takes in about 57 to 100 billion dollars worldwide
a u.s report showed that americans spend more at strip clubs than they do at broadway
off-broadway non-profit and regional theaters the ballet jazz and the opera
collectively we look at the church and there have been hundreds of roman
catholic priests admitting to thousands of sex crimes in 2008 they paid out 436 million
dollars to victims of sexual abuse a fifth were under the age of five
and these aren't that's not to mention the forgotten victims and we have to ask yourself one
how did we get here two how was that story constructed and three is marriage
giving us what we want and is it realistic and is it feasible
so number three where am i with that yeah yeah i'm still touring i'll be totally
honest with you i can say it i can imagine okay so i can
imagine that on the one hand i can imagine being in a relationship with with a woman and and being with
that one woman for the rest of my life i can also imagine being
with someone in a relationship and having more than one sexual partner
but but if if it was flipped around and someone asked me
would you want your partners to be with other men yeah i'd say hell no of course like it
just seems yeah it that is not something because i'm so strongly programmed
against that even though that's potentially the biological heritage i can't imagine being with someone who's
with us with other people i wouldn't want to be in that situation and i'm aware of the acute hypocrisy
contained within it yeah i think everyone feels the same way to some degree i think people that tell you otherwise are probably talking [ __ ]
because they're playing defense against not wanting to happen to them to some degree right but yeah um it's a and i think it's an ideal
situation for yourself but not for the person you're wit with from your perspective i read this book a long time ago called the mystery
method um by one of the world's number one pickup artist and i don't know if this is true but
what he was saying was men are programmed in a way that seeks um the woman to be faithful for
them because the risk the evolutionary risk was if i impregnate you as my wife um or no so if i if i'm committed to you
as my wife and then you are you cheat on me and get pregnant with someone else's child
i will then spend my resources my energy my time raising someone else's um child and then
my genetics won't pass on that person's will and essentially if you think about it from
an evolutionary perspective i then wouldn't have existed if i didn't have that concern
about making sure my sperm was the one that reached the egg i so you think about it from an
evolutionary perspective you wouldn't exist if your ancestors
hadn't done a brilliant job of making sure their sperm hit the egg and one of the ways of doing that was
making sure it wasn't another guy's sperm hitting the egg yeah by being territorial by being whatever and on the other side from the woman's
perspective the book talks about how you know if a woman got eight months pregnant um tens of thousands of years
ago she can no longer hunt and gather for herself so really she has to find a partner that isn't going to abscond that
isn't going to bounce especially once they've had sex and so the book kind of talks about some of the
the reasons why you know in society we typically think women are more in search of a relationship and are
trying to you know get a guy more than men are typically um is because
from an evolutionary perspective they would have died on the savannah in africa or whatever if
if the guy had sex with them impregnated them at a time when we didn't have birth control got them eight months pregnant and then
bounced yeah and and i don't know how true that is yeah it's something that i've believed because i've read this book for some
time so that's the dominant traditional understanding of
human sexuality because whenever you look at other species yes it's about essentially
an aggressive alpha male than uh being with a
female and knowing that their offspring is being continued through that lineage
there's an alternative which has come out more recently where i know there was a paper published
in science in 2015 that actually showed that what separated
humans from other great apes was our social organization yeah about 10 000 years ago we started
living up next to water and in camps exactly yeah so and then we were a tribe essentially i've read about that
and up until that point though it's very possible that we had uh
multiple sexual partners but biological paternity was less of a concern because our
structure was such that so what we found out now is we didn't used to live with our close relatives we actually
created social ties with other individuals and so we're set up in such a way that
the focus wasn't ever on individual survival it was on group survival group identity
group welfare and the reason is it's the group that keeps you alive anyway
and so it's very possible that then there was a shift which happened
actually with this advent of private property because that's whenever eternity would matter
because there's some hunter-gatherer communities that believe when multiple men have sex with a
female that it's to collectively because you have to think where does our
understanding of the sperm and embryo come from that's very recent it's a very recent biological
understanding our ancestors wouldn't have known that and there are some beliefs where collectively the men contribute to
the production of the child that actually it's almost like an amalgamation of the different man then creates that
child and that child becomes part of the group as opposed to that one person's child and this is the thing just to like
challenge that thinking say that there was one man in the group that was slightly better and making sure he was the one that
inseminated the female yeah he his genes would pass on yeah his his genetics would pass on as
being slightly better for whatever reason and inseminating a woman and uh
therefore in the next round of you know the next generation he would have a slight advantage pretend that that the kid of that man would have
a slight genetic predisposition for being good at that which would increase the probability that they would pass on
again and again and again and it seems like that that those genetics and that ability to be good at
intimidating whether it's through being territorial or being stronger or being more persuasive or being more you know more of a peacock yeah um
through generations over the space of a million years from the chimps that would create a scenario where we are programmed
to be through our psychology and our behavior and our peacocking good at you know yeah winning yeah
even through slightly more malicious methods or yeah and then there's also the social
conditioning and the ideas of of marriage of monogamy of romanticism
of what that means and and i think what i'd really come particularly
through my work with clients is seeing that where people find themselves in trouble is when there's enmeshment
whenever there's too much when there's too much closeness when actually the identity of one person
is submerged with the identity of the other and there's no space that happen to you
in your marriage where you became more like her
it's incredible that you ask that i have a little announcement to make and
if you're watching this on youtube you might have seen a little clue as to what i'm about to say when we brought this podcast back and we
decided that we were going to do it every single week on monday we also decided that we wanted to find a sponsor
and a partner to help support the growth of this podcast so that we can take it all over the world we can produce the
video format we can hire a big team and we can make sure it gets out to as many people as possible
and so here's what i did i thought of a couple of companies that i really really love and companies that
i've used for many many years and i've been an avid customer of and one of those companies
in fact the first company i contacted was this one hule and if you if you don't know what huel is then you must
have been living under a rock per se but huel has been a huge part of my life for
about four years i first started drinking huel four years ago when i first moved to new
york and i was running social chain and the reason i did was because i was frequently
missing meals i and if you if you know me personally you'll know how true this is i will wake up in the morning
and i'll rush through my day meeting meeting meeting meeting speaking on stage flying somewhere and i'll get to about 9 00 pm and i
wouldn't have eaten a single thing and there's no you know nutritional expert in the world that will tell you
that's a good thing and what then happened was i was binge eating at nine or ten o'clock and when i say binge eating i mean like two
large domino's pizzas to myself and so then i discovered this thing called heal about four years ago and for
me huel is a nutritionally complete drink which means that i don't have to spend hours preparing food which i
wouldn't do anyway hence why i was skipping meals it means that i get all the good stuff i need to perform and have a good diet
but i can have it in like 20 seconds and as someone that values time so so much
heal was a godsend i've been a customer for i think four years i've had my subscription with you for four
How I Lost an intrinsic part of who I was
years so when i was looking for someone to sponsor the podcast i contacted the ceo who's been on the
podcast before julian and has built this staggering company i sent him an email i said listen julian
i would love you to sponsor my podcast because i can actually talk about your product authentically
and he said to me because you've had a subscription with you for the last three four years and i know you're a customer
he was up for doing it so i thank you and um every week on the podcast i'm going to talk about different
things to do with huel to do with time saving to do with diet and nutrition and of course we're
going to get julian back on the podcast at some point their company is doing unbelievable things in the uk
if you've not seen and sort of kept up with the progress if you'll i highly recommend you do because it's one of the most exciting companies we've seen in
the uk in a long long time and it's an absolute honor and a privilege to to have them sponsoring
the director ceo the perfect company to be on this podcast because you know it's a company that is so in line with
some of my central values did that happen to you in your marriage where you became more like
her it's incredible that you ask that whenever we first met
she was the sensible one she was very prudent very pragmatic very level
headed she made very safe sensible choices in life in general and she was known in
that way i was a bit more of a rogue i was uh
a little bit more mysterious it was probably a sort of you know hint of mischievous
of um spontaneity yeah of playfulness and and there's an idea in
psychology that we all that we seek in the other person a part of ourselves
that we've lost and so there was almost that um that
attraction there it created that chemistry it drew us in together i think she was
looking for that excitement and and in a way that safe danger i was actually looking for stability and
groundedness and over time it connected us and brought us together but over time
a remarkable thing happened and that is just like you said i began to become
more like her i became became safer and i actually lost
an intrinsic part of who i was i lost the
the wild child that's in me i lost the part that's a bit more dangerous it's a bit more risky that it doesn't always say something
which is politically correct and i became almost like a sanitized clean version of who i was
and that's not the man that she met and that's not the man that she fell in love with
and on one level it it worked in terms of a stable love
there was reliability there was dependability there was relatability
but it crushed the desire there was a slow suffocation of that desire over the last
couple of years and so i believe that
one day she woke up and she sensed that loss of connection
which i also sense too and that loss of intimacy and she was scared and when the mind is
scared it comes up with thoughts is this it am i gonna have to live like this for
the next 10 20 years will i ever get that chemistry or that connection back
what if it never comes back and when we're afraid we're then seeking
that that part of ourselves that we've lost and so it's almost
less about the other person and more about us it's less about turning away from our
partner and more about turning away from a part of ourselves it's less about finding another person
and more about finding another part of ourselves in which we feel alive and i think the fear would have been
wildly tempting wildly exciting it would have been
all the things it would have given her a lot of the things that we had in the beginning that she missed and suddenly it was back
and even the structure of an affair is such that you can't
have the other person and the forbidden is erotic and it's set up in such a way that it
just perpetually creates desire because it has to be secretive it can't be long
lasting for long periods of time there's continual space now if
fire needs air desire needs space
and we found ourselves in a situation in which we're seeing each other every day i used to be traveling i used
to be working away a lot more we would have pockets where we'd be apart and in that pocket even if you're
away for a day or a couple of days there's a sense of loss on a very micro level
and then a sense of excitement of the person coming back and reimagining that life together
and so going back to your point i did i change and that song that's something
which i've learned from i've cha i changed and i became
like a squeaky clean version of me and
and she ironically ended up turning towards what she'd lost that's something you
regret i could feel regret in the way that i said it there
yes yeah being being honest if i could have if i could have changed on one level if
i could have changed that if i'd been aware of that and i'd and i'd seen it coming
then i would have wanted you to stay true to who i am and that's the
path i'm on now and i'd be curious to hear your thoughts but i
i want to live in line with my truth and it's like john 8 32 the truth will
set you free and i believe that when we're living in line with our truth it saves you and whenever we neglect
our truth it destroys you yeah and so if i if i'd if i'd been able to
stay truthful i think it would have been a very different trajectory i don't because the relationship worked
on multiple levels and we and and it did we had a wonderful um time together for
for eight years but it's a little bit like putting a frog in boiling water it
was in cold water and the desire is the frog it's alive you don't notice the heat there were
unknown factors that were at play and it was a dance it was both of us
there's no it we're we both contributed to that situation i think she wanted me to be that stable
dependable reliable person without realizing that on a subconscious level she actually
was attracted to the man that i was and i wanted to make her happy and didn't want her to
be the kind of person that creates tension or or or there being too much grit but
actually tension is what creates fire at the same time and so the rough edges were a part of
who i was and i didn't need to get rid of them it's so crazy it's almost quite contradictory the typical narrative you
My Ideal relationship structure
hear about relationships is especially from you know dare i say it um women movies and on instagram is
there's this conversation around can i change him um and it's and it seems typically that
people want to change that or they they hold out hope or they want to change their partner in some way
to make them more like the image they have of that person yes but in fact what you're describing
is the thing that ends up saving the relationship is a finding someone that
you love for the way that they are and you're attracted to the way that they are but then both
parties having a resilience to change um to some degree but because of that
understanding that you formed your relationship on the basis of this person being like this
and then but then you say okay so over time people change and in fact in
the last podcast we did there's a quote where you said change is the only constant so both of you are going to change
anyway and you talk about the spiritual psychological change that both parties go on
and again this kind of draws it back to the conversation around monogamy is you know you're going to change anyway like you 10 years ago
versus you now is probably a little bit more stable and a little bit more you know solid and a little bit more
rational in your thinking um and because as you said in the last podcast change is a constant
how do you form a how can you guarantee that death will do you part when change
might do your part first and this kind of brings us back to the conversation around monogamy which is
i guess it's my question to you is like if you what do you suspect now
if not marriage is going to be the way that you know when you meet
someone what do you suspect what's your hypothesis on how that relationship will be constructed for me personally yeah i've
got mine yeah yeah yeah but mine kind of i can tell you mine if
you want first yeah yeah okay so one kind of
so it was interesting what you said there about um space being
the air to a flame right yeah and for me that's so critical earlier on when you're talking about
marriage yeah one of the factors you you were talking about was how where marriage came from as a social construct
yeah and how it centers on like you know you know religion and god and all of these things and one of
the things that i think is also really important to understand is as a general first principles rule if
people are different and we all are different every single human being on this earth is different then the solution should be different
like the the glove we fit is different we have different size feet and different size hands so the solution to love
or whatever that is as binary as it sounds should therefore be bespoke to who you are and the life
you're living in for me i live a life where i'm i get my fulfillment out of the podcast and my work and that's it's
such a big part of my wiring i can't change that it's the way that i am i'm different from my brother and he's only a couple of months older than
me i'm completely different and so as it relates to love and me having a bespoke
solution to when i meet someone and i when i have kids or i want to you know want them to be my partner um the
solution should also be bespoke and so i look at the situation that would be right for me and it is one
that's really really reliant on space yeah i love being on my own i am happy
there i love having time to myself to reflect to think um to work on my projects space is such
a big thing for me so marriage and the idea of moving in with someone and then being you know on top of me
seven days a week for the next 60 years is a is something that i almost can't understand i'm not
sure if i'm like psychologically [ __ ] up and that's why i can't deal with that but i love this idea as the founder of
huell said on this podcast of treating my relationship with my romantic partner in the same way
that i treat my relationship with my best friend my best friend seems to get on perfectly well and we and i can't see a divorce
ever coming you know what i mean yeah because we have that space and we have the the middle ground that we meet upon
which is the relationship but we have a fundamental amount of space
um which we both need like in fact my best friend moved in with me in lockdown for a month and yeah uh
you start to piss me off so [ __ ] loud like clean up after
yourself how lowly do you choose we had an argument i remember we are going over something stupid like a video game or something um so i'm
going to conclude the point i know for me that space and the lack of being on top of each
other is something that would be a fundamental part of the relationship i have i'm willing to commit because i actually can't see a world
where i would allow them not to or that i'd be happy with them not even the word allow it's like permission right it's
like such a [ __ ] thing to say but i can't see a world where i would be okay with them
not committing to me so i i'm gonna have to concede there and i think i'll figure that out hopefully if we can keep the sex good
so space and commitment i hate the idea of marriage i don't think religion or the law have
any and should have any involvement on the topic of love i think they'd have a terrible track record religion with
homosexuality and and the you know the history it has on love and the law i didn't see why a court would have
anything to do with how i feel about someone so i hate the idea of marriage some kind of commitment
that offers me space with the right person where we both understand that at some point we might grow out of each
other and when we do um that's fine and i'm going to conclude with one point which you actually said in the last podcast
which was when i asked you about monogamy and about committing to someone for life you said to me
um don't view it like that just ask yourself the question every single day yeah today am i happy to spend today
this day with this person in this relationship if the answer is yes fine yeah if the answer is known then there's
something that needs to be addressed yeah thanks for sharing that
don't use it
i've actually got a photographic memory absolutely it doesn't work for it um what i know for for me
is there's definite similarities in that realistically i can't see myself being
in a non-monogamous relationship and if i was with someone that would be the person i would be with
in the past though in our last podcast when he asked me about the definition of love
that hasn't changed in that i believe that love is fostering that emotional and
spiritual growth of someone else but what has changed is what i've realized
in order to distinguish though between a partner that you're with and a partner that you have connection
and chemistry and intimacy with there has to be that physical intimacy
which which is maintained and which is and will wax and wane but which can still be
a light because whenever it dies it irrevocably shakes the foundation of the
relationship and i don't think i put enough importance on that
i almost had like a zen-like view of marriage as opposed to appreciating and
it was it was funny it was a um someone was speaking to him and they were saying from a male
perspective females want the new man during the day to be kind
sensitive loving and they want a and tie them up in the evening
and it but you know it got me thinking because what if the same ingredients that lead
to a long-lasting loving relationship or monogamous
marriage stability dependability relatability safety protection caregiving
what if these are the same ingredients that kill desire because what i think is true is that
and i should just speak for myself what i potentially find attractive in
the bedroom might be the things that i actually stand against during the day
there might be power and there might be dominance and that doesn't match up with how i see myself
during the day and so then you reach this conflict and i think what i began to do was i
began to become the new man and only the new man
and actually what i want to do more often is to tap more into
and there's this great philosopher called usher who says a lady in the streets
and a freak in the bed and it's like i and i heard that lyric maybe eight years ago and i literally say it
to my friends all the time when i'm talking about the type of partner that i want and it's matching up exactly what you
said the civility and the class with the lack of class and
the freakishness and the and it's it's hard to find and maintain the
balance yeah um i found yeah and because sex can be really
a journey of somewhere that you go and so then there has to be that trust and that safety there and at
times it might be about uh letting go of responsibility and surrendering
it might be about taking control and being dominant but it's an understanding what it means
to you and at what times they should unfold and and be allowed to live so your imagination can live because
when it doesn't and then it just becomes an act or something that you should do
or a way of having children then we begin to feel lost and that's you
know what's happened with a lot of clients i've seen and so going back to how i would want to
imagine the situation is yes it'd be a monogamous relationship with with another um with a woman and
i would want to try and stay true to who i am and still keep keep that whole version
of me and that's what i've learned keeping and i've gone back to that the wonderful thing is would i you know you ask me what do i
regret it the reason also why i don't regret it because i'm not holding on to it it's because the changes have happened
and i've trusted that it was meant to be and i was meant to unfold that way and i'm much more in tune with who i am now
so i finally got my motorbike license i bought my triumph bonnie uh
yesterday and i'm doing the things which and i realized because i'm drawn to more
of a sense of risk and danger and actually activities where i have to be consumed within that moment and be
present and i'm getting back in touch with who i am and how i want to live my life and what i want to stand for and it's on me
to maintain that with the next person i'm with another thing i learned was the space
because where we went wrong is whenever we didn't have the space and actually i realized i really enjoy
living alone i love that freedom my other relationships are very important to me with my brother and my best friends
and so i don't know yet what that will look like
but it will definitely involve more space and and also that sense of adventure and
spontaneity because that's what i enjoy i want to travel i want to see different countries and i've i can set my life up where i'm doing
that potentially with another person or still pursuing my passions
and that is a safe relationship relationship where that person knows that i love them and
i'm there for them but i won't always be but then kids comes in the same room
[ __ ] up this whole fantasy like do you know what i mean because then we'll deal with that in podcast three yeah
but that's that's the bit where i'm like okay it's all wonderful and perfect i was just thinking then my last three
relationships they've all lived in another country and it's and it's probably the reason why it works is because
i can walk around here my boxing shorts all day just like drinking my heel you know eating my partner or whatever
and um being myself and then we come together when they come there or i go there a week yeah wonderful love it
great and then i go back and have my you know my bachelor lifestyle you know um
but yeah like i i think um kids is a is a really
a topic which we would be like intellectually dishonest if we did it didn't
yeah address because there's there'll be people listening to this and i think okay well that's all well and good but when you become a father or a mother
you have to be there for your kids yes and there's not a lot of science that says it's not good to be there for your kids right so yes and in
the same way that we can start to though make sure that we clarify between what the science says
and then what the script is because absolutely we know that
uh children will have better emotional outcomes and even physical development and
situational success whenever they are brought up with a sensitive caregiver someone who is responsive to
their needs someone who hears them can hold them give them safety but also permission to
build to travel and come back and who's invested in that child
but i'm not aware of studies that say that the parents have to be living
in the same home in the one house 12 months of the year and be their lives to be set up in a certain
way and i don't know what the answer is yet and i'm not at that stage yet but i
would be curious whenever i am at that stage to begin exploring and it might not be
as radical as is envisioned at a certain point in time but there might be enough space or
enough still spontaneity or adventure or playfulness even on an internal level or in the way that
you set your life up where both partners have that space and still are able to maintain that
passion isn't it crazy how much of life's misery and failure and um unhappiness
Why unhappiness stems from conformity
stems from either trying to conform to the conventional way or the script as you say yeah or trying
to fit into or even sometimes answer an invalid question we talked a little bit about
this on the last podcast where i said you know i think so many people live their lives trying to answer invalid questions like
what number is orange is what i said last time and in the same way you know the question are you in love
presumes a yes just by asking it i'm forcing you to to say yes yeah or no i'm also presuming
that we've agreed upon the definition of in love which again is just a [ __ ] amazing because no one's ever told me what that
is no you're not born and they go okay god goes by the way if you ever feel this that's love okay and you go okay
got you right because i you know the word is so loosely i love peanut butter i love my dog i love my girlfriend i love my wife i
love my mom and it's like so what is it different it's such a [ __ ] confusing complex nuanced thing love
and we're forcing it into this yes or no yeah and people will like that they'll ruin good things because
they they they feel pressured or they're unsure if this is it yeah and
um i just i just wanted to kind of leave that point there in a sense of like that idea of like you know
i know so many people listening to this will will be unknowingly programmed by convention and
it's like the first principle thinking and the ability to question why you're
doing what you're doing and then i guess lastly to have the
fearlessness or the courage to potentially interrogate and then reject it um
that can literally save you in every facet it saved me like go to university get a job do this and i
i stopped going to school because i thought it was a lot of [ __ ] dropped out of university after one lecture started a business
and i am as i've said on this podcast before i'm the happiest person i know i've reached a level of success at
ridiculously young age i managed to like write us write a news story write a new script for how life can be lived
and um people admire me and listen to this podcast basically only because not because i'm
smarter than anyone else or anything else it's fundamentally if you go back to where it started was because i
for some reason was willing to question the script and then had the as they call it
fearlessness for me it wasn't for me the biggest fear was [ __ ] following the script clearly right but had the perceived fearlessness to
say well this doesn't make sense um yeah how does that resonate with you
two things come to mind one is that like you said before the solution in my
mind will be bespoke because we're trying to take a one-size-fits-all solution a panacea and
apply it to everyone and and we're all unique and it's important i think for the each to
begin to become aware of the emotional resistance we have to considering
possibilities outside of the conventional nuclear family unit and just begin to
think about what that might mean and and where where we might be able to
see change and the second part is to ask yourselves what do i think i have to have in order
to be happy so in relationships often people think marriage
children in business it could be x revenue y set up
zed lifestyle and then we can ask what will that give me
why will it make me happy because below will be the emotional need so it could be in relationships this
could be because i want affection physical intimacy a sense of belonging
stability for something else it could be status to be accepted by others not to be
judged but isn't just a yeah isn't the actual
truth based on that so on that point of marriage people thinking that they think marriage will make them happy
they've never experienced marriage before right so where have they got that idea from it's i think the actual the fundamental
truth is because they told me it would make me happy yeah we've been sold that story but what do people really
want what are they wanting out of the marriage if you go deeper there will be an emotional need that they're trying to
meet through the marriage that they think their marriage will provide the solution to but like you're saying it doesn't
well it can but it might not and so what people might actually want
is emotional connection or companionship you know if you said describe the
marriage the ideal marriage to me they might say well we're happy and we're there for each other and i have a confidant or a best
friend or i have a lover it's understanding those different parts when we've broken that down
and understand what we're what we're actually yearning for or searching for we can then ask can i meet those needs
in a slightly different way that doesn't necessarily prescribe to the conventional model and that's
first principle thinking in essence which is exactly back to like the fundamental yeah
yeah which is how yeah yeah and which is what i said before is what i love about your mind because you take it back to
your first principles and then that's whenever you potentially become you know i just threw things yeah
that's it's such a i i wish the school taught kids how to think in that way because when i if the first
principles just go back to the university point for me where i want to be i want to start a business and be a millionaire that's what
my stupid ass brain was thinking at that point right so this piece of paper who am i going to
show that to if i'm self-employed yes good point i don't want you to show it to myself everyone else everyone else around me is
sleeping on their desk and hung over and i'm going to have the same stamp that they all have
but that's actually probably going to work against me and i swear to god this isn't i'll tell you
if it was hindsight [ __ ] i was thinking that i've got this vivid memory of my first day at university and my last
um of looking over and this girl bits up being sat on my right and she was drunk and sleeping on the desk and i didn't get into a good
university because i got expelled from school so i didn't really take my exam seriously either again because of the same thinking um
but i remember thinking i'm gonna go i'm gonna get the same trophy as her is that how is that going to help me if
we both show everybody and i just think and then you've got it was boring as [ __ ] like i've been running businesses
since i was 14 day one they were like make a poster i swear to god the lesson my last lesson in my first year at
university was make a poster and i thought this isn't gonna in terms of the information part that's
not gonna give me the information and it was that and i walked out there i walked into the business office
and i spoke to the head of the business at the university and i said i'm going to defer for her for a little while she said cool fill out this piece of
paper and you can defer i never even filled it out and never went back turns out i actually hadn't properly registered for university either like as
i was meant to so i didn't really have to defer and that was it and you know i wanna i
wanna move on because you spent a lot long time talking about this topic i you said earlier on that you spent lockdown in california yes which is uh you know
i'm jealous you don't know and and it cuts both ways you don't know
what's going to happen in the next moment we have a projection of the way that we think our life will
unfold and often we become tied to it and bound to it and any deviation we can see as a
failure of some sorts but actually sometimes life has other plans for us
and when we don't know what's going to happen i think it keeps that freshness you keep fresh eyes and you stay
grateful for what you do have while you have it on the other hand
we don't know what's going to happen and it could all be taken away from us at any point and i've got a good friend of mine and
his father uh just had a stroke a couple of days ago and they now know the outcome is he
won't be around 10 days goes walking in in south ken and five minutes after i passed and was
coming back there was um barriers put up and
a uh refuse collector had been walking out in a bus and knocked him down and in an instant
his life was over and i just imagined that i could be completely wrong but i could i imagined gosh he might have a family
he might say goodbye to his wife and the kids in the morning and he went off to work and he had no idea and she had no idea
and and the things that were really that might have been niggling or causing arguments don't matter now like
none of that matters now and and i didn't see what was going to happen coming and and i you know i lost it on
one level i lost a lot and it makes me really appreciate what i had but then on another level that wasn't
the end to the story and then it was as if life said you're
on this path and i'm going to shunt you into a new trajectory
and that's the path you're meant to be on this is where you're meant to be going and i believe that it's a part of my path and it was meant to unfold this way the
universe is unfolding as it should and it's a lesson for me to continually trust and that's why that voice came up
in the very beginning in my heart saying all is well because i know on a deep level that all is well
it's just about trusting sometimes letting go of our ideas and living in this moment
i can think of a better ending listen i i don't even you know thank you
so much for so many reasons because what you've done today on one hand will probably be selfish
selfish as i as you move forward and realize that the release of your truth and talking
about it and processing it with people is always liberating but on the other hand it's incredibly
selfless because there are so many people that are going to going to have less pain deal with their pain
better and understand themselves and hopefully be a little bit more self-aware because you had the guts
and the um and the you know the humility and lack of ego to share what is an incredibly emotional
um touching personal um experience and so thank you so much it's helped me
you know and i have no doubt that the hundreds of thousands of people that listen to this it's going to help them in the same way
um if people want to find you and they want to talk to you about this and i'm sure
there will be a lot of them you know the podcast was big back then it's much bigger now right how do they find
you what's the best way to reach you so on instagram it says at dr.underscore aria
or my website which is drhyphenaria.com and what kind of services do you offer
people that are going through you know various predicaments so i do one-to-one coaching so
right now everything's done digitally but essentially it's identifying what aspect of your
life right now is critical for you to resolve and then helping you with the psychology
and the mindset to be able to work through that or work
with that so it could be emotional resilience it could be sustainable weight loss it could be
relationships it could be taking your business to the next level in terms of how you
view yourself as an entrepreneur um it might be fears loss of intimacy
impostor syndrome whatever issue is actually there for you i'll
check if it's something that we can approach from a mindset point of view and that's where my expertise is and then help you on your journey as you
then have a more empowered mindset so that you're developing that robust sense of self and you're able to
change and adapt and be fluid in your journey and keep on growing essentially
we have um we have such good conversations even off the podcast we met i think last week or the week before
and had just an open conversation about a bunch of things in life so i actually wanted to ask you i've never asked a guest this before but
is there anything that we've missed in terms of the topics that you think are
curious to the relationship we have or pertinent to the relationship we have or um any sort of learnings that
you've garnered from our conversations that you think we should be sharing with people because i feel
somewhat i thought those conversations were so rich that i i you know we talked about so much last time and
um even in our private conversations i just i just wonder if there's anything else any sort of key topics that you
i'm sure there will be like i don't think we've exhausted our conversation we'll be back for a third hour
listen thank you so much for your time i appreciate it i i yeah i appreciate it so so much more than i you know people they give up
so much time and they fly to come and do the podcast but um the what you've given today
i don't think you'll realize how selfless um that act was because of the value it will give to people and this is exactly why i do this
podcast um to hear these kinds of things and to to hopefully make myself better and the listeners
better for hearing it so thank you a million million times over thanks steve thank you

it's very rare that you get to meet entrepreneurs that are following and have followed in the steps

that you followed in in your life and like so whenever i meet people like you and ben francis who

is similar age to me who has like similar life ambitions um i see it as like this really amazing

rare opportunity to learn for myself and to ask honestly like selfish questions and i saw on your twitter i think it was

over the mental health week period you did a tweet where you talked about your experiences with

depression burnout and anxiety and from what i know about your story you experience those things in that

order so i think that's a good place to start which is let's talk about depression and the the role that

depression played in your life and where it came from and how you've overcome or are overcoming all handling depression

Depression - where did it all start?

yeah so interesting actually because um i i realized when i started to talk

about mental health stuff even more interestingly than what you've just said i kind of realized that

i'd been burying another mental health problems actually the the tweet was more depression burnout anxiety

um and insomnia but actually it's really interesting i did a podcast interview with a nutritionist

called rhiannon lambert and when i was preparing for that i was going over my the fact that i'd grown up fat and the

fact that um you know i probably did have an unusual relationship mentally with food and

um suddenly like i was unpacking what had happened in my 20s and i actually had bulimia i used to throw

up for like four to five years not intentionally though this is like quite unusual but that's

how deeply rooted this mental health problem was i would eat something and i would throw a lot of it

up um my friends would like know about this but it wasn't like labelled and i went to you know specialists in harley street to

see what was up and they were like medically you're fine so psychologically there's something there

anyway i haven't done it since i was about 26 or whatever but it suddenly occurred to me a few weeks ago really interestingly

that you know being able to label like the time i got depression the time i got anxiety the time i got

insomnia the time i was burnt out i remembered those moments this one i'd

actually buried as a story right in my head and never i'd never expressed it in my whole life to anyone

publicly at all full stop um and it was a couple of months ago i wrote a newsletter on mental health and

uh and nutrition um and i admitted for the first time then that i'd had bulimia and like what the symptoms

were and how long it had gone on and the fact that i was basically like losing lots of weight getting really skinny and all i saw was someone fat

um and it was so interesting to me like two revelations that came from that one is that um if it's

so uncomfortable right it's for me it's really embarrassing to admit to myself that i was weak enough to have a mental

health condition that bad that i would psychologically throw up when there was nothing biologically

wrong with me um that's really awkward to admit to yourself it's also far more terrifying to admit it publicly

once you've uncovered it and it kind of made me reflect on the fact that um sometimes like these things

are actually just so painfully embarrassing about your personal life that you can even bury it to yourself did you ever understand why you were

bulimic was there because it's a psychological like comorbidity so what was the cause it's really hard to

say what the cause was because i got it after i'd lost weight um so you know by the time i was sort of 21 or whatever i was in perfectly

reasonable shape um but i got it at like 23. um and actually there was a result of it um the

only time i was ever hospitalized it's a really random but hilarious story in its own way

um because i've been throwing up i've been basically like hurting the inside of my throat right and i was at a festival one time and i

had a coughing fit in in hackney and i had a coughing fit at the hospital and i coughed a hole in my

throat literally it's called a pneumomedia steinem it's a very unique

thing to happen apparently and fortunately it was close enough to the royal london hospital to go in there and show them right

and basically what happened to me was my head started to grow so i was with my friends feeling fine other than this

cough and one of my friends just looked at me and was like whoa and i was like what they're like may your head is massive

i'm like i'm not even talking mate maybe a dick no no your head is growing what is going on i was like what and then

everyone else was like oh my god anyway walks to the hospital um it's sort of like five

in the afternoon or whatever because there's a day festival um and there's like you know it's east london there's quite a lot of genuinely

like gang related things people are bleeding everywhere all this stuff and they just see me and they're like that guy's next

and put me and i went into intensive care for like the whole week um whilst they were basically trying to sew up this hole in my throat when you say

your head was your head was growing so oxygen was going uh not going like in my mouth and through my

bloodstream properly somebody was escaping around my head and my brain so it was like an emergency procedure to like like get me on

uh meds and sort me out but it's so interesting because even knowing that that had happened to me i didn't relate the cause

to actually a deeper root cause which was another mental health problem um to be honest with you like i couldn't

say to you what the trigger was beyond this like story you know the things that we grow up with the people

that we grow up with those little you know bullying and things like that i mean you know in some good respects

because i grew up fat i've got a good personality and a sense of humor so i've always been like able to really connect with people because i just never

had it all my way kind of thing do you know this this story about you know um people that are fat having

better senses of humor and being a little bit more you know quote and quite bubbly yeah why why is that i think self-deprecation

can sometimes be like a defense mechanism right and and ultimately you know with these things you're going

to hear them a lot if you grow up you're going to hear it a lot right you're going to go to a new environment someone's going to bully you for the obvious and so

you kind of find a way of coping with it in your own way um for me it's just interesting because

the other mental health um issues that i've had in my life i'm able to trace back usually to a

moment or a thing or reflect on why this one kind of just happened later and then as soon like you know i had it for

a few years but then it just also went away at what age was this so about 23

to about 27. are you old now uh 33. so it was so you had it for 23 to 27 for

about four years and you overcame yeah but like

naturally i wasn't doing anything different i mean i started to learn what foods would make me more sick than others if that makes sense as well

um but i find it super interesting again less so i mean we're cool to know

the trigger obviously but it's almost less so that and more so the fact that um it kind of ran its course as

well was interesting to me and that i buried it right in my head um and actually 27

um you know was the start of like a whole other you know experience in life for me anyway

so it is possible that um you know these things are related to stress and other things

um my entrepreneurship journey started at 24 so it's not completely unrelated but not quite not

not enough to actually label it and say it's for a thing um but then you know the

other the other experiences um that i've had with with mental health a lot clearer so i

think depression is a really complex term um and the only i think it's really

worth saying the only relation that i've got to depression that i'm comfortable talking about

um is after my father passed away and i think that's really reasonable right and so this is

the thing i like because i work so so much with people in mental health and experts i know like depression is also

not something to claim you have when you feel down or you know it's very different like and

obviously there is a spectrum of these things as well but for me my depressive episode was

right after my father passed away because he was on life support for six months and overcame

when they said he's 100 going to die actually survived made it out of the hospital into

recovery home and then someone basically had a cold around him and he died of their cold catching their cold

after the entire recovery process um the truth of the matter is that my depression was actually interestingly

sort of linked with a lack of belief in um a higher power or whatever you

want to call it justice like everything right because in fairness yeah and like my dad was like such a generous spirited guy

he was blind he had all of these things wrong with him anyway and still like was just the funniest nicest

warmest person anyone knows and um the last person on earth to kind of deserve something like that

and so for me the um the experience after he passed away so

he believed in god so when he died i was like that's my connection to god gone

therefore i straight up believe in nothing um you know i think it's really interesting to have conversations with people

intelligent people like yourself when you talk about purpose and vision and these things it's very

hard to imagine that you've got a purpose a vision for anything if suddenly you've switched

and you've switched off and you've said i believe in nothing you did totally destabilized yeah yeah i remember the the feeling of

being i was religious until i was when i was christian until i was 18. and then which i think will surprise a lot of people because i'm a very

rational sort of someone that makes a lot of decisions and things from first principles or logic and then at 18 i lost my faith per se

and it was the most like the two years following that were the two most destabilizing years of my life

as i i became a total obsessive atheist which means i read every book watched every documentary video

and then i got to the point and this is when i realized that i'd overcome my sort of wobble where i no longer cared about

engaging in these debates with people that agreed or disagreed with me and i was at peace with my own beliefs

that um i guess which is like agnosticism if that's a term and the other really destabilizing moment in my

life where i lost my sense of purpose was the day someone offered me about

20 to 30 million um hypothetically to buy my business and 18 year old steve shows up i've

talked about this a few times because he thought we were doing this for money he thought that was the goal

and so i go home that night i remember where i sat like it was yesterday i'm typing rightmove.com looking at

houses at 24 years old and then i'm looking at these houses and i'm getting this real sort of deep sense of um unfulfillment by

thinking well that was that was it that was the game and then like okay so um auto trader boom

boom lamborghini aventador i'm looking at this aventador and feeling like i'd be poorer not in a financial sense but in like a

spiritual sense if i chose to step on what's clearly a hamster wheel

and and that so from that day the day after i didn't know why i was i didn't know

why i was working hard anymore i didn't know why i was building the business and i had to then go in search of a real form of stability in my

life which was you know i love it but i thought i loved it for another reason i thought i loved it for money

but i loved it for connection and for conversations like this and those things but to go back to your point please um

Psychedelics

you're talking about how you lost your sense of sort of stability i guess yeah i lost what i believed in this world

yeah and if you don't have a sense of belief it's really hard to find your purpose and i i would say that i

i went through a few years of that um very important age sorry uh so 24 my dad

died so i mean also similar time to having the yeah i mean i didn't even realize that as

i until i was saying it just now um but so probably related obviously um but

i i went through about three years of not believing um

in anything right like really and you know not very nice about it either um so i

grew up jewish um and i've always said in fairness you know i think judaism is as bad a

religion as all the other religions you know i don't actually personally uh like any one of them

but i do love what they all mean but then you know it's very possible to be wise and not associate yourself with a

religion and what i've learned which i find so interesting is my identity my connection to

spirituality and judaism is a weird one as well because it's like a race and a religion so it's like you can actually be not

religious you can lose your religion but still be the race yeah um and that's that's like an actually it's a positive in a way because it

means you don't have to disassociate from cultural values but you can disassociate yourself from religious ideals

and what actually happened to me was you know i would be relatively difficult

and question people a lot when they would talk to me about their religious beliefs i'd want to dig into them and i'd really

want to challenge the way that they think and why they think these things and how they can defend them but not trying not to be an absolute

[ __ ] but just using my own i guess bitterness and my own experience of growing up being told

to believe in something which is very different to finding something and you know when my father passed away

and i didn't have this connection to it anymore i also felt like i didn't have a connection to spirituality or anything

and so it's very weird to have like almost the death of a religion as a human being because that's your death of your

connection to this earth and purpose and everything and it wasn't until i was 27 really um

one of my really good friends told me about um and obviously we've been talking about christian angermeier as well like our mutual friends so this is

a relevant conversation told me about ayahuasca and i'd never heard of it before i didn't even know what it was

um and i went on a retreat with him and um i mean i came back that weekend

completely i mean when i say a 180 i went from the most cynical non-believer in the

whole world negatively so to like without sounding like a complete

[ __ ] like positively enlightened and confident never never

more confident of anything in my life um of spiritual realism

and what i believe in and ultimately what i believe in when i have these like fun conversations with people now about

spirituality which is you know what do i believe in i believe in nature i believe in

looking at the beauty of the world and how cycles work which is science right and the way

that my ayahuasca experience actually opened my eyes to believing in something spiritual or greater than myself

was 90 percent of my hallucination was observing what happens in nature with cycles

right birds bees oxygen air soil all of this recycling all the time

for a sustainable system and being like you know that is in itself a scientific miracle but

something greater than us that's always happening throughout time and it was a real shift for me because

a i overcame my depression from that b i suddenly believed in something

even if that's something is nature and when people are like and i get this from christians quite often as well because they're like you know what do you mean

you believe in nature like what is that i'm like i mean it's it's more believable than a guy that walked on water

yeah and when they like get annoyed i'm like i've got nothing against jesus i'm just saying that like believing in nature as ridiculous as

that sound is a profound belief and what's important is it is a belief and having a belief has actually helped

me helped guide me to then work on things like what are my personal values you know which you talked about you know mental

models what do i say yes to a no to in life well you can only figure those things out if you spend time with mental models

first principles thinking about what things mean to you in life and then suddenly

other things start to come into flow and and so i really want to just double down on this ayahuasca experience

what exactly did you do on that experience so ayahuasca is essentially uh and it's

completely natural it's tree sap from the amazon um and it's been practiced for thousands of years and

you know i won't go into like the whole history of psychedelics but i could do because i've read a lot about it um the the reality is it's sacred

so our shamans have like a legal license to practice with it um and they it's a guided experience so

the most important thing to say to anyone thinking about ayahuasca or whatever like it's not something you do at home on

your own at all ever you could do that with mushrooms you can definitely do that with lsd

you definitely do not want to do that with ayahuasca because um in my experience the other

psychedelics are a bit like you can have sort of one foot in this world one foot in that world and ayahuasca is not even in this

plane you're just somewhere else but what's fascinating and very common from people's recollections of ayahuasca

trips is you have a spirit guide called mama ayahuasca that's what everyone calls

her um and in all of my experience of doing it and

i've done it about 12 times now so i almost go back every year by the way it's an incredibly painful experience

and it's very difficult to do and it's not something you look forward to which is why it's like rockish rocket fuel growth um which is

why i do it because you learn all the things about yourself you don't want to hear you don't want to know and you confront the

worst realities and i've learned more in those weekends that i've done this then you know you can learn with therapists

and you can learn yourself so staggering everyone says this to me and it's and you know you mentioned a guy called

christian angermeier context he runs a company called a thai which are are now developing um psychedelics as a way to

cure treatment resistant depression um it's really sort of a groundbreaking company and he sat with me in his

his penthouse just across across the street in fact from where we are now and he was telling me that you can let

you unlock the brain by taking these drugs and you discover truths about yourself which

in many experiences which is similar to what you're describing will have a permanent lasting

transformative impact on the way you see the world and it like corrects your thinking and it's it's

it's crazy crazy for a normal person that isn't in this world or doesn't understand this to think that you can take

a magic mushroom or a drug or a psychedelic or whatever you want to call it and overcome grief there's a great book

by michael pollan called um how to change your mind and in it he talks about this problem with

psychedelics it's a bit like dreams right you're having an ineffable experience so to describe it for people was generally

quite boring what i think is more interesting in a sense is to discuss the outcomes that i've i've got from it

um so the first time you know very quickly because you asked the experience was the hallucinogenic

experience like i said was watching the cycles of the earth develop and were you conscious because right so

you haven't done it yes so you drink it it takes about an hour for me you lie down the pitch blacks fluid

it's like a shot it tastes disgusting but some people like it you lie back um and and the shamans basically start

playing music and it's a completely guided facilitated experience with them if you're having problems they come over they help you if you need to be taken

out the room they look after you it's like you know it's busy night there's noises like a lot of people throw up

how's this for irony i didn't throw up for my first 10 times which everyone was like that's super weird i was like yes especially

considering my history really bizarre um but the

um the experience i saw was the one i needed and there's a really deep insightful experience you get from

psychedelics which you can often go in wanting a thing but it isn't what you need and in this experience what i

wanted was to see my dad and to connect with my dad but it isn't what i got what i got was

um a vision of understanding how everything in this earth is living

in a cycle like a beautiful miracle and so it was less about like seeing micro things and seeing macro things

being in it if it's taking me to a place i don't want to go and a door i'm not ready to open

you can negotiate you can actually say i'm not ready for that yet and sometimes it'll push you and say open it anyway but sometimes it will

actually listen to you and let you go sort of back into your body so it is a really fascinating

experience and what i'd say about it is it's the number one most important thing i've ever done in my life

um and especially because it's not pleasant um the first time i

did it was you know the single most life-changing moment in my life not only got over my depression you know

i went and spent the whole day with my mum the next day explained everything that i'd experienced um you know not a

mum's favorite chat hearing your son talk about psychedelics but certainly is in context of like helping me get over

something she was aware i was suffering from um the single greatest lesson i've learned in ayahuasca is about gratitude

so i was going through a period i think i was 30 potentially it was a few years later and

uh things were going well at the time so my attitude my mindset was i want this i

want that right what's your intention going in well i want this i want that that's like how you answer it because you're not enlightened enough

to understand the psychedelic experience right yeah yeah and you can write it down and come back to and be like that was what i was looking for in this journey

um but actually the lesson i learned so i was asking you know how can i 10x what i do

how can i be more how can i become better how can i have more impact you know me me me me all these questions um i was

instead transported to um like basically i'm not sure where in

the world but a very poor part of the world where there was this like kid like begging

in the street basically and i like became that kid and i became this person like trying to

get water for his family and having to walk miles for it and

50 of my whole entire psychedelic experience that night was literally walking like a mile in this

boy's shoes and it this lesson sort of came to me about you know it isn't always about what you

want and it isn't always about like you know asking for more it's actually about having gratitude for

what you have and when you have enough gratitude for what you already have you will unlock the path to more

and you know there's this thing that i've learned as well which is when you go into experiences it's helpful to have a totem

right so i carry a different stone in for each experience and i have these stones at home anyway i have this stone

by the side of my bed um and every single morning that i wake up the first thing i see is this stone

literally just a pile of crap stone but the point is it's imbued with this message for me and i wake up every day and i'm grateful

for having running water in my bathroom there and that is like an unbelievably poetic

and powerful way to live your life past an experience to wake up in camden town in london being you know

so fortunate like i am but with a real genuine reminder of gratitude as opposed to like waking

up groggy and being like hey i'm grateful for waking up today this is like it means something to me so these little triggers and shifts they

emotionally change something in you but i've learned a lesson the hard way through ayahuasca as well which is

just because you're learning lessons this is like all wisdom right it doesn't matter whether you get it from ayahuasca or you get it from you know your

instagram posts you can read it and it can resonate and you can be like wow that's powerful

without action it means nothing so if you don't create then the steps

to be better based on what you learned you're wasting a very powerful weekend and painful

weekend and i've been guilty of that too i've learned i've learned lessons that i haven't necessarily followed

through with and you know and and sometimes it's because they take bravery

and i feel like i'm not ready for that bravery up and so we were talking about the other day you know with the exactly with personal

branding exactly actually that's actually a good segue on to that topic as well because it's something that i know for a fact a lot of people

Posting online despite what people think

struggle with in different forms and um but in but also specifically with this topic which is

putting yourself out there on the internet um i know this because a lot of people have told me but also

because i've been there right so let's if we rewind a couple of years in my own life

a guy called ash jones says to me you should make a youtube channel i dismiss the idea obviously because i'm

like well people are going to think that i think i'm mahatma gandhi like or like people are gonna think that i think i'm a genius or

that i think i have all the answers so i'm not doing that eventually after two years he sits me down in this room and it took

about eight or nine hours for us to shoot a two-minute video because i couldn't speak i i was

self-conscious and all of these things and i was plagued by that thought that my friends back home who knew me in

school will think oh steve's a [ __ ] he's changed what's he doing who does he think he is and that almost imprisoned me it almost

stopped me from doing the thing that actually liberated me made me the most fulfilled i've ever been and by allowing me to be my like true

self and in fact what i wanted to do was be true to myself and um

it felt like i was worried that people would think i was um being something i was not trying to fake

myself and so i guess the question that i have for you is you know a lot of stuff but you've not

you know you've got a great podcast secret leaders you've got a new podcast as well which is centered around your brand heights um

you've struggled to put yourself out there on the internet and social media can you explain why yes i mean such a good question

steve um but also because we connect a lot on this right so you're like my unofficial mentor with a few voice notes where i'm

like he's got a [ __ ] point here um

so you know it's i guess i'll put it a slightly different way you know i was listening to one of your early but you sent me this actually your podcast with

with him so what was his name ash jones yeah yeah you told me to listen to an episode which i did and you know he was talking

about the early days of social chain you learned early that you you were bringing in most of the revenue like

steve was bringing in most of the revenue therefore the business decision made lots of sense to center that around you i think when you're doing b2b that makes

loads of sense the challenge i have is um my products are b2c right they're for consumers

and putting as much time and effort and thought and energy into promoting myself is is mental

energy i should be putting into the brand and you know there is i think uh probably a reasonable compromise and

also like all things this is a bit of a developing scenario however um you know it's a very

fair thing to say that i'm not the product this is the product um inside my company we could all agree

that that is like broadly true right we're selling a thing we're not selling me whereas you know going through exactly the same

experience at social chain you guys if you weren't in the room you guys would have come to the same conclusion which is steve's the greatest like part of the

funnel here so we as a company succeed when steve's succeeding so that's the kind of marketing final we should back so you

know i can see you sort of smirking at me because this is the story i tell myself okay fine because i was like this doesn't make

this is the story this is the story that i tell myself it doesn't mean that it's true um

you know then there's another question about platforms right so um you know this isn't a mental health

condition um but i do have imposter syndrome and you know we've talked about this in the

past as well but um you know the first business that i scaled

uh was grabble and which is when we first met yes um and you know that

that was me going into technology and fashion having had no experience previously i was in advertising before

and i love changing industries and i love challenging myself to completely wipe the slate clean and do something new but it comes

with imposter syndrome that's what i've learned about myself right i'm i'm full of the internal monologue of

i'm not good enough no one cares what i think and i don't deserve to be doing this it's someone else's dream

um that doesn't change right in me that that voice is still

there um however you know a really good thing if you're aware if you're consciously

aware of your limitations especially like some of your mental frailties creating steps to improve those things

are helpful so with heights the first thing i did just over 100 weeks ago we started a newsletter

because i was like i'm going to get imposter syndrome so badly in a space of neuroscience and nutrition

not neuroscientists or nutrition like it's going to be awful for me so i'm going to write a newsletter every week

and i'm going to read a science paper every week and i am going to distill that into three minutes because when you read something you learn it once and

when you share it you learn it twice so the process of literally rewriting this was creating neural pathways

and embedding the information into my brain so i was like in a hundred weeks it's actually what i told myself and it's just

been 101 now um in 100 weeks i won't be a neuroscientist or a nutritionist but i will have read over 100 science

papers and i'll know what science says is good for your brain according to journals experts etc which

would be an amazing step to create an amazing habit to build to get over my own mental frailties and

my own story of imposter syndrome so when it comes to social media i feel like i've got the same thing which is

like um when my last company failed and i didn't know what i was going to do

next i looked at like my social media platforms i was like you know where am i going to spend time rather than where am i going to waste time

ultimately right because you can get caught up in this silly game and then thinking personal branding where do i feel

comfortable that would be a good place to start and i chose linkedin and the reason i chose linkedin was because i told myself

a story which i completely believe to be true anyway which is whatever i do next i'm a serial

entrepreneur right as in i'm fine not having any money i'm fine working for other people for free doing all these things but i'm always going to

start something else myself again so if i know that to be true it means i'm always going to hire people

and what do really smart and impressive people want from their boss they want to know who they're working for they want to know what your values are

they want to know what you believe in they want to know what kind of things you share and so i was like linkedin is the only place that could credibly do that for me

right and i actually went from i mean it's not you know that impressive but i went from like 3 000 followers or something to almost

25 000 on the basis of and as you know there's no putting money behind anything in linkedin or anything

literally just by being myself by writing about how i'd failed by writing about what i was working on

next by working and and also all of the things when you know writing about what you're working on next is such a difficult thing to do because it's

probably going to fail as well and it did you know before heights um with three iterations of things that i

was publicly putting out there and getting feedback on and stuff that we had to kill because it didn't have legs um it's a horrible time for an

entrepreneur in between or it can be certainly in between people like what do you do and your identity is in flux and you

know you're like do i talk about this new thing that i've just discovered that might not be a thing in a month preaching here dan i know right exactly

exactly but it's such a complicated answer to give in the now yeah um so anyway like on the personal brand

thing like i decided linkedin was a place i felt comfortable because i can be my authentic self because i am an entrepreneur because i

am someone who is willing to go big and fail and like actually figure out

why and talk about why and i think this stuff is so important um for entrepreneurs to

connect openly and honestly because i absolutely hate and the one thing i will not miss about networking events

is like going to them and everyone talking about them killing it you know that is literally poison in our society it's

nonsense so everyone just talking about how they're killing it stops people from saying actually you know shit's really hard

right now this is the problem i'm dealing with and this is like how it's making me feel if you're able to say that to another

entrepreneur because you've created the container in the environment to be comfortable to do so that person can probably help you and if

you are stuck with the narrative that everything's going amazingly all the time and that's all you're telling people no one can help you

figure it out when you actually could do with the help you know it's the other thing going slightly off piece sorry but

you know my biggest bug bear in entrepreneurship is stealth mode i think stealth mode is like the most

stupid thing that an entrepreneur can claim to be in full stop because as you know ideas are worthless execution is

everything anyone that's ever built a business knows how stupid it is stealth mode is when people say like working on a new business in

finance in stealth mode right i'd love to see i mean not telling anybody yeah i'd love to tell you what my startup is but it's so amazing you'll

steal it so i'm not going to tell you guys all the time all the time so many people

do it and and i i i give the most direct feedback on linkedin probably very similar to you like loads

of people asking my help for loads of things all the time and if i ever see stealth mode on their thing i'm like i don't talk to anyone in stealth mode

fyi stealth mode is such a stupid thing because it's it's it's like how do i describe

like saying i'm afraid of feedback but it's yeah but it's also like saying i've got something that i can't tell you

yeah why did you tell me you had something i know you know just don't start the conversation with me i'm a curious

person what it is but you know you're attention seeking but you don't want to tell it's like it's a weird form of

like i don't know flirtation i don't know um but i want to get to this point about

why you we have this conversation yeah like a week or two ago about instagram and making videos of yourself

and putting your ideas out there what is it that's stopping you doing that you talked about imposter syndrome i guess that kind of relates to the

business side of things more what's stopping you going on instagram putting a video on your instagram and saying

this is what i think these are my ideas comment below if you agree yeah you're it's a great question um

so i guess as a starting point like it's worth saying that i think a very healthy way to approach stuff like this in your life is to to

choose a place build confidence and go on from there so i feel like that's what i did with linkedin i understood that that's the

place where i'd feel least impostery and so i'd start there now you know i picked up on on twitter i

mean twitter is like my favorite platform that's when i spend probably the most time on um but you know it's it's got a very short

half-life so it's kind of impossible to to consistently come up with gems um

instagram you know to me was this place where just beautiful people live young beautiful people live and that's all

anyone's interested in and that's not really my world right i'm interested in challenge i'm interested

in mental health i'm interested in stories um and i interestingly i wasn't finding

that on instagram so i was like what am i doing i don't really belong in this place at all um i'd say like a hundred percent

like inspired by the way that you've approached your instagram like sharing insights because insights and like distilling my thoughts into something

and writing them down that is something that i do i just don't publish them or i was on linkedin

so actually like what i've now started doing on instagram is like literally taking a leaf out of your book after our chat which is going through

some of my high performing linkedin posts that you know might have got one or two thousand likes and being like if

it was popular there i guess it'll be popular let's have a go and trying to get over it now slowly but surely but it's this

constant belief that no one wants to hear what i have to say yes of course and that's what i was getting

at and like where does what are the forces that are

at play which are making it feel like some like psychological discomfort if you are

to tell the world what you think on instagram let's say what in your mind what is it friends back

home is it this particular person sometimes i can think of a particular person and i can think that person from four

years ago is going to think i'm a dick 100 dude like the thing that i've learned which is so interesting is

90 percent of my fear of what people will think is based on my school friends yes who like you know i only speak to a

bunch of them now you know identity is such an interesting thing and you know you have it when you're um you'll be going through it right now

and i empathize right you're not steve from social chain anymore yeah right and that's you know for ages you know i was down from gravel now i'm

down from heights um you know people do that and that's fine but it's important you don't over

compensate that identity for yourself attached to your business because we're all on a path and we're going to go

through a journey and the journey the stories are going to change and when you over attach yourself to a particular

part of the journey is where you can find struggle and that's and on that point you build your life around

that identity so your friends the you me your music your interests and so you you would have collected

through your life a bunch of people who know dan as this exactly and you're gonna have to shed

some of them potentially by by stepping into your new identity 100 and that's a i guess a conflict or a

100 and it's difficult right but as you grow you edit and you know you need to really consider

who you're editing out of your life and who you're welcoming into your life and i think you know there's the the

practical reality that what was good for you five years ago is no good for you right now and frankly you know the highest

leverage decision you can make i'm still terrible at this by the way but the highest leverage decision you can make is picking what to say no to

and the hardest thing you can do is say no to opportunities that you would definitely say yes to so you know that includes friends that

includes saying i don't have time for this friend anymore or this identity this part of my

identity anymore even though i like it i like them i like all this stuff because

frankly there's you know this shedding almost that we do as human

beings um you know the you know in reptile form it's very physical right they're literally shedding a skin

but as humans you don't see this change but it doesn't mean it doesn't happen and we go in these cycles and i think a

lot of you know mental health conditioning is attached to our holding onto the past and refusing

to sort of embrace the future and that's why you know i think it's really important

to set out a clear understanding of your purpose a clear understanding of the things you will say no to and won't say

no to and acknowledging that that changes right so i do an exercise like this every year um and it takes about five or six hours

i do it with my wife it's like a whole massive like briefing document essentially on your vision your purpose your friends

like all of this stuff um spending the time thoughtfully thinking about these things which people do not do enough of

is so important because if you're not reflective and you're not spending time thinking manifesting essentially who you

want to be in the future then i think you're going to miss a massive opportunity to grow

um you know i because you know i work in the brain space now in in brain care neuroscience

you call that neuroplasticity right it's this idea that the brain will grow it's plastic and it's essentially changing in whatever

direction you choose to take it in if you are episode 53 of chapter two we

talked about this on the last episode so it's very relevant oh really okay fine yeah so neuroplasticity is that

um if you are into spirituality like i am then it's called manifestation right

it's spending the time thinking about what you're gonna do and how you're gonna get that and then to put it into like super

business terms if you're into business it's called planning and execution so there are these different ways to

articulate the same point but the point is if you just spend your days going um bit

by bit not really thinking about where you're going to go and what it means to you it'd be very hard for you to make good

decisions and frankly and this i guess actually speaking like personal branding a more popular post i

did recently was about stamina and the things i've learned about rest which is that as a founder and a ceo you learn that

you're not paid for your stamina right you pay yeah you pay mo gorda for sorry not mo

called mo farah for his stamina right he's got to run a [ __ ] 10k that's

stamina right that's what athletes are paid for i'm paid for my decision making people

invest in me and they invest in heights for my decision-making abilities and overworking

giving yourself burnout not taking space to rest not listening to what you know to be

true and spending the time planning that's bad decision-making yeah um if you can't do those things for your own

body you know it's like what i said is if you can't be the ceo of your body you do not earn the right to be the ceo

of your company you gotta you've got to look after your mental state and your physical body

first by thinking and finding the space carving out the space to think what does good decisions look like that

fit my purpose and where i'm looking to go and if you can do that and you can answer those things you actually start

to learn things start to add up and and that kind of segues back to the

Burnout

initial tweet where you talked about depression anxiety banner and insomnia so let's talk about burnout then it's a

very um a very popular topic i actually think one of the most listened to episode of this podcast was

the top was the one about burnout and us being a burnout generation and how we've kind of glamorized it we're

optimizing our lives so we can fill it with more things to do did you burn out how did you burn out and you understand

why you burnt out 100 um you know garyvee is a very clever man

um very intelligent but you know he has created a negative impact on society

that he would probably be upset about because he seems to be a lovely man that really deeply cares about stuff from what i can see i believe his authenticity but he

has created hustle culture and hustle porn and you know what i met gary vee had him on this podcast

and you're right i think in every um depiction of him there he's a genuinely

authentic person you meet him and think you are who i thought you were online um

and you're completely right in the sense that because he's being his authentic self which we can't

you know uh um we can't criticize anyone for being in fact that's what we tell everyone to be be

yourself and chat you know and be willing to share it with the world the issue i think as you're pointing out

is his lack of appreciation that

about nuance and that everyone is fundamentally different and everyone's not gary vee i had that problem too when i started

i couldn't understand why people weren't sacrificing their lives to build businesses and working until four in the

morning and sleeping under the desk i thought everyone that wasn't doing that was both an idiot and inferior and wasting their time and

wasting that time and they would never be happy because as far as steve's bartlett's brain could tell him

that was happiness yeah and because like all of the pain that you suffer is part of part of the game and yeah but that stuff

isn't this is the thing right that stuff isn't not true you do have to grow growth is painful and you will have

sleepless nights and all the other bits and pieces that is part of the parcel the thing where we confuse this is it's all mutually exclusive aka

my identity has to be that and only that because that's how gary v and like a few other geniuses in society

have got to the top of their games but here's the thing like there's two

reasons why i had burnout last time the first was because i wasn't happy on what i was working and

running a startup can feel a bit like a cage sometimes so uh unless you're really sure i say this

all entrepreneurs all the time are you sure this is the company you want to build because if it's not you're going to be doing it anyway and

then you are your own bird keeper you have locked yourself in a cage and that's what i did with

grabble i got lucky i found a niche an opportunity

it grew exponentially really quickly millions of downloads had a million monthly active users in our end we had

like a you know even acquisition that failed sadly but you know would have made us millionaires was

a real journey with that company it was fashion for tinder basically yeah exactly and it was a real it was a real

exciting journey but at no point did i enjoy it um really like

not at no point my ego enjoyed it right and we won loads of awards um you know we won the award we wanted

like we were like we just want to be written about in techcrunch and all this stuff and in 2017 we won best mobile startup in europe over depop at the

techcrunch europas we didn't even turn up to that awards to take that award

because i was having such a bad time mentally i didn't even go to the awards of a ceremony my friend picked up that

trophy and took a photo on our behalf i was sitting at home drinking whiskey feeling really terrible about myself

um why because that was living someone else's dream i

didn't care about fashion um what was the force that made you live someone else's dream yeah good question uh a bit of

serendipity in the sense of um you know listening to users going on a bit of a journey and the product sort

of developing and then it getting catching fire before you really have an opportunity to stop and say no that's not really for

me like you were getting dragged you weren't pulling a bit yeah a bit but then at the same time like you know

like everyone i'm scared of failure so i didn't want to be a failure so i wanted to make it work and you know by hook or

by crook i was willing to like push really hard to make it work and you know i look back on my time with grapple and

other than like working hard i was working against my purpose and i could feel it and when people ask me i'm

actually like as you know always to my detriment honest so

i would tell people including the wrong people including investors that you know my heart really isn't in it and like all

this stuff because you know all i had left for authenticity was to be honest in these

conversations with other people you know i've just finished writing my book um not trying to plug it although happy

sexy millionaires happy sexy millionaire available on all bookshelves no it's not pre-order um but there's a chapter in there where i

really investigate burnout and the reason there's topics like self-awareness and burnout which we haven't quite yet properly defined

everyone throws it out there on instagram oh i'm feeling burnt out but nobody's like gone down the rabbit hole to figure out the innate causes or

the psychological or social causes of it so i just wanted to like go as far down as i could go

and i tend to believe the depth that i've got to with my thinking and the research that i've done

is that you typically get um you stand a higher chance of burnout in situations where you are extrinsically motivated um

to do x activity because i view my life and i think about all the things that i do intrinsically like walking i've never

got burnt out walking my dog or playing with my dog you know i've never got burnt out um

like reading books that i love and those kinds of things but when it comes to getting paid to

do something that i don't intrinsically enjoy doing burnout is almost inevitable at some

point not just by now right but then my but then motivation and i started looking at motivation and the spectrum

it sits on of on one end being totally uh extrinsic you're literally doing it because you're forced to

and then on the other end doing it because it's an innate passion an intrinsic passion and all of the things on this end where you

you're paid and you're forced to burn out seems to show up and on the other end when it's it's

intrinsic and you love it and you're doing it for the sake of doing it i never get burned out and my motivation seems to last the course of time so i

wanted to see if that resonates with you yeah but let me tell you something else that's interesting that i'm i'm consciously aware of because i've had

burnout and by the way my experience of it was you know i just couldn't get out of bed for a month really um that was it i basically just

stayed in bed and i just like i couldn't face going to the office i couldn't face leaving my

team in the office yeah and you're lying in bed well i got my co-founder and i just like explained that i'd literally i didn't

know what it was at the time i was like i think it might be depression i didn't know what it was though this is the thing i probably didn't even say those words how did it feel um just like just no

energy whatsoever just like no no ability a bit like when i had corona virus to be honest just like zonked

um not and nothing i was doing was able to make me feel like i was getting the energy

i think the reason why as well was um again i like i'm a helpful guy i really

believe in my greatest superpower full stop is connecting people right i've got infinite numbers of ways i've connected

people eight people have got married that i've introduced you know they say three in heaven but you know i don't quite believe in heaven so

it's irrelevant but point being um you know so many co-founders introduced

i really just believe in the serendipity of creating you know moments where you know that person and that person just should have

that chat and i force it to happen so because of that because i really believe in serendipity as well

um i do try and say yes to people and help them out so what was happening to me at gravel was

we were flying we were like number one in the app store and all this stuff so the inbounds start coming like thick and fast right and so i was like

i can't do this the way i was doing it which is like all over the place i'll go to old street at 6 00 a.m

every single tuesday and wednesday um and between six and nine i'll do like sessions right

if you come meet me between that time and like your 45 minute slot i'll fit you in and then tuesday and

wednesday became tuesday to thursday and then before i knew i was doing it like almost every single day

trying to be so helpful and it was great because i i i get loads of energy from that right like

so much there's you know great quote of you know there's no such thing as altruism because you're ultimately doing it for yourself and i

believe that um however so it's like find your motivation and then turn it but i overdid it and so the result

the net result was like one day i woke up from my alarm trying to do it and i like basically couldn't move and that alarm basically you know kept

going for the next few days and i was like nope i just can't do it i can't go to work i can't get out of bed

it's really like it's really strange time but the thing that's really interesting to

me this time right so i analyzed that as partly burned out and i was trying to do too much to and

not spending enough time on myself not having any rest not being sensible about my personal space

and my life which was stupid but the kind of thing you learned the hard way quite often and then the other thing was obviously

like i was working on a business that i wasn't very happy and i was having more fun meeting these people and helping like make introductions than i was

working my own business now with heights you know very consciously aware of the opposite problem to be true so we just talked

about burnout from some of your insights right one of my fears from heights is you know

i won't see burnout coming because now i'm living my purpose now i am so passionate

i get so much motivation and pleasure from working on heights that i could do

this 24 7 um and i diarize stopping myself right i literally put in

my diary to stop like all my things rest naps peloton

like all of the things like i talked to you earlier about like my shakti meditation these things are in my diary

because if it's in my calendar i'm going to pay attention to it and i'm going to respect it and if i don't i won't respect my own boundaries because i know

that i'm intrinsically a bit of a workaholic and if i'm passionate you can't stop me so i have to stop myself

sure and knowing you know taking preventative measures towards things like burnout

if you are happy um i think has been a really like mature decision that i'm really proud of taking

this time around because it's a bit like the imposter syndrome right how am i going to overcome it i'll write a newsletter every week great i feel way

less like that now same thing burn out i don't feel like i'm going to get burned even though i've been sitting in my bedroom pitching you know

to investors like all of february and march like it's not a great existence because of lockdown and if i said you yeah listen

uh i'm the same i'm a workaholic and all these things i'm an entrepreneur i'm going to build a big business dan what is the one thing i can do to

avoid myself getting burnout what would you say that is you would say is diarizing and scheduling time

to do other things like you know i had near l on this podcast and he talked about he writes the book indestructible he

talks about how he will literally schedule time in his diary to see his to spend some time with his

partner and take his kids for a walk and and those kinds of things is that what you're saying you're saying yeah yeah

i mean i've got um i do have like a list of habits that i've created for myself and you know talking about habit

formation um terrible error everyone makes is like oh i'll listen to dan i'll do all of these you know habits no i

pick like one new one a year to be honest with you my number one mental health hack full stop

um that i say to everyone everyone always asks me my one thing mine's going for a walk um you know spending an hour or so

walking if you can do that without being distracted i mean i listen to podcasts and audio books but

i also go for some where i don't take anything with me and i just go for the walk um that's my number one health hack um

because it's not only good for your brain but good for your body and because it puts you into there's two

things one we live in london actually to be honest like gets way worse of rep about rain than you know you would think because i don't

go out with a raincoat most days um but even if it's raining you still go out and that's a great moment to just be

with the elements and accept that you know things aren't always perfect even the manifestation of rain you know it's a great moment to just go

out and be like things aren't perfect but i owe it to myself for my own rest and for my own space to

do this today and the other reason honestly is because on average i get to listen to about 50

books a year just by doing that one thing so as someone who's like a lifelong learner and happiest when i'm

learning the amount of books that i've devoured by stacking that you know habit onto my daily walk has

been the fastest way to grow yeah and so we talked about burn out there the next thing so and that's that

Anxiety

was during your time at gravel the next thing from that tweet was anxiety yeah so the anxiety and insomnia were

completely linked with each other so a really really fascinating experience

to me the most interesting of all of them really because at the time i got and so at the time i

got insomnia and this is when anxiety starts to build because anxiety does go with it insomnia

very well because uh you start to get scared of going to sleep which builds anxiety you can't really sleep when you've got anxiety so

it's like a self-fulfilling prophecy like every single night so i had insomnia for six months

and my symptoms were i'd go to sleep at midnight but i'd wake up at 2am and at 2am i was wide awake and there

was no going back to sleep whatsoever no matter what i did so this was a time when business was

going well i was pretty happy in life i was getting married um yes my dad had passed away but my mom

had just recovered from cancer so i'd had like the whole fear of her and she's already had it before and recovered once so very unlikely to

recover the second time but she had i have a roof over my head i practice gratitude you know like i am just that archetypal

[ __ ] that's just too smug for the world and i just suddenly

couldn't sleep and i was like i don't understand like i have everything that i wanted and i'm not i don't even want much

you know i've worked on that stuff so where has this come from and you know

basically chronic anxiety the feeling of chronic anxiety is lots of sweating lots of self-doubt

um lots of um almost like a bit of a personality change in me you know outwardly i'm

quite confident but you know this experience with anxiety was sort of really making me question everything about what i say

how i feel who i am and you know it was in this cycle where if i'm about

to go to sleep i'm not going to be able to go to sleep because of this you know these feelings of doubt

and stories i'm telling myself and it became this perpetual illness and by the way i tried so many things right because when

you say doubt yeah and the story self-doubt self-doubt about business self-doubt about business self-doubt

about who i am um and about why i'm feeling like this anxiety is such a complicated thing

because um you know there's a great uh i think it's by lao tzu the it's not a perfect um verbatim

quote but he said something like depression is a symptom of sadness for the past we've lived anxiety is obsession and confusion over

the future you're gonna have and that's why like mindfulness and being present is the antidote and i think i really resonate with that

because you know my own depression experience was loss of my father the past my anxiety was like the person

hey was anxiety about the night i night sleep i'm about to not have but also like you know who who am i

going to be what's going to happen how long can i live like this feels like it's self-fulfilling in a way as well exactly so the the truth is i tried all

these different things so like i went to i did therapy i did sleep therapy i used all the apps calm sleepio

i tried you know uh cutting out alcohol i tried drinking much more alcohol like i tried you know

like you name it i'd like not smoked weed for a while i was like right that's it getting a weed habit back you know like anything that you could

possibly do to just like stay zonked but i went to the doctor and he recommended me sleeping pills

but that really irked me i mean we just talked about lost connections johan hurry right um i don't appreciate medication

that will work that night as solving my problem and i'm smart enough to know that it wouldn't solve my problem it would just help me sleep that night

so i've still got those sleeping pills and i never use them and i kept on going for this journey the search for why

this was happening and it led me in the end to a dietitian which i'd never worked with before and by the way i didn't even know what a

dietitian was and heard of nutritionists because isn't that just everyone on instagram um but a dietitian

uh had no idea but it turns out a dietitian is basically a nutritionist with a scientific degree they can work

in the nhs and they work with sick people so if you have a sick problem like insomnia you go to a dietitian and they

will literally tell you medically what they can do to affect your

your experience and she just said to me um she basically asked me about what i was

eating and my habits and like all this kind of stuff and i told her and this is someone who i think i'm quite healthy generally speaking and she just said

um you're basically not getting enough brain food and i was like i don't even know what that means like i don't understand the context of that

statement and she was like well let me put it this way your brain is an organ right

it's 60 fat 90 of the fat in your brain is this one compound called dha and most

people that come to me with essentially mental health problems which is what you currently have have nutritional deficiencies and don't

realize there are three main things that i would recommend in your condition one is omega-3s the other is b vitamins

because again that's for energy so she explained that i'm having a spike at 2 am so i need that spike not to happen i

need to have like much more slow release of b vitamins in my energy supply in my body every day and then the third thing was blueberry

extract because it's an antioxidant and would help make lymphatic system whilst i slept right she's saying this stuff to me i'm like

so skeptical i can't even tell you not only not a supplement taker um but she's now recommending me three supplements and i've been given pills by

the doctor and i'm like i mean like come on how is this gonna be any better so you can imagine my complete and utter

surprise when i took those three things i mean they were very expensive they were like

medically prescribed ones so super potent from you know i think it was whole foods

or planet organic they were pricey but within two weeks i was sleeping like a baby and i wasn't i

wasn't feeling anxiety and when you have a moment like that in

your life and you know this because you're a deeply inquisitive person it makes you stop

and it makes you go hold on a second like this was so simply solved i don't

actually believe it to be true this must be placebo this must be finally my placebo that has caused this

um instead i did what i do i'm quite nerdy i started reading science papers because i kind of you know the one thing

i do hate on instagram is like everyone's a nutritionist everyone's at this everyone's at that i'm like i don't want to listen to some guy that

takes nootropics telling me about like my brain and mental performance i want to see what scientists that don't take any credit

actually have to say about this stuff and i learned that there are thousands literally of

science papers this is why i did the newsletter i knew i'd never run out of content it's like literally the deepest well of content

ever ever ever to do what i'm doing um there were thousands of science papers on all of these ingredients and

how they impact not just your mental health below the baseline so if you're suffering from insomnia if you're suffering from

anxiety even if you've got depression schizophrenia like so many medical papers scientific

journals sorry um about the impact of taking a high supplementation of xyz or obviously

much more food of that particular ingredient and the impact it's had and then when

you're at the baseline all of these examples about nutrition impacting your mental performance so this is things like decision making

focus energy like all of the things you we want in life right no one wants to really be recovering from a mental health problem they want to be

at their baseline and thriving and it just took me by so much surprise because i was like well if this isn't

like if this is so well known in science why didn't i know about it i was working in shoreditch

at a scaling startup like bearded glasses hipster [ __ ] like you know keto vegan like yes i've

heard of all of them um all my friends intermittent fast yada yada this is just like common sense brain

food why is that not a thing that people know about why is taking care of your brain not something

anyone's actually talked about clearly and actually found a really meaningful way

to communicate what that stands for and what science papers do really badly

is like you know when i synthesize them there's about two or three sentences that are saying the point but it's just

covered with jargon they're boring as [ __ ] um so i was like first step newsletter i will add some

Supplements & brand

emojis and some lols and make it millennial and fun and i will get people to read science papers without even realizing they're necessarily reading

them so every week you'll learn something from a scientific journal which i will link back to that you can click and by the

way no one clicks it and you can learn something that science says is good for your brain every week and that is essentially how the journey

with heights actually started with this like realization that something as

you know when you you know the beautiful moment in life where you can spot an opportunity so big

and actually solved by the power of communication and brand um you know a lot of people say brand

and comms that is not a market strategy that is not defensible

i think those people are idiots and the wrong market because you know my counter to that is do you

think that buddhist monks got everyone meditating or was it calm and headspace do you think that we

love to run because we watch the olympics or is it nike getting in our heads do you think that people around the

world are doing yoga because of like you know some ashram or do we actually think it's lululemon

brands create change in the world that we want to see and brands connect

with human beings and create communities and the power of social media and standing for something

is where brands take something that was always done before anyway stick a tick on a shoe it's still just a

shoe like lululemon like it's just like a little logo an omega logo on pants it doesn't matter the way that

you express what you do and why you do it is the thing that has the power to change and my opinion and my own experience of

being you know in that shoreditch hipster [ __ ] area where you just know about things

like early and trends to have never come into contact with something so important that can have such an impact as

nutrition and mental health nutrition and taking care of your brain to me felt like a calling right i've just

suffered for six months i've overcome something this is all i want to do with my life

and so you started heights and so i started heights how's it going great question we launched january the

6th in a pandemic well not in a pandemic yet i have to say you know i saw this on my facebook feed

and um i think i messaged you about investing in the company just because it was beautiful i saw the

branding on the website and the way that you'd done the website and i was like this team get branding and in the direct

to consumer world it's interesting what you were just saying there about comms and like the way that i hear it is like storytelling and

um platforms um enabling um

almost democratizing the access to like build great products now because back in like if we think about nike shelf space

or you think about the the you know the power that the unilevers have you're in fact not the war isn't always

storytelling and brand or comms it's in fact like knowing a guy or price points but in the direct to consumer social

media world brand and comms and storytelling can win and

product design exactly in product design which is a huge part of the story and that for me was beautiful so i i uh i was straight in there to try and

invest in your company and i mean you know you know for a fact that i've been taking heights ever since

january i think yeah yeah december maybe what's your experience been as a customer then i i love it and you know

this is and this is this is where i really this is why i always also really wanted to talk to you today so there is probably

several people on a spectrum of like you know devout um vitamin takers or and then there's

people that don't understand or believe in it yeah i was that yeah and so how do you confront the skepticism because with products like

this it is hard for the user to establish cause and effect and like there's other factors that

might happen in my life that may cause an effect almost in establishable so like say i take my i

take the the heights for one week straight but in that week i have just the worst mental health week because of other

factors how do i know so i guess it yeah it's a great question i think there's two parts to this right

so one is um like supplements deserve a bad rep this is the most important thing to address

first and foremost because when i went i was like why is she giving me this like prescribed stuff i kind of just go to holland and barrow or boots and just buy

the things that she says there um it turns out there's this weird marketing thing in supplements where

you can put a minimum in so there's the amount according to science that will have an impact on your body brain whatever and then there's a marketing amount

which is way lower that you're allowed to put in on that product so if you say like vitabiotics or you know a lot of products there's an

asterisk on those boxes they're legally obliged to tell you tiny small print on the back that

what you're taking is actually a fraction of the daily amount that you're meant to have according to science but marketing wise they can say promotes

healthy this promotes healthy that um you know my favorite story on this is probably uh seven seas the biggest amiga

right because we all grew up as children our parents give us seven cs and you know that's the biggest amiga three brand in the whole entire world

now every single day according to science we're meant to have a minimum like an rda if you will

250 milligrams of omega-3s right you can get it from your food or you can get it from these pills

as a safety net it's essentially what a supplement is right is if you're not getting the food supplement not instead of don't take

supplements instead of eating they're supplements so it's like a safety net now that 250

milligrams the minimum you can put in is 45 milligrams so guess how much seven seas put into

their number one best-selling product 45 on the dot and that means you have to take seven c's for six days straight

just to get one day's worth of the scientific dose you're meant to get but it's all small print and a consumer

doesn't see that and supplements for whatever reason have been able to do that so when we went into our supplement design

right this was the awesome thing me and my business partner joel came from a tech background at this point right we've done user experience

we've done all this stuff and we are very much into this idea of because we're not from this space we're going to win because we are going to

approach this completely differently a we start with community building a newsletter and an audience asking questions to that audience about

what we should do and how we should do it and can we see how they behave so here are the things that we learn most people like a lot of people are

super open-minded about taking supplements starting supplements right the problem with supplements is it can be very difficult

to feel the impact or know they're working and so like a lot of things with prevention and well-being in general it's a commitment to the person you want

to become more so than it is like a medication which cures a problem and you're like oh that got fixed that's great that's

over so you know we got really fascinated by this idea of like how can you help

people build habits with our product design how can we overcome this problem that supplements have the you know in january massive

surge loads of people start but very few people continue if you can get past the hurdle of someone trying something your job as an

entrepreneur is to figure out how to make them a real customer not just a first-time buyer um you know

you talked about that bottle that bottle was designed with our newsletter audience by going into

people's homes and asking them very weirdly and quite often the wives show us what you do with your supplements

and everyone has these supplement cupboards because we neither of us were supplement takers before like we even started this right so we didn't know what normal behavior

was which means you get to ask these great open questions which is where you get the best answers so like everyone has a supplement

covered reason they all look the same and what happens is psychologically and we got told this

the whole time people basically open their cupboards see so many that are like broken promises at the time they promised they

were going to start and didn't continue i feel attacked yeah they feel guilty they feel guilty and they're like well i

can't just take the vitamin c because i said i'd take d i said i take that and everything else and they're always separate so people just give up and you know

there's two things to that there's one there's sort of like guilt about the promises that you were like with the person you wanted to be and then the second is just again you

know it's set and setting or you know out of sight out of mind so but

also for me it's i will complete you completely right i'll commit to what this person that i want to be which is

i'm going to develop this new healthy habit which involves me taking zinc every morning or whatever i do it for three days and if you look

at that you know famously but maybe miss attributed quote from einstein doing the same thing over and over again and insanity yeah and not

getting and getting the same results i'll take zinc for three days and because i can't see a difference

it's much like going to the gym for a lot of people although you do eventually see a difference with the gym and the great thing about when you get to the gym is you get the pump

and you use a little bit of sweat so you think something's going on when i take my zinc

nothing next day nothing no so it's almost like a belief and uh and that's i think what i've

struggled with historically so here's here's the thing so like we hear this kind of stuff with heights and we

we love this because it's like opportunity right it's like challenging opportunity that's how everyone did it well that's

dumb we're gonna do it better so like our first thing was um the number one reason most people do not continue is because they forget

out of sight out of mind so we designed a bottle that passed the wife test that wives were like yes i'd put that on my bedside

table or yes i'd have that out in my living room like you've just done right you've got your bottle there but there's no other supplements there it's because it

looks nice and because it makes you feel good because you're looking after your brain and it's there it's like virtue signaling exactly it's actually signaling to

yourself completely i'm the kind of guy that looks after myself i look after my most important organ and

this is my symbol of doing that so that was like an important first step then you know the capsules themselves

are in like patented clever capsules so you've seen like there's omega-3 on the outside the nutrients on the inside that's

important because we learned that lots of people take supplements at different times of the day ritualizing when you build a habit

is really important so if we could make these that you don't have to have them with food like you do with most supplements

because of the absorption the absorption happens because the dha omega-3 on the outside is fat

when this when this dissolves in your gut the new literally the capsule dissolves the outer capsule with the inner capsule at the same time the

nutrients have been dissolved in fat that is the same effect as what you get from food so those capsules have been designed

also around habits to help people pick a time and you know a lot of people don't eat breakfast right and so they just end up

forgetting their supplements full stop so we did it so that you can start the same time so you get ritualized like

with by having the bottle out and you see it and then the most important part which is communication

so we actually have something like a brain health score essentially it's like an algorithm put together by a couple of neuroscientist phds

and you take it before you start and again we do a 15-day check-in and then before

we send you your next month because it's a subscription through the letterbox before we send you your next month we ask you to take it again

now what happens for most people in the first month let's be real right like you just said you know

scientifically typically speaking this product will last will take three

months for you to feel anything like all supplements so it's a bit of a long game right you have to believe in

that now in the first month for you to feel an impact maybe you will because where your

nutritional levels were coming from and your mental state was coming from but maybe you won't so how can we help nudge you there well we can give you

awareness so yeah so we sent people that this brain health survey right and you know self-administering but it gives you a bit of a baseline

a score at the end of like you know where you are right now and then we start sending you coaching comms like very short emails

and snappy bits of information about how to take care of your brain that you might not have thought about things that are really small little habits that you can

build in and people start to read them they have an unbelievably high open rate because

you've just taken the first step to choosing to look after your brain so from that point on why wouldn't you

read the emails of the thing that's coaching you to do those habits and what we find is in the first 25 days or something

like 90 i think it's more than that like 93 of people have improved their brain health score on a self-administered

basis from paying attention right not from the vitamins not from anything else but suddenly

they're interacting with the brand they're and they're welcoming a brand into their life whose sole focus is about how you can take care of your

brain you've got all these really interesting very very respected people just helping to coach you on your

journey um and that is such an important part of this

because you do have the disbelief in the first couple of months right and people like to be able to see and

measure improvements and that's hard to do instantly with supplements but it isn't hard to affect

how someone feels and help encourage them to make changes in their own lifestyle that will make them feel better that is the brand's

responsibility and that's our responsibilities that's what we work quite hard on so where i'm really passionate about building this brand is

as a community it started as a newsletter community is everything to me bringing people along on this journey of brain care and

understanding why it's important you know the amount of money that we spend on skin care or hair care every day but nothing on brain care the most

important organ in our body is so completely normalized in society to have skin care

and hair care rituals and budgets in households but not for our brains and so you going

How do you find the guts to keep going despite failure?

back to the business side of things um you started grabbing yeah didn't go well yeah and you were an estimation of

it you said you know you struggled with fears of failure and it failed one i was when you were talking about imposter

syndrome and when you and and when you're talking about some sort of confidence issues around putting yourself out there

all of those things seem to sit in contrast to something else you said which is

that you're the type i think this is a not a verbatim quote but you said it earlier on you said you're the type of

person that's just going to keep starting and you know you're going to fail potentially and that seems like someone that's high confidence and very very self-assured

and is not scared at all and then the other side of you seems like someone that is

the antithesis of that so i'm wondering how you you kind of like content because i i do believe that you will

save that god forbid not that i believe in god as you know now um but you believe in forbid

yeah i believe in forbid forbid um heights doesn't go to plan um reaches its lows yeah that's another

way of saying it you will start another business at some point based around something else how do you find the guts

to keep going despite failure and i'm guessing maybe it speaks

to your motivations as to why you wanted to be an entrepreneur in the first place right i'm intrinsically motivated by

growth and learning so the way that i like to think of myself is oh someone else said this to me and i

just i thought it was so poetic and i was so impressed with her for using these words which is like a lifelong intern

um you know this was a founder she'd gone to stanford had a really successful career and then she basically coming to intern at

heights for a few months and i was like you know like i talked to you about i did that in other companies as well but it was

interesting to me to find someone else that did that and i was like i mean like you know i could learn from you rodney the other way around she's like

i'm a lifelong intern everywhere i go i'm a lifelong intern and i'm like i talk about myself as a lifelong

learner but lifelong intern was like even more powerful right i was like wow that's you know it's a real mindset towards you

know um redefining what success is yeah because as long as you're learning well

not you i as long as i am learning i am fulfilled and i think we all have this like one

thing we know to be true about ourselves right um starting a business is super hard right and you know

i'm like i say not a nutritionist not neuroscientist had no experience in the space have never launched a vertically

integrated supply chain like from three different countries our ingredients come to from 10 different countries

because we literally source the highest quality so the omega-3 comes from like canada and the blueberries come from italy like

nuts but all of that stuff it's so exciting to learn and like the

the opportunity to learn all of these things are new gets me out of bed and so the whole like

failing and starting again you know that's got nothing to do with you know confidence or lack of or

anything it's got absolutely everything to do with knowing where i'm in my uh sweet spot

there's a term that i learned years ago that sums it up so perfectly which is icky guy are you familiar with japanese

guy that's me i'm living my icky guy right now what is it guy uh so icky guys japanese term

um basically looks like a venn diagram on a venn diagram right so you're at the center and then the different aspects of things

like you know what makes you happy what makes other people happy what makes you money what makes other people fulfilled

it's like ticking off all of these things and it's like if you can find that where you are in the center and you could say

am i contributing to society yes am i waking up every morning fulfilled yes am

i mentally challenged yes it's like ticking off all of these things it's like this weird flower you should definitely check out for people watching

and listening to this podcast on youtube i will put the ikigai graph on the screen now yeah it's amazing it's

amazing and and you know and i come back to it all the time you know i had my honeymoon in japan because of uh discovering ikigai really because i'm

like so you know i'm very spiritual yeah well i had a spiritual wedding in ibiza and then i

did my my honeymoon in japan and you know it was all it was like hikes and spiritual searches and stuff and

you know there's another fantastic uh japanese proverb which is uh literally translated as fall seven

rise eight but what it means is like if you fall down seven times rise up the eighth and you you we talked about success and failure

just in that moment and you said that i think you immediately defaulted to talking about

the purpose which was you love progression sort of intellectual progression growth

and learning and it almost seems to me that one of the ways to escape from the fear of failure

if you even think about what happened at grabble the faith you describe that as a failure one of the ways to escape from the from

ever failing again is by redefining what success is redefining what failure is and it sounds

like you've almost redefined success now as growth and learning and you and you won't fail at that even if the company

goes down right so this is like it's almost like you've developed a strategy somehow not to be able to fail again because failure

now isn't losing the company it's losing your per losing your way like you did with grabling becoming someone you're not and being

extrinsically motivated and it's exactly that and you know i think the opportunity

that we all have as human beings to be creative is to certainly accept that things are not

going to go on a straight path but you know when when confronted with these

like horrible moments of like things like failure and everyone else thinking that you're a failure

blow gets softened a lot when you get to reflect and think about what you learned you know really interesting experience

that uh joel and i did after failing was we went to uh business psychologists

and we had a facilitated sessions over the course of a week with the this was your fault that was my

fault i take blame for this i blame you for that letting it all out right and then we spoke about you know what

our we did personality tests and we looked at where our crossovers were and we had like for the first time a real clear view of strengths and weaknesses gaps

and could map out some of the poor mistakes and decisions that we'd made that led to failure and

interestingly like you know rehiring in in heights this time the thing that we've had for the last

year before we had any employees was a set of company values and hiring processes and all sorts of

like interview tips and hiring docs based on our values before we hired our first person we must have had them for

nine to 12 months because we were so certain of understanding who we are and what we

stand for being the company values and that those company values lead to hiring the right

people with the right mindset and that those people are the greatest leverage you could have as a founder to do less of the stuff

yourself and enable brilliant people to take it forward um i think that's probably the one of the

most important things i've done in my life with spending time on company values with a business partner by

identifying gaps weaknesses and spending time hearing

my failings from my best friend so much of what was true um that i

demonstrated a lack of focus um i'd been overly honest right so i hadn't picked my moments he's like you

know i appreciate a very like transparent person but you know but you know he's like you know you don't have to like tell an investor to their face

that you don't buy into the business that they've given you money for like you could have a filter if things like that then

this is this this is the behavior was the most hurtful thing he said i think the most the most hurtful thing

that he said was that um you know he felt that i had um not

not contributed 50 50 right and that i had like an almost

irresponsible attitude towards what i was trying to get out of the business compared to what he

needed to get out of the business and that was a really meaningful start for us to decide on the next business too

because what he meant by that was joel is like a very intelligent person so he is motivated

by challenge if something is hard to fix right then he'll find a way to fix it

that is like he'll get up in the morning for that i won't um i'm motivated by making an impact and

feeling like i'm having a difference and telling a story and impacting people and then telling me that you know that made them feel this

way that is like all emotion for me right here's pure like logic and challenge so

by me you know constantly discrediting the work that we were doing by saying things like that right by

being too open and honest about my purpose and not putting on the filter i was literally without care or remorse

making fracturing yeah fracturing what he believes in and his ability to succeed and his ability to tell his own

story about the hard work he put in and i think all of those things were true i'd say that it was

60 40 if i was being brutal to myself 70 30 like you know the success of our last company

on him and to be honest like a lot of the failure was related to me and i personally don't regret any of it and i

really don't believe he does either but being able to say this stuff to each other with a

letter to all out that then also gave me the confidence to say like joel came up with like two or three business ideas

before like heights and we were like figuring out what we want to do i was just like no mate i'm going to do the same thing again i don't care about that thing

yeah but it's really exciting i'm like it's not to me right no one is going to have their health or

mental health impacted that i feel like that's my space that's where i want to be so really really enabled us to just you

know look at my mistakes of the past and my character and say if you want to work with me you know that i'm going to have to work

Relationships

on something i feel purposeful about that otherwise this is non-negotiable for me otherwise we'll repeat history

and you've got another partner in your life which is your uh your wife um when did you get married

what age uh well two years ago i got married two and a half years ago when did you meet her

ah well uh do you know the story at all no i don't know okay fine fine so technically speaking i met her

at 18 on the khosan road for one night uh but i didn't sleep with her uh in thailand okay um in bangkok i

didn't sleep with her but i tried to chat her up and stuff and it was a straight up no right um so she's she was best friends with my business

partner joel's sure best mate a cousin sorry so anyway the point being um that's how we met her originally and

i'd like you know sent some very awkward facebook wall messages when that was a thing like you know trying to chat

over the years it was always annoying um and then at like 30 or 31 like on my birthday um

joel basically reintroduced us and i was like i'm having a party why don't you just come etc and she's older than me right she's two

years older than me so i was a bit like you're 32 i'm 30. you're a bit too old to pick right now your mates are married i literally gave her all the banter i

was like your mates are married you're running out of options i'm still available you know let's do it you're not going to do any of that yeah

she found it hilarious anyway she did she did um come join me at drinks and like the rest is history and actually

our relationship's been super interesting because we spent the first year um not monogamous

um we spent the first year openly so we spent the first year openly communicating that we'll sleep

with other people but they were all like more like one night stands whereas we were like coming back to each other which was interesting because

she's just like hilarious really good fun really funny and so i enjoy hanging out with her but it's

very clear like you're not my girlfriend and she was like great i'm not your boyfriend no problem we did that for a whole year

why were you saying that why were you not um yeah because i like loads of reasons like one is like i'd come out of

a horrible relationship the last time where i i wasn't treated particularly nicely and i just didn't didn't make me want to get

married for sure um and i told my mom and her that i wouldn't get married incidentally um so i was like i don't

believe in marriage and i don't really believe in monogamy and like those are my beliefs i told you about this book sex at dawn i highly

recommend you read it so i had been telling myself the story that this wasn't going to happen so you were rejecting her

kind of in a way and protecting myself absolutely um and you know i think that was mutual for

whatever reason for for a year and actually after a year you know we had that awkward conversation i almost

like where she actually you know said like what are we gonna do like this is getting like a bit silly now you know i'm getting on i'm like 75 now

i need to get married um and um and so i said you know i almost said no

they there and then i said let me sleep on there and i was about to say no but then all my friends were basically like you know she's literally wicked like why

on earth would you do that to yourself like what have you got to lose and from that point of saying yes and

being in a relationship with her i proposed to her the like it's six months later and we got married a year

later so it was actually a really short relationship you're on meeting to marriage you you met when you're 33 now yeah you met her

at 30. yeah so you proposed when you were 31 yep and okay so you've been together for two

years now yeah and so i always find it super fascinating when i meet an entrepreneur that's super

busy and you know in love with their business and their ideas and and is a workaholic on to some degree how they manage to keep

their relationship balanced because i haven't figured it out yet yeah and i

i take the faces that i've gone through different sort of levels of immaturity in my life so the first phase was um meeting great

people meeting a great girl and thinking to myself you need to wrap your life around me

i'm not going to change a thing about myself i'm the most important thing in the world the world revolves around me you're welcome to

join the orbit but i'm not going to change at all didn't go well

unsurprisingly and then like trying to find a little bit of um compromise

somewhere in me um but still being ruthlessly apologetic didn't go well um and now i'm at a place where i'm

currently single completely single and i need the answers i i'm less

i don't want to be one of these [ __ ] [ __ ] narcissists that i just read about one in the newspaper i won't say any names martin sorrell um

and what i've what i read about people i think it was his ex-wife that described him was very very similar to the behavior

that i'm exhibiting which is this kind of self-centeredness that excludes everybody but ultimately

will run the risk of actually being self-harm when i make myself lonely and miserable um because i don't appreciate the value

of a relationship so i want you to help me with the answer well let me tell you i told myself the

narrative that being in a relationship i don't have time to be in a relationship right

um that's my narrative um being married and all of these things

will close opportunities down to me and my life will be worse for it um and

that's fine those are stories and like everything you know we convince ourselves of all sorts of stories and i do believe in you know finding

um not just the one but ones i really don't believe that there's one person for you in the world i believe

there's many and i think having a spiritual connection with others and you know for some people like a sexual connection

with multiple partners i think that this stuff is totally acceptable a b completely

biological like biologically scientifically more normal for us

than monogamy which is essentially because of christianity in the world

and and frankly you know even though it's not what i do with my wife currently we've had conversations about

you know in five years or in ten years right if we weren't sleeping together because we weren't finding ourselves like you know

sexually attractive or whatever at that point you know would we consider having the conversation like opening up our

relationships huh can i ask you that question yeah yeah i'm not answering it almost now

which is like yes we would we would do that and would you be comfortable with her sleeping with other men that's very different question because

uh right now no future me maybe um logically right logically if i took

emotion out of it absolutely because if i didn't want to at that point sleep with my wife it would not be fair

to deprive her of sex because of how i was feeling and so i think having a maturity towards

your relationships and to all relationships is so important and a lot of

you know what really upsets me like so many people get divorced um one of the most common reasons people

get divorced is because they cheat and you can avoid that by having a conversation like i still love you

and i still think everything i already always did think about you but for whatever reason the sexual

attraction has gone and either we are going to work on that together or we should explore other options and

like everything in life steve the most uncomfortable conversations are the ones you need to have

so i think a really smart way and i would say this because you know i'm

doing it but i think a smart way to approach your relationship is like you approach your business

so you set out a vision for your relationship and you say this is what we want to be

and where we want to be in 50 years what does that look like um you know recently

i did this with my wife we were in portugal we were with some friends i told you i was working in portugal for

a month during lockdown um we were staying in like a villa with some friends and like we'd kind of been okay in lockdown but like now she's

around other people she's being a cervix snappy like kind of [ __ ] we were just getting on each other's nerves and i went for like

a long walk on the coast with her and i was just like where's this coming from like five wise right why are you doing that why are you doing that but

why are you doing that right and we got kind of got to the crux of the issue um you know these are things that i'm

annoying about and what i do that irritate her and obviously like these are things you do and it's like okay let's take a break from like

right now the things that are annoying us about each other let's flip the script in 50 years what

are the things that we're going to be saying doing and believing about why we love each other what does that look like

so like literally let's imagine in the future how we are and work back from there so objective right a long happy and

fulfilling marriage so you know you might be familiar with okrs so objectives and key results

we implement them at heights as a startup but also melissa she's the um director of operations for europe

middle east and africa for vice and she put okrs into vice so we're both fan of the system right and

the system is literally this is the objective you're trying to get to these are some measurable key results that would have to happen for us to achieve the

objective so we decided to try and apply this framework to our marriage right what is the objective a long

sustainable happy and fulfilling marriage what are the key results that get us there well we broke them down into mind

body and soul right and from there you get to cascade down these key results right so

they start to say a little bit like okay so mind for me meditation is really important for her you know she doesn't really want to do

it but like from a compromise point of view because she knows that i believe in it and stuff she'll do it with me similarly you know from a mind point of

view she wants to be heard right so how about um you know we will ask each other how our days are

but systematically as a habit right we'll build it as a habit another one was you know we'll teach you some

each other something new every day so we're always growing these kinds of things literally became

a habit tracker list that we fill in in our journal every single night did i teach melissa something new today

did i um ask her how her day was did we have sex were we intimate right were we cuddling

and you know spending time did i have personal space because really important to have space away from your partner these literally become habit trackers

that if you think about it really methodically you know did we exercise for 30 minutes a day these things

if you do them you know the compound gains of the results you get in a marriage if we're literally doing these

things together if i'm asking how her day is and i'm listening if i'm

spending time like learning something new to teach her because i want to and she'll reciprocate the same

it will literally create these moments where we're not in our work and we're not doing other things we're

doing this with each other and they don't have to take very long but they are like things that we've taken personal responsibility for

to achieve it's it's people some people a certain type of person will listen to that and they'll think to themselves

how robotic how robotic and you know i had the same conversation with near il who came on this podcast yeah

and he's the king of this stuff right yeah and he talked about how he literally schedules time to be with his wife and to you know to see the kids and to play

with the kids and a certain type of person listening will think well that takes the specialness and the magic and the

spontaneity out of just like living and being you know free to go in whatever direction and it

also when you listen to that you that you start to think about how

us as humans have over this is potentially a thought over

organized and over routine and really over thought every facet of our life and one of the things that i

have a sometimes a bit of a visceral bad reaction to is like and you would have heard about

all this stuff that you know the 10 habits of highly successful entrepreneurs you got to get out of bed drink the green tea do the yoga write in

your diary do 10 star jumps then call your mum until you love her and and it gets to the point that it's one of mine to be fair

yeah every day if you listen to all of this stuff your day would literally be completely

unconscious it would be what's the next thing in my list of how to be a good human and so how do you kind of contend that

rigidness with creating space for lack of rigidness and just [ __ ]

seeing where the wind takes you is a great question in my experience so far this particular bit of rigidness has

created more space not less space for me interesting um and the reason is because if you

think about the opposite of this right so if you don't do some of this stuff if you don't

i mean there's so many examples that are like filling my head right now so if i don't ask my wife how her day is

regularly if i don't exercise regularly if i don't you know meditate every day this is me personally right

okay what are the outcomes of that my wife is not going to feel listened to we might end up in an argument how much not how much time does the argument take

up how much mental energy after the argument's over is going to distract me from all the other things i could do that day right

the things i wish i hadn't said like all of the things right call that day a write-off maybe a couple of days

right that takes up loads of time if i don't meditate every single day i have a very loud mind i'm much slower at

making decisions in general right so it is actually taking up more time to not build that habit in for myself but don't

go for my daily walk personally a i'm not making time to read listen and learn so therefore my

personal growth as a human being is slowing down because i really believe that you know the way that i can build a

better life for myself is funneling wisdom into myself choosing what i read and choosing who i listen to and

choosing what i believe to an extent right i love reading counter views to stuff like i'm a lefty i love

i follow loads of conservatives and right-wing republicans because it's healthy for me but i'm choosing to funnel stuff

into my life so again by not doing that i could be more aimless and more free

and i wouldn't necessarily be following the path to making better decisions as a human being which also speeds things up

if i don't call my mom every day she will call me up and ask me why i don't love her which will make me feel like [ __ ]

for three days so i actually find that this stuff in in my you know again not exercising you

know you don't have to ritualize half an hour five days a week like i have in my diary right but if i don't i actually start to

feel achy i start judging myself you think about these things like actually they

create time they don't take away um in my experience and that's exactly what nier said which is that

you know he's he's planning his time so that he has more time to do the things intentionally that he wants to do i my

last question on the relationship point is about bringing your problems home and how you've kind of because this is

one of the big problems i have as well is along with the like selfishness around my business being the most important

thing sometimes is how do you

not bring your problems home but then also like not make her feel lonely when she sat

right next to you by being off with the fairies and you know i was reading um elon's book the book written about

elon musk and it talked about how he would you know come home and be you know a little bit of a recluse even though everyone's around him and he's in

his head and he's just focused on his problems his life he's working incredibly hard to the point he's sleeping on the floor how have you

managed to find the balance in the relationship um is it just the okay ours is there does she unders does

she get it yeah i think i'm lucky like a she gets her and b she enjoys her personal space

and she's super busy as well and she's super busy as well right yeah exactly and we have you know she's got scale up

she's running a big company like she only reports the ceo so she's got a lot of responsibility does sometimes it go in the opposite

direction as well where you're not getting enough out of her in terms of attention no i think we're both really

lucky like we both like our own company and we both like each other's company so you know you can kind of be happy either

way if you're lucky enough to learn what you like and how to be with yourself which takes

quite a lot of learning a lot of us are very dependent on other people um and if i was still completely dependent on my wife's attention and my

wife like in general then i might be like that but i've come to learn you know how to listen to myself how to

make time for myself how to spend time enjoying being on my own as well

and i think that's a really important skill to learn because otherwise i think the answer would be true and i think you know she's got the same

which is you know i'll listen to podcasts about performance and habits and stuff and

she'll listen to case file on repeat oh my god is she a case firefighter oh man if i hear that australian pricks

absolutely one more time oh my god i've listened to every episode there's a uk one called they walk amongst her i'm obsessed with true crime

yeah so is she so obsessed well listen it doesn't work out yeah exactly exactly yeah yeah she makes me watch

true crime stuff on netflix and it freaks me out i have this really bad habit of because i can't sleep without listening to something

yeah so i'll be it'll be 2 a.m in the morning just got in bed with my partner or whoever i'm with

and i'll say do you mind if i just put on a a murder podcast yeah about like a

serial rapist yeah and then like every single i keep asking the question but the answer is always saying

steve babe it's 2 a.m i don't want to listen to a story about a serial rapist right now

while i'm closing my eyes in the dark [ __ ] so i i get my phone or my airpod and i put it in one ear where they can't

hear it and that's how i fall asleep yeah so she's exactly the same and she like she you know we actually i mean it's

i find it so interesting you know she will make me watch these things on netflix because she's like but it's so

interesting right but actually they really they actually quite damaged my mental health because you know you see things like you know

but that husband loved that wife so much like why does he end up killing those two daughters and his wife oh you're talking about america

yeah the most recent one but like there's you know all of them you know at the end of the day like why someone goes from you know lovely

and humane and kind and wonderful and all the things i like to believe about people in the world to that terrifies me really so it has it

has and this almost what you've just said then sent my mind back to the start of this conversation about

religion and belief and purpose and and what you know before when i was holding they're usually religious even more

terrifying yeah yeah but this the reason i find it so fascinating is because it gets to the truth in human

beings which is something that i know we're both deeply interested in which is like finding the true nature of humans and in the example we've talked

about there in america murderer that by the way because i'm such a nut i'd read that story i'd watched documentaries on

it three four five years ago so seeing on netflix and their depiction of it was fascinating but there you have

just the perfect perfect example of how um unboxable and unpredictable

human nature can be when forces like infidelity and love and um a normal person the fact that a

normal person can go from being this lovely dad who was quite placid to smothering his own children and an

affair teaches you something valuable about the nature of being human and um and for me that is like awesome

that is awesome oh and and that's why i think i'm so obsessed with those things is they teach you

the lessons in a violent emotional gripping way about the true nature of

being human yeah i mean she feels the same way whereas i'm just like you know it just plays on my mind really

it plays my mind to the idea of like well that could happen to me then that's why because i'm like i'm so kind

loving you know full of you know good energy but so was that guy in that example so was that guy so so is

every review of what that guy was like from all of his friends and everything else so how can that happen to a person and this

is the fascinating thing which for sure he met someone else clearly he was he was he was in a marriage

which had lost its passion yeah a loveless marriage he decided to stay probably for the sake of the kids he

decided comfort over a decision which he probably should have uh made a tough decision which he should have made in the short term for the long

term good and it caught up with him and for me that's like isn't that life where you suppress making a short-term tough decision but

that comes back to exactly what i was saying right which is yeah that comes back to the relation no it comes back to setting

a vision for your relationship and you know having a plan and talking about in advance right you

know if you're really smart you'll talk in advance what happens if one of us cheats what happens in this scenario right what

would happen if we fell out of love and you know there's no point like you know planning the perfect life if you

don't crisis plan the things that happen to all human beings and if you've got a great relationship

with your partner i think it's so valuable to treat it like you would your business which is scenario planning spending some time

talking about what would we do in this kind of crisis and how would we behave because by doing that with my wife like

i you know we've got permission to bring up that horrible conversation right like in theory that that would never happen to me because if i

wanted to cheat on her i'd have the conversation with her and i've got permission to have that conversation because we've talked about it

i thought you meant that like i want to murder you tonight conversation no i probably wouldn't tell

her it'd be a nice surprise um but you know what i mean isn't like you know there's permission in our

relationship to address the difficult things and that's why in some respects you know i treat my marriage like i treat my

business which is you know something that i deeply care about if it's successful

and everything that i put into my life is about making these things successful

to the best of my ability and what i've learned is doing those things from a sense of

vision and clarity and communication and values as well because you're talking about transparency and you know

honesty and exactly i i am as a when i started dating you know i was

like 18 years old whatever i thought that i was looking for i had a checklist if you said steve what's your type i'd be like okay the

brown hair the this that this they want to look like this they want to talk like this and this list was almost like it was

endless right of like little specific superficial things i was looking for in a partner and after a couple of you know bad

relationships and bad experiences and maturity and self-awareness and understanding myself i got close i was like what are the

fundamentals what are the like the unnegotiable things that i can't be without and where i'm at now and i kind of want to get your take

on this and see if it resonates at all with you is i have three things that are like fundamentals that i need

to fill so the first one i've kind of defined as they need to be intellectually stimulating to me which you can say you know

being able to have a conversation being able to um yeah like release my mind or else i'll

almost i feel like i'll get a mental um disorder if i can't release my thoughts because you know we're very

similar people in terms of our cognition the next for me is sexual attraction

i used to think it was like they they're pretty they're hot but i realize that sexual attraction is much different to

be than being pretty in the mind of the world and the third thing is um i would hope that they would make me a

better person and you i'm that's intentionally broad that could be a spiritual thing it could

be helping me become a better ceo in my business better at my podcast or whatever so those are my three things

intellectually stimulating sexually attractive and they make me a better person however you want to define

that what are yours well i have to say sexual attraction is such an important

thing to me in general but what i've learned is and you learn this a lot the more you read about relationships

that is actually something that wanes for everyone doesn't mean it will go and it doesn't

mean you won't be attracted to your wife or your husband or anything like that but it wanes and you as a human being

become less sexual the older you get right that's just biology so

i've learned not to make that one of the most important things on the basis of i wouldn't say it's the most important

thing purely on the basis of um i'm more likely to fall out of love with the

person that i'm with if one like you just said they don't intellectually challenge me

second one again like you said like they have to help me grow in some respect or certainly be with me on the journey

because in a you know in a lot of relationships including my marriage like i am the one forcing a lot

of the growth but i'm like that and i can be quite irritating to be around because like i

just always want more growth more this more that that book this podcast some people just want to chill out and that's good for me as well

right as in that is growth being pushed back and being like exactly dressed stop here you know she's the one who's like you're

doing too much you've got to stop like read this book i read an amazing book called rest by alex song yam ping i think his name

is um brilliant book much better than why we sleep and all the other ones that you would read about this stuff

and really really helped me grow by realizing recharging is such a humongous part

with that third point and like think about it it was a it was one person i was with that would stop me working yeah and she

would make me realize the value of everything else but work so she'd be like let's go to this garden

which is something steve would never usually choose to do yeah but when she took me my life was better

and so i think when people think growth they think oh like clapping at the back when you're i'm like no take me out of my world and

show me something else that'll add value to my life that i wouldn't ordinarily pursue and how much more productive you are as

a person as well when you've got space and time and you've had thoughts there's a reason why thoughts come to us in the shower or on

walks right it's because you're literally scientifically speaking your default mode network your dmn in

your brain is being activated by that moment of rest so you know it is neuroscientifically

true there's loads of studies on it but it's hard in the moment when you're people like us to take the rest and so having like you

know a partner that's there that forces it on you as a culture like you know almost every single evening now i don't do any work

which is so different to me but like last night we watched the mask together right like we will watch something like you know trashy fun

whatever but it's like not work laptop down we're eating dinner we're chilling out and it's like a rule

and you know i have to have a very good reason to break that rule and it's made me a happier healthier person but

you know without that guard rail i would just carry on working and you talked about the sexual point there i want to say a very personal

story that i've never shared before about why that made my made my list and this is a dynamic list that's changing as i mature

i met a girl that was the other two so i met a girl that was the most intellectually stimulating person i've

ever met she was actually a model so she's absolutely gorgeous she's also like a just a genius and she

she challenges me with a sense of like like she doesn't care who

i am or what i've done in my life or what i've achieved um and so that made me a better person

she was an absolute genius and she was gorgeous went to have sex with her after you know two months of you know

fumbling hot air balloons and all of this stuff i'm really hoping she isn't listening but the whole point of this podcast is

to be honest so and it just wasn't there the first time ever in my life and i experienced

what i can only describe as a feeling of like horror um total disappointment not with her or

anything like that but that that was the thing yeah and it felt like such a pathetic thing to stand

in the way of someone that i thought was perfect so and i got out of bed i tried again i tried again i tried to get over a couple

of days and i realized that it wasn't there and i got out of bed and i remember a text my best friend i said i could never see her again because this

is something that i didn't realize is actually so important to to a relationship even though it sounds pathetic when you saw

they weren't good in bed but they were perfect in every other way it sounds pathetic but it was the truth

and that's what made my list my other my other thing is sense of humor yeah so you know one of our company

values is have a sense of humility a sense of humor and humility because we jam sort of too and in the same one but

i believe so strongly in that which is work can be very serious life can be

very serious um but finding moments to connect

and laugh i mean so good for your brain but just so good for your

soul um you know spending every day with my wife in lockdown right

you know just us two etc etc like thank god we make each other laugh you know like we we have we both have a

very similar very dark sense of humor um you know one of our things is actually um

my when we fought on our first date um i brought up my dead dad and how actually one of my favorite

things to do in like social situations is to bring up my dead dad to make other people feel awkward

um just like because it's like kind of funny anyway she was like oh my god i do that about my dad and it turns out that her dad had died like a year after mine

or whatever so we um as like our second date or something we decided to go out on

father's day together without our fathers and everyone else just had their dads around we went to the hoxton hotel

and they came over they're like would you like the father's day menu we're like i know our dads are dead thanks and just literally like found it the

funniest thing that only us two would find so funny right because it's just so uncomfortable for everyone else but

to ask that kind of like dark humor like ways to connect and like weirdness that other people

it's like you're connecting on your pain as well because people [Music]

yeah and like how many of like you know comedy greats are you know coming suffering yeah not just suffering but also coming

from huge places of insecurities as well and that's their platform to bring on so i think those things all really match up

but by 100 i think you know finding someone who makes you laugh and gets your quirks so so so important

because humans are weird um i think it's lovely if you can be your fullest

weirdest self in front of other people are you happy yeah i was thinking about

Are you happy?

this question um the other day someone asked me two answers to that one yes i am happy like the the blunt

answer is yes i'm happy because i'm fulfilled the good question isn't it yeah but i know that's your body body language

yeah because because because the question that i asked back to this person was i am happy but why is happiness so

important like why is that the question you want to ask me like is it does it matter that i am happy

is it binary yeah and is it binary but like why does that matter to you and why does that matter to me

because i think a much better question is am i contributing um you know am i fulfilled

and am i contributing because if i'm doing those things i'll be happy and i know that to be true whereas for

me asking that happy is a bit like you know binary it's yeah and it's like straight to the point and it's like there's nothing really behind that it's

undefined as well undefined and also like really depends on what you're asking me that day i will be like no today i'm not happy to

if you ask me if i'm contributing to society and does that make fulfill me yeah and make me feel like

i'm living my purpose it won't matter what i feel like today are you fulfilled very but i have so

much more to do i i one of the real fascinating things that i've learned um is and i again i've read about this

at length in my book is how binary questions like that are the cause of so much pain and no one

realizes it that the cause of so much like misunderstanding pain and um and anxiety so like another great

example is if i asked you now if i said are you in love and immediately you have a bunch of

problems there first you've got to define in love no one's ever told you what that is they've never shown you it no when you

were born they didn't say okay down if you ever feel like this it's in love you've got it from instagram and movies so you over immediately have to overcome

that and then you have to try and understand if what you're feeling for this person fits into that box and and i think one of it's so crazy

that especially from what i do on instagram and putting myself out there tons of people send me their problems and usually it's because they they're

trying to fit into a binary box and they don't even realize that like steve i'm not sure if this is my passion i'm like that is a super

binary thing it either because have you found your passion that that presumes a yes or no answer

whereas if you say you're like are you feeling fulfilled it's a much more it's an answer that appreciates it's a gradient and not just a gradient but a

gradient that different things impact yeah so you know i mentioned contribution like you know

there's many ways to contribute and you know being outwardly successful or building a company or

you know you know having a high-flying career you know they don't tick that many boxes in terms of contribution a lot of contribution

comes back to what you do for society for what you do for your family for what you do for people that you care about you know

that stuff is a much broader question and it's like a cup that's

never full right so it's nice because it's got different levels and you kind of know deep down if you feel like you're living

your purpose and contributing to the level that would make you proud and you also know when you're not which is great because

again it's not bad that you're not it's just like well i could actually improve some stuff by giving it some focus and i think that's why you've got to

continue to like question the question as much as you try and answer the question sometimes are you scared of dying great

question um why is it a great question great question because um i don't believe in fear of death fear

of death is literally um like illogical because fear of death is what actually makes you

fear of life so if you're scared of dying then you approach your life in a very different

way and actually the greatest fear that we should have is not living your life in a true way so no i'm not at all

scared of dying um it's also really worth saying that like ever since doing ayahuasca like i

100 convincingly believe in things like reincarnation soul

spirits other planes all of the woo-woo crap that just like sounds completely bizarre

for me to think that i would ever say those words it's not even is it from like a scientific perspective you describe

incarnation exactly that's why i believe in reincarnation because i see it everywhere around me um so the reality is i'm not in the

slightest bit scared of death um and i think that that's uh the biggest blessing that i got from doing

ayahuasca was no fear of death um because that's a potent powerful feeling not feeling

like knowledge insight right that's categorically so quick for me to answer that question and no

um it helped me deal with the you know death of my father when my mum got cancer it helped me come to terms with

what might happen to not have her around as well this is life people die so you have to approach it

right you can't pretend that isn't going to happen it's the only thing that's guaranteed so having a philosophical understanding

of what that means to you and then how that impacts your life or maybe holds you back is a terrible thing so it's usually a

fear of death that essentially limits our life in my view i i feel the exact same and the

experience i described to you where i lost my faith in christianity at 18 was also the

exact moment where i um because up until that point i believe that there's heaven and

there's a heaven and hell and that was a [ __ ] terrifying thing so for the next two years i went on this search of what the answers were got obsessed with

reading about atheist books and it was actually richard dawkins that said um you can you should really fall in

love with the beauty of of the world and like the true nature of nature he talks about being able to go into a church

and crying even as an atheist because of the beauty and the wonder but also on the point of death he's one

of the questions one of the things he said was a lot of people are scared of death because it's the unknown and they and when you're religious you think it's i'm

gonna burn or i'm gonna be in this place with all these good people that sound kind of boring but when you when i got to the point

where i was agnostic or atheist or whatever you want to call it he said like how did you feel a hundred years ago was that i didn't

didn't feel anything were you scared were you were you fearful no no because i wasn't here and he said that's how

you'll feel then and then like that when i lost the the this idea that i would burn or go to

or you know go to this other place and be judged in some way it all became about now and it was as you described it was this liberating

feeling of then okay well this is it if this is it then i i you know everything is so much more special this isn't an audition

this is the [ __ ] show and my life completely changed and i i i i i completely agree i i asked the

question which is a strange thing to ask in like what i don't know what you really want to call this a business podcast because it's so fundamental to me and

because i think the fear of death is so deeply illogical and as you say imprisoning it's like yeah so listen we've had we could talk

for hours and hours and hours um what an amazing conversation i'm so thankful for for you for coming

Are you scared of dying?

on and sharing your insights you know it's interesting because the dan that

didn't want to do personal branding was like oh well you know i have a direct to consumer product and what's my personal brand fit

in that but the most convincing sales pitch for this product was in fact when you talked about

you it's not when you you know you know what i mean yeah and i think that i mean of course like you talking about

the struggles you've had and the agenda and motivations that went into creating

your product is the most convincing thing yeah and that's again why your personal brand and you building it and even why it's having this conversation

is so i think so incredibly important um i always finish this podcast asking one question which i'm sure

Dinner party

you've had before which is about the dinner party we're at a nice table now just imagine there was two other seats at this table who would you

bring to the table and why your arms crossed again yeah sorry i'm just getting into the serious mode like

thinking about this okay um so i think um i think to be honest

i'd want like an ancient philosopher like i'd love like you know just be so cool like marcus aurelius i would say

one big fan of meditations um you know stoic philosophy i read meditations um after my first

business fail someone bought it for me um and i read it again every year it takes like an hour to read and it's just such a great reminder of

you know yes the world is tough and yes the world is [ __ ] but everything is what you make of it and

really the world you're living in is all it all exists inside your own mind and once you understand that you can

control a lot of how you feel so marcus aurelius would be one and i would say the second

you know this is pathetic and i'm sorry but you know dennis bergkamp is my all-time hero

i'm laguna um and you know the man was a magician and so classy and such a authentic and

great leader in so many ways and iconic i feel though i hear huh fearful

fearful oh yeah oh the opposite of jesus he won't fly but he does walk on water

crazy when i heard that that he refused to fly yeah yeah you're right yeah yeah yeah totally correct yeah he's got a bunch of uh interesting anxieties yes i

could ask him about that maybe get marcus and well exactly and if i had a third um if you were being generous

to be honest with you okay so yeah um oprah yeah why uh

literally just think she's phenomenal yeah it felt stupid asking why yeah i mean just in every way right as

in i just it's hard to pick a thing but let's just say then because of personal growth media brand

understanding wealth and leveraging your wealth for good and storytelling i mean i could

just go on like you know her list is just ridiculous so a hundred percent oprah

um and uh oh i don't know i feel like i i feel like uh you know once the fourth

seat it's literally sitting sitting where he would be my french bulldog because he started sprinting around attacking uh

imaginary other french bulldog yeah exactly pablo um and then um i'd actually say my

fourth would be lewis hamilton um because i think what he's achieved

even before literally breaking a record like a couple of weeks ago um is so awesome and i love i'm so proud

of the fact that he's british i'm so proud of the fact like obviously even though i'm a white guy i'm so proud of the fact of what he's doing to using

his platform to take a stance actually being political with his message when he knows he has such a big

platform which is a thing that a lot of people choose not to do and choose to back out of so he's a man that stands for morals and

values secondly um he's vegan so you know i like i think it's interesting that he's chosen he's

gotten such a high performance no fail like attitude but is like as a

plant-based person clearly environmentally conscious even if he's in f1 which is obviously debatable but um he's got these like clearly deep

rooted values about how he wants uh the world to be and he is manifesting and living them in being

basically the greatest racing driver that's ever ever lived that's what he will end up as because he just beat schumacher's record

um and he seems like quite a nice bloke just in general like i just like when i

see interviews of him i just like what a relatable guy that says you know he doesn't seem like a

knob superstar at all so i would just love to the reason for him is i just love to talk to him about

mindset and focus because when you think about it that is all you're doing in an f1 car yeah that

is the in my opinion the most focused you can be is driving formula one i don't think there is any other i don't

think i don't think anything tops that so i would love to know how you achieve that kind of level of flow and focus

like week in week out nothing would be more interesting so marcus berkamp oprah and uh sounds like a

wicked dinner yeah hamilton sounds amazing listen thank you so much for your time today it's a pleasure to consider your friend

Outro

uh a mentor through the content you produce in your podcast secret leaders but also just an all-around good guy and um you you're you have a a way of

being honest and open which was not only perfect for this podcast but it's so tremendously valuable for people like me

for everybody listening and i want to thank you for that as well because it's not always the the the easiest thing to do you know

people default to massaging the ego or trying to get you know press for

being positive and and untouchable and perfect and i think you've taken a different route which is serving

a much needed uh positive service to to the world so thank you for that as well and pleasure yeah i'm sure

Introduction

i tested positive for the coronavirus and that is why you didn't hear from me last week

i said i was going to do this podcast every single monday we got off to a bit of a rocky start because during last week's podcast i

actually had the virus and i didn't know and it turns out my pa had the virus my cameraman who's over

there also had the virus my whole team around me tested positive for the virus at the same time and none of us knew

and in terms of the experience that i had with the virus i had one or two tricky days there was

one day in particular last week where i had mild flu symptoms and then i started to get this really

bizarre muscular pain in my back and i remember it being three or four a.m in the morning and i'm lying in bed

thinking how do i stop this pain in my back and i ordered um ibuprofen and i think like painkillers on

delivery which were delivered to my door at 4am and that night i remember pulling my pillows off my bed and sleeping on the

floor of my bedroom to try and straighten out my back weird symptoms to get i know um but that's the virus

the symptoms are so unpredictable and crazy my assistant lost her taste and smell which is quite a popular one

jack had a bunch of cold symptoms and things like that as well but thankfully we all recovered and that

isn't always the case and a lot of people especially people that are a little bit more vulnerable and have pre-existing conditions aren't always

that lucky but it made me reflect it made me reflect on the craziness

of the world right now isn't it nuts isn't it absolutely bonkers what's happened over these last seven or eight

months all of the lockdowns all of the restrictions the travel restrictions the the redundancies the the battles the

political battles it's absolutely crazy it's been the most crazy seven months of my life without

exception and hard times as much as they suck in the moment they

teach us important lessons and there's some lessons which i've learned more starkly than others which i

wanted to talk about today the things that i've been writing about here in my diary and i'm going to start

there this week i'm going to share one of the key lessons that i've learnt with you so without further ado i'm stephen

butler and this is the diary of a ceo i hope nobody is listening but if you are then please keep this to

yourself

okay so the first thing in my diary this week is just a lesson that i've learned because of this pandemic and because of all the

The first lesson this pandemic has taught me

restrictions and the lockdowns i've just written in my diary learn how to contrast in the right

direction let me explain what i mean you know i had this moment this week where i started really thinking about

all of the things that i miss and to be honest i keep slipping back into these thoughts you know in the uk and in the us at the

moment what we're seeing is the government start to talk about further restrictions and returning to the lockdowns that we had

in march and every time i hear these stories and i go on twitter and i see the headlines i start to reminisce

over my old life you know and i miss going to the theater i miss how fun my

weekends with my friends used to be i miss you know as a big manchester united fan i miss going to old trafford and watching my team play

i miss new york city which is where i lived before all of this craziness happened and

before they shut the borders and stopped me getting back in i miss speaking on stage i used to

travel around the world speaking to thousands of people in every corner of the globe i miss being in the office

with hundreds of our team members building the business together i miss my old life but i'm sure i'm sure that

many of you listening to this have reminisced over your old life and the things that you miss in the last few weeks and months pretty

you know unavoidably and typically when we do this in a more subconscious way

without really thinking about it we arrive at a place of sadness a place of

self-pity a place of grief at least i know i did you know and i almost honestly

this is kind of embarrassing to admit you'll understand why i think this is embarrassing now that i say it i almost started feeling sorry for

myself and this for the love of god is why you have to

interrogate your own thinking and let me just interrogate exactly what

i've just said to you about all of the things i miss and let me try and reframe all of those things through another perspective

when this global pandemic happened i was a 27 year old guy who was able to go to the theater go to

old trafford and watch my favorite team play whenever i wanted to i lived in a beautiful apartment in new york city

eating at the best restaurants in the world traveling around the world in business class getting paid to speak to thousands of people on stage whilst running a

global business that was full of my friends the thing that took me from that is a

global pandemic which has killed over a million people and it's devastated people's livelihoods it

stripped them of their generational family businesses and it's plunged them into desperation

right now many people can't even pay the bills feed their kids many people can't even

bear the thought of their future meanwhile all of my family are healthy i have work

i have freedom i can feed myself right now there are more people than ever praying for the family praying for

the health praying for the opportunities and praying for the life that i have right now and that you have

right now and then and when you start to think about it like that

it changes things and if you think about it like that you'll probably arrive at the conclusion that 2020

shouldn't make you feel sorry for yourself it should make you feel so unbelievably grateful

and this is the power of contrast when you contrast your life in the wrong direction you can make yourself

miserable like i did you know i was on the verge of wallowing in self-pity because i couldn't go to

the theater anymore because i couldn't go to old trafford and watch my because i didn't get on business class

flights and get to fly to every corner of the world even [ __ ] privileged [ __ ] like me can make the mistake

right so i can't imagine how easy it is to make this mistake for everybody else when you contrast your life

up as i was doing to the life you had back in march to someone more fortunate than you to

someone that's prettier than you on instagram or to someone that looks more successful than you from the outside you'll quickly

arrive at a place of self-pity and ungratefulness which is the quickest way to unhappiness but if you contrast your life down to

the billions and billions of people that would do anything to be in your shoes that would do anything to have the health of their sick parents back

to have a warm home to have a fridge full of food to have a secure job then you'll arrive at gratitude and

honestly gratitude in my life has been one of the best ways i've ever known to be happy the world we see

and how we see it is a direct result of contrast and the contrast games that you play every day if you

stroll through the corridor of a hospital and you peer into the the wards and you peer in and look at the different patients

what you'll see is people sick and suffering and in some cases unfortunately dying and suddenly because of that contrast

you'll feel so grateful for your good health and we i do this all the time you know i had this problem a couple years ago with one of my ears where i

woke up one day and there was this faint ringing sound in my right ear and at first i thought it was nothing i thought

it would pass but after two days my ear was still ringing i go on google i google it

comes up as something called tinnitus or tinnitus right and it and i'm reading through these forums of people saying

that they've had it for their entire lives it came out of nowhere and it ruined their lives

it stopped them from sleeping it made them depressed it stopped them from focusing it fundamentally changed their lives and

after 10 days of my ear just ringing non-stop faintly i came to terms with the fact

that i was gonna have this for the rest of my life and i couldn't stop thinking about it because when your ears always ringing

it's hard to ignore right and i couldn't sleep properly and i started to worry

and in that moment after two weeks of one of my ears ringing i can't tell you how much i

longed and wished for my normal hearing back for just normal ears for that ringing to

cease and it made me feel so ungrateful that it took an element where my ear

would just ring constantly for me to suddenly feel grateful for my eyesight my ears the fact that i can

walk that i have ten fingers that i can think and that's the way that contrasts work you know the same applies for the

technology in our lives those old nokia brick phones were the best thing ever in a world

that didn't have the iphone in it and your life right now in the midst of the pandemic in what

month are we in october is such an amazing privileged life

in a world where you can't remember your old one the one you had back in march this year taught me that the grass will

always look greener on the other side until you start watering the side that you're on right now and that's really all you can

do contrasting up is just such a deadly sin that we all need to avoid especially in moments like this

we all have to be aware conscious and mindful of how we're contrasting because the world is a crazy place and there's

no guarantee that it's not going to get crazier right and if you continue to contrast up you'll contrast

yourself into depression and despair and misery and self-pity like i nearly did like i nearly did when

i started reflecting on my old life and telling myself all of all of the things that i missed not the things that i have

having control of your contrast can fundamentally change the way you see the world and if it can change the way you

see the world it can change how you feel and if it can change how you feel then

it can change your life let's move on

I have a secret to tell you

i have a secret to tell you and this is the second point in my diary this week it's a secret that i only found out

and started to deeply understand recently when i say recently i mean the last 24 months it's a secret that i

really started to understand honestly being completely honest with you when i got rich and when i got

rich friends and those rich friends pulled back a certain curtain and allowed me to see

behind it i'd always heard about this i'd always heard that there's another curtain i heard joe rogan did a

a podcast with um kevin hart and on the podcast kevin hart talks about meeting jeff bezos and

realizing that there's this other level there's this other curtain which some people have access to

and the more wealthy that i got and the more you know wealthy people that started to to surround me i started to understand

what kevin hart meant and i started to understand what that secret is here is the secret

access to information and information itself that is the real

privilege in this world that's the thing if your rich parent gives you money

that's like them giving you a fish right but if they pull you into the family business and show you how it works

they're giving you a fishing rod money is efficient life and information is a fishing rod and only one of those things

will feed you for a lifetime and when you get to the level that i'm at now and you have access to a new level of information you're

associating with a different level of person you realize how much you didn't know before and you didn't know

because you don't know what you don't know it they are unknown unknowns and so back then i was kind of naive i

just thought i knew everything and where i'm at now i started to wonder

why no one told me this stuff the stuff i know now about wealth and finance and about how these systems work

and you start to realize why the rich get richer and why the poor stay poor information and access to

information obviously there's a ton of systemic issues which are controlling things but for me

information and access to information is the single biggest one when i made my first million i started

studying wealth right and i started studying investing in finance and i started to get really obsessed with how

i could turn the money i had into a lot more money i started speaking to more millionaires

and billionaires i started spending more time with billionaires and i got to see what i refer to to my close friends as

money games the games that they play and how they double triple and quadruple their money just by having certain information and

this is information that most of us don't have we aren't given we aren't let in we aren't allowed to see behind the curtain

and these are games that i never knew when i was broke games they didn't teach you or me in school games that really rich

people have no incentive to teach you because they're too busy playing them the people that sell money and those finance courses on

instagram they aren't rich right they're selling new courses on instagram if they knew a better way to make money they wouldn't be

spending their time selling you courses on instagram but there's another level there's another level of information

which is what i think kevin hart was referring to when he spoke about being able to peer in behind the curtain and you know i'm gonna really

disappoint you here after what was probably one of the biggest build ups that i've ever done on this podcast because i don't have enough

time in the hour or so that we have on this podcast to teach you everything that i've come to learn

and to be honest even if i did i don't think that's the most valuable thing that i could give you in

this hour that we have together today just like money is a fish right me telling you today's information is also

a bit of a fish because things change quite quickly in the world and even if i could tell you everything i knew now

about money games it would at some point expire it would very quickly change i think the

most valuable important fishing rod that i could give you in this hour is in fact a change of mindset

i think if i can get you to realize that your monetary future value and how rich you'll be in

your life is perhaps somewhat equal to the value of the information you have in your brain then maybe maybe just maybe you'll start

to value information and learning and the pursuit of knowledge even more and in the world we live in we

all have access to the to the same information pretty much but most of us still don't understand

the true value of it one of the greatest privileges i think i could ever give to my future kids

is to teach them the value of learning gaining experience acquiring information and

self-education which is something we can all do now because we all have google right we all have the internet we all have social media we will have youtube

you know you're doing it right now some of you that are watching this online i think we tend to over value short-term financial

incentives and undervalue learning opportunities which will give us that long-term value advantage

and all of the young people and even some of the slightly old people that i get a chance to mentor

this is one of the key lessons i try and teach them is to be able to spot short-term value from long-term value

you know and i'm going to go off peace just a little bit here and i'm going to tell you a bit of a personal story um that happened to me actually quite

recently uh and this is the you know this podcast is the home of the truth so make sure you do keep this to yourself i

had a a young person in their early 20s asked to come and work with me and when i say work with me

i don't mean you know in the same building as me i mean with me and because of the lockdowns and the way the world is

all of my sort of real close team are literally working with me in my home or in you know in a small um co-working

space and this was a in my opinion a fairly unique opportunity right because we're gonna be

sat together pretty much every day and they were so persistent that eventually i ended up offering them

a job and i offered them a job on the same salary the same wage that they're earning right now in their current role

and i offered them a guaranteed pay rise in 60 days time and they effectively

turned the offer down because they wanted a little bit more money now and whatever i say from this point

onwards is going to sound petty and biased and bitter i have no other way of saying it i'm just gonna be

honest with you honestly from what i know about their situation and from what i know about where they

wanted to go in their career and as impartially as i could possibly be that was a [ __ ] stupid decision just

just purely based on the fact that if you sit next to me or someone that's fortunate enough to have the access to the

level of information that i have access to someone that is willing to give you that information and information that's probably going to

help you fulfill the goals that you have [ __ ] a 2k pay rise that information can

quite literally make you a millionaire too and i've seen it make people millionaires you know much of the reason

why i'm sat here as a millionaire is because i got to sit next to people who had gone on the journey that i

wanted to go on and that's what i mean we tend to overvalue the short-term financial

incentives and undervalue the learning opportunities which will give us long-term value knowing how to make spot

the difference and knowing which is which will change your life and sometimes you have to play a long game you have to delay that

gratification you have to hold off on that 2k pay rise because the situation you're in is giving you real long-term value your long-term

future will be better if you make long-term decisions or your life will be slightly better in the

short term if you make short-term decisions but then your long-term future is compromised and that's what delaying gratification is you have to learn to do

that in your careers too i'm gonna close off this point by telling you the easiest simplest change that i've made in my

life to radically radically increase the amount of information and the amount of good quality information that i'm

exposed to one small change but before i tell you we're going to play a little game just imagine for a second that you could

pick up an imaginary phone in front of you and you could just listen in to the world's smartest minds

the world's smartest minds in in fitness in business in finance spirituality and philosophy just imagine

imagine if you could be a fly on the wall as they discuss ideas as they seek to understand the

world and as they talk about what they know and as they play their money games and enrich themselves imagine how transformative

that would be imagine how much that information would change your life it would change your health your happiness and probably your wealth

and imagine if all of that that access to information was free

it is free that's twitter that's social media that's youtube you can literally watch

and listen to the smartest people in the world think discuss and ideate so that's big the question you have to be honest

why the [ __ ] do you still follow jenny from 10 years ago who you do not give a f about as she publicly complains to some

customer service rep on twitter about her t-mobile data plan being expensive and slow or

kylie jenner as she publicly advertises the results of her plastic surgery and demolishes your self-esteem in the process all that

clown on facebook that tries to convince you that 5g internet the coronavirus and bill gates were all

part of some illuminati conspiracy theory why are you choosing that information why are you allowing

junk to seep into your mental diet where is that information going to take you

information is the privilege and you have to be the gatekeeper and the unapologetic defender of the

information that you consume i've said this before and in fact it's proven to be so important in my life

that i'm gonna keep saying it until i feel like you're listening to me who you follow online especially if you're

someone that spends hours of day on the internet and social media like i do is the single biggest influence on your life for the love of

god follow better and unfollow faster my trick which i'm going to give to you

is i basically mute everyone 90 of the people on my instagram are muted probably near 95

percent i just don't see their stuff i don't see their stories i don't see their posts because usually it's actually not that helpful to me

50 of the people on my twitter are muted and i'm muting people because just like you there are real world

consequences of you know unfollowing friends and people and family and things like that so i just mute them

it's a nice middle ground where they don't know and they don't need to know right and if i start talking [ __ ] online i

give you permission to unfollow me to please subscribe to this podcast but i give you permission to unfollow me too

and this has changed my life honestly it's the simplest thing the simplest decision that has had the single biggest impact

on my life i'm definitely smarter happier and more professionally capable because of it

so if there is a small thing that you can do now to really change the most important influence on your life it's to

go through your social media timelines and every time you see someone who isn't contributing

towards the values or the information that you want to consume boom mew but and here comes a very

important caveat you have to be careful not to unfollow or mute people just because they disagree with your opinion

a few years ago if i saw someone in my timeline that overtly supported like a different political party

or had a completely opposing opinion to mine all just like strongly disagreed with issues that i really care about

i would just unfollow them boom bye felicia and i think i did that because i didn't want to feel the frustration that

i felt when i logged in and saw their posts and tweets and also i didn't want to keep biting and arguing

and debating with them online but when you think about that decision logically it's a pretty terrible

decision all i'm doing by doing that is narrowing my world view and i'm building reinforcing this echo

chamber around me which is full of people who believe everything i already believe

and the fundamental truth that we all have to have the intellectual strength to believe

is that often there really is no right or wrong everything is really just a bunch of perspectives that's what the world is

full of very very few things are a case of right or wrong we'll probably all agree that the sky is blue

but as it relates to the way the world should be run our political opinions how people should be treated there's typically quite a lot of

variants and those perspectives that perfectly agree with yours are actually

the least valuable they're not going to challenge you or broaden your perspective or teach you anything

only the perspectives that differ from yours can do that whether they differ because they're you know a little bit more developed on your

opinions or because they disagree but it's not easy and i'd be lying to you if i pretend

that it was i've genuinely and i this is a weekly battle i've genuinely struggled to keep people on my social media timelines within my

social media bubble that say things i really disagree with and that support ideas that i despise

but i also think if i'm being completely honest with myself i'm better off because of it listen i'm

not i'm not going to let ryan on facebook tell me that 5g internet caused coronavirus but i am going to fill my social bubble

and my circle online with people who honestly disagree people who can respectfully

explain why they disagree and people who view the world differently to me

you know i i hope this is the last time that i make this point on this podcast but it just keeps coming

to the front of my mind so if you've not cleansed your social media following please do it now i really really hope

this is the last time i feel like if i can convince you to do this now today this week

it will be for some of you the greatest thing i was ever able to do for you the greatest

gift i can give you for listening to this podcast also you know turn all the unifications

off all of them but we'll save that topic for another time

Changing the shape of your brain

okay so the third point in my diary is about changing the shape of your brain you can change the shape of your brain

what a load of nonsense over the over the last couple of years i've heard a lot of people people that i respect a

lot including tom bill you who came on this podcast tell me that you can quite literally change the

shape of your brain and at first i'll be honest i thought this was potentially some you know some of that self-development

fluff and nonsense that we read a lot about you know the hocus pocus nonsense [ __ ] um and i

thought to myself how could you possibly change the shape and composition of your brain without having some type of evasive

surgery but i hold my hands up it turns out i was wrong and i wasn't just a little bit wrong i was really really

really really wrong over the last few months as i've gone on the journey of writing my book which is coming out called happy sexy millionaire

the unexpected truth about fulfillment love and success which you can get right now on amazon i started to develop a bit of an

obsession with neuroscience and i'm not gonna i'm not gonna go do too deep into the science because you don't necessarily

need to know that stuff but i'm to tell you about some of the things that i learned on that journey and particularly one thing that changed

my life and here it is our brains are malleable just like play-doh and our experiences

determine their shape this process is almost best compared to physical exercise where you know 30 reps today isn't going to

make you super muscular and big right but 30 reps every day for a year will and the same is true for your brain the

science says that whatever you focus your mind upon be anger or self-doubt or fear your brain will eventually

literally change in shape and i sound like i'm talking nonsense i can hear myself saying this it sounds like

some hocus-pocus magic but i promise you this is the truth and listen i'm if you know me you know

i'm just as immune to self-development nonsense and fluff as you are so i only share things with you that i think are

fundamentally true and that's supported by some kind of evidence let me give you an example if you're a compulsive

warrior the science shows that your brain will quite literally change to become a finely tuned anxiety and

worry machine you'll get your brain will become tuned for worry and i've looked through the research i've looked at before and

after pictures of brain scans of people who've overcome worry and addiction and negative thinking about themselves and other more

serious psychological conditions and honestly blew my socks off i've always believed that we are you know we are what we think

but the science shows us that we quite literally from a neurological perspective become what we think you know i read

this great piece online by this neurological expert called brian penny and he has this lab

where they've worked on being able to predict the age of your brain just by looking at it on brain scans

and your brain age is associated with increased mortality risk cognitive decline

increased risk of dementia and overall general poorer physical functioning they can

literally see how a life change that you make a decision you make in your life will change the shape of your brain over a

number of years they can see how a person that gives up x y or zed then has a completely different brain

just a few years later just like how if you stopped going to the gym or you started going to the gym you'd have a completely different body a

few years later and they've identified a number of methods just simple everyday choices and cognitive

tools that science suggests can positively change the shape of your brain i'm just going to tell you about

one of them today and it's the one that fascinated me the most it's called observation without

engagement this is basically what they call self-observation which is a pretty big part of meditation if you've

ever meditated you'll understand this and it really helps you do exactly that it involves like mindfully observing

your thoughts and your feelings and your bodily sensations the best example i can give you is you

know if i asked you to observe right now how how tense your body feels

instantly you might you know take a step back and start focusing on your sore toe or the tightness in your chest or that

headache which you didn't notice before but you can only notice when you start to observe yourself if i ask you to observe your thoughts

and your feelings you can also do that too you might start to think about the things you're worrying about or that

particular unsolved situation in your life or about your family's health because of this virus the things that are going on

subconsciously which you didn't really notice about that big decision on your future which you're procrastinating making

the point is you can take an observer's perspective on your anxious thoughts on your feelings and on your bodily sensations

you don't have to try and live inside of the problem all the time you don't have to live inside of your feelings or your emotions

and when you do this don't try and engage you're not supposed to try and fix it just observe let me give you another metaphor

which i think explains this best it's called the clouds metaphor imagine your thoughts and feelings or bodily sensations

as just clouds that are floating through the sky and sometimes those clouds are dark sometimes they're angry sometimes it's you know raining

and sometimes they're light and sometimes they're calm and thin but you're not the clouds you're the

blue sky who just observes the clouds as they're passing without engaging in them you simply observe and you let them pass you by and

as the 20-something ceo of a big company who knows that every time i look at my emails and my whatsapp in the

morning there's gonna be a ton of unpredictable yet unfortunately inevitable [ __ ] not just small

[ __ ] severe [ __ ] i'm talking ruin your day [ __ ] [ __ ] that can rear its head from any corner or person

in a global business of 700 people as as that guy this mechanism has quite literally saved

me i really really believe that and from my conversations with dom who's my business partner who's been with me this whole time you know which i

had on this podcast in chapter 10 where he described that running the business made him an alcoholic made him anxious

and made him experience some pretty severe mental health problems i genuinely believe

that this this technique was the fundamental difference between me and him self-observation which is something that

for some reason i've always defaulted to we both had the same intense stressful experience over the last 10 years

but in his words i survived it and he nearly didn't he said right and this is a horrible

thing for me to talk about he said he considered jumping in front of a train and killing himself because things at one point were so

almost unbearable and the difference is here it's in your mind and the mechanisms you rely on to

deal with your portion of unpredictable life [ __ ] which is coming your way whether you like it or not i've said in this podcast before that i

viewed the hardest moments in my life as as really a video game i naturally and

again i don't want to take too much credit for this because it's not something that i did consciously i naturally adopted this strange

video game mindset where i would almost see the situation i was in like a game of chess like i was removed

from it when things got really really hard i told myself without thinking about it that this was all just a game yeah like

a like a game of chess and i'm not the pieces on the chessboard because they can be killed i'm the

person responsible for moving the pieces and whatever happens i'll be fine just

like you know like a game of call of duty i'm not the character in the screen running with the gun

the one at danger of standing on a land mine i'm the person holding the controller sat at home and even if i stand on a land mine or

two that's fine i can just restart and rejuvenate and you know go again

and for me this perspective which is very similar to what i've described with this self-observation

was the most liberating thing in my whole career it allowed me to develop my own calm within any form of chaos and it

allowed me to think clearly without being clouded by emotion and if you're a ceo if you're running a business

that's so incredibly important and i genuinely also think that my business partner don was inside the game

he was the pawn on the chessboard he was the soldier running through the battlefield in the call of duty he was taking

the enemy fire so he internalized that pain he internalized the stress and he became the conflict

and honestly nobody can survive that nobody not even me but fortunately for whatever reason i

was removing myself and that helped self-observation isn't just handy for

increasing your like self-awareness it genuinely provides you with a sense of detachment in the most challenging situations you'll find

yourself in instead of being controlled by the situation and the thoughts that come with the situation

and all of those feelings it gave you gives you this ability to hold out in front of you to observe it

and to let it come and to let it go without impacting you too much and the brain research they've done on

this topic completely supports this they've studied the part of your brain that becomes active

when you're drifting from thought to thought and overthinking and worrying and they've seen clearly how this can

have a detrimental impact on your personal well-being and over a number of years the shape of

your brain they've then also observed how that attachment which you can achieve from self-observation and that video game

mindset where you become the sky not the clouds can quiet that part of your brain

and there's one particular study that shows that people who meditate have reduced activity in that part of their brain versus

people that don't meditate and listen when we talk about meditation i was a bit of a skeptic on the whole topic meditation doesn't have to be sitting

with your legs crossed humming to yourself right it can literally just be taking a few minutes out to relax

and pause and for me meditation is usually in the form of a massage it's the time where

i can stop i can pause and i can detach and that for me is crucial crucial

crucial for everybody no matter what walk of life you're in you have to find your paws

and listen this isn't going to stop you getting anxious or worried or stressed but learning the habit of self-observation

and that video game mindset and becoming the sky as i'll call it will allow your problems to come go and

limit the impact they have on you without having to always engage in them and therefore making them worse than they have to be

without making a mountain out of what could have just been a molehill

for the next point in my diary i've just written less answers and more questions you know so much of the the

Less answers and more questions

self-development career progression advice that i got when i was younger told me to speak up more

you know make sure i'm heard and to get my point across whenever i can and i'm telling you the older i've got and the further i've

traveled in the business world the more i've learned that that's really shitty advice in the real world it's

impressive to know an answer of course but it's also impressive to admit that you don't it's impressive to say and to have the

sense of yourself to say i don't know to say you're probably right to say

that's not my area of expertise to say i don't know but i'm going to find out or just to remain silent the least

impressive thing you can do is speak for the sake of speaking we all know people like this and they typically do that because they are insecure

and because they think if they have nothing to say then they're not very valuable we all have this contribution reputation

let me call it a contribution score you won't know what your contribution score is but you'll probably know the score of the people around you the

people in your friendship groups and in your family you'll know that person within your friendship group or a colleague at work

that just seems to speak for the sake of speaking and most of the time when they add something to the

conversation people kind of like roll their eyes and you know and they think to themselves that was a really dumb thing to say

and it gets to the point that before they speak everyone in the room presumes it's going to be something dumb again or

weird or unhelpful or irrelevant i think you'll know that person and that is because their contribution

score is low that is what a contribution score is it really really matters because if you

constantly speak for the sake of speaking or you you know you speak when you're not informed on a topic

people will gradually stop listening to you they will receive your id ideas with a pre-conceived bias

that you're probably going to say something that doesn't matter and so your ideas suffer even if they're good because of that

preconceived bias and that preconceived opinion of what you have to say so even when you do have something valuable to add

everybody will disregard it they'll pre-devalue it before it's even come out of your mouth and that's because just like a credit

score we all have a contribution score and in that case it's because you've ruined yours by always feeling the need

to chime in even when you don't know what you're talking about even when you shouldn't if you don't know the answer to

something at least know the value of admitting that you don't or staying quiet as someone that's you

know had the pleasure and sometimes displeasure of working in boardrooms and in creative brainstorms and in intense investor meetings with

big personalities and sometimes competitive personalities for the last decade i've seen how someone you know can ruin their contribution

score by constantly feeling the need to say something or add something when they don't know the answer and when this isn't their field of

expertise and i've also seen the opposite i've seen people who will sit and listen humbly and just observe and

often learn and the people that walk out of the room with their respect and contribution score intact to always

those that are secure enough to admit that they don't know and to in many cases stay quiet and the ones that lose respect

are those that try and pretend they know something that isn't in their field of expertise or that they know something about

usually because they're insecure and this is why as a general rule for life it's always better to have more questions than you have answers and to

be able to admit when you don't have the answers your contribution score really really matters and i think you come to learn that the

further you go in your career it's the thing that for me made investors believe me you know this this notion i think they

have in their head which is when stephen speaks it's probably something informed and something worth listening to

it's the things that you know makes employees trust you as a ceo it's a thing that as a colleague earns

respect and ultimately if you have the humility to learn to listen in areas that are outside your expertise

it'll be the thing that expands your knowledge and again that that will change your life

What are some of the most important questions you can ask yourself?

and this brings me to the next point in my diary and i've written in my diary what are some of the most important questions

i ask myself regularly and i when i say this i mean in all areas of my life if it's more important to know the right

question to ask them to have the answer what are the questions that you should ask yourself every single day

and um the first one in my diary is which part of this situation can i

control you know as a ceo but just as a human being that's living life like we all are there are so many times where i

encounter a situation of conflict or stress or chaos um and i'm desperate to fix it and i

start committing energy to trying to solve the problem usually and this is something that i've come to

learn there's really only like three or four things that i can control in this situation and if i know what those things are i

can invest my energy in those levers in pulling those levers and that gives me the best chance of

getting out of the situation it also is a great tool for liberating yourself from all of the stress

of worrying about things that are completely outside of your control and that you can do nothing about and i've done this over the last two

years in particular where i will hone in and i will sometimes even write in my diary the two or three things in the

situation i'm in now that i that i can control gives me that clarity it liberates me from stress and it focuses me

on the things that will actually help me get out of the situation i'm in and the second question which i

ask myself religiously at least once a day and is actually held as a permanent point on my to-do list

is what am i avoiding right now this is something that i i dare you to try and ask yourself every

day because for me understanding what i'm avoiding helps me overcome it and as near ielts said on

this podcast we are creatures that seek to avoid discomfort so there's nearly always a reason

why i'm procrastinating or avoiding something and if i can become conscious about that thing and the

psychological discomfort that's making me avoid it it helps me to overcome it and usually the things we

avoid are actually really really important and that's part of the reason they're causing us discomfort so that's a

question that i recommend everybody asks themselves every day make a list of the things you want to ask yourself the first is what part of this

situation can i control and the second is what am i avoiding the third is what would my idols think about

this decision and this is a question which i religiously ask myself when i'm facing a big life choice because i think we all

understand the values and the principles that our idols lived by we study you know we study their lives we

read their books their podcasts whatever we understand the way that they think but when we're in a situation when we're

facing a big decision sometimes we kind of relapse back to our own innate fear-driven

decision-making mechanisms and we lose sight of how our idols the people we want to be like

would make that decision so every time i make a big life decision i almost like interrogate

it against what i know that my idols would do because my idols are my idols

because they have values that i admire and so if i can kind of sense check my own decision-making

against what i think they would do which is sometimes easier than knowing the right thing to do i tend to make a better decision

and the next question i religiously ask myself is what would future steve think of this decision and this question is super handy to ask

yourself whenever you can because future you is going to pay the price for the decisions you make today

so future you is quite a selfish person they want to be they want to have a six-pack they want to be super smart they want to be rich

and that is almost all of our north star our future self and so if you ask yourself genuinely ask

yourself the question what would future steve the happiest version the best version of me

think about this decision i'm about to make to eat this entire double pizza to myself

usually that allows you to see if this decision you're about to make is in line with your values

and the next question that i like to ask myself regularly is if i'm saying yes to this thing then

what am i saying no to i think it was steve jobs who once said that it's only by saying no to things

that you can concentrate on what's important in your life and i love this line because it really helped me to realize the potency of that

question be it in our relationships or our career or in our health or in our mental health um i think it's important and i think we

need to reflect on what we hold most dear now in this moment in order to live a life and to attain a future

that is in line with our values and we need to become aware of how a yes decision is going to prevent us from doing other things

that we also consider to be relatively important it's a question that appreciates that you can't do everything and be

everything and that life is about prioritization prioritizing the things that are most important and so before i say yes to

something i like to consider all of the things that i'm saying no to as a consequence

of that yes it helps me to make better decisions today and it's a sign a signal and a nod

to how much i respect the limited amount of time i have and the last question which i've written

in my diary that i ask myself religiously is a much more direct question which is

does this thing align with my values you know people often make decisions that don't align with their values i know that i do

it every day and there are tons of reasons people do this you know they uh they binge on alcohol

they they smoke 20 cigarettes a day they have big mac you can't have a big mac pizza

they have big mac burgers and domino's pizzas religiously even though they know that their future values of health and being

around to see their kids grow up and those kinds of things are in conflict with those short-term detrimental actions

and often we do this because we don't stop to ask ourselves this simple

question and we don't really stop to think about this simple question which is how does this short-term decision

align with my long-term values next time you're doing something and it doesn't feel quite right and it

feels a little bit naughty ask yourself how it's serving what you value most in life and that

having you know the obsession i have now with continually cross-checking

the decisions i'm about to make versus the person i want to be or the life i want to attain

has been transformative for me honestly it's really really changed my life and i'm going to throw in a bonus question i did say that was the last one

but i'm going to give you a bonus question which i've just i've just been thinking about it's a little bit cliche but i promise you it's

helped me overcome you know some of the most fearful moments of my life the question is what's the worst that

will happen if i attempt this and i remember being really really young 16 years old when someone first asked me to speak on stage

and then 17 and then 18 and then the stage is getting bigger and the audience is getting bigger i remember one day

speaking in barcelona in front of about 10 000 people and being stood backstage and starting to feel a little bit of that

anxiety which we all feel and i i for some reason just like the video game mindset which i've talked

about in this podcast i default to asking myself what is the worst thing that can happen

and i don't just ask myself that question in the cliche way that friend might turn to you and say i genuinely run through the process of

what you know what is the worst thing that can happen i could walk up on stage and as i'm walking on stage

i trip on the first step i fall i smash my face my trousers come down people see my

underwear and my you know my willy and i walk up on stage and then i deliver the worst speech in my life

and people start walking out and throwing stuff at me and i walk off stage and and to be honest it's nearly always the

case that the worst thing that can happen isn't actually as bad as you think we tend to you know before we

confront it and rationalize it that way and look at it in that way we tend to i guess think it's death i

think i think we think we're gonna die and everyone's gonna hate us and and then you ask yourself this sub question which is if the worst thing

that i think could happen happens what is the long-term impact of that on my life

and even if i fell on the step hit my you know hit my eye walked on stage with a bleeding eye and then did the worst speech of my life

it doesn't actually have any long-term impact on my life okay i wouldn't get booked to speak there again but the

the material long-term impact of my life is pretty much nil and so it doesn't make sense to be

fearful because the worst possible outcome has no long long-term impact on your life

and for me that's the question that i really hold dear and it's a question that i still turn to in moments of intense pressure and fear

um fear of failure and i think it's a question that can change your life if you're a very fearful person those

are my questions and i i am i think it's important to have questions and be armed with questions because as i

say in life it turns out that having the questions is much more important than having all the answers

The thing that invalided you when you were younger, will be the thing you seek validation from as an adult

okay so the last point in my diary this week is it's just a sentence and i'm going to read that sentence to you the thing that invalidates you when

you're younger will be the things you seek validation from when you're an adult and this is um this is something that it really took me

about 30 years the 28 years i've been alive to learn um when i was younger as a lot of you will know if you've listened to this

podcast before i came from a background in a family that didn't have a whole lot of

money right we were pretty much bankrupt for my whole um my whole childhood at least the last

part of my my my time living at home we lived in a house that was beat up um the window on the front of our house

was smashed for a good decade so you know you'd get the draught coming in from outside we live my back garden

the grass in the background is about six foot high and there are fridges and tv sets and all kinds of nonsense in

there in fact the back half of my house was actually knocked down because i think at one point my mom thought we had

the money to do a renovation but we didn't have the money so they just the builders just knocked the house down and just left it as a derelict

house so one of the the doors you know which used to go into one of the rooms was actually would just actually take

you outside and we just removed the handle so that no one could really break into our house the front of our house was the same we

had you know the grass was you know a good meter and a half high at times and it was fairly embarrassing um growing up as a

black kid in an all-white school who already felt a little bit different with my curly hair knowing that our

house also looked so marked you know remarkably different and that my life was remarkably different

from a financial perspective we didn't have um christmases and birthdays by the time i was about 10 10 11 years old because

of the financial situation we're in and i know that it created a real deep insecurity within me i remember

christmas days sat in my brother kevin's room on the floor as we joked about the things we were going to pretend we got for

christmas you know like and i have to make i have to to bring context to this right like i know now as

an adult that this was a terribly naive selfish immature way to think

i know now that i should have been looking at all the things i did have which was a loving family two parents that were together and loved

me a roof over my head food on the table i know now that those were the important things but back then

when you're a young little kid who doesn't really understand the world you feel sorry for yourself you engage in self-pity and i did and i

would go to school embarrassed and i would go to school and lie about our financial situation and it

made me insecure it invalidated me you know it was one of the the biggest worries or you know

insecurities i had as a kid and so at 14 years old i started to really really value money money for me

just felt so important the lack of money we had in our life was the reason that i had so much shame it

was the reason that my mum and dad would scream at each other so much about our house and about our finances and

about christmas and about all of these other things and money was the problem so i grew up thinking

and pretty obsessed with attaining money or if i went to university at 18 years old dropped out started a business to try and make loads of money

and then when i finally got money set 21 22 years old i had a really unhealthy relationship

with it and i went to nightclubs and i spent i think one year like 50 60 000 pounds on champagne in a nightclub

at 22 23 years old just to try and impress people and then i went out to the countryside and bought

this seven bedroom mansion with a tennis court at the bottom of the garden and two living rooms and an outhouse and

big gates and a 100 meter driveway just to try and impress people and this

is this is a force in our lives which will ruin our lives if we don't understand it and the thing

that i came to learn after literally like 25 years and after being a puppet you know the

puppet master being this thing that happened to me as a kid after being a puppet that didn't know why he was doing what he was doing but

was just buying these tables and nightclubs and buying material things and trying to show off to people

i came to learn that the thing that invalidated me when i was younger had become the thing that i sought

validation from as an adult and that will be true for you no matter what it is no matter if it's romantic affection no

matter if it's validation no matter if it's money no matter what it is the thing that invalidated you

when you were younger will be this the thing that you seek validation from as an adult and until

you understand what that thing is it risks being the number one thing that can ruin your life i've like gone

through every like corner of my childhood to try and understand the things that made me

feel invalid in order to understand some of the forces that are in play in my life right now as an adult and

honestly it has liberated me i wrote in my diary one day the reasons i'll go broke

and it was pretty much this it was because i was broke when i was a kid and because that

developed a really you know psychological issue with money where money for me became

a plaster it became the thing that would make me feel the opposite to whatever shame is

and i just think it's so important for everyone to to think about the things that happened when they were young

and to understand the forces that invalidated them because if you don't understand them and if you can't make them conscious and

hold them out in front of you and examine them they will control your life subconsciously somewhere

and honestly i've got to be honest do i think i'll ever really overcome this unhealthy relationship i

had with money i don't think i'll ever truly overcome it completely because it is so deeply hard-wired into

me at a time in my life when i was so impressionable and when every emotion

just seemed to cut more and carve into me but that's not really my aim my aim

isn't to overcome it my aim is to become conscious of it and if i can become conscious of it it

has less impact over me and fortunately where i'm at in my life now i don't make those stupid dumb decisions all of the

time sometimes i make dumb decisions like i'm not gonna pretend i'm some [ __ ] like profit that you know lives their life

perfectly and always makes decisions that are in line with their values sometimes i do things to impress people

but it's like 99 less than i used to and that's because i'm holding out

my sort of psychological relationship with money in front of me and i'm able to look at it and i'm able

to question myself and interrogate my decisions against this known flaw that i have in my psychology steve

why are you trying to buy a rolls royce you don't really like rolls royces you don't know anything about them because you think oh yeah

because you think it's going to impress somebody because you think somewhere deep inside

of you that child that had nothing will feel more fulfilled if he has that range rover or

that rolls royce or that mansion and whenever i go to make these big

decisions now it's the first thing i think of so i

don't think i've overcome it but i've definitely been able to understand it and if you can understand

it if you can understand the thing that invalidated you and your kid that's as good as overcoming it and that

will help you stop seeking validation from it as an adult

and that that will change your life
