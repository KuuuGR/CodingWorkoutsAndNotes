Intro
and one of the thoughts that continually gets me to the gym and continually makes me show up and work hard
is and if you're good at it if you're great at it then you might just be great at everything but for me that really is the
meaning of life
on this week's podcast we're going to do something very different something i've never done before but something that
you've requested time and time again this week i posted online asking you to ask me any question
about me my life my business whatever you want to ask me and i promised that in return i would
give very brutally honest answers my team went through all of the questions that were submitted and they went through and picked ones that they
thought were most interesting they've written them in my diary here so i'm going to start from the top and answer these questions with the
objective of giving you the most valuable honest advice that i possibly can so
without further ado i'm stephen bartlett and this is the diver ceo i hope nobody's listening
but if you are then please keep this to yourself
okay so the first question is what is the most important lesson that this pandemic has taught you
What is the most important lesson this pandemic has tough or re confirmed for you?
or reconfirmed for you and for me that is um it relates back to a podcast
i did at the start of the year and it's that uncertainty is not predictable but it's preparable and i don't actually think
that's a word but here's what i mean what i know for sure and this relates to everybody is that your life
is of course going to be full of a lot of joy and amazing things and breathtaking moments and rapturous moments of
of ecstasy right but it's also going to be riddled with moments of unexpected uncertainty and
chaos joy is much easier to handle you just kind of let go and go with it right the good times
not a lot of action or thought required but uncertainty and chaos require a real rigid set of principles and
for me those principles over the last 12 months have become acceptance optimism and action and these
three principles have a real linear connection to the outcome you're seeking without acceptance when bad things happen
there's no optimism without optimism there's no action and without action
there's often no victory or at least victory is delayed and hard times are elongated so when bad news visits
whether that's being unexpectedly fired from your job or jumped by your partner or evicted by your landlord or losing a loved one in the case of a
pandemic you have to do everything you can to stick to these principles despite the intense cloud of natural emotions that
will try to convince you and me otherwise and you know like i do a lot of sort of introspective thinking
for a living and even i am not immune from letting emotion
get the best of me in times of intense chaos i like no matter how much i've read or written in my diary or how many podcasts
i've done even i fall victim especially in the short term to all of those emotions and sometimes
to the the instructions those emotions give you which will lead you to um
to pretty dire outcomes so you know you get dumped by your partner you immediately think revenge right you get fired by your boss you think
um you know i'm gonna sue them right i fall for those traps too and i don't think i don't necessarily think it's the aim of all humans should
be to try and avoid those emotions and that thinking because i think it's quite impossible but it's to be better at the response right to
shorten the time that those emotions sit with you and to be better in your reaction and i want to clarify that acceptance when i
talk about acceptance it doesn't mean being emotionless it can often mean the exact opposite you have to accept how you're feeling except
what's happened and importantly retire from trying to change the unchangeable or from wallowing in regret and you have
to do everything you can to get yourself to a place of optimism i see that as your responsibility people won't like me saying that right
people typically especially in hard times don't like to delegate responsibility to themselves so as hard as it can be you have to find
and create hope for yourself and have faith just like everything else has in your life that this too shall pass and then you have to use
that optimism to drive you into action which is for me the third principle that i've learned over the last 12 months if your
partner's dumped you it's time to dust yourself off and get yourself into the gym to fight back and i don't mean fight
backers in bomb their house i mean fight back in a mental capacity to stop stalking
their instagram to triple down on your friendships and your meaningful relationships to stand
tall and weather the unavoidable emotional storm and have faith and acceptance sit by your side the
opposite of these principles of course is like denial is pessimism and is in action
and these are the principles of a baby gazelle that's decided to fall asleep
with its toes dipped into a crocodile-infested waters this is a decision to lose twice and when i say
l right i mean loss and when unexpected chaos happens like this pandemic which smashes our businesses and destroys our
social lives and apparently steals a year from from our youth the first l we take is involuntary
[ __ ] happened and you didn't choose it totally out of your control i get that but the fateful decision to choose
denial pessimism and inaction as our response is a voluntary second l what you're
choosing to increase the chances that bad times will become even worse times you can make the choice
not to lose twice the first l wasn't your choice the second l well that's the byproduct of of how you
choose to respond acceptance optimism and action
and i guess the second lesson i've learned this year is a lesson in the importance of prioritization you know this advice
of which people often given i've often given of protecting your time and saving your time really feels somewhat
incomplete to me now because it's like the first half of the sentence you've got to then ask yourself saving time to do what saving time just
to spend more of it doing the wrong things saving time to spend more of it being more productive just so you can get more
work done i guess better advice is to prioritize better if you told 19 year old stephen bartlett
just to save more time he probably would have said no to a couple of things and then just spent that saved time
working alone in his office all week and all weekend and that advice would therefore lead him to a less joyful more depressive
existence and if you told 19 year old stephen bartlett to prioritize better the first question
that comes to mind is what are my priorities and my long-term priorities as i think is the case for
all of us are ultimately linked to the things that make our life meaningful which are friends the joy of work our
relationships the satisfaction of pursuing our goals the challenge you know achieving greater
freedom knowledge the pursuit of knowledge health and fitness and i guess i would have reviewed the allocation of my time
through that lens i would have saved time only on the things that aren't connected to my macro priorities and reinvested it in
better places and this year because we've you know been forced to realize what matters
in many cases um i guess now i'm not trying to save time just for
the sake of spending it more on optimizing my productivity
i realize that that's an incomplete sentence and really the most important thing is just to prioritize all of my time better
and allocate it to those things that ultimately will matter the most okay so the next question in my diary is
How do i maximise my earning potential
how do i maximize my earning potential let me tell you a little bit of a story based on a friend of mine and his
company my friend has a business which is listed on the stock
exchange in germany one of the very small stock exchanges in germany and having spoken to banks and from my
own knowledge of how the stock market and the public markets work him and me both know that right now his
business is worth 1 billion dollars because of the stock exchange he's on if he moves his business
to the new york stock exchange the banks and everybody knows that the valuation will be four billion dollars it's the
exact same company the exact same team the exact same products the exact same mission
everything's exactly the same but because he's on the wrong stock market because he's on the wrong stock exchange
the value is 25 of what it would be if he just took that same business the same people in the same products the
same skills the same experiences and just moved it to a different stock market and i i reflect on this analogy
as a wider broader sort of life analogy because if i look at my career decisions over the last i'd
say 10 years i remember working in one call center in plymouth in devon where i was getting paid about four pounds per hour
and for whatever reason i decided to move to a different call center with the exact same skills
the exact same experience and i got paid 10 times while i was getting paid at that call center and this is what i've
started to notice in my own life is i've had this particular set of skills whether it's social media storytelling marketing brands whatever you want to
call it for the last i don't know maybe six seven years and as i've moved into different rooms
and different markets and different companies and different industries i've noticed that that exact same set of
skills is valued completely differently and this made me reflect with that story of my friend's
business in mind that one of the questions you have to to ask yourself sometimes in life isn't just
you know how do i improve my skills but it's like how do i maximize the earning potential for my skills and where are my skills
going to give me the greatest reward let me give you another analogy just to just to
cement the point my ex-girlfriend my ex-ex-girlfriend is a flight attendant and she currently
flies for emirates right and emirates pay they pay okay right a lot of lifestyle perks there but they
pay okay she's told me that she'll get paid up to ten times more if she manages to
get a job flying on private jets because of tips and things like that the same set of skills
ten times the return for the same set of skills if she can move her skills to a different theoretical stock exchange if
you get what i'm saying and this is just like one of the the principles i've learned about life over the really over the last year um because
skills i was paid you know x amount for a couple of years ago i'm getting paid
10 20 30 40 50 times for the same set of skills just because i found a
market where those skills are more in demand they're higher valued and they're probably more rare
and so that's something i think we can all ponder which is asking yourself where your skills will reap the greatest return okay the
Do you have imposter syndrome?
next question is do you have imposter syndrome have you ever had it and can you relate and then there's a little question underneath which is and how do i shake
this off here's the thing whenever somebody does something that's outside of their zone of comfort and
that they don't have a ton of experience in doing we all feel the same thing right we all feel that sort of
low-key inadequacy or that slight fear but the reaction that everybody feels and the way that we label that feeling
is completely different i actually think it's how you label that feeling that determines how you perform in that
scenario so some people will say okay this is an exciting challenge i'm going to learn i'm going to throw myself
at it i'm going to use that energy of that i'm feeling those nerves or whatever it might be to focus some people will say oh my god
and they'll implode and they'll try and retreat back into their zone of comfort right and so the response to that the feeling
is human the response to it is optional if you go through your life avoiding situations that give you that
feeling of imposter syndrome then i would bet everything that i have that you aren't going to reach your full
potential i genuinely believe the feeling of imposter syndrome is both healthy natural and a sign that you're putting
yourself in a position where you're there's pressure which will make you grow and i've literally i can't think of a
moment in my life if you look at any sort of two-year period in my life where i didn't feel out of my depth
however that feeling of being out of my depth never meant that i retracted from the challenge it meant the exact opposite it meant that i attacked the
challenge i put more hours in i focused on it that reaction is ultimately the reason why you can hear my voice now it's the
reason i have this podcast i very very unfondly remember the first day ever where i tried to make a video down
the lens of a camera in the microphone and oh my [ __ ] god was that [ __ ] show
my friend tells me we should make a youtube video it's about something political so i sit in his house he turns the cameras on puts a microphone on me
and i sit there and try and get just two minutes of spoken word out down this camera of the lens and i sit there for seven
hours so much so that at the start of this two minute video it's light outside and it's sunny it's like the morning by the end of this two-minute video if
you were to watch on youtube it's dark outside and you can see stars it took me that long right that long because i was sat there feeling like an
imposter people aren't gonna give a [ __ ] what i think i'm an idiot i'm not sat there sweating and ultimately it was my decision not to
let that sort of knock me back and to swerve that being in that uncomfortable situation ever again
that's taken me to this place today where i'm doing this podcast and there's all these people that listen to it we've got this youtube channel and all of
these wonderful things and that is the defining thing it's not about avoiding imposter syndrome that's a very human thing
it's learning the art of embracing it quick one starting from the minute the lockdown is lifted we're gonna start
bringing in some of our subscribers to watch how this podcast is produced behind the scenes means you get to meet the guests meet
myself and see how we put all of this together if you want that to be you all you've got to do hit the subscribe button
okay so next question is how do you do things you don't want to do i've had i've had this crosstalk in my
How do you do things you don't want to do?
mind a lot lately and i'll tell you why because i've committed myself to working out in the gym downstairs
every single day and i have been going every single day for many many months now i think the
first time i started going gym consistently was actually march last year when all of this craziness was uh thrusted upon us
but some days as i've talked about this podcast i know people get tired of me talking about the gym but it's just a place where you learn so much about
yourself and discipline and and your body and your brain and all of that so i always refer back to it but some
days i just can't be bothered i can't be bothered to go i can't be bothered to train hard when
i'm there and um in many ways that's kind of like synonymous of life there's so many things in life that i just don't
want to do and one of the thoughts that continually gets me to the gym and continually makes
me show up and work hard is this principle i live by which is comfortable
and easy are like really short-term friends but they're long-term enemies and here's what i mean by that
comfort in the short term makes me feel warm and fuzzy but then it might lead me to being obese and having arthritis and
having high blood pressure and having a heart attack in the long term so like comfort and easy i just view so anything that's comfortable and easy
like super comfortable and is you know inherently avoiding hard work or discomfort i kind of view
that that decision or that thing with skepticism i think you're trying to [ __ ] me in the long term aren't you and i genuinely cognitively have that
thought process sometimes when my brain flutters and flirts with the idea of oh just skip it steve you know
you don't really want to do that just you know get an early night and swerve that thing um i think that's going to stab me in the
back one day in 12 months time or 10 years time that decision to choose
comfortable and easy as my friends well they're going to become enemies and they're actually not on my side
if you're looking for growth my general principle is to choose the challenge i'm not
saying choose the thing that you [ __ ] hate i'm not saying choose the toxic thing that's going to destroy your mental health i'm saying if you're looking for growth
and you're looking to achieve the future that you you know you envisage in your mind your ambitions then you should choose the challenge and
and that's the thing that i continually come back to every time steve you know it hits 6 30 and i know i've got to go to go to the
gym in half an hour and i'm manically busy and everything in my head is saying make an excuse
no one will know go tomorrow just tell yourself you'll go tomorrow you'll do it another time procrastinate or when i get to the gym
and i don't really want to show up and i don't want to work hard the same little thoughts whisper in my brain but then i think maybe that's the enemy
is that has have those thoughts really got my long-term ambitions and my values in mind
they nearly always haven't and that goes back to the podcast i did with neil where he says that you know when we try
and procrastinate or we convince ourselves to do the things we don't want to do it's because of some kind of psychological discomfort because i know
that these weights are heavy and i know that it's uncomfortable and i know that i'm tired and those are if you are able to overcome
those moments where it's easier to quit those are your growth moments those are in fact the most valuable moments and this again comes to
another point which i always think which is the moments where i want to quit right the days that are the hardest to get
myself up and going are probably by definition the most valuable moments to overcome
because that's probably again thinking logically where most people decide to stop
so you know that's where the greatest returns are and i it sounds like fluffy [ __ ] in hindsight no i think
this i think i think that in the moment i think it before i go to the gym i think yeah this is this is the day when most
people wouldn't go you know after the week you've had right so hopefully that helps and
the conclusive point here is like you're connecting yourself to who you want to be in those moments you're reminding
yourself of the person you want to become and this you know i read this on twitter i think nine months ago but it stayed with me
ever since which is how would the person you want to become behave right now and if you ask yourself in those moments
how would the person i want to become behave right now what are the decisions the person i want to be
would be making um that's usually a good way to decide what the best answer is
right hope that helps okay so the next question is a very deep question it's what is the meaning
What is the meaning of life?
of life very good question something i've actually pondered a little bit over the last over the last year or so as i've i've
got more into elon musk's work and space and his motivations for wanting to
to understand meaning he actually says that when he was really really young he started pondering the meaning of life
and actually made him depressed and it wasn't until he read hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy that he found some meaning um and optimism but
to to answer that question myself i would say the meaning of life is to
create and live a meaningful life i know that sounds like a bit of a cop-out right but
in what you consider meaningful is totally subjective and nobody can tell you what that is or what it isn't
but i think you can spot it when you get that feeling inside yourself that your efforts are resulting
in progress or outcomes that feel deeply worthwhile and fulfilling to you
in any facet of your life whether it's raising your dog or whether it's your relationships or your work or whatever
it might be and some people find that sort of connection and meaning in building their businesses
in writing in hobbies or you know training their body through exercise or raising kids or practicing their
religion one of the most important things i've learned on this podcast from interviewing guests and asking them
about the toughest moments in their lives specifically guests that suffered with depression i remember we had dan murray
on the podcast who had lost his father and talked about how it wasn't until he did ayahuasca and saw
that the world was interconnected that he refound his meaning and we also had ben williams on the podcast who said he was suicidal and
considering taking his own life until he saw an advert to be a military commando and
went off on that journey to pursue his his intrinsic career ambition of becoming a commando
that he found meaning in his life and stability and also from writing my book there are some just crazy
mind-bending studies that i read about in the preparation for my book that totally changed my my thought
process on this one of them right is studying johanna hari's work and the work he's done to understand the
true causes of depression and anxiety and his work continually points to the fact that depression and these
depressive feelings and this sort of lack of orientation in life comes from people who have had something happen to
them often who have lost a sense of meaning through trauma in their life not what's wrong with them
not because of some sort of chemical imbalance in their brain the other really sort of example that i just can't shake that's in my book as
well is this study they call rat park very very simple they took a group of rats they put them
in cages and they took all meaning from their life literally just a white cage on their own and they gave them a choice do you want
to drink heroin water or do you want to drink normal water the rats that are stuck in a white cage
alone become drug addicts right then they have rat park which is this
rat utopia where there's you know female and male rats there's a little running machine where you can
exercise there's food there's a space to to roam around and to explore there's toys for stimulation and those
rats don't become drug addicts when they're offered either heroin or normal water they avoid the heroin
if you zoom out a little bit and apply the same thinking to humans the science says that over the last two
years the life expectancy had dropped between i think it's 2018 and 2019 because of opioid related deaths because
people are getting addicted to opioids and that's resulting in their death and and again that is because we have an
epidemic of meaninglessness of purposelessness um that's what my podcast has
taught me and that's what um that's what my research in my book has taught me as well commonly prescribed antidepressants do
work for some people i think it's important to to sort of caveat my points with that but adding additional meaning
and connection to your life does seem to be one of the most powerful antidotes for those feeling lost
depressed and unhappy and lacking that orientation and just to relate it to what we're going through now with this pandemic
you know a lot of my friends have been calling me and telling me that they're feeling down right they can't particularly describe
what exactly is causing them to feel down but over the last three months in particular as the uk has gone into this
i think third lockdown i've really grown concerned about some of my friends and the advice that i
continually give them centers around the point i've just made which is to find things that will give them meaning life before
pre-lockdown gave you meaning you you wake up in the morning you go to the office you've got colleagues and friends and then you
you know you go to the the club you go to what's your favorite football team player you go and see your mum and your dad your grandparents
life was full of meaning before now it's been pulled from you so now it becomes your responsibility if
you want to you know maintain those good feelings to go and get that meaning right to go and create that meaning in
your life you can't assume that it's just going to show up like it used to so we and this goes back to one of my points which is
when you really have to fight back you have to go and get it and you know i'll give you an example that relates to me personally
the weekends right so my team and me we work you know in this building through the week the weekends come around i have [ __ ]
nothing to do i'm a single guy i have nothing to do it's me and my dog right and he's not
a barrel of laughs to be honest he's very simple guy so he doesn't do an awful lot and so what
i've started to do on the weekends is to really take time to pursue some of my hobbies which i would never normally do i've
started to dj all the time i'm now learning to dj i do a dj lesson every single weekend via zoom
i'm reading books that i used to love reading philosophy books and i'm doing this actually not because i want to but
because i know i have to keep my life full of like intrinsic passions and meaning especially at a
time when so much of that has been robbed by this pandemic so that's the long way around the houses but for me that really is the meaning of life
to create a meaningful life and um as i say in these times it's more important than ever that you fight for that meaning
What do you miss about being poor that you'll never get back?
okay so the next question is a really really great question which is what is something you miss about being
poor that you think you'll never get back the stoic people used to talk about this
concept of hedonistic adaptation and the hedonistic treadmill and i'll give you an example that's really easy to
understand i remember at 23 years old when i took my first flight to thai i think it was 20 21 years old
to thailand with my business partner dom and i remember getting on that plane and just like because because i'd never really been on a plane before other than
when i was a baby coming over from africa i remember like being so in awe of the
fact that we were on this like metal ship that was flying across the ocean and they were like giving me snacks and free water and do i want to
coke and i'm sat there in the economy section just like oh my god right
totally like full of like joy and appreciation for everything and the principles of like hedonistic
adaptations say that once you've been exposed to a certain level of joy or a certain level of like i don't know gluttony or like you know
um material possessions your satisfaction starts to decay over time
and obviously as i got you know more and more money and i got on flights every week and then eventually i upgraded to business class and then like first class
and you know even got myself on a private jet a couple of times your appreciation for the small things
wanes the stoic people would take the good things out of their life as a practice just so that they would
appreciate them again and i think that's one of the things that i definitely miss i've got nice things all the time and
that is a blessing and a curse imagine some rich guy talking about he's sick of nice things but there's
there's truth to that like you you lose appreciation for for things that used to mean so much to you and when you look at
hedonistic adaptation in the hedonistic treadmill you now require even more to give you that same level of
thrill and joy and satisfaction that's a really sad thing it's kind of an unavoidable thing to some degree
but with all things in life you can really make a conscious effort to be grateful and to take moments not to let life pass
you by all these wonderful things pass you by so the other point is you know there's that phrase ignorance is bliss and it
totally applies to this question as well when i was 18 years old and i thought the meaning and
point of life was to buy fast cars and to have a million quid in the bank account and to pursue those kinds of things there
was some bliss to that i thought i had it figured out i thought i understood that the pursuit of greater
happiness was just more stuff more money and that was quite blissful i didn't have it now
at 18 i didn't have it so i thought okay that creates real meaning in my life all i have to do is get more money and
then my life will be more meaningful and you know full of joy and then upon getting the money i realize that that's
not the case and i i remember watching an interview by the founder of
spotify danielec where he says the exact same thing he's an insecure kid growing
up bit of a geek and then he gets all this money not from spotify but from the business before and he has this deep existential crisis
where he's like oh my god this wasn't it and he had to then go on the journey of
finding out exactly what mattered to him and i i'm still on that journey like i still this is why i talk so much about
meaning and purpose in this podcast because i'm still figuring out like where i should be prioritizing my time in order
to reap the greatest returns as it relates to fulfillment and i i think i didn't think about those things when i was 18 and i was broke
but getting what you aim for is the best way to find out if it's actually what you wanted
and i was this young kid chasing material things and and probably passion mistaking it for
happiness as i got closer to it it moved off into the distance like a like a mirage or something or a rainbow
we all know that guy who like you know has a two bedroom house um in a small area he's married to his
wife one kid two kids um looks forward to you know going to the pub of the weekends and supporting
his favorite team those individuals who live the most simple lives and who are happier with less
to me from my experience generally seem to be much more fulfilled than my friends that are successful
billionaires and my friends that are billionaires but also intellectuals and sort of like
low-key philosophers are the most [ __ ] right because they really have got pretty existential and ask
themselves what is the purpose of life that's what i mean by ignorance is bliss and my third point in answer to this
question relates to challenge when i was 18 years old starting out in business living in moss side in manchester
i had absolutely nothing i just dropped out of university and i'm basically stood at the bottom of this big
ambitious mountain that i've told myself i'm gonna climb and i've told myself i'm gonna accomplish
and i'm looking up at it excited terrified um but hopeful and yeah excited that's
that's the key feeling and then you climb the mountain right the mountain for me was like financial freedom it was
accomplishment maybe for my ego it was like recognition to some degree i have all of those things now
and so when you get to this point where you've accomplished many of your goals you have
to make a very conscious active effort to create new even bigger goals goals
that will match the same level of excitement and challenge that you had when you're 18 and it's not
easy because you don't become financially free twice unless you lose it all right so my goals have to be way bigger
to give me that same level of like hunger and uh grit and you know
determination that i need um to to to to stay stabilized and to be to be
happy and i guess it's a crazy thing to say but to some degree i miss like not being at the bottom i
miss not having those massive this just mount everest in front of me and this is what i've seen in you know
many of my friends who are entrepreneurs and even some of my idols is when they get to that point when when elon sold paypal or when
you know bill gates sold microsoft they then go and take on some of these tremendous you know philanthropic
challenges it's no surprise that every billionaire becomes this crazy massive philanthropist and tries to take on
some of the world's most existential problems right it's no surprise that elon is doing you know trying to save the planet and take us to a new one
because he will not be able to find a sense of fulfillment and happiness in doing another paypal he just won't
find it and in many respects this is why i think people who are tremendously ambitious have a bit of a curse i've spoken to a
lot of my friends that run businesses you are obsessive about progress and challenge and ambition and reaching the next milestone and i think
a lot of them would actually if they could just press a button and trade their life for a much simpler
life someone who doesn't wake up every single day and check their whatsapp for 30 different messages about their business on fire in
five different countries if they could press a button and live a simple life and be content in that life i think most
of them probably would many of them would if they wouldn't maybe they're twisted enough not to not to realize that the meaning of life is
to be happy so if i gave them a happiness button maybe some of the psychopaths would still opt for their current life
i've got one particular friend in mind who i won't name who sat me down about two years ago and
he's very very successful he's probably a billionaire by now and he confided in me that he wished his life
could be simpler he wished he didn't have the level of ambition he had he he told me this one story about going
around to someone's house and they're a very very normal family with not very much at all and they just sat there drinking tea and he said
i was sat there thinking i wish this was my life this is a billionaire with more sports cars than i've ever
seen in my entire life in one driveway wishing he had a simpler life but realizing that he is
infected with this virus which many of us have the ambitious the most ambitious amongst
us which stops you from being happy with out pursuit
and without climbing that mountain breaking news i have a new favorite
flavor of huel about a month and a half ago they sent me in the post
this white bottle with this sort of sharpie red pen on it that said top secret and i took it out i sipped it
probably shouldn't have because if people send you things in the post like that you probably shouldn't drink it as your first reaction you should confirm that they sent it but
i took it out i drank it and it tasted amazing and now i'm i'm
very happy to announce that my new favorite flavor of the hule ready to drink
slow release carbs 20 grams of protein vitamins minerals 27 essential vitamins 7 grams of fiber per bottle is banana
which has just gone live on cure and my friends know that i'm a massive hulu again so they've been messaging me
all this week saying steve how good is it is it good and i've been telling them this is my new favorite flavor which i think says a lot so barry is now number two
and the new banana flavor ready to drink huel is my number one so yeah give it a taste
it kind of tastes like banana milkshake but um banana milkshake isn't usually as nutritionally complete so that's win
win win try it fiverr fiverr.com i've talked about this a lot in this podcast and um i just wanted to give you
a bit of an update i've really really got into using fiverr over the last couple of weeks and i think
if i was to estimate i've now had six different tasks completed on fiverr in the last
four weeks i've had two website builds i've had two decks made from designers that are
What is the most valuable skill you've learnt and how does that serve you now?
all around the world one is in venezuela the other one is in iceland i've had one logo made and one
video made and to be honest i just wish i knew about fiverr sooner in my career because i think i would have been able to
accomplish more in a much more cost-effective way okay the next question i have here is what is
the most valuable skill you've learned and how does that serve you now um my mind bounced around to a few different things when i read that
question but it came back to this this this one answer which kind of summarizes all the other little points which is
sales and i genuinely believe sales however you kind of want to define that
is the single most important skill in the world i don't mean like selling rolexes out your coat or selling double glazing to a grandmother
on the phone i mean the art of being able to persuade other people to take an action right and this is a skill that you will deploy in
a nightclub when you meet someone you fancy with your teams when you're trying to build businesses with investors
every time you communicate in some respect if you're trying to achieve a certain outcome you are a salesman or
woman and the art of being a good salesperson is broken down into a bunch of different factors there's an understanding of you know having the
self-awareness to understand how you're coming across having the awareness to understand what the person
you're speaking to is after it's how you carry yourself it's your body language it's the way you speak
it's the energy you bring when you're talking it's all of these small things which are very hard to to train into somebody but
for without shadow of a doubt sales is the most important thing because it's the skill that i use every day the
most right and i want to answer the question like how did i learn how to sell things i've raised investment maybe 20 times maybe
more probably more if you consider some of the road shows i did when we took our company public one of the most important experiences i
had in my whole life was i started working in a call center in plymouth when i was 16 years old selling double glazing at
everest call center and then i did that job until i was about 18 and then moved to manchester dropped out of university and then my
next 10 to 12 jobs were all in call centers whether it's because of my voice
or because um because of my skills with selling i was just so good at that job and i genuinely believe that that tele
sales experience i've had and i genuinely would work in a telesales call center for three months make so much on the
bonuses that i'd quit this is why i've had 12 teddy sales jobs i'd quit i'd spend the next two months trying to build my
business i'd then go back to another call center make huge bonuses then i'd quit and i'd keep doing that
but i genuinely believe that that experience working in call centers where you're honing this particular
skill which is calling someone usually completely cold out of the blue and having to persuade them in less than a
minute to give you a chance or to buy immediately but to give you a chance to sell them something that they didn't need
we all [ __ ] hate tele sales people including me i just hang up immediately these days because i'm so time poor but if you got a chance to do one job in
order to improve your sales skills i would highly highly recommend you do either that or even better which i did again when i
was in plymouth door-to-door sales because that introduces sort of body language and other sort of more
physical communication skills which uh which are even more relevant to the world we live in today so
yeah sales is definitely the most important thing and i often say to people when they're when they tell me that they've got an
offer to take one of two jobs i'll often always prefer the sales role
especially if they're young and they need to develop in that area because i think it will yield the greatest returns over the long
term i think getting good at selling stuff when you're young will yield tremendous returns as a skill as you get older and
as i said at the start sales applies to everything everything
and if you're good at it if you're great at it then you might just be great at everything
or at least be able to convince people you are okay so the next question is what is my greatest weakness and when i
What is your greatest weakness?
first read this question um a bunch of different things came to mind in different sort of parts and areas of my life so
i'm just gonna share as many of them with you as i possibly can the first thing that comes to mind is i'm really bad at prioritizing
against the things that really matter to me and i know that will matter long term i've talked about this a lot in this
podcast i don't call my parents enough i don't see my family enough i probably don't give enough time in
person to like meaningful friendships and connections and those kinds of things and i know i'm completely totally convinced that those
things are really really important it's not that i don't understand the importance of them it's that like my work priorities always seem to be
just one you know one step higher on the to-do list my work has urgency to it there's no
urgency with calling my mom right and that's kind of one of the things i know is a weakness in myself that i that i continue to strive to
to be better at is trying to prioritize things that aren't urgent
but in the long term are really really important the next thing is in relationships i'm like really
self-centered i i just want to do what i want to do and i like i am generally like really unwilling to
compromise and that's an awful thing because relationships are all about compromise apparently so i've been told many times
um but i know it's a weakness of mine i am kind of like i kind of live the world in my own head and if i want to just get up
and go and dj or walk down the street or go in my room and just look at my laptop and watch youtube videos doing that is
quite hard when you're in a relationship and you've got someone else to consider you have to consider what they want and you know the things that they want to do
that day and and also in relationships generally i don't want to do much because nine to five like
throughout the week my brain is [ __ ] chaos so on the weekend i'm not really all up for doing much you know that's my down time
and that's become a real weakness of mine and it's made forming romantic relationships harder because on the weekend i don't want to get out of
bed and if i do i just want to do some i just want to do nothing or something very very simple but the
problem i have there is through monday to friday i've spent all my time on my work so saturday and sunday by definition like
logically have to be the time that i commit to you as my partner so this is why i i continually struggle in
relationships because monday to friday it's not about you and on the weekend it's about me it's
about me and my down time watching manchester united play and i have to i have to learn to compromise i'm sure a lot of people can
relate to that the last thing would be because i'm so mentally bombarded with a billion things
i have to do at all times over the years the one thing that i've definitely noticed in myself is i get
more and more arguably rude
and to the point which is like when at the start of my career i was very i had more time and there were less things like less tabs open in my brain
so i could take more time about how i respond to things and i could be a little bit more fluffy and soft and whatever but when
you have tons of urgent priorities your brain is so funny i was i was talking to a friend
about this this morning in fact and i was just giving some feedback to one of the teams i'm working with
at another company because the ceo had basically got in touch and requested that all comms become much
more streamlined because when we when the team were using extra words he basically to some degree gets you
know gets a little bit frustrated with that because we're trying to move fast as an organization and i totally related to that i noticed
myself getting annoyed when anything takes longer than it should and this is something that's really changed like totally changed in the last couple
of years so i guess the thing that i have to be aware of is that even in the situations where i'm just desperately trying to save time
is that i don't compromise on being a decent human being and i can't explain to you how hard this
is because we tend to have a philosophy for how we act and how we behave and that philosophy sits deep within us and
it whether it's a landlord showing me around a new apartment or a new office or whether it's an email or whether it's a phone call
the philosophy tends to be the same right and you it's hard to switch between different philosophies so i tend to treat very personal things
sometimes in my personal life whether it's a landlord showing me around an office with the same rapid urgency
or my mum having a conversation with me with the same rapid urgency that i might treat business things and i need to get
better at like switching between the context and behaving differently in each scenario and realizing that in some scenarios
the saving of the time is not more beneficial than just remaining a decent person and like engaging in the situation
it's hard and i say it's hard not just because of my own experiences but i've seen pretty much pretty much
i'd say over 70 of the highly successful people i know become so incredibly impatient that it
almost verges on looking like rudeness like they don't care about you um and like they are
not present when you're with them now this is a really hard point to explain but i think people who are incredibly busy will understand this
over the last couple of years i've noticed that i've got incredibly impatient with um any request i get and it's something
i've noticed not just in myself but in some of my friends who run very very big really really sort of ambitious global
businesses who are constantly bombarded with stuff they are some of the most like anti-social slightly rude people i've
met you just can't get 10 seconds of their attention and like just to give you context of what's going on in my head now
right now as i'm making this podcast i know that i'm missing this phone call with this pr firm i know that i've got this major ipo
coming up with this one company i know i've got this board meeting coming up with this company i know i've got this ipo coming up got this other
conversation about joining this board and this other ip coming up and i've got all these other personal things going on in my life and this you know i've got to record this podcast my
brain has just got all these tabs open so when my pa walks up to me and she goes hi steve how's your day going
you know shall i buy pablo some dog food it just it's just it's almost the only way i can describe it is the question is like an
irritant um and what you what i've got what learnt over the years is like
i have to understand that people don't understand and i have to try and respond on that
basis which sometimes especially when i'm like really tired can be a challenge um something i've
really tried hard to work on but i'm still like really not that great at is remembering to be like gracious and just
a decent person irrespective of what's going on in my head and treating people and being super polite and trying to be my best self
every single day in every interaction you know i i talked on this podcast once upon a time about the day i got on
a plane i sat in business class and i look up and it's that guy from man versus food and we were running at the time one of
the biggest food publishers in the world love food and so i messaged the love food team there was about 150 people that got this
message in the social chain chat at the time they said oh my god that guy from um man vs food is on the plane
and they all said okay go up to him and ask him this like famous social chain question we have which is what's your favorite sandwich long story short when you join social
channel you get asked the question what's your favorite sandwich so i jump up and i walk over to his seat in business class and i say
hey uh um i got quite boom shuts me down not right now like shouts in my face so i like slowly
tiptoe back to my seat in business class i'm like slouched down and then i have to message 150 people
saying oh by the way that guy we all really like is an [ __ ] um and he would have had no idea that he
was speaking to somebody who ran at the time the biggest food publisher in the world and had
hundreds of employees and at some you know some point in the future might have wanted to do some business with him or work with him but now thinks he's a
total [ __ ] and this for me that moment i'll always remember of as teaching me how important every
interaction is even the ones that don't seem that important um and i try and bear that in mind if
you've ever come and watched me speak anywhere in the world which i'm sure a lot of you have because i was a bit of a speaking hoe over the last couple of
years then you would have known that i never ever would leave a venue before everybody's got a chance to like
take a photo or meet me or ask me a question i would be the last one to leave my own talks um because i that's the way that i would
want someone to treat me someone that i followed and admired that's how i would want them to treat me and i'm scared of being an [ __ ]
um yeah and it's much easier to be an [ __ ] when you're
when you've achieved some level of success right powerful people find it the easiest to be an [ __ ]
they can therefore also probably do the most damage by being an [ __ ] but also get away with it a lot of the time
i believe in being a good person as much as i possibly can be and i'm like clearly imperfect in many many ways and i still
struggle with this but i'm doing my very best to be a good person um and to be kind and to you know
to never forget who i am and where i come from okay so the next question is i'm scared to post my business
I'm scared to post my business or myself online at risk of humiliation or failure
online at the risk of failure or humiliation do you have any advice this is a very
interesting thing that i don't think people talk about enough especially when they're starting out in business which is how do you overcome
the sort of public transition from just being steve to now being this entrepreneur who's running this business and raising money
and giving people advice and has has a podcast how do you like square that with especially in your friendships and your
personal circles with the person that they they knew first right and when we
started the business when we started social chain my business partner dom who's come on this podcast to talk about it was ridiculed by his friends privately
like you know those kind of jokes that people do where it's like a joke but it's also not a joke so he would post on his facebook page
saying we've just started social chain just about this business it's going really well or whatever he'd say and like five or ten of his best friends
in the world from his hometown would jump on there with these kind of snide jokey like patronizing
bantery comments uh but they were like inherently mean comments and i remember back in the day
continually jumping into his comment section and trying to defend him and i'd get some of my other friends to jump in there and just be a bit nicer
he was posting his achievements and being like ridiculed with like not funny kind of funny banter and for
me as i reflect on what that actually was and the psychology behind his friends and knowing his friendship group back
home i'll be completely honest i think his friends saw him changing and somewhat didn't like who he was
becoming because his success kind of alienated them and nobody this is just a principle of
psychology that i've actually written a little bit about in my book people are most envious of people
who they can relate to so if you're you know colleague at work or your friend or someone your age is achieving
huge amounts of success and they look like you and went to the same school and came from where you come from that
inadvertently shines a mirror on you it means you've got no excuse and that your you know
success or lack thereof is probably a consequence of your own actions and as humans we just don't like that thought
and so dom's my business partner dom's social circle back home many of them not all of them there was one or two key
exceptions we're trying to rein him in and saying you know you're one of us stay here don't become something that we
can't resonate with and if you find yourself in the scenario that dom did you basically have a really
simple choice to make it feels complicated and it feels like a bit of a minefield but it's not
the central question and the most important question you have to ask yourself is who do i want to be and what makes me
happy whether and this is a point you can extrapolate to any sort of area of your life even those outside of your career
who do i want to be and what makes me happy and decide what that is and pursue that thing anybody that you
lose in the pursuit of your happiness is probably not someone you needed or wanted in your life anyway they're
probably not someone that had your best interests which by definition are you being happy at heart
they're probably someone who was riddled with a little bit of jealousy who didn't want you to become everything you could become so that's the framework
in which you make your decision which is who do i want to be and what makes me happy pursue that and be open to losing people
who no longer resonate with you pursuing your happiness along the way and i distinctly remember
going through this myself which is facing ridicule and banter and little snide comments behind the scenes i remember a
day where i posted something on facebook like one of my quotes whatever it was or some of my content on my daily vlog and
a friend of a friend had made some snide little comment about like who the [ __ ] does steve think he is the friend had told me and it's those
moments where you can make that decision to like fall back in light line and conform and to avoid criticism
had i can you imagine my life if i'd done that if i'd let a couple of comments stop me from pursuing my my career and
producing all this content which gives me so much intrinsic joy and fulfillment can you imagine if i let the fear of a
few comments hold me back from my potential and the things that make me happy i'm so glad i didn't and in that
particular case where that guy was ridiculing me behind my back that same person four years
later um when he went through some troubles in his life and some mental health issues reached out to me
because he was in love with my podcast now and uh met me in a sushi bar in london and
just sat there and asked me advice because of something i'd said on the podcast that he initially ridiculed
and that kind of shows that that teaches me a lesson that you know even some of the people that ridicule you at the start you've kind of got to forgive whatever
it is in their nature that's making them try and hold you back but you've also got to understand that
it's not a you problem it's not your responsibility to control what people think of you in their head or the image that they've created of you in
their mind that's not your responsibility your central responsibility as a human being is to pursue
your happiness your truth and the things that give you the most intrinsic joy that's your responsibility and one of
the things i've come to learn about success generally in life is that it's the small seemingly invisible seemingly
insignificant decisions piling up over time that have the greatest impact on you it's not our big life choices it's the
small ones the ones that are easiest to do or not to do and it's the same with bending under
public pressure or criticism it's easy if you see a friend of a friend slagging you off just to stop doing that thing
if you allow these small seemingly insignificant comments just nudge you just one day at a time away
from the person you want to be and the person you want to become can you imagine how far you're going to be from that person in 10 years time

Transcription:

Intro
one of the reasons i step back from social media was because i if something can manifest so physically that you're having a [ __ ]
seizure then you probably need to take this more seriously and that was you know like that was that was tough
and that for me is my happiness
grace beverly ceo founder of two multi-million dollar companies one's a fashion empire that's focused on
sustainability and one's a fitness empire comprising a mobile app a supplements business and gym equipment
she did all of that while studying and graduating from oxford university while growing her online channels to millions and millions
of followers while writing a book and while dealing with all of the things that every other gen z person has to deal with at the age
of 23 23 and on the surface it's easy to understand while looking in someone might love to have
grace's life but as you start to peel back the layers as we do in this conversation you begin to understand her obsessive attention to detail the
weight of her workload and the personal cost of her accomplishments and you see the impact that those things have had on
all parts of her life and it makes you reconsider despite all of this
she's persisted she stayed true to her values she's doubled down on the things she loves the most and she's cut out some of the things
that no longer serve her she's learned she's learned lessons that most of us would take a lifetime to learn
and she's 23. it blows my mind without further ado i'm stephen bartlett
and this is the driver ceo i hope nobody's listening but if you are then please keep this yourself
grace i started my business at 18 years old as well you um you faced a different set of
challenges not only have you started your business at an incredibly young age or at least you got into business at an incredibly young age you face a set of
challenges that are even alien to me in the sense that you are a woman in business um you are taking on various industries
that don't want to be taken on and that really are sort of incumbent monopolies in the space of fast fashion and fitness and those
things i guess my first question is why did you choose business and what gave you the
How did you have the confidence to pursue such an uncertain career
what gave you the confidence to pursue a career that's filled with so much uncertainty at such a
young age i think i think people often assume that the first part of it always
has to be a kind of i'm going to start this i'm going to do this and i think that mine absolutely wasn't that at all and i
think that that's what often makes me kind of question you know the amount of things that have had to fall into place for this to
happen and of course you know there's hard work in that but there's also so many other things that have had to go right um so for me you know as i kind of said
when i was 18 and working doing an internship at ibm that's kind of when i started and
i just started doing some i essentially started monetizing something that should be monetized so it's content i was giving away
for free and then i was going to do lots more of that and so i decided to monetize it via an ebook um and then you know the
next year i did more of that and then that's you know then it started picking up momentum i started doing different products and i think that
that's i guess often not seen in the way that business is represented it's kind of seen as like a
eureka moment then you go and do it then you put it into action then you fail once or twice and then you get it
and that it was far more gradual than that and i think that probably over the past you know so it's
probably been so it's been five years since that moment i'd say four years since the business it's ready that it is
now has um i guess was founded um and in that time probably the first two
years were incredibly gradual very much a kind of residual extra
income um rather than kind of this big like these are my goals
this is gonna happen within this time um so i guess in that it's been a
gradual process i think the confidence has gathered through that and a lot of the time i
haven't been confident enough to do that but have i guess just done it anyway so
you know when i was when i did kind of my second set of ebooks which was in my first year at university
that was literally because my student loan didn't come through like that was that was the only reason so as in i don't think it was necessarily a
confidence thing i think it was more okay like what are we gonna do in that situation um and then putting that together and
then being able to you know leverage a platform to be able to monetize that so and then from then
onwards obviously it's been very mindful it's been very kind of strategic
and that's how it's happened but i guess i guess the answer is that the confidence hasn't always been there and it hasn't always been a kind of i'm
going to take on this industry sure starting tala that that was um but but the rest of it
a lot of it has been gradual a lot of it has been this kind of more just a cumulative
making one decision at a time um which is i guess what i kind of try and
show as well so that people can know that it doesn't always need to be this one big decision and this one big business that's going
to be the biggest business in the world it can just be you know something you're just doing in that moment
the world has changed recently over the last 12 months because of the pandemic a lot of people have lost their jobs and so freelance websites and entrepreneurship
has now become more in focus as people are trying to find ways to give themselves a little bit more stability in their income
and when i speak to my friends that are you know your age 23 years old right 24 next week a week after sorry um or
who are younger 18 19 or even older um everybody seems to have a business idea yeah and i'm sure you're
bombarded with dms like this right everyone has a business idea um there seems to be this
barrier between the idea and taking the first step like making uh the
instagram page and is the the barrier between that is it confidence in your view what is it i think
it's probably specific to the situation the person the circumstance so
you know i was when i was at university if you know i think that there was
something that came together to make me do that but i was also at university in a place and in a time that i could
take i guess a a risky decision in terms of how i spend my time in terms of what i'm putting together i wasn't
i guess i wasn't doing a part-time job at the time that i could have put into that and so you know part of it is
circumstance in the way that people a lot of people don't necessarily have the
the backing to put behind it or it might be the the time they can put into it you know lots of people are
working three jobs just to make ends meet and therefore you know you might have an idea but actually being able to sacrifice the
time spent doing that isn't an option and i think but then i think a lot of the time as well i think it can be
confidence out of that circumstance it can be um or outside of that circumstance it can be you know
should i be doing this why should i be doing this and i think that a lot of the ideas that i've had you
know i'm sure you'll have the same like there'll be ideas that you have kind of the whole time and it's choosing the right ones and it's
choosing and it's being able to test it i think i'm sure if i tested out my first i guess what has turned into shreddy now
if i tested that out um you know even more gradually or if it hadn't worked or whatever
i don't know how tenacious i would have been in terms of actually making that happen and as i say it's been like an accumulation of that confidence and
actually testing things realizing their work and then replicating that so i think
i mean i think we can't necessarily blanket apply it to everyone and be like it's because of this it's because of this but i think that you know probably
the biggest the biggest factors will be circumstance confidence um and yeah i guess there are so many
things that can stop you but there are also so many things that can enable you to say okay well this is this is this i'm gonna i'm
gonna make it happen or i'm gonna take that leap or i'm gonna at least do the background work we'll do a survey to see if my product would be liked or
whatever it might be i think as well if people looking at you or myself that have achieved things in
business will see this very polished product right and they'll think well i'm so far from that so i'm i'm so far from being
capable of what that person has achieved but as you've described that which i think is so powerful and important for you it was
taking one step up a very very thousand stair staircase at a time and and as you say when we look at you
now on step 934 we think oh my god like you know you must you probably get this comment a lot right she's like you must be so proud of
yourself yeah which is like well it's been one step at a time so yeah you know and i think you can be proud of the steps along the way
but i also think that i look back at some not necessarily some products but you know some branding some
content some all of that and i look at it and i'm like it was crap like that is awful like as in i would
just scroll right past that or i wouldn't you know and of course things have changed people's like tastes have changed and
all of that that kind of goes into branding and product and all of that but there was something you know i've sold everything from
you know like t-shirts to notebooks to like whatever it would be it's not what the everything that's
accumulated now is the good things that have then been replicated it's not everything gets kind of replicated and
then you know you see all of the end products there have been some things that never ended up as an end product
because they were so [ __ ] in the first place that they were never you know they didn't deserve that extra time on them so i think you're completely right there
is this kind of and i i think it's also perpetuated by you know unknowingly often by people
like ourselves so you know like i i think i look at the stuff i share and i look at it and my god i'm so much more likely to share if
it's this or you know if this product worked out well and and subconsciously because there was an
end of that journey we don't necessarily say like oh this was the thing that actually went really wrong because you know it's embarrassing like
you don't want to share that you don't or you don't kind of think too because you don't think of the kind of like pride in the journey that's got to that
point um and so it i guess it all does you know you will just see the the good
things or you might see the bad things that are positioned in an inspirational way but it's still curated
but it's still what i guess is want to be seen and to
to my other point about being uh a woman in business that comes with a whole unique set of challenges you know i've heard you talk
about being underestimated not taken seriously before speak to me about some of those challenges that i wouldn't even
you know know about so i think first i always also think it is important to
preface this with the fact that yes i'm a woman in business i'm also white able-bodied i was privately educated i went dogs but
a kind of huge list of things that need to be
i guess contextualized which i've always thought is important and i think that i think that
it's you know i won't face half the challenges that a black woman would face in the same
position i think the challenges i do face are you know they are
kind of often and they have to be they have to be worked um through i guess and and that's been you
know a journey there have been you know people who have wanted to work for the businesses
who clearly won't accept the fact that you know this i'm not the face of it like i am
acting ceo and you know i do do x y and z and there have also been you know it's
been the same with partnerships it's been the same with you know i think people people have a certain perception that's definitely
warped and increased and perpetuated by online presence and the fact that i don't just
share my work and um and i think that you know it does come down to it does
come down to these preconceptions and i know as well since i've started realizing this i have preconceptions as well you know we'll
say like it's about a woman who's high up who you hear about and you're like oh god
they're doing really well like why don't i have that and i think you know i often think like oh well you know apparently they're really hard to
work with or like they're like whatever and we all have these own kind of like our own like internalized
sexist whatever it might be preconceptions in terms of these things as well and
i think that it often comes for women who are successful you look at them you either think you probably think one of two things you
either think or maybe one of three things you think wow amazing must be superwoman or you think wow
amazing but like oh i've never seen a partner or like children like do you think they're happy in their
personal lives or you think wow but they're kind of like either they
haven't actually done it they've just been put at the front of it or they're like a [ __ ] or really you
know really [ __ ] or like a tyrant or whatever it is and like that is and i think that when i look at that i'm
like actually that's probably the way i see some people you know that's probably the way that is in some ways for you know for
for me and my conceptions and i think that it's it's just it's it's what it's it's what it's become and it's actually
obviously got better in some ways you know it's got hugely better since probably like the 1950s and whatever
but there's still a long way to go in that respect when i knew that we were going to be having this conversation i i looked into
How does it feel being discredited for what you've done?
the general sentiment around your brand and you've got a huge hugely engaged wonderful community of
people um you've got this you know this true like i'd call it a fan base or supporters that understand you and they
get you probably because they followed you for a long time and they followed your vlogs and they like know who you are right and then
as is the case with pretty much every um successful person i've seen there's
also the antithesis of that there's the opposite there's people who as you said we will try and highlight reasons why
you maybe don't deserve to be where you are you don't deserve credit this is something that pretty most of the guests i face um i've sat
with have faced to some degree it's it's not easy to take right because
um i know right i come from a slightly different background but i know that irrespective of background
you have to work hard really really [ __ ] hard be honest with me
how does that feel i think that i think it's an important discussion to have first and foremost i
think that and i think i'll be the first to say that and i think a lot of you know i spend a lot of time in the book for example
contextualizing success because i think it's very important especially when you know
you're presented three people on your instagram feed with in the same square and one of them you
make from school one of them's you like your mum and one of them's beyonce and it's kind of like this
democratization of the news feed that makes everything look the same and you don't see the teams you don't see the privilege
you don't see all of the above and i think that it's a very important conversation to have so to be perfectly honest i'd be rather
people have that conversation and maybe write off my success based on that
i think that i think also aside from that i do think that you know a lot of the people who the people who do follow me and have
followed me for a long time know my work ethic and they know that i work hard and they know that you know often that's been an unhealthy amount you know
i use work as a coping mechanism so it's been through the worst times of my life that's what i know i can do
and that's what i throw myself into and i think that i'd rather that conversation be had and
me be able to know in myself why i've been successful and how i've worked and i think that i think that that's
you know i guess first and foremost that's important and that's how i'm able to i guess push through and be able to do
what i do is because i know why it is i also know that there have been things that have helped me
and then you know i guess that doesn't matter i guess the important thing is that we're able to
have the conversations and able to like i'm able to know as well in myself i know that's a very mature
position to take i've got to be honest it's a very mature position to take but i i'm skeptical as to whether it's always
been as easy to take as that and you've you know so talk to me about the process yeah i mean i think that any justified
criticism or you know might be justified it might be unjustified criticism is hard to take
i don't i think you can have a mature standpoint towards something and equally you're still going to feel
like a punch in the stomach of course and that's and that's fine and i think that one of the things that i wouldn't wish
you know when i think for my children that i wouldn't necessarily want them to be in is i wouldn't want them to be
in a higher profile position when they're younger um and because i you know i talk about i have this whole chapter in
the book which is essentially a i guess probably like the most honest i've been in a long time because
it's you know as i've said it's a there's no instant feedback loop there's i can write this and not hear about back from it for you know like a
year and it's me talking about how actually essentially i feel like a lot of i became known at a time where
my self-confidence was at its worst and therefore i was able to i guess rather than feeling that lack of
confidence with confidence and self-worth i filled it with validation and therefore when i decided to take a step
back from social media because i decided that wasn't what i wanted to do kind of first and foremost as my job
that kind of bandage was ripped off because it didn't exist and that's when i realized that you know
these things are the things that we need to be able to deal with and we need to be able to i guess cobble together to be able to
you know no matter whether this person thinks x y and z about yourself how much does that matter if it does
matter and if you do think it's wrong are you going to do something about it and can you still get on with
your day essentially and i think that there are people who are amazing who i see on social media
who i wouldn't give a single criticism to that i can think of that i'm sure get the exact
same thing and there are people who have been to hell and back and get the exact same thing and there are people who actually have
done you know have lucked out and get the exact same thing and in the grand scheme of things i don't think it
necessarily matters i think what matters is that you know in yourself and you also know that if there's
something you need to change then you can change that like if you want to if i guess sometimes when
something like other things you know like hit a nerve or whatever like do you need to change that do you need to address that do you need to do better um so i
think that that's that's kind of how i tackle it but of course no there's not like a something in me where i you know get a
message that says you look ugly and i'm like thank you
that's not an initial reaction but i think that you have to be you have to be rational when we're not
designed to be taking this much feedback and criticism or even if it's not criticism if someone
like i say the whole time oh i don't like that color i don't like like clothing or like
whatever it might be to the designer that might like rip them to shreds or whatever it's not mean
it's an opinion and we're not designed to be able to take that in so i think that there has to be a sort of rationalization on a human
part or on your like if you are in that position you have a duty to yourself to learn how to deal with that or to remove
yourself from the situation otherwise it's just untenable i guess um you've got you know two businesses
Sacrifice of business
two key businesses and um when you run a business when you're young irrespective of age you undergo a couple of things real like
unexpected chaos at any given moment then also a tremendous amount of sacrifice i actually want to start on the sacrifice piece because i don't think
people as you said earlier get to fully see the full picture of sacrifice and cost um both personal
and professional whatever so talk to me about some of the sacrifice that even you didn't expect
before you got into business and before your business grew um i think that at the same time as i
kind of benefited hugely from the you know having money at university
for example i also went to university expecting one thing and then actually spent it essentially
getting up at x hour working on university stuff because i never ever ever wanted to give them an excuse to
think that i wasn't concentrating fully on my university and then working all the way essentially
way into the night to get the other stuff done and i also you know that comes with being high profile that comes with all
of these things so i guess one of those things was very much like there was the time and the life experience and all of that
that because things took off quickly at one stage even if it wasn't like
it wasn't that the businesses took off you know the businesses have done much more over the past year and a half or whatever when i haven't been at uni
but at that point you know the the high profileness all of that that came with i guess
different to what i was expecting um and um or not what i was expecting i wasn't expecting it at all and therefore there
was kind of i guess you know something that i really did want for myself i didn't get but i also
got um you know a lot more in another way for yourself well i just wanted the
university experience really and i think that i was so once this took off i'm a very determined person and i
i get i get a vision and i'll work for it day and night and i think that i
actually got to i think in that instance you it's kind of like a fork in the road and
you decide okay well i'm taking this one and i'm going to concentrate on this i'm going to grow the businesses and all of
that and then i think as well i saw the deadline for that as my end of university because if i had to
if it wasn't as big as i wanted it to be by that time or if it wasn't you know whatever it might be i was
gonna choose i was gonna go into a normal career um and i think that um so
i was so dedicated to making that happen rather than you know i wanted to grow up too quickly essentially i'm
23 like i you know i'm and i think that a lot of that has been i guess in terms of people's whether
when it's people who meet you their kind of perception of you or whatever it might be and so i think that was
something where it was a choice i'd make again and again but it was i guess a sacrifice that i wasn't
expecting to make and i guess that comes with everything that comes with you know relationships with friends
with time in general with you know time to yourself time to whatever i think
having a business in a way and i'm sure some people will disagree but i'm having a business in a way is like
having a baby and you can't just you can't just like up and do whatever
you can't you can't say no when a crisis comes in at 1am you can't like that is what it is you get all the other
benefits with those conditions and so i think that you know that's kind of a constant one like you can't
you can't say oh i'm gonna quit this and go and do this for two years because especially when you've got x amount of
people working for you you've got all of their salaries you've got all of their pensions you've got you know like it's it's a huge responsibility stops
with you right yeah and and and that's you know it's it's it's an important one do you sometimes i
reflect on uh the business journey and just how like obsessive it is and all consuming it is
and i think it's a bit of a disease i'm like why did i choose this to like it's almost like masochistic
yeah like obviously it's got the most amazing benefits but it is also like i remember what i remember my friend i can't remember
i think i really we'd agreed to just just lock down things we'd agreed to
watch a movie on a sunday night and then the sink came up and i was just like you know what i'm gonna like i'm gonna
do this i'm just gonna work harder so it's just gonna be easier for this week and it was like tiny sacrifice and my housemate turned
around to me and she was like what is the point of were you working this hard for this many years if you can't watch a movie on a sunday night
and i was like yeah like as in like you're not wrong like i'm still gonna do
it but like you know you're not wrong like it's what is the answer to that question though so say
because i've muddled over this as well if i'm working obsessively every day at what point does is enough yeah i think that it all comes
with what you want and i think that you know i've i've listened to you before and i've listened to you kind of saying that you know there came a point that you
realized that it wasn't about money so like what was it about and i think for me there's the kind of
aspect of it's it's for the businesses and i have these really clear dreams for the
businesses that result in dreams for me as well sure but i think that that is
i think i'll come to a you know if i decide to sell a business or whatever i'll come to that road there where i'm
like okay what is it for now and i think that knowing myself anyway
i know pre-business post-business i'm sure i am like that so
whether it's this or whether it's something else or you know and i hope i can channel that into something else at some point that
doesn't require every inch of your being and i know i'm like that so it's kind of
like yeah sure it might be for nothing but it's i'm gonna do it anyway like there doesn't need to
be reasoning behind the fact that this is how i am i have always been
i've always yeah i've always been like this i've always been kind of like i'm gonna make this happen like whether
that's kind of through like coordinating all the babysitting jobs that you got in one night and allocating them out to your friends
and stuff or you know like taking essentially like any job ever that like that i could
then you know that's all that's what i'm like so i kind of know that where did that come from though i
i think probably a few things i know that everyone in my family is a very
hard worker and that is very it's kind of almost like an like an
anxiety to do well even though like my parents were
not pushy at all i think people assume you know especially if you go to oxford or like whatever but the least
pushy people ever i think that actually it all i kind of was discussing this with my
sister the other day was like where does it come from it doesn't come from our parents like it comes from them clearly because they had
it in themselves but you know like they both my parents had careers when i was growing up i
lived with my mum just me my mum and we had a tenant who lived in um my mom's house
and my mum was working pretty much all the time incredibly like i respect her so much for it
because i also never grew up thinking like oh it's weird for a woman to have a career and have four
children and like whatever she just you know she worked all the time and um and she loved it she
loved it and she gave her like everything to it and so i i think i spent a lot of i spent a lot
of time kind of in that situation knowing that i also wanted to love what i do and i
think there is this mislead like perception that you know like if you love what you do you'll never work a day in your life blah blah blah
but i also think that there is this like it's a flow state isn't it like you have something that matches your
challenge and your skill level and you get more fulfillment than you'll get from anything
and i think i was so i used to say i remember saying like i i think it was like when i was like 15
16 and i would take like work experience from anyone every single holiday
and every single school holiday and i remember my teachers saying that you should probably choose one of the avenues and
then you can do like more within that or something and i remember just saying to them like i'm so terrified that i'll be stuck in
something that i hate and it was like a constant like and i don't think it's necessarily good i
don't think it was necessarily healthy i was constantly so terrified that you know the same was for university the same was for whatever
like i didn't get into oxford the first time i applied i i i and i went again like i literally that
same day i went online and i found out what i could do for a year that would earn myself some money to be able to not be
i guess studying that year and went to um and applied for the ibm future scheme
which is the one they do for gap year students that that literal same day
and then applied again the next year and like as in i was i'm very like that it's
very set on kind of one thing and if that thing then doesn't work i either want to do it again like it's
really clear to me i either want to do it again or i'm like that wasn't right and then i move on but i know that i'm
very straight out and very like i will not stop until like yeah you
get it right what's the uh actual the business and the chaos in the segment can is there one day in your business
career over the last couple of years which was your worst day um i mean or your toughest challenge
i think my toughest challenge in general was there was this stupid stupid time that
i'm constantly praised for that was the worst decision i've ever made in my life which was that i was
coming up to my university finals i was launching a business to i think it
was a month before my university finals yeah i was launching a business beginning of may the 7th may if i'm right um
and i started i finished my finals on the 6th of june now that meant that 40 000 words were
due and five three-hour exams within the space of two weeks and i also wanted to launch my business
and i also wanted to do well at university i'd been working with that for three years um but i'd persuaded people as well i'd
be persuaded people to spend money on this launch i'd persuaded people to you know so i was going to do it right people were like you're amazing like
this is so great like how can you do this and i'm like you are like it's not wise
it's not smart like it's not like this isn't a competition for how many boxes you can take within a small space of
time that is like a fast track towards burnout and either something going incredibly wrong
or whatever and i think that that you know like as i've said work was always a coping mechanism for me so it's always kind of like well if when if we
have to do it now or we like run out of money before launch and we're doing it now and i don't care like i can work x y and z and i actually have like
a whole like chapter in a book where i'm essentially talking about like that was the time that i felt most validated in being a
hard worker and i felt like because i was i was in the library at 3am and i was also
on the phone with the suppliers at you know 7 a.m the next morning and all of x y and z and people could
see it and i was living it i was like hustling the hustle and that was when i was like wow
like this is it like i am the hard worker like with capital h w and like this is
me and i think that that is like that kind of like sums it all up in
the way that that was a huge challenge also an incredibly unwise challenge at the time
and yet why did that feel like the time i was doing it right so that's actually that's a lot of what spurred on essentially why i was writing
the book because it was kind of like how can that be the epitome of hard work when that is
also the epitome of not being productive like that's like completely unproductive um and
not useful for anyone you're not gonna be nice with the people you deal with at the time you have a higher chance of actually
like messing things up and all of that and yet why was that the one time that i felt like truly validated for what i was doing and
you were broadcasting that and i was broadcasting that and there'll be people i'm sure who see me now who are like
she you know did this and that and like yeah sure i work really hard i really do but there are some things that
it's kind of like i addressed that and like as i said to you while i was writing the book there were so many things that i noticed i was like i'm the
problem here as well i perpetuate this how can i criticize a culture of the hustle culture that i
benefit from at the same time how can i do that and i think that i think that that's
what made me you know that's why i say that this book was such like a soul-searching process for me because i was like
you know what is that why is that like is that because i need the validation is that because we all need the validation now because hard work has
become so unobtainable because it has to be doing this job that job like everything in between also being
amazing at self-care also doing like x y and z and i think that that's when i was kind of like okay this is a challenge
but it's not only a challenge it was a silly thing to do so it's not even like a you know there are things you have to do
there are crises you have to deal with and all of that that will be a challenge and will also be incredibly rewarding and all of that and
most of them are but i think there are other things that you look at and you're like yep this was a challenge and it also didn't have to happen let's not do that
again as you guys know i'm a massive fan of hill i've been consuming the products for about four years now and you know
that i attribute much of my health and fitness goals that i've achieved over the last 12 months to
heal more recently i've started having the hot and savory bags of fuel and as someone that really
loves to have the ready to drink cure it's actually been really nice to find a product that is a meal but still gives me all of the protein
and the nutrients and the minerals and the fibers that i need for my diet so i'm now on the hot and savory journey
join me if you want to my favorite flavor is the thai green curry flavor i like to add loads and loads and loads
loads of cake and pepper to it because i really i'm from africa and i really like spice so give it a shot you mentioned burnout
Your mental health
yeah um and i remember reading a quote in a in a piece that you know an interview that you did where you talked about
mental health generally and how you know you'd reflected that maybe you weren't representing mental health in the right
way i think you said um you were giving advice but it didn't apply to yourself in terms of like talking and being open about it
i want to know long way back i've just been digging through every two and a half years yeah i just wanted to get a flavor for
everything oh yeah no i appreciate home it everything but talk to me about your mental health and the journey
you've been on with your mental health since you were you know 18. um well as i've said i think probably
a one of the reasons that i think i you know in that in that pose to give
context i guess i said that i am one of the biggest advocates for people talking about their mental health
we have mental health days like within our the company like you know you can take days off and you
can literally just take a duba day and it could be you know because of your mental health whatever it might be and i'm the biggest
advocate for that and talking about it and everything and then as soon as it came to me no
like that was not it's not the same case like i'm not going to talk about it i'm not going to
deal with it and it actually got to a point that i was having seizures essentially um from
something really horrible that i went to that was through that was essentially ended up giving me ptsd
that presented in seizures and obviously i was having symptoms up to the point of the seizures but i only took it
seriously when it was a physical symptom like when it came to the point that i was like okay
like i'm being hospitalized now like this is not ideal at all and that was the thing that made me slow down and that was the thing that
maybe or not even slowed down i didn't even think i necessarily hugely so down after that but it was kind of like okay this is real and this is just as
like if something can manifest so physically that you're having a [ __ ] seizure
then you probably need to take this more seriously and that was you know like that was that was tough that was right before my third year at university
that that started and um everything up until then like i've been a i think i have this like really
toxic mental health attitude within myself that doesn't prioritize it that isn't
kind of that kind of sees it as weakness even though that's the last thing that i'd
see you know in any of my friends who suffer from depression or anxiety or like whatever it might be
and it's completely different it's like we don't get the same treatment like
i'll give you no i'll understand that and i'll see that and i won't do that and i'm sure there are lots of people who are the exact same
you're not being compassionate to yourself exactly and i think that that's another reason why i really needed to like look inside myself and be able to
evaluate that and be able to look at like why like why is that the case like why do you feel so
undeserving of the justification for like you know having bad mental health at one
time and i've been lucky that you know apart from this which was a result of specific trauma
i've generally been you know i've had generally good mental health and i've you know been
able to deal with like i guess you know like i think a lot of the way that mental
health is presented is really damaging in that you know people do i've had friends who have kind of said like
oh yeah but you know i don't want to take meds from my depression or whatever and
everyone has different views on it but it's kind of being like well any other chemical imbalance in your brain you would because you'd say
like hey i need this to offset this or i need insulin to offset this or whatever and yet it's like a it's a thing it's
like a you know what's what's she called like mrs trunchbull you know from matilda that you like have in your
brain that's like you do not like get this or like you do not like deserve to have that compassion or whatever it
might be so i think like i've had a and i think i'm what's so strange is that i don't know about you but i'm able to talk
about mental health really openly and i literally had so i thought it was really important for me to
um i think as a business owner i think it's probably important for all i mean i think it's important for everyone but for business owners i think
it's important for everyone to get therapy because you're not meant to go through that much chaos
all the time like you're not meant to have three messages a day that could kill your business and yet you do and you're like and then
you're like the next like 15 minutes later you're like so what's that like your fight you get you get like programmed to
get up again like second nature and then you never deal with things so i kind of
i kind of decided i was like i'm gonna get like i'm just gonna have it once a week and it's just gonna be literally like an offload
and i sat in it for kind of like two months and i was like i'm like i haven't cried yet and i'm a
crier so i'm clearly talking about my mental health as if i'm doing an interview and if i'm like
you know just able to talk about it like yeah like i think it's important and like this is and it's like this is everything that's
okay to talk about this is everything that's not and i won't address that and i think that that's something for me
to i guess to deal with and i think that the important thing is as an owner of a business that
has people within it and then you know and as someone with a platform and all of that all of those things make it really
important for me to treat mental health properly both for myself and for other people
but i don't think i do but you are setting a really remark you know what you said there about being a business owner and it's important for
you to get therapy one of the other points that i think of good that you'll be doing by doing that is you're setting a precedence for all of your employees
that even me as the boss you know and that creates a safe space for other people in my business it was the same so we met
we made mental health therapy opt out yeah i saw that yeah so like and it meant that the men who were hiding in
the back that didn't wanted to be tough guys whatever you know i was going and i told the doctors the business my fat co-founder to go as well and that
week my co-founder dom said he got um something like 11 messages from men in the business that had been suffering
from mental health but just had never spoken about it and he became like the de facto male therapist in our company for that reason
what i wanted to go back to on is the point you know you talked about this build up that you had which
culminated in you being hospitalized with your mental health um i had i had a guest on the podcast a
couple a couple of weeks ago and she was uh she's a kayaker and she something something changed in her life and it
meant and she wasn't listening to her body and ultimately she ended up getting
chronic fatigue syndrome where she went from being a kayaker that could kayak for two hours to not being able to lift up her hands
and she said there were these warning signs in my life that i just ignored until my body went listen if you're not gonna
listen to me then we're shutting down and it sounded very similar to what you were saying so my question is what are those what were those warning signs that
you were in some respects by the sounds of it ignoring yeah i won't talk about specifically from from that perspective i do think
it's important to talk about in terms of burnout as a whole so when we i think the same thing
applies to kind of like the way that this kind of productivity
like rat race comes across now is that you essentially need to be working as
fast as you possibly can it's not productivity at all it's working i guess if you look at productivity like the definition
is that you get the most amount done in the least amount of time but that has fine like that taken as one
and then that's multiplied so you're getting the most amount done in the least amount of time so that you can do the most amount in the least amount of time
again rather than being able to just you know do that and move on and find that's good like we should be you know we should be efficient we should be
effective all of these things are important but i think that you know it's also the equivalent of
expecting someone like that or a marathon runner ultra marathon runner to sprint for the whole marathon like
it's ineffective they're not gonna win they're also probably gonna get injured
you know there's nothing beneficial about it and we see it from a physical perspective and we completely ignore it from
a mental perspective or from a work perspective and i think that that's why it's so
important to talk about especially you and me people who are essentially will be seen in some way
as like what hard work looks like that results in success or whatever it might be the
acknowledgement that working hard does not mean working all the time and like having it all does not mean
like doing it all and all of these various different things that actually are important to
look at from ourselves as well because like as i said like i realized that actually probably i was perpetuating a lot more
than i meant to and that was why i then ended up needing to perpetuate things because you know i constantly wanted to show people
that i was actually working hard which actually all it gave off was this is how what hard work looks like and
therefore there's you know it's probably stopping a whole generation of people who actually want to do something but
see something you know i'm not that type of person i actually don't get up in the morning and want to read like some disgustingly
boring like non-fiction book and like but actually being able to acknowledge that and find
some middle ground and find some realization that it doesn't all like it's not going to be the same for
you as it is for someone else and the same goes for hard work um and i think for for me you know
i now and i think largely because of having written this book i now see when i'm lagging i now see
when i need a rest i now see you know i'm able to construct a working
week that essentially you know is able i'm able to be ceo at both companies and i'm able to
do all my work and i'm able to do my own work too that isn't just responsive to other people's work
and then i think you know and i'm able to culminate that in a way that is i guess
a livable way of me working and there have been times where it's not that there's been times where it's you know like hell to leather and doing
everything possible but that's a needs must amount of time that is not representative of what hard work looks like and then being able to recognize that
within myself and say like that's okay like you're not weak because you have to sleep like you're not weak because you
have to you know like sit back sometimes or your creativity just isn't coming out
you're just like a human or not even like even machines can't do that like if you had a machine like working like it
would go into override or if it was set on the wrong thing or if it was you know like doing too many things at once it would go into override so like we
don't it's not even that we don't realize we're humans we don't realize like limits at all we just have no boundaries yeah and i think that's
that's what's important there's been a there's been a big shift i think over the last i'd say two years
there's been a huge conversation around burnout right and it's gotten to the point i did a post about the day but it's gotten to a point where
it i actually feel bad talking about working hard and i played around with
that idea because um on one hand you can be deceitful in the sense that you say like i i work 24 hours a day and i never sleep
and on the other hand you can be really deceitful and saying listen uh hard work doesn't matter self-care and like yeah yeah yeah
sit back and put on a face mask yeah like i don't want to lie to you i still work really hard but obviously there's
nuance and balance and sometimes i don't have good days yeah yeah but i don't know anyone that's
really successful that doesn't work hard i don't know any athlete 100 percent i think what i even realized
that was after i kind of went through all of this like self-discovery and writing the think pieces and all of that
and then i sat down to write the productivity method and i was like i feel like gordon ramsay telling someone he's like
an idiot sandwich like i literally feel like i'm being that harsh just because i'm telling you
that actually if you want to get that done you've got to get it done and like i think that's why the whole reason i repositioned it rather than
you know it's not just because as soon as you're that then you're equally as harmful in the perpetuation
of like self-care culture that now has these knee-jerk reactions that's either like
it's like a cult and it's like this wellness thing or it's like a waste of time there's like a middle
ground like that is important for everyone but it doesn't just need to be kind of like you know like face masks
and everything it can be it it has to be like part of all of it so yeah
you might work till 3am from 6am every night for a month
i would argue that that's not that possible beyond that point like it might be and you might be an incredibly hard worker and you know like
and i perceive myself to be but you still at the end of it all you still
need rest and yes you're completely right there's no glory and no kind of benefit in also
perpetuating the completely the other side you know sometimes self-care is the most
productive thing you can do but also sometimes productivity is an act of self-care like
you need to it's self-care to look at that project that you've been putting off for three weeks for the 50th time and
actually get it done that's self-care like that isn't it doesn't have to be you know this that or the other it
doesn't need to be compartmentalized into like you know some forms of work or self-care some forms of self-care are
like what you know like it goes both ways and i think that that's what's important i think it's rather than choosing one or the other
it's just real it's like being realistic and being you know you don't always need to be like disarmingly like i've had a bad day
today because i also feel in the same way like i can't be asked to do that the whole time like i don't like when i've had a bad day i
don't instantly think like ah i will get the reward from being vulnerable by sharing this on social media like that's not my instant reaction
but at the same time there is an importance and i do think that people like us also have a duty to be
able to share both sides even if it's that being like you know like i was up till 11 last night writing a crisis plan for
something like you know like you you constantly have these things and it's like and then like so there's just so many
different types of i guess there are so many different angles to it and as long as there's kind of a more
realistic thing as long as you don't feel weak to say that you sleep or whatever and you also don't feel
like you're being like really mean to say like you have to work hard to do well
both of those things are wrong so like there must be a middle ground and that the the left side you speak you
speak so i'm just calling it the left just because it was the left i raised my left hand when i described it i'm not saying it's the left
but it is it's like um i've always considered myself to be
more left than i am anything else but um i felt somewhat alienated by this kind
of lack of personal responsibility blame someone else um pessimism culture that's
emerging from that side and i in some respects it's someone that's been a social media for about almost 10 years i understand the
algorithms will create echo chambers and they'll reinforce things and you'll and they're actually polarizing us to be the right and more
on the right and the left on the left and my point here is that um i like to be a bit more nuanced so i
don't think binary solutions to complex um problems ever make sense left you know rich poor black white
um left right whatever it is and i post posted something about um personal
responsibility and being grateful and things you can do if you're feeling bad and there was a lot of people that said
i was and i actually take this to compliment they said i was toxic positive and there's this whole new this whole phrase not being too positive
being so positive that it makes people feel bad and i don't give a [ __ ] right like if we
also think we have toxic things within ourselves and that's like it's toxic but also like you can tell me i'm
toxically positive and i like if so for example like i might be the same in that i know that you know
i'm not i would consider myself probably like a realist like i wouldn't consider myself like a constant optimist but i also know that
like my coping mechanism for anything going wrong is to make something else go right so if that needs me to work hard if that
needs me to push completely into work for 40 days and 40 nights but like i'll do it
but i think that you know i think cor you know being able to label
something as something doesn't necessarily mean that it's bad i think sure if
someone thinks that toxic positivity then fine a i don't think that necessarily needs to
be kind of you know like nothing is going to be nuanced enough on social media for you to understand unless it's like a 2000 word
think piece but i also think that like these things exist like we all know some of these like i know that i have
bad coping mechanisms in some way i know that i don't need anyone else to tell me or if they do like it's fine but it doesn't
like there's no benefit here like you're still gonna think that way and therefore if you're sharing more of your thoughts
it's still gonna be like that you might be toxically positive but it's that's you know that's you and that's what you're also gonna
say and like that would also be you would also be lying to then say okay well i'm gonna make this more realist
and so i'm gonna do x y and z and i'm gonna put that out there and then there are going to be more people who say the other side so it's
like you can either spend your life like swinging back and forth between like what people perceive to be right and
you're never going to get everyone because obviously as you say it's completely polarized but or you can
it kind of be like yeah you might not like this i just my whole stance is like i've read a lot of stuff about
psychology studied psychology for a little while i i've had my life experience and if you follow me you're here to get that stuff
and you don't have to agree you don't even have to like it and there's loads of other and i think i just really destroyer today there's loads of places you can get like fluffy you know face masks so the answer
to everything stuff it's just not here because of my lived experience and i understand i have a you know a bias
because i'm an individual that's had an individual experience when i was stalking you online grace i found it really hard to find a boyfriend
Relationships as a young successful woman
i was i was looking a lot like i was like i was i found like i was like [ __ ] we'll try google images google images
like these are just friends and then i was like yeah i mean i don't think anyone will find a boyfriend probably until i'm maybe
married with kids but i mean as in there's not good there won't be one yeah yeah i'm not looking for it's not
there's a boyfriend there because i read some stuff about you meeting this guy when you're like 15 and then you oh no no there's not a boyfriend there oh there's
not a boyfriend there's not a boyfriend but there's never going to be a boy from
yeah being young being successful being a woman i know where
this is going yeah so maybe i don't have to ask the question i'm just saying like i asked this question a lot of guests because
probably because i've struggled myself right so being young you're a successful woman in business
a lot of guys quite just going to be honest would be quite intimidated right you don't have to answer that but
they would i'm one of them i'll tell you i'm not speaking for myself i'm speaking from some insecure friends that i have
that would feel intimidated by their their their partner who is a woman being successful that's just
some men are insecure enough to find that emasculating yeah talk to me about the difficulties of
having romantic relationships when you are young you are successful you are a woman um
i'd say it's not necessarily what i'm concentrated on first and foremost and
just just from like you know i want to do lots of things before i concentrate on
that um i also think that one of the things that i i guess i found because like what you're saying is
true um but i think what i find comforting in that is also the fact that like i don't
want to be with someone who finds that masculinity so i think it's quite a good um it's quite a good kind of whittle
down yeah because yeah if you find it emasculated like that you don't
any other thing that people might not like about someone you don't want to be with someone who doesn't you know like my work is the biggest
part of me and that's really sad it's not but like it's a huge part of my life and
it will be and i would never want to be with someone who thought that was any sort of like great um and so
it doesn't necessarily i mean maybe it will trouble me down the line but currently it's kind of like yes i
completely agree i think people do find it intimidating and emasculating
i also think that that's kind of you know as i say that doesn't necessarily change anything
because it's actually not you know i would have no interest in being with someone who
can be emasculated by that so and at this point in your life do you foresee in the future at some point you wanting
to be with a partner yes yeah yeah i mean i think i think naturally i think a lot a lot of people
talk i'd say probably the large yeah yeah and i think that it's important especially with women not to presume
because i've made that mistake you know yeah no i mean i've i you know i couldn't have like one friend who i think of her
i know she she knows that she doesn't want to like ever have like a life partner like she doesn't it doesn't make sense to her
which i think is completely i i think makes sense you know like but i think that absolutely at some point
and um but i'm in no rush i mean i'm very young when that day comes yes um what are the
the difficulties you see in the current way that you live your life and forming a relationship with whoever
this person this lucky person might be um i say the first problem is probably going to be closet space
i think no i think in general why is grace difficult today and why
probably yes you should probably ask a few people um no i mean i think that i'm an incredibly
loving person and i'm incredibly dedicated to the people i love and
that currently is filled by amazing friends and family and people i'm lucky to have
in my life and i think that that will you know at some point as i say like that will
absolutely hopefully be filled by you know that type of position but i i think that the difficulties would
probably just you know be about around understanding
that work is as important as it is to me and i think that you know like i've had relationships in the past and that is
you know like that does it does become a problem and i also think that
you know then you can't necessarily combat that by having someone who's the same otherwise you're never gonna see each other like i think
i probably you know would want someone who has the same values in that way but there has to be like a kind of middle ground or there has to be then
you know some sort of way in which you will see each other once every 15 years or something um but no i think i think the troubles
will be around work and they won't be around emasculation because as i say that wouldn't be
you know then there's no space for that um but i think you know in the same way as i'm able to be
a great friend and family member and you know all of that now it's
to me it's an extension of that to me it won't be you know any different i know in my qualities you know i probably
probably the part of the reason why that's not what i want now is because i also know that i care a lot about that so you know if i
am in that situation i will give a lot to that and currently i don't have a lot to give to that so you know i think it's a
prioritization for me and currently that's not a priority yeah how has running business
How has being a successful person changed you?
and the way that people have treated you in business especially being a young entrepreneur i reflect on this in my own life
changed you as a friend as a person you know your
patience your snappiness your tolerance i think i'm a lot more
i think there's a part of it that's actually quite interesting that i've been thinking more about recently where if you're in business and you call the
shots how does that develop in friendship so i i've actually talked about that
recently i don't think i've you know i've had to grow in confidence to say especially to
for example men who have far more experience than me and are technically you know working for me like there's
been a point where it's kind of like can i say like that this is not right or like whatever and i've developed that but i think you
know i think i've now developed that well and i don't think i have a problem with that now and therefore i think that you know
there's going to be part of that where you then like how does that switch off automatically the second you step
through your door and you're with your family or your friends or your housemates or whatever and i think that that's probably
something that i'll you know i'm very grateful that i think someone once asked me like how do you stay like
grounded and down to earth and i think that that i don't go for the types of friends
that obviously my friends like bring me up and they're my biggest fans but there is no smoke being blown anywhere
they will be the first person to also say you know and that's what i value like i don't want to be
in a superior position in friendship in family relations in whatever it is i
will never be with the friends and family that i have and i think that that's so important and i think that that can absolutely
affect people and i think that you know i've seen people then surround themselves only with people in their position or only
with whatever and i think that you know one of the most valuable things i have is that a lot of my friends are
in entry-level jobs and i'm able to see from their point of view what's the most frustrating thing about their workplace
and not feeling valued or whatever and i'm allowed i can make sure that i try like my best to make sure that never
happens for people within mine and i think that so you can get those you know you get so many benefits from having
different people around you primarily like no one is kind of there yeah as we say what about when the
bill comes oh well first of all i'll be pleased to hear that my friends like to go to a
very cheap place okay which i also like i'm i i love a you know nice dinner and a nice like whatever but
you will not i mean you you'll find me buying a bottle in the club if it's one of my friend's birthdays or like whatever you know like
i love treating my friends i love taking them on holiday like i love you know but it's you can tell when that's
someone who's there for that i also have the large majority of my friends have been around me for a long time and um i think
i i generally trust myself to be a good judge of character i've got it wrong before um you know i've had things where i've
kind of like taken people on trips left right and center and then you can tell that like that was the aim
um but like in general actually you know i have amazing people around me and like i think we i'm
i like to consider myself a generous person and i want to you know do things like like yeah sometimes i will just be like
i'll just get this or like whatever it might be and and i'm in a position to do that and i think especially if
you know there'll be a friend who's been asking for a workplace for a raise for three years and it hasn't
even gone up with inflation and that's kind of like oh and it's not the it's not compensating
for that but it's being like you need to be able to be grounded enough and like
whatever to be able to still be a friend to people who are in you know either a very different situation or like whatever it might be
and i think that i never want to lose that so yeah i'll buy nice things for people and i'll do that just
as i would for any like anyone like my sisters or whatever if they need something but it's
not i think i'll tell instantly and maybe not maybe i'm being walked all over by everyone but i'm happy so
no i mean we find ourselves in the same position largely right and i think the interesting point is you've been successful and the people
that you love you want to share that you know you want to have good times and good experiences with but being realistic mathematically they won't be able to
have those experiences unless you create them right and so that creates a bit of an issue for you
because you want to you know have good times with your friends but you know that you know that you're you're gonna you're
gonna have to create that situation whether it's a holiday and it's not a problem for you because you love these people and
they're good people but it can sometimes create yeah of course and there's a i think also like the important thing from
because i know people who talk about that problem but also they love the flex so it's like okay if
you're complaining that you're always the one paying for the bill and you're also the same person saying for three weekends in a row let's go to nobu or
even one weekend like it's [ __ ] expensive like you know like you're gonna like that generates a certain type of thing
and i think that you know that's not necessarily their fault then but i also think that there's
a you know if you want to be doing that all the time and you're the only person person in that position in your friend
group then you're you know there's a certain thing that's demanded of you but i think like at the same time that you can be a good friend and be like
very generous and like like i understand that i'm incredibly fortunate to be in my position and i want to get
them nice christmas presents like whatever it might be and take people on holiday like if you know i want to go or whatever it
might be but um i think yeah largely yeah it's a
difficult it's not a difficult position to be in like an incredibly fortunate position to be in but there are there are things that come with it and i think
that you know thankfully i haven't been i guess like harmed by that too much and i you know
intend to i don't want that to make me a bad person and i don't know it sounds like you're keeping the right people around you that's probably the
most important thing right people that will tell you when you're stepping out of line oh trust me yeah exactly tell me the first person to be like this comes
across awfully crazy thank you so much
you guys will hear me mention a service called fiverr quite a lot especially if you follow me on linkedin and instagram and this has been another week where
i've really relied on fiverr to help me and to help our business extend our capacity this week we're having a newsletter
website launching called mentalwealth.com which is being developed on fiverr we're also using a freelancer we found on fiverr to
cut the edits for this podcast promo that will go on my social channels and this is really the beauty of fiverr
even when i was a ceo of a company with 700 employees or even now when i don't have a company and we have a much
smaller team there are still moments where we need to extend our capacity usually because of you know we've got a
sprint or a project to do in a cost-effective way thank you to them for sponsoring my podcast and if you want to check out
fiverr there's a link in the description below that's fiverrwith2rs.com
ceo we've talked a little bit before we go on on we started recording about working culture and how working culture has
Your take on working culture
changed and how the pandemic has shifted things to being you know um working from home what do you what's your take on working culture
and how teams should operate and how your teams operate and stuff so i've been reading a lot about this recently actually um general things you
know like rework work rules like all of those types of books talking about working culture and
i think that the main point of interest for me that i've kind of been exploring obviously
has been the idea of working culture but how we internalize it and how our lack of boundaries within this generation has
meant that we're have no boundaries between work or not work so it's kind of you can be working anywhere and everywhere so when you're
not you've kind of internalized this idea that when you're not working everywhere and anywhere it's the equivalent of like being in an office and taking a nap like
just because you're living your life and i think that that to me is the most that stands out as the most problematic
kind of side of working culture within our generation i also think that that is that is coupled with you know like
companies like google for example who are seen to have really good working culture because they
support their employees they you know unlimited holiday all of that some of that is also a thinly veiled way of making people work more because they
don't have to do their laundry they don't have to cook their lunch they don't have to um you know they're not going to take any of that holiday if they're given
unlimited but they do feel valued so they work harder you know and i think that it's really complex and i think that it's not
necessarily like i definitely couldn't deconstruct it as a whole and i probably perpetuate it in some ways but i think that
it's important that we look at it more and more now these boundaries are absolutely gone especially you know i started
having some of these thoughts and feelings when i started working from home before we progressed to having an office
um and i kind of was thinking like why am i working more than i ever have and producing
less than i ever have and also my mental health is on the floor yeah yeah and i think that then when kind of there was the office exodus
going at the kind of pandemic um and then people kind of saying the same thing and all of that and i was like oh good
and i'm like why am i feeling happy you know the fact that everyone else is struggling too and it was you know it's a lack of
boundaries we have awful boundaries surrounding work surrounding success surrounding all of this
and it's part of a generation that i guess bulldozes boundaries in a kind of progressive sense but it
ends up meaning that we actually don't know where we stand we don't know what is good for us and i guess we
are constantly on the hustle train being told to like do more think more achieve
more like xyz without ever questioning whether it serves us because that's what
we've been put on like if you're a hard worker you have to go in that like kind of way and i talk a lot in the book
as well about like the i guess the kind of contradiction between the
progressing values of like a four-day work week and you know amazing you know places
like um nordic countries that have amazing work rules and all of that and at the same time like at literally
the exact same time and often by the same you know people the same kind of um examination of it
we also have this idea that you kind of need to work all the time it's like how are we progressing in these two completely
different directions and we don't necessarily know which one is right and then if we're going down to the full day work week is that because
it makes us more productive so technically it's actually to make us like work more or produce more or whatever it might be and so
i guess it's it's all just very complex and i think that there's not enough examination around it
in the mainstream i guess like you should be able to if you're in the financial position too and you want to and everything like you
should technically be able to take your work down to four days a week or whatever and that
seems like the most ludicrous suggestion ever because you know you could always be producing more you could always be doing
this you could always well then you should side hustle and that three day weekend you get and like x y and z and so i think it is i think
it's damaging and i think that yeah as i said and there's something funny here well you know because we're talking about
ideas that we would probably never live ourselves yeah like you're not gonna oh no three days off for a [ __ ] weekend and
i'd love to yeah would you because you're gonna go insane
but yeah um but i but yeah no i think it's completely true and i think that part of this has been
me being like okay this is really unhealthy this is actually problematic this is xyz and yet and you are the embodiment
of all of this trying to figure out but that's important and i think social media discourages that type of thought because you have to be on the defensive
you have to say like yeah this is a bad idea and this is a bad idea and yet i do both of them you you have to either acknowledge it's
a bad idea or not acknowledge it's a bad idea and just do it you can't have this like cognitive
dissonance of thinking one thing and like doing another because yeah like sure that's a bad thing in some ways but also like
you have to accept the fact that you don't always think what you're doing is a good idea or you don't you know you know something's good in
theory but don't do it or whatever and i think social media completely bulldozes that opportunity because you have to like stand firm you
have to stand your ground you have to and i found myself actually getting quite one of the reasons i stepped back
from social media was because i felt like i was justifying myself constantly not to not outwardly
to myself because i was like i need to you know but like if i agree with this why do i do this and like all of that
and i think that i had to be like this is causing so much like i'm going into overdrive because i don't know how to
deal with the fact that i have multiple thoughts at once because social media makes you linear it makes you yeah it makes that like
lack of nuance like your thing like it's the mo and so i think that the
i think that's kind of okay where i realized that like we just can't discuss anything like you have to choose your
camp you have to choose your like whatever you um when i first came across you it was a couple years ago it was actually on twitter and i think
well i don't know i followed you you followed me let's just go with you followed me because it makes me look better um and i went on your profile and i
remember going down and thinking here we have an influencer who actually like stands for something and that was my only like real sort of
uh that was my first sort of take on you another couple years passed by whatever and i i wondered as i was you know going
through some of the tweets more recently that you know people just talking nonsense whatever i i wondered you know there's a cost to that there's
a real cost to standing for something because then it's much easier just to stand for nothing because then
i can't attack you for anything right because you don't you know but when you decide that you want to stand for something whether it's sustainability
or whether it's certain values you then are interrogated for perfection yeah and one human step out of line we've got
you yeah no absolutely i think the same's in everyday life but it's magnified to a point you know in the same way i remember when i i went
vegan like three years ago now and i um my friend said that my friend
the reason i went vegan was because my friend was ill at the time and she couldn't eat any dairy products and she was upset about it and we were um we
were actually going traveling together and so i said i would do it with her and we were like let's just try it like it'll be fun and i was like
[ __ ] i really do not want to give this up um but we did it and then we actually stuck to it and i was kind of like i
actually like this it works really well for me um and um i and she was saying how hard her
friends were taking it and how like they were just like you know be like ha you just ate that that actually
apparently has like this and it's like it's the same it's just magnified and i think that i think that part of its projection
we don't like to acknowledge that we think one thing and sometimes do another in ourselves but we love to pick it up
on other people and i think part of it's just as we say it's the binary of social media it's the lack of
kind of you know it's the fact that that is going to happen and i do you know you
find yourself doing things the whole time where you're like oh yeah we shouldn't have done that or like whatever
and i think social media amplifies that to the point that it's so much more of a big deal than it needs
to be sometimes it doesn't need to be a big thing like i'll stand by the fact that you know cancer culture fine like in a lot of
ways not great in some ways like there are some areas yeah really shouldn't be said or whatever um
but i think that there's also like an aspect of that that's kind of you know we live our lives constantly
thinking one thing and doing another like cognitive dissonance like we you know like you know you should be better for
the planet and yet you still buy fast fashion or you still like eat meat every day or like whatever it might be
it's how we operate and i think that that isn't allowed on social media i don't think that's like a then like a
complaint i think it's more like a that's how social media is and therefore if you're using it in that way there
kind of needs to be an acknowledgement of the fact that that's just like i know that and i know where i go
wrong and i know you know like where i'd like to do better and that's for me to deal with so you know and so i think
that that's something that we see across our lives and it's just hugely magnified when you made this decision to step back
from social media i know you hadn't posted on youtube either for about 11 months i have all my dates was there
By stepping back from social media did you let the negativity win?
a part of you that thought you would let this
negativity of social media win i don't i think any time i've thought
that i've realized that it's completely untrue because i've realized it later so when i step back from youtube that was
about that was a you know a bit after all the things i've talked about that like i was
going through and it wasn't right for me and i just decided not to do it and i think
that also part of that was a business decision it's a like lost to income in the kind
of short term but everything i've done for the past three years has been towards longevity it hasn't been about the short term
because i've been able you know at the beginning i accumulated enough to be able to make that change and to be able to say okay well i want to
i want in two years time if i want to to be able to disappear so you know that's i think
rather than i don't think anything has to be a defeat like sure it could be some people
couldn't consider it that for themselves like great that's fine then we both win because i realized
and once again i talk about it like i talk about kind of like the thought process behind it
in my book and i realized that kind of that was actually not you know i had this choice to
be full time influence so i guess with my businesses in the background and i also had the choice to lean in and
really make these businesses something and make them you know like much bigger and have the potential of
you know growing them huge maybe selling one one day like whatever it might be and i think that i decided as well but
actually what made me happy in the actual work itself was the head down get it done even like the crisis
management the working with the team until three am the building of brands all of that that like i was so young and
still am that i hadn't even started my career like sure i had but i like everyone i guess anyone at
any time can do three years of something then decide to go to business school then decide to stop and do writing or like whatever it
might be that was my change that was me being like actually what do i like in the day-to-day
it's not you know whatever like there was a lot of stuff that i was doing that i did love
but i a i saw what was happening down the line i saw that it was really hard to maintain that after a certain
amount of time and as i said i've always had this kind of constant anxiety that i'm going to end up doing and something i don't want to do
which has made me be probably quite proactive and actually being like actually no i'm gonna do x y and z to make this
not happen and i think that you know sure like there was part of
you know there will be parts of it where it's like oh and also even better than that it means i won't get the negativity but i also
loved the sense of community i loved you know at that time actually i didn't get much negativity at all like
and i don't think you do necessarily when it's kind of like just a sharing of your life like people loved especially the fact that i was at uni for three years so i was
showing a really realistic like i'm still just gonna be in my one room home um like you know doing another
essay like it's not that exciting and people loved that it was i think because you know once the channel grows it often gets unrelatable
which you know people have different arguments about that but like for three years mine had to stay relatable because i was
still within that same room writing more essays and i think that i absolutely loved that
like i loved that and i will cherish that as part of my career that i really did love
i think i know that what i'm doing now is what i'm meant to be doing i also think i'm really good at it
and i think that i feel fulfilled like i i genuinely feel fulfilled um most if not every day what are you so
what are you what are you doing now in terms of your your focus and your um
i guess the question that i wanted to ask to that point is what are you as it relates to your
businesses like i think about the same question for myself what is the bit that you're really good at and that you think you know what
What area of business are you best at?
that's the piece that where i consider myself to be irreplaceable so i guess the more i you know as a ceo
or a founder who's moving into another or whatever it might be like you you step back to work on the business
rather than in the business right so the more i step back i think the more you then realize what you're really good at because those are the things that you
keep having to jump back into and you keep realizing that like yeah i could get this person to do it and i could delegate it entirely which you
know you try and do and then it keeps coming back and it's not quite right and for me that's marketing and branding
that's like the you know the thing and that is i also think that a lot of
successful businesses are you know founder-led businesses
are the ones where i was talking to a friend about it the other day actually are the ones where the um founder is
product and brand and they still have that involvement whether it's just at vision and their briefing at the beginning of a process
or whatever it might be that is where the concentration is because that is what the brand is and we are in a generation where
brand is everything and so the you know the house of cbs the like what
you know the yeah they're all they're all their brand and and beyond brand their
brand bleeding through to product and so you know it's good that that's my concentration as well because you know
that's definitely paid off but i also think that that's the things again and again that when i was having
the discipline to step back and to actually you know do what i should be doing which is not being in
the execution all the time being in the lead and being in the vision those were the ones where i realized i
was like okay i have to be in this in some way sure even if that's you know as i say writing a brief at the beginning of the
process or mentoring that person through the first few times or being at the end of the approval process
whatever it might be those are the things that i nothing will go live without that going through
me not at every stage at all but there are stages whether that's the beginning the end both
whatever it might be it sounds remarkably similar to many of the founders especially young
founders that i've spoken to who have that realization like ben who's been on this podcast as well from jim shark um even like huell julian who runs hum
where at some point i'm speaking more about ben here you have and to be fair myself as well because at social change i wasn't doing
process finance yeah legal all that nonsense i was doing brand marketing
um we have that realization that um that is your strong point it's also the bit that you love and all the other things
the process the business stuff those were systems that were created long ago and that there are tons of very you know
better people than you to handle those things and it becomes a case of where will my investment of my time um return the most
for the business and i don't think people have that conversation enough because i think young founders sometimes feel like they have to be able to do
everything right i think that is the materialization of this hustle culture i think a lot of that
led it's the kind of like idea of so i talk about this thing called like announcement culture which i thought was
a thing but then i actually looked it up and isn't anywhere so i kind of like defined it within the book about the essentially the idea that
you know success is valued as more within this generation once it's announceable so it's not the
underlying stuff even if that was doing more it is everything that is announceable labelable all of the above so
it also comes on a micro level within our everyday like we like to tick thing we like to see the things ticked off
like we like to you know we'd probably rather see 10 things ticked off our to-do list than have actually made some real
thinking progress in a concept that like whatever because that's the way it's you know you feel more
productive you feel like you've done more and i think that that's also an area where where
founders people on social media who within businesses whatever they need to be seen to be doing everything to be validated and i don't
think that's a personal problem i think i've had it 100 i think i still have it at certain points but you know
it's a validation through being told you're legitimate because you do things and like i'm not
gonna lie i don't know half of the [ __ ] that goes on in our finance meetings and i will sit there and i will look at
it and i look at you know and it's like that's great and i need to be over it and i need to have that understanding and i'll ask the questions
but i also think that the second i let that fear of illegitimacy by not doing
everything leave that was the second that i was able to actually be a leader because i was able to realize that
actually what if if i'm better than everyone at their specific things then we've got a
business that is as big as one person like as it goes like you should hire people that are better than you
at their specific disciplines so like even if you're like if you're micromanaging if you're being like a bottleneck if you're like
whatever it might be you are automatically causing
a problem or not even necessarily causing a problem it might work that you know like it might go to plan but
you are restricting that growth that potential that magnitude of the business
because you are and it's for your ego it is not for anything other than your ego even if that's an innocent thing even
you know as i say i still do it i'm sure at points even if that's you know like you want to be said to be on this project that did
really well and i think that as a founder you have to get to a point where
that ego of course it's like a validation thing and it's coping mechanism and you'd like to think that you always do the best for your business
but especially when we're looked at online and when you know we need to be seen that we're involved in this that and the other
because otherwise people think you know like especially someone who i'm sure lots of people think i'm just the face of the business whatever so like maybe i
need to prove that i do x y instead but the second i stopped doing that was the second i
as i say was actually able to do my job remarkable when i was 18 19 20 starting the business because i
was young i'm gonna be honest i definitely feared hiring really experienced people because i thought well how am i gonna manage them
and are they gonna and they're gonna figure out that i'm not that experienced and it's gonna be difficult and so i look at
the first 10 highs i did and they're all like kids yeah i'm like why did i hire 10 kids and then i get to a point where i'm like 21
22 and i start social chain and i hire some really experienced people then they go on to higher loads
of because the person the people because they know yeah they know what their teams need to look like i always say in our companies i'm like the most important people are
the people you have hiring all the other people right absolutely and that my life became 99.9 easier when we got better people in
and i i fell back and stopped letting my ego or my insecurities run the show and the other thing which i wasn't
expecting is it actually makes you look so much better when your business works
like i i think the thing is that like you've got to ask yourself yeah would you like the business to have
the glory or would you like you to have the glory and like then realize that if the business has the glory you still have
the glory but you just have to wait a bit like you just have to not need to be validated every day by
the fact that you were involved on that project that did well or the fact that you signed that off i don't need to sign something off if
the team is made of people who are better than me and like fine actually i'm sure there are people who are far better than me within branding but it's my brand
so like you know like still that's going to be that's going to be like put in a certain direction but i think you're completely right i
mean i actually hired you know in my final year of uni i actually had three students
working for me or one student and two fresh grads and they were great like they were fantastic and to like and
i think they're you know amazing one of them still working within tala now and i think that i think that that
actually was my only option at the time like oh i couldn't afford to hire you know like any more than that and it was people who i put them through like so many tasks
and i was like i need you to be the right person because i'm about to launch business and do my finals at the same time so i'm going to
be outsourcing and i always say actually a lot of the reason for my success was also the fact that i was forced to
outsource so early based on the fact that i was at university and oxford had always been my dream as i say i
applied twice like i was not going to let it go i thought i deserved to be there and i proved when i was there that i did
and i think that that i was so committed to getting to the end of that getting what i deserved and you know and
being proud of myself even though that wasn't necessarily my dream anymore that was my like childhood dream i was so convinced
that that was gonna happen that i had to outsource immediately essentially like and who was that first key senior hire
that came into your business and how did it feel when you you know you saw the salary and you thought [ __ ] yeah so
so salary wise those those are more recent those are much more recent those are within the part actually probably right
before i finished uni there was someone who we hired and i was like but i actually
managed to get someone else to hire them so so to work on essentially what would be my
account um so the but even then i was kind of looking at that and i was like you know like that
regardless of who's hiring affects the p l so like you know what and but then more recently there have been
you know we've been hiring ahead of product from sweaty betty you know like all of these like the people
it's but also like those are the ones where i have to like hype myself up during the interview because i'm like you graduated from my university 20
years ago yeah
it all ties in as well because as soon as you realize that you don't need to be that person you also realize that they're not
wanting you to be that person they want to come in and do their expertise they don't want you to be like oh i just
want to check over this because i'm the founder or i'm the ceo they yeah they just want to do their job
and the better they do their job the better you do their job the better you do the job the better they do their job it like it's all cyclical but it's like
ego and validation and legitimacy that ties together to make this kind of big old like cauldron
of like this is probably ineffective but i have to be not even validated i don't think it's
vapid like i don't think it's like you know i don't think it's necessarily ego in a bad way i think it comes from
like the fact that all of us have some insecurity that needs to be you know especially if you start a business young and especially if you
feel like oh like wow i'm in this position like you have to be you either you're like incredibly
confident somehow and like completely full of yourself but i genuinely believe that most of us have some insecurities about
yeah and so like it's all tied in i don't necessarily don't think it's bad thing i don't think it makes you a bad person as i said i have a lot
but i think you have to recognize it and i think that's the first thing i'd say to i actually had a fellow founder messaged me like two days
ago and she was like i just wanted to tell you what you told me about a year ago saying um like everything you know she
was at the stage where i was like you need to be hiring people and she's like but it's expensive and i was like i know but they will pay for
themselves because like if you you know like even not even necessarily the right people like even if it's admin even if it's
like whatever you should be doing the things that only you should you can do whether you're self-employed whether you're like
whatever it might be and you know like my my like i grew up like my dad was self-employed like all
of these things and i think you see you're like there are so many different ways of working and i
was thinking because i've seen people do things one way like i need to prove myself and i need to do that
proving myself is more effective if i have a team of amazing people and that's been like one of my biggest
biggest lessons i asked you then what your you know what you were really good at within the business you talked about branding and
marketing so i'm going to ask you the opposite question as the boss as um grace beverly the ceo
What area of business are you bad at?
um what are you really bad at big silence
kevin i think i think there's probably like we're going to bring in her pa now
i think there are probably a lot of things i think i think there's definitely i think one of my things is
the thing we've been talking about getting involved where i don't need to be involved i think that's probably you know and i think i have an anxiety
around that that actually you know there have been times where i haven't got involved where i probably should have because i was getting too confident with
my moving away and then it just wasn't right and the product didn't shift enough or whatever it might have been
and so i think probably what that's one of my main things and also only recently have i realized how much
confidence i have to have in people and i think it was actually based on talking about how shitty some of
google's rules are actually in work rules um the book about google working culture um he says that
like one of the most important things at google is that they encourage and empower everyone to be like their own
founder so like if they're on a project like they should be founder of that project and they should feel empowered to also like look at me and be like no like
this is not how it and like and i think that that stood with me so much because i was like you know what like the next day i emailed someone who
was you know hiring someone within their team and they were like should we get them on this or this and i was like you decide
like you you know you decide we know the end goal any way we get there i'm happy with you
decide instantly so that you know like because people also want to be empowered with that and
also people often you know do much better when they're given their responsibility and so i think that some of that what
we've just been talking about is probably one of my biggest weaknesses because i'm so terrified that
something will go wrong and obviously as the you know success as many fathers and like all of
the you know all of that like you have to take responsibility when it goes wrong it doesn't matter whether it wasn't you whatever it might be
i mean something goes wrong right yeah with your brand mm-hmm grace beverly mm-hmm is the one that
they 100 hold responsible so in turn over but also something goes right for true but in turn over here says
something responds to a dm yeah whatever you've got to almost justify that even if not even
justify it but it apologized and it's happened it's happened multiple times and i think that how do you not then go to
the intern and say because i i i think if it was enough for
me to do that i think it'd be much more gracious for me to just probably get rid of them as in essentially to say like
this is not the right place because it also you know there's a par there's an element of that that's not understanding the brand that's not understanding who
we are or ethos or whatever and if it's that far out of line and it's like okay well this is a mismatch here then
but i think that so my two options then e both of them involve like you know
being gracious in some way and one of that is fixing it if i genuinely believe that it was an honest mistake
and it came across wrong or like whatever it might be then fine and i will work with them to deal with it and i don't believe
you know maybe someone will disagree but i don't believe i have ever ever ever gone to someone and be like how dare you you've sacrificed this good
like like you know you've done all of that because also they do the work every single day to make the company great and yeah it's
frustrating like trust me like i don't see that and think like it's fine because last week they did a nice post or like whatever
but like there is still an element of it that's like frustrated and that's like feels like you've taken 10 secs back and
is terrified that you're about to be cancelled or like whatever it might be but there's either a decision then to
decide it's a mismatch or to decide it's still a match and it was an honest mistake neither of those involve like ripping
someone to shreds so how do you do sometimes though when you do get like emotion and business
it's your baby it's it's sometimes you know anger or i don't know frustrations they
do manifest themselves in business in some ways like i'd be lying if i said that i didn't have days where i was frustrated and people knew
i try not to be as much as i can i try and remain a little bit calm especially when it's most chaotic yeah especially in offices i think that's
particularly like we have the luxury now i'm like no you can't see me like as in you know i think
i i often like i think probably the near our
office the like cafes they know me well because i will go in there i will take myself i will exit
because i don't i think in life and in business i don't believe in i don't think i necessarily
react in that way naturally um and i think to my detriment sometimes because you know sometimes you do need to just
say you know this is absolutely not right or whatever but i think it's the same thing as i kind of talked about before like you
know i'd rather work out the best way to deal with it there have been times where i've picked up the phone and i've been like what the [ __ ] has gone wrong
like why would you do that like this makes absolutely no sense like this is you know you should know better like all of that and
they are first of all they are very few and far between i'm not saying that i don't say that to my housemates i'm like how [ __ ] damn
i don't understand why he would do that like he knows that's not the case but i would i don't i don't i mean you
might disagree i don't think i i don't think i really like i'm not looking at her she also is paid to say no um
but i genuinely i genuinely i'm not a she's the same way as a text
i think i'm the same in relationships friendships like everything i am a walk out of the rumor and come
back in half an hour and at that point i'll leave the shout or i'll you know but i'm not instantly kind of in that moment
which is why i sometimes also find social media hard because i don't want to react in the moment and social media warrants an
instant reaction because that's the only way that you're being true to yourself or like whatever it might be like i often will think something you
know when you're angry and you think something you're so angry about it and then half an hour later i won't be or i'll think it's different or i'll
think someone didn't mean that or whatever it might be and so i try and even though social media doesn't necessarily
allow for that amount of kind of like discussion i do try and like you know just yeah and that's kind of in
general how i deal with things i go and spend some time by myself and if anyone talks to me
if you are to become the person you want to become what does that person look like in terms
of values the way they conduct themselves react to things um i think for me it's a lot of
repositioning i as i said like i think that i grew up on social media at a time where i was
particularly low and therefore like a lot of that was made up with validation therefore like i think one of my main aims
and one of my main like work what i've been working towards for the past you know year or so has been that kind of
self-validation and that self-worth and i think that that through and through you know unfaltering
self-worth is i don't know whether it's even like a reality like i think
people have faltering views of themselves just like they do every other person you can love someone absolutely unconditionally
you can think in one moment like yeah like you know why did they do that or like i think that's a terrible trait
about them or whatever and i think the important thing is being able to bounce back from that into the original
position or being able to consider that and still have that worth or love or whatever and
i think so i think to become the person who i want to be i think it's you know i'm
quite you know happy with where i am now and i think there are like i know what i need to improve in
terms of like and i think a lot of it comes down to my own confidence and my own um like assurance
in myself in order not to project that elsewhere so yeah like in general i think that's
probably one of my main main things being completely honest i don't think it involves like money or like growth in any other
way i think the first thing that i know that i need to improve on is that how how does one go about improving
their self-validation i would love to know
but i think in general it's just like an it's an understanding of yourself it's an understanding that you're going to [ __ ] up it's an understanding that you're going to
think one thing and do another and i think that part of that as i say put that was part
of the reason you know i did move away from social media because it was like i can't have all these people telling me one thing even if it's
a great thing because it doesn't allow you to be like completely in touch with yourself and know those differences
yeah exactly like even if it's the people blowing smoke up your ass like you then can't get that from yourself
because you're constantly like clouded by that if it's people hating it's the same thing so i think that like i'm don't i don't
necessarily know i think all it can be is being in touch with yourself and understanding that you are
going to do things wrong i think i'm very harsh on myself in the way that i don't like doing things wrong and
i work very hard not to do things wrong and so when i do it you know it hits me
hard and i think that part of that is learning that does it hit you hard yeah i think i think in general it
really does and i think that i yeah yeah i think that that's kind of one of the things that
you have to then develop that kind of self-love and all of that to be able to say um okay
great well like you know but i'm i'm as i've said got this like miss trunchbull living in my head who
just wants one thing and one thing only and it constantly changes and it's constantly more and
i think that's an important thing to address two things the first one is instagram you kept instagram
Instagram
yes why i like instagram in general i think that you
know i think one of the one of the sad things that i found about kind of
pivoting was that i loved what i got from things like youtube in
terms of like the community as i say that like i loved being able to share that and i
was at this really weird point where i loved sharing my life but i also didn't like sharing my life because i like you know
and it was you know there were bad things and good things about everything but it was like the highs were really high and the lows were really low
and so it's kind of like toxic in that way and i think that instagram
instagram and twitter probably both can be used in a way where you i try and use it more as like
a you know i post way more than like a regular non instagram non public eye whatever person
would post but i don't use it as a platform for anything other than just
social media like if that if that makes any sense at all it's kind of you know it's pretty much
my only platform and i just you know i post as on when i want i don't need to post i don't need to come across a certain
way because i don't need to do stories at all one day you know like whereas yeah and probably the most widely there was a
report out that said instagram is probably the worst platform for mental health well you can see why visuals filtered visuals
unrealistic compounds i think i think i think i also thought that no matter what i didn't like or what i wanted to pivot
to i also owed it to myself to be able to celebrate my success in some ways and i think that you know that however many messages i get from
people saying you know i know you've moved off other platforms but please don't agree delete
instagram because you know xyz like whatever it might be like everyone has their people who really
don't necessarily really need them but really really benefit from them and i think that i also
saw a lack of representation for women in the business space who also shout
about it and i think there's a reason for it like i wouldn't encourage a woman to shout about it not from a moral perspective but because you will
be ripped to shreds and because people will have preconceptions that are different from successful men and you know whether
that's showing material things or like whatever it might be it's perceived as differently and therefore like but i did think in
that way that not only do i want to be able to do that i also think that you know i think i'd
like to do it also to make sure you know to be able to be in that landscape and i think that i kind of
owed it to myself also to be able to celebrate that even if i was moving away from that being my job i didn't post in
any way the same as i posted when that was my job um i post very differently but
you know it's i love it you've got any sort of big regrets in your life that you've uh that might help others
Any big regrets?
avoid making those same mistakes um i think i mean i mean i think
my it's it's the kind of same timing thing again it's once again it's just anything to do with allowing other
people's perception allowing focus on other people's perception of you over your focus on
your perception of yourself um but i don't think i'm not really like a
as i've said much to my detriment and to my success i've you know i don't necessarily
concentrate on don't maybe it's that toxic positivity thing you said or whatever i don't necessarily concentrate on
those downfalls like i feel like everything that's gone wrong like we're not not getting into oxford
the first time or whatever that led to me having a really great corporate job and i was able to make some money and i was able to you know like work in econ for a
bit you know like all of those things and i think that i'm very like
my pick yourself back up attitude is bad in some ways but the way it's good is also allowing
you to not have many regrets because you always make something out of a bad thing and therefore it's really hard to look back and say that was [ __ ] because
fine even if it didn't lead to what you thought it would like i had for example i had my absolute dream job lined up for
april and it got cancelled because of the pandemic and you know i
like was very lucky to be in an industry that was largely unaffected in fact in some ways did really well
and i was so devastated about that um and like maybe it will happen maybe
it won't but like you know i think that that was something that couldn't be a regret couldn't be whatever
but i also know that at this point i've moved so much away from social media in that time that that
probably would have put me on a like blasted me in a way that actually maybe i wouldn't have been able to deal
with and i think that you know kind of the world works in like mysterious ways and like maybe that wasn't right and maybe i
wouldn't say yes if i got that opportunity again and i think that that actually just
yeah i i guess maybe it is a toxic positivity maybe it is like maybe i should be you know i don't allow myself
to be sad about those things when i maybe should be or i should address them but i think part of that means that when i i'm asked about my
regrets i have kind of very little that's good i mean regrets that come with their their upsides right and the value in the
lessons that they teach you so it's hard and i don't think it's bad to have regrets i think acknowledging your regrets is
really important to be able to move forward um maybe i'd block them out i bet you can't wait for people to to
Worries about your book
get your book right yes it's a real labor of love right yeah i mean i'm terrified at the same time
um and i'm sure there will be some people i think i think well i think you it's the same as a business if you pull that much love and your soul into
something if people hate it they essentially hate you like that's never nice it doesn't matter whether you're a bad nurse or whatever like it's not something you want
and i think that i think also as i say there's a lot that i've put in there that i probably wouldn't have talked
about online because it's there's delayed feedback there's you know i don't need to hear what someone said
thinks about that in that moment and so i you know i'm excited i'm terrified um
but you know and it's also very different like it's different from what i've been doing it's not entirely about business it's
not entirely about you know xyz it's it's different like it's essentially another pivot in one way
and i think that you know i'm excited and equally like you know i think about
it some like some for some reason last night was one of the nights that i had kind of like constantly waking up i was like what if people don't like this bit
and like what are people you know and i think that that's not something you control control and like
i think the only way to guarantee not having that would be to write a blank book which i don't have much interest in and is that those worries because i'm
because i'll be honest i don't have those worries yeah and i've spoken to other authors that you know when i talked about them being
excited about the book coming out they also didn't express those worries so i'm wondering where those have come maybe it's because i'm conditioned to
having a constant feedback loop of you know whether on the businesses whether on my socials whatever it might be
um or maybe it's because i'm more insecure about those feedback things like maybe it is
but i think that it's also i care a lot
so you know i care a lot about it i care a lot about my well-being i care a lot about you know i
and i feel like some of that you know is acknowledged that it's not necessarily even the right thing like i want to be able
to write my truth and to write what i genuinely believe in and for someone to say i don't believe in that and it's kind of cool
back to the battle we were just talking about there so yeah you said you wanted to be less sort of connected to people's feedback well i
write in the book i write you know at the same time like there's
i don't i don't obviously it's completely irrational to want to be liked by everyone and i don't
want to be liked by everyone but i think in the same way everyone who is in the public eye and sees something [ __ ] or
whatever it might be you know as in it's just you know it's a natural reaction like
you know yeah so i think but i'm very very excited and i think that the reaction so far to you know the
concept to the excerpts to everything has been amazing and so i think that i should
probably just be more excited about it and um yeah you're a you're a
How do you battle with all your ideas
very um inspired entrepreneur i noticed this when i was going through your sort of your history over the last
four years you've started several businesses you've had several ideas within those businesses and you seem like a constant stream of
ideas right i imagine that's also a problem yes my early investors told me they said they
kept hitting me with this whip and saying steve stop [ __ ] emailing us with a new idea all the time how have you made how have you been able
to distinguish between what's an idea worth pursuing and what's that because you could you know when you get a little bit of resource and you have
teams of people you could at any time be the ceo that's walking in every day and saying we're gonna do we're gonna do this a new thing
that can be unhelpful i'm still guilty of it yeah no and i'm sure i am um i'm sure i am how do you decide what
to what yeah i think i i think i use our audience a lot i think that one of the
real benefits of having a you know i'm gen z so having a gen z led brand for
your gym yeah i'm the first year of gen z um and i think one of the benefits
is like everyone's constantly like how do we market to gen z how do we do all of this and i'm definitely not like
gen z like don't ask me to do a tick tock dance but like i um i think that in that way i feed off
our audience a lot like i know i'm not the most experienced at branding that doesn't mean i'm not the best at branding for our brand
that means i'm not the most experienced so how can i use that in experience how can i leverage off people you know how can i can i can just
ask people sometimes like i can just say like would you be interested in this and i like used to be like no because they can only see it the final thing
and then sometimes people have said like yes yeah and then i've been like actually no but i think it's instinct i think some of it's instinct i think the more you
know your brand the more you really like know your brand and i think that lots of the time you
know it's an equal problem when other people have ideas and you're like
no but i want you to have more ideas like and i think that you know it's just a constant learning process and i'm sure
i've had i have had ideas that have gone you know that just haven't gone as well as they should have and i think that that's
constant thing i think in in fashion especially like you're going to have like a certain amount of things that
don't sell as well as they should like whatever it might be and that's just a constant reality so i don't think it's necessarily about
always picking out the best ideas i think it's about picking out the right number of ideas usually fewer
and executing them well and as we look forward to your future i'm sure there's plenty more ideas to
come is there anything in the pipeline that one might be able to know about well actually because because i've
started two businesses the one question kind of press everything always asks is like what's
next what's the next business and there just really isn't gonna be one
for but i think currently i am so maxed out
i think because i have two businesses here but i also have my personal brand sure so you know the book is a business
you know and that's a lot if you think of the amount of days in the week yeah so you're thinking like
five days i'm really strict on weekends so i hate to tell the hustle culture crew but i take weekends and i'm
strict on them um and so five days a week split between technically three
businesses that's already a lot of time blocking to establish what you spend your time on
and where and bearing in mind that about you know fifty percent of this or not 50
40 of the stuff i do will also be unexpected so i think that as i've said the
kind of ethos i have about constantly constantly pushing on and doing more more more
is actually detrimental when it comes to doing things well and so i think that you know yeah i
i've had ideas and nearly started multiple businesses and that this time at one point i even wanted to do like a
mini essentially influencer vc of some form and like but actually i
want to prove to myself and i think i have and i think i can continue to do so i want to prove that i
can do these well and i can have patience and it's not about more more more
because i think some of that comes from the fact that you know when things settle it's really easy to push for more when it's just at a settling
state and i constantly you know why can't i push for more within those businesses like each yeah exactly and growth and wider more
breadth and everything and i think that that's part of my plan so it might not be new businesses but
huge projects sometimes within a business sometimes take just as much as a new business and i think that yeah sure probably if
my businesses were taken away from me tomorrow i'd probably have an excellent you know like another one the next day and that's
how i'm programmed and i'm thankful for that because you know that's definitely part of the reason why i've got to where i am but i also think that
it's been a big lesson for me to learn that more is not always more yes that's the lesson that i also
learned and i then started becoming a bit of a preacher to my friends who would brag about having five businesses
and me saying one good one is much more that's the thing i would almost people as i've said people would say
about the end of uni when i was doing you know like all of these things and i think i recognized
probably too late but at some point i recognized that it wasn't about that and therefore i kind of was almost
embarrassed when people were like she's got 72 businesses yeah because i'd be like yeah you know i'd rather have one that was doing
really well i'm currently concentrating on two doing really well and a third one which is my personal brand which is you just yeah yeah
and then you know and that one will be the key to longevity for the rest of my career but so will
these two if they're done right because you don't need longevity you know if that happens and so i think i'm lucky to be in a position
where i have many different potential paths and the most productive
thing i can do in that moment is decide on the path and stick to it and i think it's fickle and i think that i can be fickle
in like a hard work you know like diligent way because i just want to do more and quicker and like all of that but
actually the toughest thing i can do is just stand still and do it right and where where does this end then for
your businesses in your view where do you how because when we're entrepreneurs we kind of forecast you know five years time i'll sell this or i'll do this or whatever
i'll step away what's your thinking with your businesses i think it depends i think that like for example i often
i'll have a view i'll say like okay well i'll maybe aim to sell this one in two years and then this one i'll keep
on like and i'll you know do that forever um and i think that then it changes then
like the other one starts to get really exciting and really profitable and you're like well maybe i'll keep this
one for longer so i think that like i've got used to the fact that that's not you know
there's probably not i've probably got used to the fact that actually there'll be a point where rather than
saying okay in two years i'm going to do this it'll be like [ __ ] i'm done like i'm done and
therefore and that's too late but i know it will be like that because i know i will push it to you know like the end or whatever it might be
but i'm i'm open i'm very open to it i think also i'm very much at the beginning of this
like shreddy four years old tyler not even two years old yet and i think that i'd be doing myself a
disservice to kind of be it's exactly what i would do jump to the next when can i sell it when can i get
all of this but especially because when you have a business you kind of programmed to assume that by the time you've done this
you're officially like you're no longer an entrepreneur you know you like sold a business for x
or whatever and it is a success point it's a huge you know it's a huge accolade and i think that
for me i it's just about constantly keeping in touch with myself and what i want what i want for the businesses as well
because i'm sure there'll be a point where i'm like i can't do that yeah like you know this needs x amount of funding or this actually needs to be
acquired or whatever it will be don't think it'll be soon but there might be a point you know and there probably will be a point that that happens or
where you know we've grown hugely recently i have a terrifying thought of like what if it gets too corporate at
one stage and then you know it's not a joy for me anymore and at that point yeah like i can like very much consider that
um so i think it's very much like an open consideration constantly for me and i think that the best thing i can do again is just
not yeah exactly have you managed to achieve balance in your life
well this is the sort of whole point of the book i guess but um
um i think i think i'm doing well at the moment i think i wasn't doing well this time a year ago
i think that i um i'm probably doing well you know because
for example like as i've talked about like i'm not in a relationship so maybe like that would throw it all off or whatever it might be i think at the moment i'm doing it well
and probably too much of a focus on work but that's what balance looks like to me at
the moment it's not 50 50 it's not like a tipping set of scales it's like sure this is what's added up oh yeah i'm
definitely happy i think i'm i think i'm particularly happy at the moment because i feel like i'm somehow simultaneously living my
early 20s life whilst also being you know being in this amazing position and that for me that was the main thing
i wanted because i just was you know this more more more thing was like you don't need to be acting like you're
40. like you you know and so i've really tried to maintain that even though it's strange for me to be in my position
and living with three of my friends in my house or whatever it might be like i feel like i'm having that and i feel like that's
that was a real you know that was a big thing for me and i'm you know happy that it doesn't
necessarily have to be that i'm in like some sick high rise apartment by myself with like exposed or whatever
um and that for me is my happiness thank you uh it's been wonderful
speaking to you i find you so inspiring and you know people have said to me as i've like gone through my journey that i'm like a wise head on shoulders
whatever but you like really really are oh thank you well you are no but you like really are like you're 20 23 i remember when i was 23 i was still
largely uh an idiot and you you you seem to have figured out no i know but it's like the
level of i'd say self-awareness right and i can see as you're speaking in the way that you answer questions
you're also really you're really trying to appreciate nuance that's something it took me a long time to do right so i thought the world was
the way i saw it if you don't work hard then you are inferior yeah right and then but i can see you're being very considered in how you speak
and appreciating nuance and i think that's the trait of someone that's that's a bit had their life accelerated in the public eye or through you know
pressure of running businesses but just someone that has very wise um head on their shoulders and you're inspiring as hell
thank you and you're a lovely human being so i want to thank you for coming here today and giving me your time and um when when can we buy your
book april i know we can pre-order now 14th
15th thank you lexi yeah i know mine is march so yeah but
you can pre-order now 20 something oh yeah well pre-order pre-orders dom when is my book now
25th of march we'll cut it so it looks like we've got it right first time i'll pull up you can pre-order both now
maybe so many people will pre-order the same ones that you know when amazon assigns like a specific bundle people who yeah yeah exactly they're
like you can get these two together for this i think that's the aim from this do go and check it out because i've
i know how much you put into it personally and sometimes i sit down with people and i know they had some ghosts right i create the whole thing but speaking to
you on and off camera i know how much you've poured into it and when when people do that i think they create really remarkable pieces of work and unique thoughts so
thanks again for coming on you're a really really special person and i'm honored to have you here thanks thank
you

intro
why am i at this point and how the hell has someone died under my watch you can't even go and
kill yourself you can't even go hurt yourself you're [ __ ] useless and i'm beneath the surface and you can hear the thumps
overhead like and i turned around and looked at vice and he went [ __ ] run
now [Music]
wow this is the most gripping inspiring twisting conversation i've
ever had on this podcast ever if you're squeamish i'm gonna have to ask you to prepare
but even if you are i'm begging you to follow this story my guest grew up in a broken home one
plagued with domestic violence with abuse with heartbreak and he moved to five six seven different schools as he
stumbled through his childhood trying to find his way trying to find out who he was and then stumbled through
his adolescence looking for purpose in life and he was met with rejection with pain with confusion with barriers
and as he spiraled into daily drug abuse into addiction and into purposelessness a job that he
hoped would give him that sense of purpose ended in a manslaughter case and this tragedy only caused him to spiral
further and as he reached the depths of his despair he made that decision one day
that he was going to leave his house go for a drive and end his life for whatever reason
and thankfully he didn't go through with it and by fate or luck or faith or whatever you want to call it whatever
you believe a short youtube advert that popped up one day out of the blue would be the catalyst for him to pull himself out of
his darkest most desperate moment to give up drugs to overcome his mental challenges to brush himself off
and to pursue his childhood dreams he went from suicidal drug addict to elite commando
developing what he calls the commando mindset a mindset and a set of values that you can learn
but his story doesn't stop there his time as a commando is riddled with graphic violence with
heartbreak with being injured by the taliban while at war he'll describe the moments after he was
blown up and turning around and seeing his friends laying there behind him in pieces and losing some of those friends being
discharged from the military because of his injury grappling with ptsd finding comfort in alcohol and addiction again
getting himself in trouble with the law finding himself in court facing four years in prison and then
rebuilding himself once again launching an incredible coaching company and working with elite performers
harry kane gareth southgate and the whole england team before they went off to the world cup and then the pandemic comes and his
coaching business collapses but in typical ben williams fashion adversity doesn't dictate his outcome
thanks to the values ingrained in his commando mindset he bounces back to launch an incredible
tech company what a wild emotional gripping ride you're about to go on honestly congratulations for
choosing to listen to this episode without further ado i'm stephen bartlett and this is the dire of a ceo
i hope nobody is listening but if you are then please keep this to yourself
[Music]
ben from doing this podcast over the last couple of years one of the things that i've been reminded of and an idea that's been
Your Childhood
reinforced in my mind is how important all of our childhoods are
in influencing what we then become and i studied childhood psychology between the age of like 16 and 18
and it blew my mind to understand especially in those early years how that sort of fundamentally shapes
who we then become as adults and it's and it's in some respects often quite
hard to shake right um you know that old adage of not being able to teach a new dog new tricks because we're so we learn
most of our behaviors when we're young so my first question for you is tell me about your childhood
tell me about that experience how did that shape you yeah my um my parents had quite a rough
divorce when i was around i think six seven years old um
and i never speak about that divorce i never go into detail never talk about what it was but it wasn't nice
and we sort of didn't see dad for a while and then the mortgage wasn't paid and
mom had to take everything on and we had to move and we went from this lovely house
to a very small house on a sort of council estate and i think at that age i didn't
really see it too much i just it was part of the journey it was part of the process i didn't
recognize her problems i didn't recognize what was happening it was just our dad's gone we're probably young
enough to just get on with this and it's funny because my kids are the age now
and i think about what are they processing now what they're going through how they seeing this what do they see every angle like
um and then i think as i got a little bit older and i began to understand their separation a bit more
and how it was not a clean break it i felt like i was a young child who
almost wanted to protect his mum i had my younger brother that i thought i wanted to
or knew i wanted to look after and protect and then she found a boyfriend who
wasn't a father figure and i hope you wouldn't mind me saying that as well he was just there in the background so when you said
it wasn't a clean break [Music] you mean there was domestic violence issues or there was
it was uh it was an aggravated separation that's pretty much as far as
i'll go on it um but we witness things we witness things and i think that stays
with you quite clearly in your mind as you move through and when we go
and move and transition into this kind of new phase of our life in a new house with a new man in the house who wasn't really
acting up as dad it was probably the most problematic area to be
mum's dad and mum um and you can actually fall out with mum
because she's trying to be dad and vice versa as well and i have
probably the closest relationship in my entire family is with my mum because i recognise everything she's been through
and she's an extremely resilient lady who's got herself to where she is
today but it is true and i'm listening to your podcast and
looking back on my own journey you see every single little thing begins to affect you i think later down the line rather than what
you're going through at that moment it's all about that process and i don't think that processing happens very well when you're a child
as i just said it's kind of next phase next phase next phase you know then all of a sudden six seven schools later
um and you don't fit in and you know i'm not the broken wing story if you don't if you come to school and
you don't know anyone you're the kid they're gonna pick on so that was part of the experience and
then then you find your feet a little bit in the system like my sort of final school
that was kind of my make or break moment and i think i went more towards break
you said that when you're young you don't really know what things mean so you're kind of experiencing them but you're not like consciously processing
them yeah but they are still sitting with you and having an impact on your world view then they're telling you what a
relationship looks like and what a relationship with you know your siblings or someone else or authority looks like for example but you
don't have that time to process it and i think as is the case in my life i like didn't process a lot of this stuff until i was
like 29 or like 28 or whatever yeah um and i guess that's the same for you right it just feels normal
i think if you've not experienced anything before what you then go through feels normal um well this must be reality this must
be how we do things and then you just kind of crack on and i think actually it was during my
military career and then been sort of immersed in what that throws at you that i kind of
describe it as like almost the eddie stabard lorry that you're just putting things in along the way every now and then you just stop and put
things in and then you're just traveling at high speed and then something will happen and you bang the brakes on and then everything comes
flying forward and that's what i kind of found over the sort of my mid-20s
was why am i thinking of this again why is this coming back what's this all about and trying to work out a way of beginning to
process what i should have processed years ago talks about six or seven schools um so
you you were expelled or you were moving no we moved a lot all right yeah we moved a lot so we moved
from guildford and then up to beds area and went to some schools in bucks and it was just house to house
so we moved from school to school which is difficult for a kid and i found
i found myself leaning more towards listening to certain music types such as heavy metal
very heavy metal actually and dressing with it and i think back then you know early
naughties is oh there's there's a kid in the corner with the black nail varnish on the spiky hair and the dog color and he's new
let's throw exit him oh wow um so i suppose maybe i didn't help myself
as well but that was just it was a real strange one because that's what i was into that's
i still like that stuff now um yeah i felt like i wasn't accepted for
liking what i liked you know that's how i kind of didn't fit in for a while at school
and is that is that a coping mechanism was was the music a coping mechanism was was being different in school or
whatever it's some form of a coping mechanism because heavy heavy metal is pretty emotional
sometimes i think it is uh i think it does become a coping mechanism
[Music] i but i found it was the start of things it was the start of escape
and it started with metal and then it moved to more sinister things such as drugs and at one
age so i started smoking weed around 12. um um
you know i tried weed before i tried cigarette weed got me with people i always wanted
to be with or thought i always wanted to be with and all of a sudden i was smoking with the cool kids and oh this
is all right you know i'm finally fitting in but it's only because you're all using weed and you're all focusing on
this one thing that your togetherness is your little unit um
but then yeah i think drugs took a little bit more of a hold of me than i expected it to
and it was weed for several years and it just got more and more weed until i started to progress into my late
teens where i start to pick up on other things which is when it all gets a bit cloudier
going into the clouds what age did you did you start experimenting or using other drugs so
i think just to give you even more of an insight of what i was thinking is i think because
what happened between my parents and then not really having a father figure when we moved
i actually began this sort of hatred towards males um i just didn't like him i just
it seemed like it was the guys at school who would pick and then i didn't have father figure and it was am i the male who where is the male here
and i just began this almost sort of disliking to to males when i started at
school i started to have anger management around 16 and then i i was going to ditch
everything at school i wanted to join the marines and leave and my mum
god bless her was no you've got to stay on the path you're on do you relate do your a-levels and then move on and
then if you fancy doing it do it then and that then left me quite bitter because i was like i want to go and do this this is my destiny i'm going to go
and join the military and that sort of no from her was that moment where i was like
well [ __ ] you i want to do what i want but i still stayed in school and it was like what's the next best
option i don't know why becoming a bouncer suddenly becomes the next best option
but i wanted to fit in and i wanted to live a more macho alpha male lifestyle and i
thought that was going to throw myself in the deep end and become a bouncer and so i managed to get my sia license
so prepped for my sie license which is the badge you got to have as a bouncer when i was about 17 and a half the
moment i turned 18 i was on the door and very quickly learned what the real world was all
about and it didn't go very smoothly for me in the first instance whatsoever
so to try and skip my almost youthful growth i started
injecting steroids i started on started taking steroids
orally and then moved on to injecting and then bulked up and got angrier and a bit more difficult
to be around you talked about wanting to be a bouncer because it would make you feel like an alpha male or
The desire to be an alpha male
whatever um and it would make you feel and why why did i'm really like intrigued by that
i thought where did the desire come from to be considered an alpha male
whether in your own mind or to external to other people so i think part of it is the fitting in is
why can't you fit in around that time you know lock stock was
quite old but snatch and certain other films were out which they were quite they're almost in the
limelight it seemed like that way a life seemed to be normal uh not normal but what you should aspire
to be like uh aspirational the aspirational like gangster um and i watched a bit too much of that
you know i read lenny mclean's book and roy shaw's book and thought oh you've got to be hard to fit in in this world
but i take to take you that moment where as basically mum said no you're not joining in the marines until you're 18
or at least do your a-levels when we did sort of begin to have every fortnight weekend
with dad again the marines museum is somewhere where he used to take us
we also went to the parachute regiment and uh to the imperial war museum here used to just take us around these
military museums for some reason i remember being a young sort of nine-year-old in inata or as well
looking at these pictures of these really incredible people i thought
because this is what inspired me i thought i want to be a marine and you know as back as sort of nine years old
10 years old and then when it's kind of many years later when you suddenly almost pluck up the courage to be like let's do this
it's a no it turns you quite bitter and quite angry and why not this is what
i've always wanted to do and it and it does feel like that someone suddenly puts a blocker in the way of what you've always wanted to do
your sense of purpose yeah that can that can make you um think in rather negative ways and i
that for me was when it was what else can i do this is it this out is it this alpha male
thing you know that's is that what a marine is is what's the closest to that then and where can i fit in and that's kind
of what led me to the path of i'll go where everyone seems to respect
you know i'm not going to sneak into the nightclubs like we used to do by putting our socks over our trainers at 17 to get in
i'm going to work on it and those kids that have always taken the mick those kids that have always thrown the
odd thing at me are going to respect me and there i was 18 years old on the door
two questions the first is what did your dad do professionally and
was your desire to be macho in any way influenced by
um wanting to also be accepted by him at all
i would want to say yes but i think i'll say no i
i don't know where it came from um i don't know where it came from and
my second point was there is a stigma in society that bounces have power complexes and what you've
described there sounds like a power complex yeah and it's this thinking that
mum was dad and there was no other male in the house apart from her boyfriend who didn't really
really be dad to us so do i need to be dad do i need to be the alpha here and the the older i got and the more i
was on the on the door and the bigger i was getting um
and i was working five nights a week you know this was my full-time job and you were getting feedback and validation from
yeah women yeah and you know you get into the you get into the fights you
you get better at it you get more switched onto it you get more aggressive with it and all of a sudden that validation
comes in you think yeah well maybe this is my purpose maybe i am supposed to be here um
and you don't see the animal you're becoming even at that age you can be 20 years on
a door or you can you can do it within a couple of years if you start doing it every night and becoming
almost laser focused on being there for the violence you're you're an animal it's like the
frog in the frying pan gradually being yeah cooked it doesn't really it's a good way of putting it yeah i i it's
particularly intriguing to me i've actually never talked about this but one of the people closest to me in the world followed almost an identical path and they went
through school i i think in my view lacking validation probably in the top four people closest to me in
my life lacking this validation they then started using steroids at 18 17 18 years
old i found the steroids in their drawer and then they went and became a bouncer and they were doing it for
they told me for the attention from girls on one hand but then also because i think it did something for their self-esteem and this person is
the single smartest person i know in the world but being getting that validation from being a tough guy on a door
and injecting steroids and going to the gym and eventually he even started doing some fighting like ufc fighting stuff i think was um filling a hole in your
story though the i read about an incident when you were a bouncer that kind of changed everything for you
yeah i remember um we had a neighbor a little irish lady she's lovely she's
still with us she's still with us and uh i think she knew the underworld better than i did from where she was from
and i remember saying she said to me she literally sat me down she not when she found out i was joining
i was gonna work on the door um she came and knocked on the house and sat me down no one was in as well and
she was like you don't know what you're getting yourself into i was like i do know and strangely as a young male
and you may have experienced this yourself when someone says you can't do something or you don't know what you're doing you're very quickly like i know exactly
what i'm doing i've watched all the films i've read all the books i know how to do a some sort of kick i'll be fine and she's
An incident that changed my life forever
like you don't know what you're getting yourself into okay so she was right
um there was an incident which happened uh at one of the nightclubs in milton
keynes where it was around 3 am and i was leaving
the venue as literally i was signing off at 3 and the rest of the team of signing off at 3 30.
and i was literally about to hand my radio in and there was just like this massive
screen down the range and we had a door team i think of around 15. it was a big night club and it was
still pretty packed for this time and yeah there was just this sort of scream down the radio
and then you heard black black and that was like so you had code red which was like it's
kicked off code black is like we've lost control and you just kept hearing black black down the down the mic
and i was with a friend of mine uh another one of the doormen and we were literally like what should
we do and just chuck the radios and run to where it was and we ran down the fire exit
it's in the escape builder i don't know if you know the escape building in milton keynes it's like it's just like a maze you go through one exit and you're
just in a maze of concrete tunnels and we were running down the stairs and then sort of round
the corner and as we were running towards coming in the back of this part of the nightclub the doors just
bomb burst open and everyone just fell through it was like a dam of bouncers and people scrapping
and it was just carnage there was just people fighting all over the place who couldn't even work out what was going on
um and then i recognized this massive guy who early that evening had just been a
pain and he gave me a massive kiss on the lips and everything and like ruffled my hair when i had some um and was really
patronizing towards me and and just he put me in my place that's what he was doing
and they were fighting and it was inevitable they were going to kick off on this evening and they did and i just remember seeing
like his arm dangling as they were trying to force him to the ground there was about three of the other lads on them big guys
and then there was brother and then two of the people fighting in this this area of the team i just grabbed his
arm and he was just like flailing me around and we i was just slapping into the wall and then back on
and then we all hit the floor and there was this almost like crunch sound but no one
thought anything of it because he just he went almost even stronger and i just had this arm
i was lying there thinking this is he's really trying to get up here this is going to get out of control and you
could hear his brother screaming down the corridor who's a big lad himself um and we're probably
on the floor probably about a minute trying to subdue him you know calm down calm down
um and his face was facing back across me and it was just staring at the wall and
then i noticed some sort of pulling underneath his head and uh it just didn't look right the blood
itself was not a nosebleed it was purpley and i just said said to one of the lads
was like i don't [ __ ] think he's well and everyone literally just
massive breath came off him and he was still lying there didn't get up and then one of the bouncers was a
fireman and i was like roll him over and then began trying to resuscitate him but to no veil
and he'd passed away there and there on spot remember standing there watching it all unfold
suddenly going from this big alpha male we're here to fight to
what the [ __ ] has just happened and then they closed the club and they nicked everyone and then we
were on man or charged for about a year as they tried to determine what happened
um he'd lost his life you know as a man had come into a nightclub
whether he was a pain or not had lost his life and worse than that uh five kids had lost her dad
through an act of violence through actually no one's fault he fell and the way everyone landed on
him unfortunately broke a bone in his neck which caused him to go away and it was um it
was put down as an accidental death there was no malice in it there's guys trying to defend themselves and and
the court recognized that and i'm glad of that as well because things like that don't always get
recognized and people all do get in trouble for defending themselves
um but for me it was a serious point in my life where i thought wow we're not in deep here
we're [ __ ] way past deep um which became quite a hard thing to
deal with and then you lose your job and by that point i was already using cocaine and
steroids and you're trying to keep up this addiction and all of a sudden becomes an escape
and then you can't afford the steroids you see yourself get skinnier and it's what do i need to do i just i'll just do
more i just need more coke but cokes are expensive and smoking more and more weed and i just became extremely lost you
know i was uh i was cleaning school toilets at one point because
that was the only job i could get was to be a cleaner and for me i felt like i was very much
lying on rock bottom you lose your sense of purpose at that
point right like you lose your sense of orientation and this i've you know in writing my book and doing tons of studying over the last
two years i've really grown to understand the importance of especially men having a sense of purpose
and orientation and as i did some reading about why the life expectancy has dropped over the
last two years in the uk and the us i think i've mentioned this before the data suggests that it's because of
opioid addiction and then you say why are people getting more addicted to opioids and the data suggests because men
specifically are losing their sense of purpose and i think jordan peterson's the one that says there's a purposelessness epidemic
sweeping the world which is why the life expectancy has started to decline and it sounds exactly like that when i
when i read that in your story and as you've said it then sounds like one of the the worst things that can happen to someone
a man or a woman is they lose their sense of as i say in my book their sense of like
chaos because that chaos and that having stuff to strive for and aim for seems to be our act our stability
um how bad did it get for you at that time in terms of drug use and and um your mindset
so i've written about it quite openly in my book um i was using it on tuesday mornings
you know in my mom's spare bedroom using coke right um and it got really bad
it got really bad to sort daily use always that was it that was all that the
focus of the day did like get cleaning work done or or if i wasn't doing that just like oh soon my
mate i literally had two mates which i did it with and i'd just wait for him to finish work and then we'd go and pick up and
then we go and see my course until midnight just sat there just looking at the stars
thinking it's a chill sesh really just [ __ ] wasting my time um and it was on one of those very
lonely days where i just sort of thought i don't even know who i am and actually
i have a girlfriend at the time who's now my wife you want to meet a resilient woman my
wife has put up with me for so many years i've got a lovely family
and yet here i am sat with like half pulled blinds [ __ ] everywhere in my room no purpose
don't know where i'm going in life taking drugs why like i'm from a nice
background why am i at this point and how the hell has someone died under my watch how's this even happened
and for me that kind of was a moment of obviously give up
so i took the i took the courser which i shared with my brother and i just went for a drive and i had it
in my head this sort of ambition that i was just going to go and drive off something or drive into something or
go and do something stupid and uh try and escape what i thought was
this internal pain it never happened it never prevailed i never
did it i actually ended up back at home after losing track of time sat there
feeling sorry for myself oh you can't even do that you can't even go and kill yourself you can't even go hurt yourself
you're all [ __ ] useless um which lo and behold is when i
sort of flicked on youtube the old clunky version
and that advert appeared and i thought i don't know if it's fate i don't know if this is some sort of
sign from above as the advert for the royal marines
yeah and it just came up it was an old advert and it was just there just appeared as
part one of the videos that i should watch and it was a young lad and i reckon he
must have been about the age i was at the time i sort of 1920 i think it was at a time
My turning point - joining the Royal Marines
still quite loose on my time into that one and he goes he's going through the endurance course which is one of the commando
tests and one of the four commando tests and the endurance course is a two mile bogs tunnels
um just just just a muddy hell that's the kind of way of crazy muddy
hell yeah and then a four mile run back to camp and to get to that point you have to have done the 32 weeks of training
and that's the first test and i remember watching it and and he's running through wood wood
breeze on where it is would be common he's running the stops and said would you stop here
and then it goes again and it goes through the tunnel would you stop here and then they have this obstacle in there called the sheep dip and the sheep
dip's about three meters long and it's fully submerged and you have no control what happens is
um someone will put you under they'll force you through and then someone else is the other side and they have to pull you out you can't swim you just go
through like a torpedo and it's a bit dramatic but this kid goes under the water and gets his trousers stuck
on some jagged bit of metal and he's like hanging out for breath and then it's going it freezes would you
stop here and then it freezes again and it does it again does it like two or three times and then it says if yes don't even
bother filling out the form and then the next cut scene is him with his green beret
at night on uh a speedboat offshore raiding craft just going along
no music just this weird sort of tone it was like and then it goes 99.99
need not apply and that for me took me back to that young child in the royal marines
museum in portsmouth who was looking at the pictures of old guys of moustaches in the falklands and
the early iraq's people who had become something and i thought what else have i got to
lose what else have i got to lose here than to just go and do it
and that week was a turning point so you applied yeah i can tell how much
that particular video influenced you because you can describe it i mean it must have been decades
right since you said yeah and you can describe it in such graphic detail i still watch it now oh really i still watch it now only because it just
it reminds me of that sort of transition in my life that courage you know i always thought that i
had a lot of courage i think a lot of men do they what is courage to us what what is courage and it
was something that i thought i could establish or find on the door or
in like a violent world and be that alpha male where actually courage now i look back
over my years i look back and think courage was the ability to go downstairs you know after sitting there for hours
shall i shine shall i not i'm going mom you know you said no thinking of doing
it and she went thank [ __ ] for that because i've done my a levels and i think she'd
grown tired of me yeah yeah and i was like what and it was like this just acknowledgement like yes
please go and do that because we can see what's happening here and you're ruining your life and you're only just about
realizing it and i was like last to the party and realizing i was the one ruining my life
and the other hard part was you know my girlfriend had been with some for some time [Music]
who had been through all of this up to this point i'm now leaving her to go on this journey
and become a royal marine and i think that was for me the hardest part to build that courage up and say
can i go and do this and she was like yeah i support you with whatever you want to go and do
and that was it it was literally i described in my book like a couple of days later i literally just threw i had a pack of
coke in the house and just threw it in the um in the toilet and flushed it and didn't flush
i was like that was dramatic because i thought
admittedly i kept smoking weed for a little bit because it was my progression off everything
but uh you know the steroids were done partly because i couldn't afford it but
you immediately begin to learn about what being fit means i remember this moment i am i didn't i
didn't really have too much physical training kit i just had the odd sort of football shirt and horrible jogging bottoms lying around
and it was uh i don't know if you've seen it i think it's sean penn run run fat boy run
at the moment when he he steps out the doorway for his first training run for his marathon and he's all overweight
and he's like stretching off in his really crap yeah and i uh
i felt like that guy and i stood at the doorway of my house i was like i'm gonna go for a run over the rest of your life
yeah but it was this it was like the weather we have now it was just this hit of fresh air and running and the
endorphins and the exercise feeling like it was purifying me i thought
this is what it feels like this is is this what success feels like is this what progression feels like is this what
it feels like and that was that week alone of just feeling myself getting slightly fitter
and healthier you know simple things like tidying up my room i was making myself homemade meals like
lasagnas and pastas because it was carby and it felt like that was the right thing to do um and then i began to to start the
application process and yeah it's about a year's process of fitness tests
medicals well psychometric tests and stuff like that
and then you go down and you do this three-day course before you start training you have to go and do a potential royal marines course
which is what i can only describe as a three-day bee sting where they just make you cry for three days and see who
survives it and um i got food poisoning the night before oh [ __ ]
yeah i literally threw the eye of a needle and out the mouth and i was like i'm in a [ __ ] state a real [ __ ] state like a corpse in my
bedroom and uh i remember my mum's saying again she's like why don't you get and see if
they'll move it like in that mumsy way yeah let's ask the marines if they'll move it mum i just thought
i've just got to go and i went down and i was last on every test but i managed to scrape the times but i
couldn't put my hand up and be like feel poorly like two three days into becoming a royal marine it wouldn't have
gone down well um but i passed and that for me was just
this incredible moment of i've just managed to kick my
bad drug addict habits i think i've overcome some sort of suicidal tendencies here
to now be passing a course that's going to give me the ticket to begin training with one of the
world's most elite and respected regiments and that i didn't need anyone else
around me for that one to say well done or that validation that was a look in the mirror and go nice one how did it feel when you got
that like was it a letter or an email or it's uh it was literally there on the spot you know you do the last day of the
three-day course and then they go hey you passed or they go you [ __ ] you failed off you go
and i had this letter which said uh which said uh you passed you you'll hear from your careers officers soon
you also get given this t-shirt i cringe when i think about it now but this t-shirt says potential royal
marines commander on the back yeah and when i see people wearing them now i'm like
and uh i put this t-shirt on and i was on the train just like hold it and it was freezing and i'm traveling through
i actually came back through london because i was living in milton keynes at the time and so i was on the tube just like that
no coat on just a t-shirt yeah but i was so proud of it and i trained in that t-shirt every day
and uh and then yeah i got my letter in the post saying you'll be starting on this date uh get yourself ready this is
your kit list this is what you're gonna need and that date came round but your mum was proud right yeah
yeah she was really proud i think my girlfriend was a bit confused and a bit oh there he goes off
on a journey what happens to me now um which is why i work so hard now so which i'll come on to later but you
know being stood i've been sat on that train um for day one of training
and going from milton keynes and i went up to birmingham and then i caught the birmingham all the way down to exeter
i remember looking at people on the train behind sort of newspapers and that those glum sort of mp3 playing faces
with the listening to their music looking out the window and sort of cheap suits and
you know tapping away on laptops and i thought i wonder if these people are happy i wonder if these people are
on the journey i'm about to go on and that train ride in itself was extremely
fulfilling and then the royal marines training center's got its own train line which is super scary to turn
up to and then uh yeah i pulled up sort of five hours later and there's the first instructor awaiting
you and you you walk through the gates you're carrying all your kit quite bewildered but i remember thinking
i've arrived it's crazy that you went from being i almost have this vision in my head of this young man who was
looking around for for something and finding nothing in terms of his purpose and then obviously going within himself
and using you know cocaine and other substances to try and take to try and escape and then suddenly
it's like this north star just becomes illuminated in the distance and it's this sense of orientation and direction and purpose
for your life and um and that seems to be what you know changed changed everything
obviously it takes a ton of resolve because you know the way you've described it sounded i've got to be honest even
though you had these challenges along the way between like the moment when you decided you saw that youtube video to when you
actually showed up at the training camp but it's tough for a lot of people to um
to even see the north star and then pursue it and especially when they're holding the baggage of like addiction and i
find that pretty miraculous i'm like a lot of people wouldn't be able to do even that part going from addiction and suicidal ideation to
putting on those shorts and going for that run i feel like that's that's the biggest mountain to climb right like yeah
that was uh i think that was part of the rush for me was actually just arriving at the camp
and i'd watched a documentary by chris terrell um commando on the front line and it
followed a troop through commando training which was quite it wasn't an old grainy one it was you
know a year or so before i was going to go there and i just obsessively watched this
and at the time afghan had just kicked off as well and so they were getting combat footage of
what is happening out there right now mix of this training and and i remember watching this thinking i'm going to be there soon i'm going to
be there i'm going to be there and it took you know that's a year's worth of sort of preparation and then i remember
standing in the foundation block which is where you spend your first two weeks with 60 guys i've never met before all
of us have shaved heads or just look bewildered and a little bit worried about what's next and i remember looking around thinking
this is the room they filmed that first episode in i'm in it wow and you do think like what
legends have walked through here what heroes have come through everyone comes through that door over there
and i think even that itself was a real moment of pride like i really enjoyed the first few weeks of training
and then it got quite hard to realize that all right yeah it's quite a long course and this is going to
take a lot of resolve as you say but um you know those even those initial first
few days of just excitement and looking around and just being surrounded by excellence you know
the values have written on the wall your corporals your troop sergeant your captain they wear the green barrier of
pride and they're stood there immaculately dressed i'm gonna become you one day i'm
How to find that purpose
and we're having this conversation today but something happened uh in my life yesterday in fact so this is
i think why i'm really dwelling on this point of like how you go from the youtube video to putting on that
pretty ugly gear that you found and then going for the runners i've got a very good friend of mine who
i know what miami saying this because we talk about it openly um who is going through tough times at
the moment he sounds very very similar to the guy that you described who was having those negative thoughts and was
looking for purpose in life and i'm almost searching for the advice to give him i think that's why i'm asking you the question
because he is that guy that sat in his car looking up at the sky wondering what's the point in living
what is it that takes you from that place to putting the shorts on and saying do you know what i'm going to do something for me for
once i'm going to help myself no one else is going to get me out of this situation but me that bit there feels like the hardest
mountain to climb i guess for you it was that sense of purpose and prestige and that was
you know this had been your childhood dream or like there's also this quote i sometimes ponder on which is change happens when
the pain of staying the same becomes greater than the pain of making a change like when life becomes sucks so much
that would ease it would be it would suck less to go and be beasted yeah yeah
you've got to want something that's what i looking back out having learned
everything along the way it was the desire to want something
what is it i want um and it wasn't the validation of being a tough guy at
all it was to be part of my dream you know and you think back to that nine-year-old he'd almost made his mind
up on the spot there that he's going to join the marines and that kind of got taken away and then i took it away from myself anyway
and i think almost further away it gets it becomes less tangible so when the
incident of the nightclub happens and you find yourself becoming wrapped around the wrong axle completely
you think it's getting further away i'm losing control i haven't got it i'm losing that thing i want to that that finally that day of
something that reminds you to go remember what you want to go
[ __ ] it i'm going to go and do it and you know what i found i know a lot of people like this i still have a few of them my close
friendship group um and i've worked with a lot of people like this as well
where it's actually the courage to go and do it somewhere in your friend's head he'll be
thinking something that i wanna he may look at you yeah but you're successful it's easy for
you to say it look how well you're living the dream [ __ ] you you can't give me advice and you're like oh dude come on switch
on in there somewhere is something he wants in there somewhere it's a desire
in there is a child who had an ambition for doing something
and the older we get what i found with my experience it it feels like it gets slightly further away and that gap gets bigger
and all of a sudden you've got to take a bigger step or a bigger leap but if you have that ability to go no i
do have the courage with it that that gap closes and it takes steps it takes baby steps and people think it's overnight you know
you may have found this oh you're an overnight success that's like 10 years worth of hard work you know messi says it took 15 years to
become an overnight success that's because deep down in the shadows those people which
are fighting every day the addiction the difficulty the desire to go out in the piss with our friends in the normal
world to do the drugs to eat unhealthy food whatever it is is is that fight right there to go yes
or no should i follow the easy option or should i follow the hard option and sometimes the hard option isn't the
challenge sometimes the hard options the courage you have to build within yourself to take the steps you know that
um is there anything that i could have said to you when you were in that point in your life when you were doing the drugs and having
suicidal ideation if i was your friend is there anything that i could have said to you that would have helped you get out of it
because as friends and family members we're always trying to change you know help right and i sometimes doubt the power of
a mate turn into you and being like pull your [ __ ] together you know
it it strangely happened to me so uh i won't mention his name because he's
doing sneaky beaky things these days but there's a close friend of mine what's sneaky beaky you know appearing
from curtains working for special forces okay fine and things like that right not perfect no no no no no no
yeah can't do that one again no he's not perfect that's why i won't mention his name
a friend of mine was within this lifestyle i was with him and um he decided to join the marines
and he got out of what we were embroiled in and i i remember ringing him like what's
it like what's like you know sort of inquisitive about it and he just said
come and do it and for me that was like this guiding light it was
someone within my life who actually had come away from what we'd all been doing and plucked up the courage to go and do
it and it wasn't some millionaire entrepreneur it wasn't my mum it wasn't my dad
it wasn't a really senior marine it was a friend who was probably about 15 weeks ahead of
me on the process who's not even made it himself and is still going through the hardest parts of training to say
come and do it come and give it a go you've got this and that was almost that not validation but that
boost to be like yeah all right because that's a relatable role model yeah he's just like
you yeah it's someone i know it but it's so real it's so hang on he was with us 15 weeks ago i
know him i bring him and i'm like wow okay i'm gonna i'm gonna follow in your way
which in turn becomes quite uh intimidating because you're sort of social groups looking at it going well
the marines is really hard to get in now two of them are there one of them's guaranteed to fail aren't they shortly
and i'm looking at him going wow he's stronger and tougher than i am is it me and that sort of creeps in every now and
then but it was that role model to have seen i was as you were saying that i was thinking that people will now look at
you after being in the marines for you know almost 10 years 10 years 10 years they'll see that that marine a
decade in they'll see ben and they'll think oh god i can't i can't do that he's you know like he's a big
strong man he's disciplined he's got this mindset like there'll be a kid sat in his bedroom glancing at that youtube video
of the you know the marines advert i think and then looking over at ben and thinking oh no i'm not i'm not ben he's all polished
and it's funny that it sometimes takes a relatable role model to be the bridge where you go do you know what there's a
guy that's halfway through the journey who i know and i'm like him and he's not special or smart or whatever or rich
and that can that's the the bridge that i'm gonna use to get in there myself it's one of the things when i do the podcast and when i talk about my story i
always want to let people know that the guy you see now that can talk and that can do this business stuff and no social media
was like an idiot who like got kicked out of school can't spell still can't do maths well
it's just like you but as you say maybe the defining thing was courage and that
courage came from just a delusional belief that i could this is what i talk this is why i wanted to write my book
commando mindset because i wanted to um get people thinking
that a commando mindset is a particular way of thinking within our world you know to have a hundred percent of the
command of mind say you have to become a commander you have to go through the process and join up um but everyone has to get themselves to
the gate and i become quite interested in to get into the gate part to start and who doesn't get to the gate
you know the biggest critics never stand on the start line with you they're always the ones in the stand given at the beginning aren't they it's
those on the start line who get to the gate now i got to the gate and i was really proud of getting to the
gate you know how cringe-worthy but potential royal marines commando yes at least i'm a potential royal
marines commander instead of a potential civilian which i don't want to be for now i want to go and live and
enjoy the world in different parts of it um some you wouldn't go to holiday on but um i
wanted to go and see it and that that for me was a really interesting point and you know
fast forward many years later i managed to get the prestigious job of going back to the commander training center as an
instructor and get to see those people get to the start line and see them go on their journey and
listen to their stories you know you're a bit of a tough guy over them at times but listen to their stories and hear them say that they had drug
problems and this happened within their family and or this person lived on the street for this long
but now you're in my world and i'm going to try and take you from what you were and turn you into
something that we need you to be but you have the ability to be as well
and that process seeing them go from civilian to commando and that's really empowering
because i get to stand there on the last day of training when they finally do it and you can finally call them mate
when uh you know it's a bit hard up to that point it's like good effort mate and you have a beer of
them and you tell them a little bit about your story they go whoa i thought you were like
this sort of thing yeah untouchable [ __ ] just yeah yeah yeah that's it yeah yeah pretty much
but instead they realize you're a human what is the commander mindset are there principles to it what's the philosophy you know you talk about it
What the commando mindset?
being something that we can all sort of reflect on in our own lives we can all have that command in mindset i
guess in the home or in work what other what is the commanding mindset and well we have an ethos that was the sort
of thing that first jumped out at me when i got there and we have values and the values is
pretty much what makes us courage courage determination excellence self-discipline integrity
cheerfulness and humility and um these words they're very human words
aren't they they're very you could put that in almost any walk of life and i think people can acknowledge it and go
courage yeah excellence i have a bit of that integrity is the biggest one we say integrity in the marines is your
virginity you can only lose it once and so when you have that way of thinking and you have that ethos amongst
your peer group and your leadership group um you know most of the time what's coming
out of people's mouths is true and that whether that's moral courage to say we're the same rank
and you've got stop swearing nests and you've got to take your hands out your pocket and you know let's set an example for
people who are below us um to even you know being able to say that to a senior commander
like oh should we have rounds in our pockets right now sir but it's this ethos within us that enables a
particular way of thinking and it's when you're in the most extreme circumstances when
bullets are coming at you i remember my first ever combat engagement
i was we're in a quite a large patrol of 12 and we've been on the we'd flown into an
area in the green zone and told the taliban are here you're just gonna have to go and find them which is like finding a needle in the
haystack sometimes and we were on the ground for about four hours and we always take an interpreter with
us and they have a radio that intercepts taliban frequencies so they can actually hear what the taliban are saying
and it was the first time i think i heard the taliban as well you hear these voices and it's quite squiggly over the net you
can't really hear it properly but you just think that's our foes that's
oh [ __ ] they can see us as well where are they and they said uh we can see and we can see them
they're heading towards the melon now they're heading towards the melons was their code word for um ied improvised explosive device a
homemade bomb so the taliban is saying across the radio that they can see you they're talking to one another saying
they can see us and that we're heading towards the bomb they've planted and you start thinking well maybe
they're trying to egg us on maybe it's not real we went into this farmer's compound and we stayed in there for about half an
hour to gain our breath and have some water and then they came back on so they've gone in person they said his name as well
they've gone in his compound we'll pay him a visit later we'll get him on the way out so you're
looking at the poor farmer thinking you're getting a knock on the door like you don't need but also
we're in the safety of this small compound that we're gonna step out back into the open soon and they're gonna they're gonna see
us and we stepped out the open [Music] and straight away we can see him again
we can see him again and you again you kind of are they trying to pull our bluff because they
know we can hear them they know they know we listen to them um you kind of take it sometimes with a pinch of
salt but you have to take it seriously but then we had assets in the sky which was a drone
saying that it can see fighting males coming towards us all carrying weapons and then moving down this street and
that was like okay this is actually real and we hadn't been hit by this point in the tour
and this was about to get very very real and your whole everything changes you know the
adrenaline's quite the adrenaline's high but it's controlled you've got control and you think i know
how to deal with this stay focused and we came up to a ditch which
there was it's almost like a t-junction ditch where one met another and then to cross it it was probably
about four foot deep and then you had to pull one another out of it and you get onto a track and then there
was a wall and the track sort of went left and right from us and about three of us got out the ditch
got onto the track and then just a hail of bullets came flying down the track and they all spat off the wall and off
the floor and off the trees around us and what you're taught to do when you're shot at
you're taught to do something called rtr which is return fire whether that's from the hip shoulder whatever just spray in
a direction take cover return accurate fire rtr
i nose dived into the ditch don't blame you yeah like quickly as
well and just completely flopped into the water my kit's probably wearing about 100
pounds so i've just gone straight to the bottom of the ditch and i'm beneath the surface and you can hear the thumps overhead like
a split second you're underwater split second but it's long enough to go ah that
wasn't the right thing to do that i've just done everything against what i do in training and what i've been
taught to do you panicked right yeah massively like oh [ __ ] someone's shooting us what do we do jump in the ditch that seems
like the cleverest thing to do and jumped in ditch and i remember this thought coming through my head
going oh you [ __ ] up big time there get out the ditch and i in that second came up out of the
water and noticed everyone had done the same thing so i was like right mark dodged that one
um and the way we were looking was down the track so everyone sort of looking across each other down down the ditch and down the track and
there was one person still on on the track returning fire on his own stood up
literally you couldn't make it up it was it looked like that sort of call of duty image where he's just firing away on the
track and it was our commander vicey um
and he just looked over all of us in the ditch and went check your [ __ ] flashes
and that is this internal system which just goes like that because your flashes are
what you wear on your shoulder and it says the words raw marines commando and everything those three
words mean is related to the ethos related to our values related to those 32 weeks
training related to every person that's died for those flashes and we're all hiding and he doesn't need
to say get out the ditch come on on the track or anything like that he just screams check your [ __ ]
flashes and that's your reminder to go oh i need to switch on and be a marine here
as opposed to hide cowardly in the ditch and then we go out and you get into the fight
and that's what the mindset the mindset isn't necessarily just down to skill and ability it's that ability to tap into what
you're programmed to do what your dna is what your value system is have courage have excellence have determination all
these things that were just words up to that point have true meaning for you to get into the
fight whether you lose your life in the moment or not you're there to do a job and that's what it looks like
and those values as you describe them go back through that list again courage one of them was joyful not just
cheerfulness in the face of adversity why is that so important that's the one that struck me the most i was like that sounds like smiling
if you uh if you don't laugh at it or laugh at you and i i can't i've lost count the amount
of times where i've been soaked in mud i'm absolutely hanging out and you know
a domino's pizza and being at home and going miss and you look over to the right and all you can see through this
this muddy face is his teeth someone else looking back at you and you just go
and you giggle and you know this is [ __ ] isn't it yeah let's get on with it because if you don't laugh at situations
that get tough it is going to laugh at you and the moment it starts to laugh at you you're going to begin to suffer now it's
not in the case of when people lose lives you're stood over there going ah having a giggle but it is those moments
of extreme warfare where rounds are pinging off the wall in front of you and you look at one another and go [ __ ] you know that was close wasn't it
and you have the ability to laugh at situations maybe other people wouldn't laugh at cheerfulness in the face of adversity is
is what we all need i've been saying it to people all last year and this year you know this is [ __ ] what we're going through
but if you don't smile in some way or another and find that sort of courage to have a bit of morale within yourself it's going to laugh at
you that's where your mental health starts to take a knock that's where you start to have that
sort of negative downward spiral and that was something i never had before the marines the ability to laugh at difficulty
and the marines encourages it out of you what the other words again so cheerfulness
courage determination determination excellence talk to me about excellence why that's
so important because i know from the i've got to be honest i i feel like i've watched every
documentary ever on like the sas and the marines and um the other special forces across
different countries i i got so obsessed you know when i was younger and one of the things that you see in
training is this obsession with the the soup you know your uniform being clean and your gun being clean and
things being in order and it seems like from my outside perspective they're like training excellence and organization into you is
that is that why they use the word excellence in your flashes um you can never achieve perfection
everyone looks at the military as in they're perfect everything's shiny everything's ironed everything's clean
but it's not perfect if you if you think you've got perfection you've hit arrogance or you've let your standards
down because excellence is that ability to continuously keep striving
towards something um my corporate training said if you do not put 0.1 better every day at least you're
heading in the right direction and his way of looking at that was you could have the worst day ever you could fail every test
but if you do something extra that day that just boosts that 0.1 at least you're making a little bit of a
more positive impact on that day than maybe yesterday you can always strive and that word excellence
is is embellished in that it's a it's the ability to say i can never achieve perfection
but as long as i strive to do my best effort that's what excellence really means that the the ability to strive to put in your
maximum effort on everything you do you could be the slowest guy in the troop and not be able to keep up with everyone
but if you are hanging out i always just said to my recruits i don't want to see you just giving me
the face for the sake of it i want to see your face that you are fully inserted in the locker then i know you're giving me the best
effort because they're striving for excellence they're striving to just be the best they can be
do we do enough of that we do in the military and that perfection doesn't exist you
can't aim for perfection you have to aim for something a little bit more tangible you have to aim for something that
does exist and what does exist is the ability to keep doing it at a high standard how do you
Why “its taking part that counts” doesn’t work
in our culture at the moment there's a narrative emerging which is like at least you did your bet you know there's a kind of a fluffy soft
so you hate it i can see it in your face yes it's kind of like fluffy soft it's okay that you're not that good at least you know take rest well you
know good is a good good is fine which is kind of infiltrating our culture in a very pc almost in my opinion toxic way if i post
this on instagram as i've said before i'll get like cancelled because people that sense of like doing less
than your best and being negative seems to be comforting for people in a way that keeps their
self-esteem and ego smothered with cotton wool so that they don't have to take personal
responsibility i can see you're very pissed off good go ahead
yeah this podcast is over um my lad took part in so i have a boy
zach he's seven and i have layla who's three going on 18. and uh he won a race
in sports day and i was like the marine dad on the edge and they're like godzilla you got this and he's flying
down and he's miles ahead of everyone else it's like yes and he crosses the line i'm like
yeah and he comes running over and he's got this massive grin on his face and he's got a big sticker
winner and there's another sticker next to it participator and uh i looked it and
instantly in my head i tweaked and i thought rip it off okay good are they handing out them ones are they
and um he went i won hold on when he's over over the moon and my wife and i were like well mate
it's amazing and uh he went why did everyone else get sticker
and he was pissed off and i was like and i could i can almost hear the parents around me
i could hear their ears turn towards me like oh how's this parent gonna approach this one
and i did think in my head i was like shall i go down there well it's good that everyone had to go and everyone took part
and then this kind of the stoic commander went [ __ ] that i went listen here no one else should
have got another badge right you're the one who earned that that's the reason you've got that winner's badge don't worry about that
participation meter what i want you to always strive just do your best every time and you can win the race like you
did today don't worry about everyone else and he was like yeah but why do and it kind of the conversation went off in child
language sure um but why do they get a sticker though dad and like kind of looking around again at the
parents i don't know i've not worked this one
out yeah but i did i wanted to let him know that that there was that parent in me there's almost those two voices to go
go along with it because other people are listening and this is now the new cultural thing to do of just praise
effort and sorry praise taking part over anything else or let my son you know one of the
marines values his integrity i'll let him know what i truly think of it i don't agree that they're handing
out those stickers mate you won you won the race and you deserve that one make sure you do that every time
and he likes that people will listen to that and they'll think some people might think oh you're toxic that's yeah those yeah pushy parents and
you're training your kid to you know he'll end up like michael jackson changing the color risk or whatever like but if we look at the importance of
purpose and forward motion and orientation i think that removing accomplishment
removing north stars and just saying nothing's an all-star and everything's a north star is actually really really dangerous
because then if we don't have things to strive for if there's no winner if there's no accomplishment if there's no
mountaintops then again we lose our orientation and that for me is where people get depressed and have opioid addictions and then they end up
killing themselves or you know whatever else it's also it's also maintaining a
standard for not what i expect of my child i want him to put the effort in if if he
doesn't want to put the effort in he won't put the effort in um and he will either go through a
process in life like i did or he won't and he may look at my life lessons and others around him and go we're not going
to do that i'm going to do this i run a business you've run a business if your staff
or employees sorry turned up i'm like i'm just here to you know get paid and nine to five
hit five and i'll go home you know that turning up attitude what what does that do for the culture of
that business you know you have too many of those people within your environment your business is a car crash waiting to happen
you know it is the people within it or your friendship group your friendship group oh just you know see what happened i'll just turn up
you know the just turning up attitude is what we're encouraging when we say well done everyone for taking part in this
race today you know i i personally think you you reward the top two
and and the one who's putting in maximum effort who came in last give him or her something as well you know well done that's a good effort
we had um another cake yeah yeah i didn't want to say you said it before
um i don't care about being canceled at this point yeah you're not cancelled my episode
but it's it is that it's if if we almost reward this participation
now that's all you get rewarded as the winner gets as much as the loser gets and everyone in between gets rewarded
this participation we are encouraging this just turn up just all you have to do is just turn up
and you get praise you win you know it's what simon sinek talks about this kind of entitlement where does it come from
well you just turn up you know you get everything everyone else gets anyway no like
you and i people who've had to work hard fight hard the reason the green beret is
so well respected is because it's so [ __ ] hard to achieve the moment they drop the standard
you know it's not going to be the value that it is at the moment maybe that will happen maybe society
will push it through i know training was very different to when i actually took recruits through training you know i
have seen that difference in culture society is having an impact on that we
are rewarding people for just turning up simply just turning up and that to me is
it's not we're not breeding this michael jordan attitude we just want you
to come and give your best effort the excellence turn up and strive don't just turn up and tick boxes that's
a big thing that i took away from the military is do not tick boxes you know you can get your report we were always
encouraged with our reports to be way better on it you know don't just you know well done you've done everything
you need to do in these couple of months it's good after you've done all this and this that's what we look for it's funny
because people just her state of mind and the kind of soft fluffy cultural
narrative that's kind of breaking through especially on like social media i think is designed to try and protect
your mental health but i think that the argument we're saying is it it actually has the adverse effect because it takes away that sense of like
striving and accomplishment which is so clearly important for people to live fulfilled lives and uh it goes back to
the point i made about you know chaos being stability and stability being chaos if if even in my industry there was no
competition there was no podium there was no nothing to aim for my life would descend
into some form of like probably some form of depression because i would have no there would be a purpose
and although you know the mountaintop or the podium actually isn't the moment of purpose the journey is like the
striving the training the whatever it's important to have it there um and i i'm glad we had that conversation
because i think a lot of people don't melons you mentioned the word melons earlier on
the taliban talking about they planted their melons so i heard that it was in fact one of those melons one of those ieds
that took you out of the military yeah it was the catalyst for sort of end of my career
um i've got something really exciting to share with you last week as many of you might have seen
in the press it was announced that i would be joining the board of huel and for you guys that
know me well and know how much i drink you all and how much it's been a key part of my life and running my business and staying healthy
will know why this is exciting to me because it's a product that i absolutely love and the reason why they sponsored the podcast in the first place was because
when i knew that i was going to be bringing it back and investing in the you know the the production of the podcast and the team i wanted a partner
who i could talk about authentically without having to [ __ ] you and heal is that partner so i reached
out to huell and said listen i'm starting my podcast um up again and i'd love you to be the sponsor of it and so as i've got closer
and closer to julian some of you all know he actually came onto this podcast and he will be coming back on in the future um we realized that there was a lot
professionally we could do together and upon leaving social chain i got a ton of offers to join boards to
join companies to be an advisor a consultant you can imagine what my inbox looked like immediately after the announcement and i said no to
everything i'm a firm believer in rejecting good and the whole doubt for grey and when julian had the
conversation with me i said yes to joining hughes board in less than a
second i knew what he was gonna end the sentence with so i said yes before he ended it and um i've started working with the
team now on products on their comms on the wider business on the brand everything and it's amazing i absolutely love it so
what started as a little podcast sponsorship what started as a conversation with a remarkable entrepreneur and julian has now become a
more formalized relationship and i'm a board member of huel and i think it's important to be honest with you about that because
when you hear me talking about it now you know that i'm actually in the building so yeah just wanted to share that with all of you back to the podcast
you mentioned the word melons earlier on the taliban talking about they planted their melons i heard that it was in fact
The thing that ended my time in the Military
one of those melons one of those ieds that took you out of the military yeah i was the catalyst for sort of end
of my career um yeah we we were deployed on an operation around
three or four weeks before the end of this particular tour in 2011 um
and yeah it was called the hornets nest it was just an area i've heard that before yeah it's not
it's not nice when your commanders say you're heading into the hornet's nest and when they follow that up with we're
going to go and hit the nest okay all right good luck i'll see you okay postcards
now um but it it the idea was to go in and disrupt the taliban an area they
thought they were untouchable within and we knew it was going to be heavily contested and they had the civilians
on hand there they they had it all and it was really deep in the green zone as well which i think this is sort of
end of august beginning of september so the crops are at seven eight foot um the tree lines are sort of every
hundred meters and the trees are very high it's just a really difficult place to operate in it's like a jungle in the desert and
then we landed on the americans gave us a lift in the morning dropped onto target
and within about four or five hours we'd had um five guys taken out the game already
by a grenade which came into the compound and just detonated at their feet taken out of the game yeah so injured
and put back on stretchers and put straight back on the helicopters um we then took
attack well we started to receive an attack from three different angles um so they were firing us from the
bearings right north west and south um and there were firings from two different angles from a distance to
distract us from an attack which was coming in from this third angle which was to sneak up to the gate
and try and get into the compound so we were sort of really trying to fend off and and this
came sort of every half an hour it would just pick up and then it'd drop off and move scrapping all day it got to the point
that if you weren't on the roof fighting you were trying to get your head down to get some sleep and then ready yourself
to go up and things would explode and you'd wait wait for a scream or wait for something
and then the firearm has started going oh everyone's alright just carry on it was just the most surreal situation
um and we ended up fighting with the enemy pretty much all day that day and then we needed to push patrol out in
the morning and that morning that morning just had this weird feeling about it you know the day before
five guys had been blown up by a grenade you know covered in frag um we'd had some injured civilians come
in it was just just quite a chaotic day the taliban had got right up close to the gates and we've managed to push them
back and kill a few and it just kind of leaves you the feeling the next day thinking oh we've
got another six days of this seven day operation another six days of this um you know
that first day we were there it got that bad that mortifier was getting called in over us landing literally 50 meters in front of
the compound to stop them advancing on our position and that's frightening that's you know you're close to that sort of hand-hand
combat and um the next day i remember waking up thinking i didn't have a great night's
sleep you don't really get good night's sleep out there and this really weird thing happened i i was sort
of messing around with the some ornaments which were on a shelf you know just like being a nosy sort of
brit having a look around this compound and i ended up flicking this sort of like weird dish thing it had a
car battery like just a half a car battery in it and i poured it and it had all the acid in it and it
leaked onto my head and then onto my face and then onto my body i was like oh my god i've got battery acid on me and i even
said to myself i was a bad omen for the day isn't it um and there was just these like weird
tiny little events that happened and i think they only seem weird now because i look back and like because there was
an incident and um one of uh one of the marines uh darlow luke
he um we usually rotate on patrol so on one patrol he would go at the
front or second from the front because of the weapons we carried um i carried a light machine gun which
is um you know it's between the we have two machine guns we have the gpmg and then
we have the lmg and the lmg's slightly smaller and i had the lmg and so you go that second person to
cover the first person who's a rifleman who is literally with a metal detector looking for the bombs so
you're there on their shoulder and you work as a pair and it was actually my turn to go in the
middle of the patrol and it was luke's turn to go up to the front and
neither position really is any skin off your nose i was like doing a swap today and he's like now stay where i am i'll
go jordan up the front and we came out the compound and literally straight away
into a ditch and then into a cornfield and we kind of navigated our way through the cornfield and the idea was to get up
to this village was which is probably about 200 meters from our sort of um base i suppose you could call
it an occupied compound um and we just wanted to get in there and talk to some of the locals and
see what the problem is with the taliban and where they are and see what intelligence we can get out of them and i i was a jordan at the front and with
us was a dog handler and we had the dog handler because they sniffed the bombs and we came to the edge of the cornfield
and there was just no one around call it atmospherics so positive atmospheric
women and children out in the streets farmers in the fields you know normal life pattern of life happening
there was no one nothing like literally you had the tumbleweed going down the street
um and i looked over my shoulder and you could feel it we call it spidey senses it's when you know your skin and your hair so it starts to
stand up on your neck and you could just sense it after yesterday's fighting
no villagers around they're here the taliban are here it's just where are they um i looked over my shoulder and vicey
was behind me my commander it was just like yeah push up the track let's go and we came out onto the track and began
walking up towards where we needed to be very slow pace you know you're checking for these bombs in the ground
and a tractor appeared in front of us probably about 20 minutes 20 meters to our front
and this this farmer just looked at us and he must have just seen load of marines suddenly stood there in
the street and just we were like thresh you know stop and he just like
floored the tractor as much as he could it kind of just chugged off and he disappeared and it just it just all felt a bit weird
and we got nearer to this um we literally come up to this crossroads and myself jordan the dog handle were on
top of the crossroads now or just just slightly just before jordan was on it and i was just slightly back from it
and these two guys walked around the corner dressed in full black trainers on which is a massive indicator
for taliban they used to wear trainers where most of the people just wore flip-flops and these trainers for obvious reasons getting around quicker
and they would just stood there as you are to me in front of us and it was like [ __ ] out and
you couldn't do anything like they're not armed they just stood there looking at you and they're as wide-eyed as you are and
you think this is taliban and then they just bolted literally just ran straight from us as we're like stop
stop and they ran to our right behind us a short wall but into the
field and you could hear him like traveling through the field like the snapping of the corn and everything and why the [ __ ] are
they just running to the field why didn't they run down the track or just stop and all this is starting to go in your head and i turned around and looked at
vice and he went [ __ ] run now and we'd start to run and we'd we must have taken two three steps and
the wall next to us just obliterated and this this plume just
covered us all like i've never heard anything that loud i've been around a few loud things
but it was so close and i remember this something hit me in the back of the head
um which my helmet must have deflected and then something went through my leg and i just felt like this almighty pain
in my leg and but i was still stood there and i don't mean that heroically like shrugged off a bomb it was just a shock
of it everything just went through you all the rubble um all the um frag
fragmentations to the shards of metal just just went through your bags helmet everything and the pain in my leg was enough for me
to like scream out in agony and then drop to the floor and the way i dropped
i actually ended up sitting on my foot so my injured leg had come back under me and i had this right leg
out to the front i smile because it was mildly amusing when i look back on it
but all this you know your ears are ringing you can't hear it you just hear that sort of muffled sudden sound um
you can smell the core diet you can smell horrible things you know when you come
to terms with what happens next i remember looking down thinking oh it's [ __ ] me and i was screaming i've lost
my leg i've lost my leg because i just i was concussed i had the pain here i
couldn't see it there's lots of smoke and dust everywhere and [ __ ] i've lost my leg i had this moment sat literally must be 30 seconds
long sat there on the floor thinking [ __ ] i've lost my [ __ ] leg where is it for a start um and then it was like this weird
sensation of like my foot trying to come back round underneath me and it and then i was like oh [ __ ] sat on it i'm sat on my foot
i sat on my foot and i did look down and there was blood all down my legs but my foot was there my leg was there it
was all intact and you check other bits which are quite required for a man and i was like all
right it's all there and you do have those really surreal moments it's a real thing where people check themselves
and i was like [ __ ] but then it real then you realize you're on patrol and there's other people on that patrol
and there's 12 of us out on the ground right now and that thing which just happened was very very close
and it was almost at the moment i turned around that the the orange dusty smoke was clear in that
everyone was lying on the floor uh three of which were just out cold completely
and it was just this stark realization like [ __ ] we've been hit hard there and the
wall had this little small wall which obviously the device was hid behind you know you quite quick quickly know
what's happened as they've planted a device behind the wall which is facing the path
and they've run into the field at the end of a wire and just connected the battery and it's detonated on our patrol and
what it is is called directional fragmentation so it sprays across the patrol instead of coming up from under the ground
and everyone had been hit everyone and behind me was my corporal vicey out
blood coming from his neck blood everywhere kit weapons clothes just ripped to pieces
and you just think [ __ ] and there's no one else around like it's just you guys on the track and most of them are lying
unconscious on the floor and i started thinking i thought to myself i've got to get to vicey
so i started crawling i was in utter agony as well i just knew i had to get to him and as i
was getting nearer i could see that he'd been struck in the neck and it was doing as you would see on casualty
coming out at an angle and you'd i've been in these moments before i've been around people
which lost legs have been there for people which have been injured but there was people left and right
you know there was your team were there on this occasion everyone's just [ __ ] out cold and as i was just getting to visey a
marine came sprinting up the track from right at the bottom and just jumped onto his neck like with
his knee literally jumped onto his neck and just lent into him and he started shouting at me going get your [ __ ]
kit out now get your kit out and so i started fiddling around for my medical care and what we were trying to
get out was this thing called hemclot which is like um it's like a bandage
but it's uh it basically you stuff it into a wound and it expands um and i needed to get my henclot out
but you have to throw it's like this technique that you take out throw it over your shoulder so it doesn't get caught in the dust
and you have to keep it over your back so you can then put it in but you're not packing all the [ __ ] in around them
and uh he's like get your [ __ ] head glow out now and he's now obviously removed his knee from his
neck and he's got his fingers in the wound and he's trying to hold on and so i remember looking at her thinking he's
trying to hold on to his artery there and he's trying to pinch his artery going stop [ __ ] looking start putting it in there i was trying to do it and he grabbed it
off me went i'll do it hold that and then you're there like [ __ ] now i'm holding it literally
pinching it together going don't go don't go don't go and then the medic came up from the back and barged me out of the way and
start started treating him on the spot um and all i could do was just hold his hand and was just like pray for your
kids stay few kids stay with us stay with us and i just sort of 45 minutes flashed by
and we were on the helicopters and we're back at kambastian and they were going through triage and
i don't know miraculously they're still with us today um vice lost his leg in that moment as
well which is unfortunate darlow who i was meant to swap with took fragmentation through the temple
and is now disabled because of it but he's still with us and uh it's still great fun to be around
still marine at heart definitely and a few other lads taking it in the throat
all over their bodies and you kind of we meet up every now and then you know not so much now but we meet up we call it
the bangiversary and you look at these kind of reprobates which are still just got scars all over
them and you share the stories and you take the piss out of one another and vice always says to me he's like you
were crying when i was dying when you know i was like yeah [ __ ] was but it's
it's a part of that journey you know and it was a real intense moment but um
we signed the dotted lines we put ourselves in that position and um that's what happens in war at some
point you decide that you can leave or you would discharge medically or yeah it was um
i was discharged because of my hearing and it was something i'd hid from that day i knew my hearing had been affected but
the way the sort of hearing tests work in the military you can kind of blag it you press it every three seconds and it'll
it'll look roughly like you can hear it and i could never hear properly in my left ear and they changed the test uh several
years later and i got caught out trying to blag it and the doctor was like what are you doing
hearing test yeah stop doing the three second rule all right do it properly and did it
properly and then it was like you can't hear any left ear can you i was like i can hear something then let's have a chat and yeah we
sort of that was the ball rolling between being elite military to leaving the forces
not easy to leave as they say life change is very different yeah have something to aim for that's
what i decided this moment they told me i think i'd been up threw enough stuff up to that point to go okay this is what happens now
adversity strikes you've got to work out how to get through it um i i had a
i had this ability to coach people like that's what i did with my young marines and then when i worked with the
rehabilitation troops as well i thought i could do something outside here and
fortunately as i was sort of in my year of discharged gareth southgate brought his motley crew
down to meet us at the commando training center and i got to meet some pretty cool characters within the england football team before they went to the
Falling back into my old ways
world cup and that's where i realized that no this commander mindset thing can actually be transitioned and help people way away
from the military how do i do this but between that gap of leaving and you know starting your next sort of
chapter i was reading that you had you suffered with ptsd and you were you know because it would be
conceivable that someone would then fall back into the old patterns right like losing your purpose again and
then like losing your sense of orientation and was that a i think i had that
relapse or i know i had that relapse actually not long after afghanistan and i think
this sort of trauma you go through the way you may handle it
and what you've seen and all these things it's it's hard to get your head around is
really hard especially when you come home so quickly it's like bang explosion you're back in the uk i remember being at um
the queen elizabeth hospital up in birmingham and it had been 36 hours since we
triggered well since the taliban triggered the device on us you know literally two days ago we're fighting them
coming up to our doorway and then i was sending this sort of crisp white sheet bed white sheet bed looking
out over birmingham and my mum came in you know this woman who i admire so much and i didn't want to
speak to her i was like i don't want to speak to you i want to speak to you i want to speak to you i don't speak to anyone leave me alone because
i was still an afghan and i genuinely think even to this day
a part of me still stayed there and i could never get my head around it so when i when i
you know rehabbed and i was fit and i could go back to the unit i would drink a fight
i ended up getting court-martialed and i was suddenly spiraling back towards
that bend before the royal marines you know using that violent way of being and taking a
substance to sort of numb the pain which in this case was drink and again it was this ah back at square
one done this career all right just i've just fought for my country and now i've got to go and stand in
front of the judge which ironically was over an incident now i was defending someone else for when someone pulled a
knife out you know it was just it kind of felt like really i'm actually trying to do something good here and i'm
getting punished for it but that's uh maybe the naive way of looking at it but it it was
a difficult moment i had to begin to process what happened in afghan and it's it was just another moment of processing
as we keep almost coming back to is how we process stuff and afghan was tough you know we lost people
we we lost lives we lost people lost limbs a lot of people lost limbs there was this constant
battle in your head because of the ied threat you can never see him so you would walk out on the ground and think i wonder
where i'm gonna put my foot today and that that's like seven hours long every day that that has its toll on you like
constantly looking like that everywhere you go i remember when my then fiance we moved
into the flat together i was really mad at her for the way she stacked the bean cupboards i was like
what the [ __ ] aren't they facing the same way for and she was like why are you being like this they need to because then when you go to
say because you've got nothing for that because they just [ __ ] do it and now that's me
still like packing my kit regimently at the end of my bed what if we get attacked we need to be good to go
um and it's it's so hard to they call it decompression it's so hard
to decompress from that and you feel so pent and i remember coming back thinking
no one respects us like it seemed like the civilian world didn't care the london riots were happening
you know i can't even get it right on our own shores let alone trying to help other people out and you just felt forgotten and it wasn't you who felt forgotten you
felt the lives had been forgotten and everything which isn't the case you you know i meet so many people now it's like
wow that's amazing to me thank you so much for what you've done for the country and you get to this humble point now we're like yeah
thanks i signed the dotted line i'm so pleased you appreciate it um but back then it was this kind of
bitterness of why don't you care i've just done this why don't you care
and it took me about a year to get through that and i i look back now and think i think that's actually quite natural
for a lot of the marines that they went through and soldiers and then i got that turning point of
picking up my leadership courses to then go and work with recruits and that was it for me i was like even though i was dodging and
weaving the hearing tests i get to invest something back now and i get to
make the next breed of marines come through and that became your new sense of purpose right that was yeah and it's such a
valuable thing for me to do um we ended up moving the fam well my wife moved down pregnant we had zach
down there we made a life and i really felt like it was just it was
just brilliant to be part of their journey and see them progress and that's what the purpose became it was seeing people go from a to b
and being part of their journey to say i believe in you you need to believe in yourself and you
see them progress and even that comes to the england football teams like you can do this if you put your mind to
it and they got that close very close let's talk about that then so where is gareth southgate and you ending
up sort of working with the england football team just before they went off to uh russia yeah russia yeah yeah um
Working with the England football team
[Music] they came they came down to get a taste of our world that's how i was literally put
and the idea that they would come down and be immersed in some activities that we do they do some
of our assault courses but they'd also be introduced to the mindset that's what gareth wanted to do
most and he wanted to introduce them to our values again that was a really important part of their whole trip was
to know what courage looks like what does excellence looks like self-discipline humility integrity all
those words and um it was it was very surreal
you know i felt like a giddy kid most the time you know knowing that they're in the buses they're almost at the
training era we were we were up in one of the woods that we trained in and there was
me and four other corporals five other corporals and our sergeant and you could see the bus turning up and
we were like oh they're coming literally like we were like that like then you had a tough guy yeah that was it yeah troop sergeant was like when
they come over that wall don't forget like you gotta put it all on though boys all right yeah roger no worries taff laughing and
then harry kane appeared first and we were like like staring him down and then i just
remember tafar sergeant just went why are you staring at kane and just started bellowing at
him and get on your kit then and then we all jumped in oh god then south gate start moving
and um it was brilliant you've thrown that for a little while but actually they're there to understand
you and that's not actually who we are um i was you know surreal moment one o'clock in the morning drinking
or sharing a cup of tea with harry over a little fire talking about uh what it's like to score
in front of 80 000 people what's it like to wheel away and you turned into a fanboy yeah
massively and even when i was asking i was like ah don't ask the question but you know what he answered it in a way
that it wasn't to the fans it wasn't to the press he genuinely answered it which i've you
could hear it was like there's nothing like it you know the way you just the way you just expressed it
and so you can see him staring at the floor a bit as he's saying it as he's thinking about those moments yeah he's visualizing and so yeah that
was amazing and but then he asks you is like you know what's warfare like um
and again that sort of stumps you a little bit like wow the england captain's just asked me what it's like in afghan
you have this conversation it was just so normal it got that normal that i started moaning to him about
holiday prices because i just paid for the family to go to lanzarote on an all-inclusive and i was like and
then and in holiday prices through the roof at the moment i just paid three grand today
and then i'm thinking he's just got that from dubai he's probably just done all these things but he was so humble with it and it was
a really genuine organic conversation and we found that with a lot of the guys and girls which came you know they
bought the whole set up with them kit man to gary southgate and everyone in between
and they just wanted to see our world and see what values mean when you're going through different things you know when you're in
the mud and water it's very easy to be in that position and feel like oh this is [ __ ] but when someone's going
this is what courage looks like this is what this looks like this was what this looks like you know
it helps frame it in a different way and it helps show you what your ability is what you can do what what that meaning
of that word is and that was something that we kind of encouraged them to take to the world cup
and i think they did i think they did and there's been a lot of press around it as
well so yeah they did well would have been awesome i i've read one of your uh
your podcast all your interviews whatever where you said um had they beaten i think it was croatia
wasn't it you were set to go on pierce morgan's show the next day and explain yeah exactly how you how you helped them get
there but then they lost we had a focus literally yeah so i'm cheering going come on england
we're made after this come on yeah yeah yeah it's a hard time um but it didn't happen
but hey you know later i think it was january 19 i went and did the keynote for gareth at
the football writers awards at the savoy and i did mention and and i know a lot of people phrased it
but there was an element of pride to be part of that journey and say you know they didn't bring the
trophy home but they definitely bought football home and i think it's really unfortunate that we didn't have it this year you know
that oh gosh they were last year so much whatever it's meant to be last year wasn't it
2020 it was yeah some wasn't yeah yeah it's almost 20 20 euros yeah so but it i thought i thought it brought
the nation a little bit closer personally you the other thing i was intrigued by was i read this i think it's a
r a um sort of strategy per se which um you've adopted to help you deal with
Your ARA strategy
difficult situations could you could you explain that a little bit yeah so
ara was almost kind of made up on the spot when i was trying to think of some things to deliver to people
and and i've written ara's quite a focus within my book because we all encounter adversity we all
encounter challenge and one of the biggest things i've noticed with myself and then when you look at it objectively
with other people when people encounter adversity there's almost that fight flight or freeze mode people go
into there's oh i'm going to take this on or i'm going to bail out and hide in the ditch or i'm just going to stand there
and there's a lot of research around most of us actually freeze we just don't know what to do um
and for me going through a lot of experiences you know where i really go back to is
when we lost our first person in battle d we lost eno and we lost dina within five minutes of the 24 hour operation we
literally ran off the back of the helicopters at sort of 4 30 in the morning we were going to take a village
and helicopters went trooper crossing the ditch to get into the village stepped on an ied
blew him up and he was gone um and he died there and then on the spot
and two of the other guys were injured severely with him as well and you just i've used it a lot within football i call it three nil down within one minute
and it's that moment of wow we're on the ropes already we've
only just started this thing we're on the ropes how do we deal with it what do we do and i remember you know these
incredible emotions go through you when someone gets killed you know you feel anger you feel rage you feel you want to cry
you do you want to just take a knee and look at the floor and go i can't believe he's dead let's mourn it right now
but you've got 16 17 quite hungry taliban on the other side of the wall who want to kill you as well
and the worst thing you can ever do is is go into a village or an area such as that
emotionally charged if you go in emotionally charged you're going to make cataclysmic errors
that could be that you're so sad or overwhelmed that you're not concentrating you miss that person in
the corner they then take you or someone else out or you go in there angry and when you go and they're angry
you make serious mistakes and you don't have to look far and oppressed to see that happened and that happened on our
tour um and that emotion gets in the way of dealing with the situation and what i
like to more frame as thinking with clarity it's so hard to think with clarity during adversity and that's
why i spent quite a bit of time thinking well what is a quick framework we can just jump to what have i used
an ara simply stands for accept remove adapt the moment something happens then
on the spot it's happened and then it's instantly gone so someone dying on the spot
in combat is there's nothing you can do about it there's nothing you can do about it the most
effective thing you can do is be it your highest standard strive for excellence get up on that roof and do what you need
to do to the people which have hurt your comrade that's that's that's how you should be posting it what is still
the strategic operational part of what we're doing here and
the the accept part is very difficult for a lot of people to do it's very and i still struggle with it
now myself but actually having that little framework to go alright okay this isn't good how do i
accept the situation has happened or happening how can i process it and without dwelling on blame or exactly
or you know or bitterness is there another one like say your business is shut down because of
kovid you're angry at boris johnson you're angry at everybody and you dwell on that so that's the first hurdle is as you say
accepting which is tough tough but it's a mindset you know
this isn't for me this is not something we should shy away from you know the moment say it's tough does that then allow people
to go well i'm not doing it then just i'll just turn up sympathy can sometimes show up as well too much sympathy maybe
a victimhood the except is it's happened what is the next move what is the next thing i need to do
um we lost almost all of our work with our business last year we we were working in talks and coaching
and doing workshops overnight gone like i could have sat there which i did for about half a day going
oh what the [ __ ] where's that all gone but you can't how long do you sit there
doing that for before you just start to take a spiral down or where do you actually go right what can i actually do with this where
can i make a decision we could become so emotionally wrapped
up in covert as well the pandemic alone like i've i've expressed a hell of a lot of empathy and
sympathy to everyone i work with saying this is probably one of the toughest things we've all been through collectively in a long time we're
literally playing stuck in the mud for real you know we're grounded and it
does become quite an emotional place doesn't it people losing jobs things going wrong but part of ara is this remove emotion
is not becoming emotionless like not asking you to be motionless it's for me in combat it happens you've got
to deal with it then and then remove the emotion get the anger and the sadness out the way do you know what we'll do we'll deal with that later no we've got to deal
with that correctly as well this is where some people make the mistake of bottling up i'm going to come back to that later but
i need to get on with my job and that part is that adapt part okay how do we adapt to this situation how do
we adapt to loss of life there what was his role not who is he as a human what was his role
what do we need to do to fill that role for now while we're here um i was telling you about that time
when we were having to use mortar fire as almost a curtain as the taliban metroid commerce on that
final operation the person calling in that mortifier was vice my commander
and he's not a mortiman he is not trained on the radio to do that the day before when we lost those five
guys who were by a grenade one of them was the mortiment and he was the one who needs to call that stuff in we didn't have him
you have to learn to adapt and we could sit around and say oh we've lost our morton and we're [ __ ] now
or we can go right he's gone let's not cloud our judgment let's think with some clarity and get
the emotion out the way okay how do we adapt to this situation and i've had so many people which is really
genuinely humbling because i kind of didn't make it up i just wanted to put a little bit of an acronym on what i
use and give it to other people and i have so many people get in touch saying ara because it's a simple process
maybe in the morning you know when you stub your toe stub your toes like the quickest like ah you just want to go band's eye on the
table don't you but you just go stop i've stubbed my toe yeah yeah it does hurt yeah i need to be a little bit
less emotional with this table and now i need to adapt to the fact that my toes facing in different directions
so we all look at the table now but it is it is something you know something just happens and you
have to be able to go all right that's happened how do i remove the unwanted emotion i call it
unwanted emotion what's the bit that's going to get in your way if you're making the right decision the anger the um
the sadness whatever's there and then you have to adapt i always think that the first l you take and when i say l i
mean loss the first l you take is often involuntary nothing you could do whatever the second
l you take is often voluntary so like the pandemic happens wasn't your fault we get that
but then you dwell on it so much and you refuse to adapt and you you become a victim of circumstance you
become bitter and blaming and you don't adapt as you say which was your choice
and that leads to another l which is your business goes bankrupt and so i always think like the first i always say that's like you don't have to
take the l twice the first l is you know involuntary the second one is your choice and that's i think the similar sentiment to the
importance of like getting rid of that unwanted emotion focusing on the task at hand finding that calm
within your within the chaos and being proactive and as you said as the sort of military values
being cheerful because that is uh optimism is a very important uh emotion to experience in times of
real chaos you have to believe that there is a way out um and that's super interesting i i i
was reading through your story as well more recently i read about i think you touched on this earlier
this joy that you've now found in running during the pandemic yeah yeah tell me about that i don't like it
The joy of running
as well do i just say well i started training in march as well and i've been training all year so i thought that was really interesting
you mentioned earlier that getting out and feeling the air and the endorphins and yeah i um i was never a great runner in
the marines not really no i was more the one who'd put the big backpack on and just be able to plod on um
your son could give you some tips yeah that's who i train with now um i just i i really
i like the idea of just it sounds so forrest gump but just running there's i have no
reason to run i i think during the pandemic i found it a nice bit of an escape you know we're locked inside all the
time uh you're on zoom call after zoom called the kids are downstairs and
um you just need that moment to yourself and and i just love being out there running i just it's interesting my business
partner and um his wife asked me the other week she's like why why do you run
i don't know you know it got me pondering so i think maybe i'm a little bit better prepped to answer your
question um but it was i use this word escape loosely because i
think i've used the word i i've escaped before in the past through
drink and drugs and the more sinister things escape now is actually just to be of
myself for a while and i find that and and you would have found this on your own business journey
is it's so full on all the time it's just someone wants you for something your phone pings or
you know i'm i use social media i don't have the biggest following but i use social media because it's part of
what i have to do you know promoting a book and things like that i don't really want to be on it i actually kind of like my reserve
lifestyle but i have to give you something to show you what i do um which i was listening to i think as
jake talked about on your podcast this morning it was really interesting it put my ears about thinking about it
but running is i don't have my social media on when i run i'll if i need to i'll record a video to
be like oh i'm not running um and post maybe sometimes but i just like being out i like feeling a bit of
the pain in the shins and in the feet and i like running further than other people do not for time
but that idea of what my corporal said to me in training 0.1 better every day i i really enjoy
just striving for that excellence and i have found since leaving the military it's really difficult to feel like
you're constantly striving for excellence it seems like there's more challenges there than there is
success to be honest it's like one thing after the other i've done this within the business are we oh that's good oh
something else come along which is difficult to deal with now isn't it brilliant um but for me being out running is that
ability to escape i live in a wonderful part in the southwest you you know that area very well up onto
dartmoor up onto the southwest coast um you just just incredible places to be
and take the dog out running and i actually found in probably the last year or so
it's an incredible space to think and i run back and i actually pick my post pace up at the
end because i cannot forget that yeah you're not running back home through the door and you're like what about this with this yeah that might
work but it's um it's just a place to be free you know and i'm not real
a gym bunny i don't really i go to the gym i kind of walk around it look at a few things do the odd pull up and then
go home i love being out on the road and i love being out on the muddy trails as well
slipping around getting wet getting muddy it's just fulfilling isn't it i think
when i was in the military that was all the time and now it's not when i left when i when i got binned from the military
my last final day i came home i laid on the floor and it sounds i say that about social
media i don't really like using it but there's this this is almost like tradition in the modern military now that when you leave you post like your
favorite pictures of your career and then a post um and you acknowledge the lads and then
and then you post it out and i was writing my post and i was picking the photos and i was blubbing i was just like
crying on the floor but to myself and i'd kept it in for so long i didn't think i was going to do this and then i
was just in utter tears because it was this just this excitement that i was going onto this new phase of
my life but also that's it now i'm never going to do that again and that made me who i am today
i lied on the floor and i think part of the tears was i'm never going to go mountain training again i'm never going to go
out to the states and go in the mojave desert again i'm never i'm never going to go to afghan again i know it's difficult as it was it's an
adventure and then crying crying crying and my wife kicked my foot which she's actually literally hoovering next to me
she's like you're going to get up but i was like oh we had this little moment together and i kind of like gave it all on the
plate and then i went and booked marathon to sarbs yeah of course you did
because i thought i've got to have something i've got to have a challenge which will uh fulfill that
so now you're running this business looping what is lupin doing you i'm guessing you've really felt the
Your business
pain of running a business and starting a business because it's a startup right during the pandemic what
is lupine doing and how's that process been so what will help me explain lupin even
more is probably stepping back into the marines for the first time when i put my hand up and said i don't think i'm that well at the
moment i think there's something that might be wrong i'm bottling it up for so long you know come back from operations
keeping it all inside guilt you know two ieds which went off behind me injured people and you carry that with
you and so you feel like you can't talk out and there's a stigma of don't talk just keep walking forward and i remember
that moment of thinking everyone around me looks really strong and tough and they just seem to be shrugging it off they're like yeah we
did after i'm crack on come on then that's and i'm inside i'm like ah i don't feel too good at the moment
and it things happen and as i said i got in trouble and things didn't go to plan and then
finally i put my hand up to one of the lads and said i think i've got issues here
and he went yeah same here i have as well what you've been seeing and what you've been hearing and it was like
whoa just instantly like you're not you're not alone and you feel this as well and like having this big conversation
a couple of beers doesn't always help but a couple of beers for us at that moment was like are you do you feel weak and all these
things and um that forever has stuck with me you know marines
one of our values is integrity and integrity means to be able to go i don't feel too good today it doesn't
mean you don't go into your job but if you have an awareness of how i'm feeling you know maybe you can back me a bit more
or you can help me a bit more and that's going to come back i'll help you out which was where it began with how can we
show it better and that's all it was was let's make lupin something that just asks someone in the
morning how they are they respond on the platform they already use so slack teams integration
it records that data pushes it through to the dashboard you then log into your dashboard you see
your graph of how you've been recently compared to last week as well and then
you get to see the close people within your team as well not the organization you can see every team in the organization if you want to but you only
get to see the people within your team and even within our own workforce and also
with our alpha and beta testing people are reaching out to other people because they see their amber
and it's i did one this morning one of our teams amber straight on the phone you're right yeah
i just had a long night with the kids last night i'm okay i just need a coffee but all she wanted was that question of
all good yeah and it's yeah i'm okay and then on the odd occasion we get no i'm not feeling too good today
take today off them and that person is going to be more productive next week we can't bend over for it we know that
in the business world people have to be in stress states we have to be under high pressure other times we don't but it's how more transparent can we be
and i think what the pandemic's actually showing us is we can embrace this sounds amazing and
i even know someone ran an organization with many hundreds of people um being able to see sort of an early
warning sign yeah for situations developing call it the pulse is that what you call it yeah it would have been super
super valuable you think about it from a business perspective you stand a chance of losing good people because you weren't aware that they were
potentially on a bit of a downward spiral in terms of morale yeah and uh losing good people cost you a ton
of money sounds amazing and it sounds like a very long way from afghanistan
do you know what i mean going into tech because tech is a beast in itself it's a whole nother i've worked in tech in san francisco and
stuff and it's a whole nother language and culture and philosophy and stuff so to go from
you know your early years to to bouncer to afghanistan to you know helping the
england team to now working in tech is one hell of a journey in a short amount of time so incredibly impressive
you've lived many lives in your in the one that you've experienced and i actually was thinking
as you're telling the stories today how honored i am that someone like you listens to my podcast i was like i think
i need to listen to your [ __ ] podcast you're i hit a low moment last year when we dropped investment
and we took these overheads like we went from like what was it three so about six grand a
month overhead to suddenly thousands and thousands of pounds because we've got a team in an office
and we're looking at our reserves going outside two months worth then we got four months and we were getting no after no
afternoon because everyone just shut up didn't they no one wanted to invest because protecting your money and i listened to
yours and dan murray certains to just take inspiration
i don't know this world well enough and you guys do and i was listening to it going done it they've done it they can do it i
can do it right okay and low [ __ ] moments crying into my wife's arms going why have i done this i've put the house
at risk kids at risk this is [ __ ] it's better to be worth it but i want to make it happen i want to see
a change out there i want to see a change in business i want to see your businesses be more open
it's not about raising the money it's about fighting to raise that money so i can make that happen and we raised the money seven days
before missing payroll we raised half a million just over half a million and it's listening to your
stories it's listening to others was the moment for me where i'm like just keep going just i listened to the ones this
morning i was thinking about this struggle that you guys were talking about and i was like sometimes struggle's good yeah it gets
you to dig deep and sits in the trenches and i've been in the trenches and we've now been through the trenches
and yeah it's inspiring you know when i got the nod last week i was like huh
that's a massive compliment i i think i you know i've learned a ton from speaking to you today um i know you produce content yourself
you've got your book which is awesome um so i just wanted to say thank you because it's been one hell of a
conversation and i think this when i reflect on it this is really the reason why i started this podcast was to hear these
stories and and the just the diversity in struggle and overcoming and persisting
and purpose and reinventing yourself is the reason this podcast exists and you exemplify all of
that so thank you so much for your time today ben and you you know you said it was a
um a high moment for you to come on this podcast but i feel that um going the opposite way and i really
really mean that i really mean that because you're an incredibly impressive guy thank you
people ask me for book recommendations all the time and i finally got one for you it's a book called happy sexy
millionaire which is authored by me um i spent the last almost two years in jungles around the
world in costa rica and indonesia in solitude writing this book it's the most
important thing i've ever created and there's this crazy thing when you write a book because
you spend so much time pouring your heart and soul into it and everything you know and all of the revelations you've had in your life
and then there's this barrier which is that people have to buy the thing in order for them to get that thing that
means so much to you i wish that wasn't the case it's just the way the industry is and in order to get that distribution and to
get it on shelves you need a publisher so please please please if you can if you've ever liked anything i've
ever produced this podcast my instagrams anything i've ever said read this book there was no ghost writer
i wrote every single word myself there's some real surprises in there it's an honest sometimes hilarious
incredibly vulnerable hopefully valuable recount of my life my journey everything i've learned across across
the way and really the answer to being fulfilled to being happy and to achieving success
it is the most important important thing i've ever created so i implore you to go to amazon now or wherever you get your
books and get that pre-order and everybody that pre-orders the book because pre-orders in this crazy publishing
industry count as way more than just a normal sale if you get that pre-order i'm gonna put you into a group with
everybody that's pre-ordered it and i'm gonna send you some exclusive stuff so the first things i'm gonna do is a series of voice notes which i think are
um are gonna be pretty powerful i'm gonna give you access to some tickets which nobody else will have and i'm gonna do everything i can to
thank you for for giving me that sort of nine quid of your money or whatever it is happy sexy millionaire you can pre-order
it everywhere now and if you do get that pre-order please do dm me because i'd love to thank you myself

emotional [Music]
what an amazing story what a cruel amazing twisting career
my next guest has one of the most fascinating journeys through business and through life that i think i've ever heard she spent
her life surrounded by a couple of people that that i actually consider to be inspirations of mine one of them is
sir david brailsford who's been the sort of elite performance coach and cycling coach for team sky which went on to win more than
they were ever expected to win he's the i guess the author of this this marginal gains thinking which
changed how business and sports teams function the other person she was surrounded by throughout her career is
steve peters who a lot of you will know from the book he authored the paradox which redefines
from a psychiatrist's point of view how our mind works and where our behavior comes from and the other male figure in her life
that's important for the story you're about to hear is her brother david miller who was this incredibly
sort of highly regarded cyclist british cyclist who had this cruel twist to his career
where he got involved in the doping scandal which really left a stain on british cycling as we know it
Your Brother
and david miller recounts the story of him being sat in this this cafe shop with david brailsford and
being tapped on the shoulder by three men wearing suits who would then raid his house and find syringes and that was
one of the key moments in british sporting history where i think in many respects things have never been the same and we always view
our elite performers with an element of skepticism but this is fran's story and fran's story is one of tenacity it's
one of success it's one of jumping off cliffs and figuring out how to build your skydiver
as you fall her story is inspiring it's peculiar she went from starting her own business
to spending i think 12 years that team sky worked her way up to the very very top and when it became team ineos she became
the ceo leading a predominantly male dominated industry and then out the blue
in the middle of a pandemic when retail was on its ass she decided that she was going to change lanes and
become the ceo of bell staff which is a brand that has been struggling that's been making losses and then was then
kicked up the rear end by covid she's brave she is unusual she's inspiring
she's tough she describes herself or at least she respects the idea of being a difficult
woman something we'll talk about so without further ado i'm stephen butler and this is the dire of a ceo
i hope nobody is listening but if you are then please keep this to yourself
[Music]
fran i i've done a lot of stalking of your your history your past your professional career and uh i was stalking your
twitter feed the other day and i saw a quote that you'd um you'd written i guess in in honor of your brother um david
who is a a world renowned professional incredibly accomplished cyclist and the quote said following a boy who loved it
so much he got absorbed into the fabric of it and has spent a lifetime carrying the weight of the cruelty wonder brilliance and
tragedy it would bring him um is ultimately what got you into the world of cycling
i was slightly taken aback by some of those words cruelty wonder brilliance and tragedy
can you explain why you chose those words oh it's a big opening question um
yeah i mean listen my brother was was unease a very talented guy he was we were so when we
were about 10 and 12 my parents got divorced my dad went to live in hong kong and my mom stayed in the uk i stayed with my mum my
brother went with my dad and so when we were like kids we'd cross in the air so he'd come home from hong
kong i'd go out to he'd come home i'd go out and he had nothing to do when he was here because we'd moved so we had no
he had no friends around so my mom entered him into a cycling club um and he'd go and he'd do the time
trials he was super good at it by the literally from like 15 to 19 he'd gone from never really riding a road
bike to being like courted by nine of the biggest teams in the sport and he got signed very young by a big
french team and they kind of made all these promises to my mum about it and he was obviously you know he was a kid he was
desperate to win the tour de france and to go and fulfill his dreams and he totally fell in love with the sport and he was completely enamored by it and in
the space of five years he'd gone from this excited talented you know
brilliant kid to this damaged incredibly sad deep deeply deeply shamed
young man and it was like how has a sport done that like how is this is
it it's a game right like sports a game it's entertainment how is that something that's fundamentally to entertain people
basically ruined him like taking him down to the core of who he was and it just and then he built himself back up and
he's you know he's gone on to do incredible things but it was just a the sport has had this unbelievable
impact on my life on my brother's life on my life on everything the decisions i've made and
everything else i guess that's why i chose those words give me some detail on you talked about
the sport bringing him down to his core and ruining him what caused that
ah so he went into the sport in 1998 he turned pro which for any of your
listeners who know anything about cycling was the festina year so it was the year of the big fastina scandal where they raided all the hotel
rooms and the guys all kind of protested and sat down on the road and only a few of the sort of teams were
able to finish because so many guys got pulled out of the race and it was it was the dawning of the epo
era so it was the era where they discovered effectively athletes and coaches had discovered
that you could use epo in the same way they used build to use altitude training to perform to increase physical performance um and it
was just a transformative drug it was they couldn't detect it they couldn't test for it and they brought in
some interventions like a hematocrit test so if your hematocrit went over 450 you'd be pulled out of racing but it was
a it was a health check it wasn't a doping check and it was rife basically so when he this young sort of
dreaming kid went into the sport he he genuinely thought you could do it clean you wouldn't ever have to cheat i don't
even think he really knew that much about doping at that point in his life and pretty quickly he realized that
actually most the guys at the very top were doping that the doping was endemic
that the expectation was you were dope that that was what you would need to do if you wanted to be a
professional and you wanted to be any good and he resisted it for a really long time like he he was a time trialer which
is you know race against the clock basically only racing yourself and so he really stuck to his time trialling
because he was like i can do that like with the technology with aerodynamics with focus on my training it's a shorter
period of time there's less requirement to kind of be as cardiovascularly supreme as the
guys who are trying to win the tour are um and so he did very very well time trialling went to his first tour de france and won yellow
like day one um and but but what was happening was behind the scenes
this sort of erosion of his belief that he would be able to do it clean his his recognition that actually if he if
he really wanted to take it seriously and try and win the tour he was going to have to cheat the people around him that the kind of
network and the framework around him was people who weren't looking out for him
weren't thinking what's best for him weren't trying to work out how to make help him fulfill his potential they were trying to work out
how to get him good enough to make enough money to win you know for them as a business he was a commodity in their business um
and i'd like i haven't actually ever told this story but francois mcgrane who owned coffee's which is like a
company that basically does telephone loans i don't know what they do now probably you know online loans but um he had he
met my mum so when we had all these teams that were sort of courting david he met with my mum and he promised her
that he would look after him like promise looked looked her in the eyes and said i'll look after him and and yet
he did nothing like he he built a team that was allowed to just get on with it he sort of closed
his eyes to it and actually when the big investigation into cofferdie started it was francois mcgrane who effectively
called out my brother he was like i think moncuti is probably clean but david miller i wouldn't put my hand on my heart for
him and it was like you [ __ ] do you know i mean like yeah and you and he he's 24 years old
like what he's the only exposure he's had the professional support is your team
so if that's what's happened it's your team and p don't get me wrong david absolutely has to take responsibility
for his decisions in that but i for one know that when i was like 19 to 25 i wasn't making the best
decisions i've made in my life and i had some influential people around me who had they told me to do things or
if and it's that insidious thing isn't it it's a bit like kind of i was listening to a book the other day
about um decision making and you know how if you look at like nazi germany and people say oh they were just following orders
and there was this big study done apparently where they put people in a room and they told them like there's going to be some there's
going to be a student in there it's a study i can't really anything with my gran or someone who did the study and you're going to press this button
don't worry because to shock them and the shock's going to get bigger and bigger and bigger and it's like and
65 of the people would have pressed the button that would have effectively killed the person in the other room and it's like what and that's the human
condition right so this idea that we that we would make a better decision or we'd make a better choice or that we'd do it differently
people seem to impose that on guys who decide to cheat in sport or decide to make these like well how dare you make that decision it's
like if you were in an environment in a culture where that becomes the norm where that becomes what people do
this idea that you're going to be the one person who and don't get me wrong i know there are other people who do that and fair play to them that isn't that's
impressive you know that you've been brought up in a certain way to enable you to make those decisions but david was he was fragile he was
impressionable he was a dreamer he was doing something he'd always wanted to do he was passionate and desperate
desperate desperate to to be a success and i think he just got taken down the wrong path
you know and you do you feel like you went through that with him as a close family
um i'm trying to understand the impact i had on you being the sister and i know you you guys are very close yeah i mean the
impact it had on me was i was he never he never came to he went to my mum and told her that he was dating and
and they they they sort of she just said well just stop just come home like don't
worry about actually you know sort of at the very beginning he said there's a lot of drugs and my mom was like well just come home go to art
school don't worry about it it's just cycling um and yet he stayed and he persisted and then i think when he
was in 2001 when he eventually made the decision to kind of cross the line as it were he he had he
spoke to my mom i think in that period and she was just like you you know you have you have to stop you have to come home
and he was like no i want to do you know i want i want to be successful i want to go on this journey he never had that conversation with me
all i ever saw was the kind of it was like an erosion of him do you know me it's like i could tell something was going on i wasn't an idih i mean
it's like he's probably he's probably cheating but he we had all been indoctrinated into it
as well it was like well that's kind of you turn a blind eye you kind of think well you know he's
he's doing really well he's you know on the cover of all the magazines he seems happy-ish and it was only when he he'd
come home in the off-season and he'd come come and stay with me and my mates living in london
and he would he would drink so heavily that you'd be like okay this isn't normal you're a professional athlete and he would the
the depressions he'd sink into and the self-loathing that he that would come out and it's like in vino veritas you
know that kind of this and i'd be like what on earth is going on here and then eventually it kind of you i
realized what was happening and i kind of felt responsible for never stepping in and saying something and never being
like you don't need to do this i was just like well you know if you're happy and you're enjoying it and you're doing well
who am i to judge kind of thing um so i think as a family it kind of bonded and pulled us apart
like we kind of we all turn a blind eye to it i think we've all got our demons to deal with from that perspective um my dad
i think was had a very different view of it all my brother and my dad sort of you know have have an ongoing difficult
relationship my mum and my brother are very close i'm very close to my dad and my mum but you know so as a family we've kind of it it's
definitely created divisions because everyone had a different view of it and then in terms of the impact on me
i went into cycling i ran my own cycling agency i was working in the cycling industry i totally rode the coattails of
my brother's success and i was like [ __ ] okay now it's all gonna come crashing like he got arrested and
put in prison and you know i was like oh god this is not ideal and i literally remember speaking to him
afterwards and he'd just come out of you know 48 hours in custody and he was
like and i remember it being like a week and a half before the tour and he said to me don't worry france um they're still
gonna let me ride the tour you know you're like oh it still makes me want to cry because it's like david they're not gonna let you ride at all
that's not gonna happen and i think it you show that little boy inside it was just like ruined by it
sorry it's still quite emotional but yeah so it just it just impacted everything it impacted all my decisions because at that point i was
then like [ __ ] now i've got to go into the office the next day and i've got to stand in the velodrome events and
i'm david i'm not david miller's sister the kind of glory front cover of the magazine i'm that i'm
the sister of this shamed cheating lying horrible human
being who no one likes anymore and who has disgraced british cycling and is is a
you know he he's like a complete social pariah and i'm like oh [ __ ] okay now i've still got to go and do my job and did you feel
that you felt your judgment and yeah massively people would re and it was in the days of forums you know like
my forums were a really big deal and i'd be like okay i'm just going to have a little bit of a look on a forum and see
what people are saying and i'd see people i work with commenting you know people who were at the velodrome who were like
doing the timing at my events or and they all you know literally like people wishing him dead
but you know it was just like it wasn't cool and yeah i really felt i felt it for him i didn't i wasn't embarrassed because i
was like you know it is what it is he's made a set of decisions he's paying the price for it
um but it was at that point sort of about six months after that i was like okay i probably can't represent him anymore
because if i have to have another conversation with a journalist an ignorant journalist about
this kind of binary right or wrong conversation where you're like this is not how life works i'm gonna end up punching someone
in the face so i should probably stop doing that speaking of punching people in the face
no um i had it just that felt like a good turn towards one of the things that i
“Being a difficult woman”
saw you share online which was this article about being a difficult woman
and the importance of um dispelling this sort of like niceness
aura that women typically um are associated with in business that i think the article was suggesting holds
them back how important has that been especially you know
when you were dealing in an industry which is pretty much full of men and you got to the very very top as the ceo of
ineos how important was it to be willing to punch people in the face being a little bit difficult at times
as is such an interesting question because that whole being a difficult woman i think is the older i've gotten the
more i've kind of explored feminism and explored kind of the sort of female condition the human
condition it's like women are judged very differently for for behaviors that in men would be seen
as completely normal so you know there's a sort of famous kind of meme that's the sort of you know
men are assertive women are chippy you know men are confident women are arrogant you know it's like
the same behavior gets viewed very differently to a very different lens i've never filtered myself it's not been
anyone who's ever met me knows that i don't really come with a filter and i think it's really really important
that young women recognize that they don't have to apply a filter you don't have to be the quiet one in the room you don't have to
i remember reading um cheryl sandberg's book about lean in and it was like um you know when young women will come
into a meet room and they won't sit at the table like they physically won't sit at the table they'll sit back at the sides and i was like [ __ ] off who does that
and then i'd go to meetings and i'd be like i've noticed that like the 19 20 21 year old younger women in the
room they'd wait for the guys to sit down they'd be like what the [ __ ] are people why are people doing that
and it you just until you realize it's happening you don't realize it's happening and so yeah i've always felt quite
strongly that you just need to be yourself be confident be willing to get get told you're a [ __ ] get told you're and don't
get wrong when i was younger i was actually a bit of a [ __ ] i probably i probably didn't um measure that
behavior i was a bit like well it's just who i am and everyone needs to suck that up and actually you still have to be polite and have
manners and you still have to recognize that being aggressive is actually just sometimes being aggressive it's not being assertive
and that balance i think i've learned as i've got older but i think it's yeah i think women are judged totally
differently for behaviors that men would be absolutely it would it would almost be uh sort of
respected in a man for certain behaviors and in women it's it's reviled there'll be there'll be young women listening to
this and they'll be thinking you know i'd love to be like that fran and i'd love to be a bit more you know assertive and
etc etc but i just you know it's just not who i am and so kind of the question that popped into my mind was where did that you know some
might see it as confidence but it's like a confidence in being your true self right where did that do you know where that came from in you was it
you know is there experience is it something happening in the household is that your mother was taught you that behavior your father
yeah i think it's probably half nature half nurture like i think i i you know my mum tells a story about
when i was little and i said you know i'd just literally go off and speak to people like she she'd be sat at
you know the bar you know on a holiday and she'd want to know what's going on with a couple over there she'd be like francis go and ask them what they're
doing you might be like okay and off i'd go and chat to them so i think i've always been very innately confident and that doesn't
that's never gone away um but equally i think i've been very lucky i've been very
blessed i've worked with people and in and around people where i've been allowed to be myself i've been allowed
to kind of grow up and make mistakes and fail and be a bit of an idiot and get told you're being a bit of an idiot and
not not have that be a judgement upon me and limit me um and i think it's really interesting
that kind of you know being assertive or being being your true self has become a bigger and bigger thing that people talk about
and actually being your true self doesn't mean you have to be assertive and confident it means you have to be your true self and for a lot of people that is a bit
more insecure or a bit more and that's fine but you can bring that to the table you can be an emotional person you can be
lack a bit of self-esteem and just be honest about that so for me i think it's just partially how i was brought up but more
the people i have been surrounded by on the journey of my life and career i've been incredibly blessed that they
have allowed me to make a lot of mistakes and correct and
course correct me as i've gone on that that point about being assertive and being direct and
being open and honest you know what um i was actually chatting yesterday about one of the how i've changed over the last 10 years
from like the kid at 18 to the kid at 28. and the the key thing i said to my team is like the big change that i've seen on
myself is i'm way more direct yeah and i'm not sure why i'm doing that i'm like i don't know whether it's because i've got so many things to
do that i'm trying to save time at all times um i'm way more honest with my feedback
and there's this sort of fine line between being an [ __ ] and being honest and direct and trying to be time efficient and like realizing
that sometimes your feedback or the way you say things might hurt people's feelings but that's secondary to what
we're doing here um how have you toed that line i imagine from what you've said it's more
difficult as a woman to to because people will you know they'll they'll determine the same behavior to be a really negative thing
but how do you toe the line between being like direct and firm which is so important in my opinion
when you're dealing with teams and especially if you're dealing with teams of uh you know high testosterone testosterone
men how do you toe that line and and also i guess the more important question for me is do you agree
that it's an important trait to have okay so have you read a book called radical camber
it's up there on my bookshelf somewhere but i've not read it yet okay so yes i do think being honest is important
i think being a [ __ ] to people is not acceptable and so i think i i think honestly can get veiled
sorry being a [ __ ] can get failed by i'm being honest right like well i'm just being honest and it's
feedback and you should take it it's like one of the sort of best lessons i've ever been taught
and one of the most influential people in my life by a mile is steve peters um he's a forensic psychiatrist yeah and
he always says like you have to be compassionate like even if you're telling someone they're
losing their job or you know if you're having to give someone really honest be compassionate be be sensitive to the
fact that you're going to get a better response from someone if you're just nice to them you know you can say some really really shitty
things to people and it get a horrible response or you can say shitty things but get a really positive response back
because you do it in a different way so i think it's really crucial to be honest it's really crucial to be authentic
but that doesn't mean you get a license to be a [ __ ] and have you is there a place
for aggression and anger and being annoyed in business in your view
no not not ever uh well you can you can feel those things but i don't
think you can inflict those things on other people no i don't think that's acceptable it's um it's remarkable how many of the world's
most sort of admired leaders when you read their biographies and stuff you find out how much of a [ __ ] they are like steve
jobs was a good example where i was told you know from a friend that they basically had to put him in his own
building and warn people that worked in that building that you know the way steve was and elon musk in his biography is
is very very similar but uh the reason i asked you about radical canada is when i read it it made a lot of sense to
me about about people like that so that she basically describes this quadrant where effectively you've got
how much you care about people and how sort of willing and honest you're able to be and so if you're very
very honest but you don't care about them at all then you you're basically an arrogant [ __ ] and if you really really care
about them but you're really really honest then you're radically candid but if you really really care about them and you're
not honest then you're kind of it's almost like a malignant empathy do you know me it's like i'm going to be really nice to you
but because i'm not going to be honest with you you're not going to develop and so that for the first time and she said in a business
it's better it's way better as much as it's counterintuitive to be the arrogant [ __ ] because
actually the feedback is what's important so if people are getting the feedback and they're being told the truth they are like
some people might be able to handle it but the people who can handle it will develop and get better it's worse to be empathetic and not be
honest than it is to be an arrogant [ __ ] and i was like oh that's why there's so many arrogant [ __ ] in the world
because actually it does work like on the and genius you know it forgives a lot right when
people are geniuses they can behave very differently and they get away with it because they're geniuses and
there is merit in that and i think if people are very very very honest with you and give you brutal feedback
as long as you're like able to take it on board you'll get better but if someone's lying to you and saying
you're doing a great job stephen don't worry about it it's absolutely fine because they don't want to hurt your feelings you're never going to develop
that's true you you switched from working over to bell staff um quite relatively
This idea of labels
recently um and i was reading i think i was listening to one of the the podcasts you've done and you talked about how
you'd worked in cycling pretty much your whole life it was your pretty much your everything in terms of your professional experience um i've
also recently quit my job and uh how does it feel uh everything you feel everything right you feel
you know it's bittersweet you feel excited on one hand you're unsure about the future but i trust myself enough to know that i'll figure it out because i
always have um but yeah all feelings um i guess my question for you is and the bit that i found particularly
interesting is people will do a thing for ten years for five years whatever and then they'll tell
themselves that they are that thing they'll like give themselves the label i work in cycling i'm a cycling person
yeah it seems to be incredibly difficult especially if they've been in that industry for a long time to then
take on a different label you're now working in fashion and it comes with a whole new set of challenges completely outside of your
comfort zone to some extent in some ways how did you make that switch how did it feel tell tell me all about
it um it's again i'm going to reference steve peters but i remember because i was
so wedded to my job in cycling like i lived and breathed it i loved it i cared deeply about the people
it like had this it was so wrapped up in my identity but i hadn't necessarily got a huge amount of
satisfaction out of the job over the last two or three years for a whole host of reasons nothing to do with the team just personal
development wise and every time i spoke to steve you'd be like well then why don't you just leave i'd be like because i don't know who i am if i leave
the cycling team do i mean and that was a much longer conversation than that but what effectively i was saying
was i don't know who i am if i'm not that and he he said over and over again
you will be whoever you go on to be that's not going to change you are still there
you're letting this thing influence all these views about yourself you're letting it influence what you
your value your worth your you know your sort of substance your contribution to life like
you're letting it's a job it's like it's a job and i was like you don't get it you don't understand it's more important
than that and you know what when i got asked to go and do bell stuff and i left and it broke my heart like i
cried my eyes out and i started a bell staff and i i sat feel awful saying this but within
48 hours i was like oh my god i love it here and i love the people here and this is brilliant i'm so excited and actually
it is just the job that was just the job and yes i miss it and yes it was incredible and yes i
loved the people and i still love the people but it's just the job it's not my family it's not who i am
it's not my identity it's just a part of my life and i'll be eternally grateful for having done it but now i've
got a new challenge and i was like i'm really pleased i did it when i did because everyone i think
had been saying to me for a long time you know once you leave you'll be like oh i should have done this five years ago and i don't feel like that at all i feel
you know i did that for the right amount of time i loved it i've banked it moving on to something else
and it's that point there about thinking that that job was your identity that i think really like holds people down yeah um because you're right jobs are
they're fat friends they're community they are purpose yeah as you say they're your identity um
and that's dangerous like that's dangerous you know because actually they're not they're not they're not your
identity and no matter how much you love it no matter how passionate you are about it if you
it then this would be the lesson i would sort of give to myself the sort of it doesn't matter it's a job you're
being paid to do it it's a job and and i would have railed against that even a year ago
like no it isn't it's more important than that and you know as soon as you as soon as i left i was like yesterday
and my brother always you say to me your team aren't your family your team aren't your family and i never really understood what you meant because i thought well they are my family
like you know what i mean i love them they are my family and they leave you like oh no what he means is your family are there forever your family are
wedded and you can't un-pick your family they they're something that's whereas when you leave a job
you take away the memories you take away the happy times to take away the good stuff but you're the fabric of who you are doesn't change
and that's what i try and do i just finished writing my book on there's a chapter on this idea of labels and me trying to resist these labels
to make sure that i continue on my journey of challenge and keep myself you know stimulated and i don't get to
you know a certain age and feel like i'm having a midlife crisis because i don't know who i am and i can't leave and i don't have any skills
um and to really sort of realize that the label i have is me it's like steven i'm a guy with a
bunch of skills and experiences and i can apply these skills and experiences to a bunch of different challenges i'm not social media ceo you know what i
mean yeah and that i find really liberating so i quit i started djing we're doing this pokemon this theatrical play i'm
just trying to do all of the things that i think i shouldn't be able to do right but speak to me about the challenge so
The move away from cycling
you you decide to take this job at bell staff and it is a big challenge it's it's widely reported that bell's
staff has been it's had you know struggled across the years it was recent it was acquired and i think 2017.
it was making losses then and the losses of i think narrowed over the last couple of years to some extent but it's a big challenge right
a big challenge it would have been much easier to take a different job so first and foremost i didn't take it i
was i literally had a conversation with my chairman ineos um about you know maybe maybe over the next
couple of years i want to think about moving on and doing something different and when we when dave b comes back from the tour this was in september so when he
comes back from the tour at the end of the season i think i'd like to sit down and have a chat with my chairman and my boss dave
about my future that was the sum total of my conversation and literally a week later i got a call saying jim would like you to be the ceo
of old stuff and you know with the best one in the world when jim ratcliffe asks you to do something you don't kind of go
let me have a think about that and i just thought okay well what an opportunity and and i went for it
but i didn't i wasn't looking to change i wasn't i hadn't like planned to move on so that was in some ways whilst it was
quite traumatic sort of three or four weeks of because i literally i got phoned like on the 16th of september and i was enrolled
on the first of october wow so it was like yeah like two weeks of just why did you want to have the conversation though when they've
got back because i wanted to so i wanted to i'd sort of been thinking like i said about the conversation with steve about kind of
i'm not sure if i'm happy doing this job anymore and i'm not sure if i'm fulfilled i've kind of reached the point sort of
middle of last year where i was thinking you know what i do need to start thinking about my future
in my life and my career and i don't know whether that's always going to be in cycling and i don't know whether the ceo of the cycling team
is 100 y1 so i wanted to speak to my chairman first to kind of sound him out
and then when dave gets back from racing i don't want to interfere with the racing have a conversation about my future so i
just literally put it on the rate the radar of the german i'd probably be a little bit out of frustration for myself as well but like
i want to feel like i'm moving this on because otherwise i'm going to sit and not do anything with it do you know what i mean i'm going to
did you feel stagnant yeah in the role is that the main the crux of what you're getting at what was the person if i can relate uh i think
i felt so i had done what was effectively 20 years in pro
cycling it would like you say it was all i knew it's all i'd done i know everybody in it pretty much you
know i've been in and around it my whole life i'm david miller's little sister it's like you know part of my dna we got
we and i loved being part of team sky like we did that for 10 years and it was i sort of always say cup in the middle
like blue blue and i absolutely loved it and then when skye said they were out at the end of 2018 i was like right i'm
done i'm out of here i'm not going to do this anymore so i went straight to baby i was like it's been amazing i've loved it but i'm
gonna once the team stops being sky i'm gonna go and he was like okay cool
i don't think he believed me he was like okay cool and then we he said to me look would you help at
least find a new sponsor let's see if we can find a new sponsor he's a bugger like that so i was like okay i'll try
and help you find a new sponsor and then i'll move on and then you know february comes 2019
you know he's he meets jim jim decides that he wants to acquire the team you know
he jim's arguably one of the most successful businessman in the world we went and met with him and talked
about you know the design of the kit and everything else and i was like i'm gonna get sucked into it um and then and then one of the other
senior managers in the team decided to leave and go and work for another team and debbie was like would you stay you can be ceo
which was what i really wanted to be it's a massive opportunity and i was like okay i'll stay
and i think that was the point of the decision there that i was like you know this is a big career decision
to me that i'm staying again i told on my mates i was going to leave i was like you know this is it this time this time i'm going they're like
okay um and so i stayed at ineos and then we worked on
the one five nine project so elliott kip togues up to our marathon and dave obviously was the project lead
on it all he was the ceo my boss um but he very sadly got prostate cancer in that period so he was off doing the
tour de france then he had to go and have surgery and so i took on like a deputy ceo role kind of delivering the sort of vision
that he'd come up with and he structured all the performance team but then i was doing the delivery of the event everything from kind of working with the
london marathon team to supporting the performance guys to doing all the engagement piece and everything else
and i loved it as i felt like i was working 18 hours a day for like
what was about five six weeks in the build up to the first of all the test event and then through into the actual
event and i just loved it totally different totally new challenge new people different approach fresh it
was i was like i was on literally cloud nine i couldn't have loved it more and i was working so hard like i was
literally crippled by it but i loved it and i came out the other side of it not so much just because
we've done it obviously i mean that was incredible but it just really made me realize that i was just going through the motions in
in the cycling job i was just i was ticking over i was really comfortable i was good at it i loved it i was happy
i liked the people but i wasn't growing i wasn't developing i wasn't learning new stuff and i wasn't kind of and i'd
been going at a million miles an hour you know sort of in the team like on all these stuff where i was
helping other people develop and helping other people achieve their potential and helping other people kind of
you know rescue their reputations or enhance their and i was a bit like what do i want to
be doing like why am i i'm not none of this has been about me and even actually cycling is a little bit about david you know what i mean i
was on kind of this journey to sort of save young british talent from going through what david went through and it's
like actually what do i want to do maybe i want to do something different
and that just planted a seed really and i think i probably went this way to the gym and you know if i'm honest i went because i
thought i want to go and do something different i'm ready i'm ready to move on i'm ready to do something that's not this anymore
and it was all it was almost like a kind of involuntary i think everything else about me was like just stay because it's
comfortable and it's easy and you get good money and it's you know nothing's gonna nothing but that's gonna happen
but my like soul was like you've got to you've got to go and do something else now and it was literally like in the space
of two weeks it was like boom i'm i'm out of here so it was that see it almost identical to me in the sense of something niggling
at you and then for me there was like a trigger moment where i was like i was like sent an email
yeah yeah yeah and then you just send it and then but that idea of being able to throw yourself into uncertainty it's
like throwing yourself off a cliff when you were like cushy in the house on the side of the cliff and you was like oh my god i'm gonna jump
and you're throwing yourself off into the unknown in in the hope that so you'll build your glider as you
fall and then land somewhere better and a lot of people can't do that like most people can't do that
how do you how did you feel though about because because i found it really traumatic like i kind of i felt like oh first of
all i felt quite out it was like i'm out of control of this now i literally said goodbye to my team who i'd worked with for 10 years and
got on a train woke up the next day and went into bell stuff and like hi i'm your new ceo and i and that the trauma of kind of all
of it it felt i had to move out my house i had to go and do say goodbye to people do have a different email had the same email my
whole life like all that kind of stuff it just doesn't shouldn't be that important but felt really significant
how did you feel did you find it traumatic or not so i i'd already i'd quit business when i that i was my baby as
well when i was i started business 18 quit that one when i was 21 so i'd been through it once before so when i earlier when i said the key thing
for me was trusting myself i've done this before i know the feelings i know that i don't know what my future holds
but when i did that when i was 21 it led to this even bigger business that was 200 times bigger and 200 times more
successful so that was that's been this guiding thing in my life like i dropped out of university after one lecture and it worked out
so when you have those case studies you think you know what i have no idea what the future holds but i'll back myself to figure it out
now and um that's because i've done it like three times before so i imagine the next time in the future if
ever that you decide to jump ship and build stuff or whatever you'll have that case study or that evidence in yourself that you've
been yeah and that that i think will calm you a little bit the first time i quit i was all kinds of emotions and worrying
and not sure what i was now and all those things but slightly easier the third time i'm a bit
of a prolific quitter i think it's a really underrated skill yeah people talk a lot about starting as if it's the be all and then and end all
of success but quitting is the thing you do right before right you start something new so yeah yeah i've been a heel fan for a long time as
you obviously know by now but in the last six months i've got a real opportunity to get to know the people to get to know the ceo of huel
which is james to get to know the founder which is julian the teams that agonize over the ingredients that go into these amazing
recipes and i can honestly say with my hand on my heart my appreciation and admiration for huel and its people
has multiplied by a factor of 10 because and this is these singularities not only are they nice people
but because i've seen firsthand how much they are non-negotiable about the values of fuel they will not
compromise they will not compromise on the the goodness of the ingredients that goes into the products the amount of
proteins and minerals and these things regardless if they can't get to where they want to get to with the products
they will cancel the product i've tasted products and they said we've not managed to make it this we've not delivered on our promise of
veganism we've not added enough fiber so we're canceling it and that sort of non-negotiable set of values
has made me realize that they have my back when i choose you i was reading about this winning
Winning behaviours
behaviors role you took on which is a very curious title yes it is what was your remit as the
head of winning behaviors that team ineos so it was it was when it was team sky okay um same time um
so basically 2010 we first started racing we started the team and he was begun the journey of starting the team
in 2008 off the back of the beijing games started racing in 2010 we were [ __ ] like
embarrassingly [ __ ] and we've been like smoking mirrors and like you know we're kind of we had the big bus and we had all the money and we
were sponsored by sky and it's like oh we're going to be amazing and we were rubbish
so we totally reset everything and dave beats be fair to him he's like a master of okay we're going this way it's
not working we're going somewhere else but he's he's incredible assay and so he totally shifted the way that we're going to run
the team we took a totally different approach we started to be very successful in 2011 we'd obviously set the objective when we
announced the team that we were going to try and win the tour de france with a clean british rider in five years and that was in start
2010. bradley won the tour in 2012. so within the space of two years three years effectively we've done it
the following year chris froome won it and we had gone from being this team that was like
on a mission like heads down arses up and we were going like there was nothing was going to stop us we were full-on
and so when people sign up to that you know people are signing contracts in 2010 with a team that doesn't exist that has never raced on the road before
that comes from a track background that's full of brits who aren't historically that famous for road cycling they were
they were signing a kind of you know they were they were adventurers right they were like these bold ambitious this is a bit batshit crazy but we'll do it
when people were signing contracts at the end of 2013 they were signing with a team that had won the tour de france twice that was
arguably the most dominant team in the sport that had gone on you know sort of achieved this inc these incredible feats and they had a
different expectation of what they were joining to what we were and we suddenly realized that actually
if we were serious about continuing and continuing to be successful codifying what
got us where we were was going to be crucial and we'd also seen for those of you listeners who are
cycling fans we'd had the bradley wiggins and chris rooms kind of divide so brad had obviously come first in 2012 but freemiu had come second
bradley didn't even bradley never rode the tour again so bradley didn't ride in 2013 from he did and he went on to win and he
started to see this divide in a team where it's like well i'm team bradley or i'm team freeman is like no check your paycheck your team sky and
that that kind of actually who are we what do we stand for what do we expect from people what do we need to be able to do to be
the best in the world of this needed codifying and it needed it needed a way of a sort of charter almost to tell people this is
how you're going to have to do this and really it was about eradicating losing behavior it was about saying to people
bitching backstabbing saying you're team through me or your team brad or you know criticizing people behind their back or
whatever that's not acceptable but you being head of losing behavior would have been [ __ ] so we called it [Music]
so it was all about creating a set of behaviors for the organization
that enabled us to say to people this is what it means to put this jersey on this is what it means to be a part of
this team it's not just about you know the glory and the winning this is hard graft this is
you know it it was arguably the hardest thing i've ever done you know working in that environment it's it is unrelenting it is i mean it's
brilliant and it's amazing and incredibly good fun but it's hard hard work
and you've got to go all in you know this isn't this isn't for the faint-hearted and so the whole winning behavior thing
was about creating an environment where we could give people the parameters that we expected them to live by but also ensure that they felt
supported safe able to deliver their very best in an environment that is actually very
high pressure so that was my job effectively helping dave create the behaviors in the first instance with the whole team
and then helping keep them alive within the business what were some of those you mentioned a couple of them there about not being a backstabber and
understanding the importance of hard work what were some of the other um let's just focus on losing behaviors
some of the some of the traits or some of the threats to success that you'd see in the team
i'm thinking this from an organizational standpoint as like yeah that's worked in business so we separated them into five different
areas we had self team um communication continuous improvement
and uh what was the other one oh it's gone anyway so quickly how
quickly you move on right um but the the so they were t itself was all about identifying your own
managing your own emotions being in control of your own emotions so a losing behavior of that would be losing your [ __ ] you know being
aggressive and arrogant with people not being able to recognize when you were too emotional to be in a high performance environment we have this
the whole chimp model you know steve's philosophy around that is there's nothing wrong with being emotional there's nothing wrong with having a
chimp but you have to know when to get out the room if that's what's going on don't bring your emotion into an environment
where you're expecting people to perform at their very best so that kind of management itself absolutely critical
and then team was all about the impact that you have as a team member you know i think people kind
of think teams this kind of static thing that you create a great team and that's it it's like as you all know having won six
very successful businesses teams like these organic ever-changing you know you could bring one person in and have a
massive impact on the team you take one person out it can ruin a team do you know me so they're sort of
the dynamics of a team and your role within that are crucial so you know not wearing a team kit you know
wearing a slightly different trainer you know um criticizing the team not buying into the sort of collective
opinion not sort of dave b has this really big thing about he'll listen he'll seek counsel from everyone he'll listen to everyone's
opinion he wants to get to collective opinion he wants to get to a collective view of what the right direction is but
ultimately if we can't get there he'll make the call and then you've all got to be on the bus non-negotiable if you sit in a meeting
room and you agree with something and you say yeah okay whilst i don't agree with it i buy in you know what i mean i've given you my
point of view you've said it's not the way we're going to go but i buy in and then you walk out the room and
you're like i don't know if i can buy that that is that is the one of the worst losing behaviors you can have
because it's insidious and it it goes around you know a whole organization can be destroyed by a is like a virus
so things like that fascinating i am you don't do a lot of public speaking right you used to haven't done
it for a while now actually yeah but like white collar crime i think sometimes but yeah so i i sort of i used to love doing it like i
really did used to love doing it but i've also i feel like the bit that i talked about which is some of the stuff i've just
said i feel like that's a bit of my past now and i want to build a new build a new
path for myself before i figure out telling people about it if that makes sense yeah so i don't want to take talks on social
media anymore if i can help it to be honest for the same reasons yeah i mean you talked a lot about dave as well so david brailsford um
Key qualities to success
and very fondly i think a lot of your tweets from my stalking were were centered around him and things that
he was doing yeah what are some of the the key qualities of of him that have made him so successful
and his mindset or you know oh big question i mean him and steve peters
are the two most influential men in my life without a shadow of a doubt um you know they they are symbiotic
because they are i think if dave hadn't had steve he maybe wouldn't be who he is and i think his steve hadn't met dave he
maybe would be a slightly different version of himself so they they complement each other brilliantly dave is
is a brilliant man manager he's he's incredibly visionary he's very brave you know you said the
thing about jumping off a cliff and hoping you get your gliders you put dave's like the king of that dave's like we're gonna go we're gonna
go and achieve that and everyone's like [ __ ] off and he's like come on let's go and he and people are like okay because
he's so he's so bold with it he's so confident with it that he and he's an incredible leader that people would
literally i mean i would have followed that man off the edge of a cliff and i think that he has that quality in him you know he's unrelenting
you know anyone who's working he's difficult you know like all geniuses are he's a he's a tricky guy
he's why um how maybe is a better question in all kinds of ways you know he's very
i think i've spoken about it on other interviews i've done he can be very um he can be very particular he's very
detail-oriented he's he wants to know all the facts before he makes a decision he'll he'll go out he'll like go after
something for age ages and you're like oh my god makes a decision i'll get on with it and then he'll make a decision that's
totally off to the other side and you're like oh so doesn't make sense yeah or it's or
it's brilliantly genius because you think oh all that work that you were doing and the decision i would have made and just got on with it and made the decision
would have taken us that way and that would have been the wrong way and it's and it's that kind of you all the way through my career with him
he would do that and i'd be like it's just he's just clever like that you know he's he's
ferocious appetite for learning he unrelenting work ethic you know expects incredible sets
incredibly high standards and expects people to meet them and all people can right no absolutely
and he'd and you know we openly say that it's not all people can there's nothing wrong with not being able to meet them
you've got to be compassionately ruthless you know that's what he always says which is basically if you're not if you're not you set a standard and if
people can't meet them then they're not in the right organization and it's best there it's a bit like the arrogant [ __ ] it's
better to be honest with them and say you know what this isn't for you than to kind of allow them to keep
failing i think that can be very cruel to people you know if they're in an environment they're constantly trying to be better but they just can't do it that's yeah you talked a lot
about when we were talking about winning behaviors about this important about high work ethic and you've expressed that dave has a
relentless work ethic as well um you you've probably observed how this narrative around hard work has become
somewhat toxic over the last couple of years and now i i you know almost feel bad sometimes when i'm
what i'm saying that i don't know how i would have been successful in what i've done if i hadn't have worked hard in fact i
don't really know anybody that's really successful in their discipline or their sport or whatever that doesn't work
hard so i know we're not trying to give anyone depression and anxiety by saying that
you know they have to be a hustle porn star they won't be happy but i still can't get to the point where i
will tell anybody that hard work doesn't matter yeah it really really matters to me and it's
i can't imagine and you know what i was in the gym last night and i was thinking sometimes words
really mess people up right so this i like when people say work they think of me on like a in a factory like
or in like like i don't know in a mine hammering some rock all day but i was thinking because i enjoy my work so much imagine if i just changed
the words of my hard pleasure yeah you know what i mean yeah yeah can you have too much of hard pleasure
um it's interesting as you were asking me the question i think that my respect because i actually i similarly read something that you'd
written about you you feel a bit of you feel a bit bad that you sort of
hear heroes the kind of i'm working yeah they're kind of 18 hours a day and i'm going out
about it yeah bragged about it yeah and and i sort of think i get it i get why people feel like that
and i think there's a difference between being exceptionally busy and working all the hours god gives and
thrashing yourself and all those sorts of things and working really hard with purpose
they're very different you know what i mean and when you're working really hard with purpose and you're passionate about what you're
doing and you love the people you're working with and you're enjoying the the sort of striving for the achievement
there's no shame in that that that's for me that's absolutely part of motivated ambitious people that's what
you want them to feel and people used to know what's something in the work life balance there isn't a
work-life balance my work is my life and i make no i make no sort of excuse for that
i love it i'm passionate about it i enjoy it i have it's hard pleasure you know it's
brilliant and i like the challenge of it and like you know i chose not to have kids i don't have a partner it's it's
the passion point of my life is my work and that's right but that doesn't mean i need to be you know not going out and seeing my
mates it doesn't mean i need to be up until midnight tapping out emails you know i mean i can still i take days off
i you know i live a normal life but i work really really hard i've i've also struggled in the
Relationships & Work
relationship department yeah and surprisingly never you know been that good at relationships i've never been able to
hold a relationship down um i can't really see how it happens necessarily i hear you talk to me about that part of
i was gonna call it sacrifice but when it's somewhat intentional yeah when you're aware of it it's hard to call it sacrifice just doesn't
motivate me i know that sounds awful i'm not motivated to have somebody in my life i'm not motivated to be like
i want a partner i want that companionship you know we when i arrived we were chatting about how this
environment that we're all living in actually i i love being on my own i i'm very happy in my own company i'm very passionate
about what i do and i think that fulfills the space that maybe other people
have other that have other passions for right and so yeah it's never been a it's never been a goal of mine i've never dreamt of the
white wedding i've never wanted to and there's never a bit of me that sits at home and thinks i wish i had someone to sit and watch television ever
that doesn't doesn't even cross my mind and my mates are always like do you not get lonely or do you not worry and i'm like
no i feel like i should because it would make you all feel better but and you know about five or six years
ago because everyone was on at me all the time i'd like did a bit of dating did some internet you know use some apps everything else i
was like this why am i doing this i'm doing this because society wants me to do this i'm doing this because my mates want me to do this this is [ __ ] uh
if it's right if it's right it'll come if it's not it won't did you did you date at all throughout the last
i guess decade did you here and there but it's like kill me you know kill me now you know
that kind of small talk oh god it's like my idea of hell on earth going and meeting a stranger
having small talk slightly awkward with kind of one end game do you know what i mean and it's like
and i'll know within two minutes of that end game's happening and then i'm like i don't really need this bulldog for an hour and a half yeah we don't
need to dress this up so yeah no i just yeah it just never yeah i did a little
bit but it's not it's i'm not looking for that and i think if i'm looking if i if i wanted if i wanted to get married if i wanted to get into a
relationship i could and i'm not i'm not adverse to it but i'm just not out seeking it and i i think you get what you look for
right yeah so other sacrifice um i don't think it's a sacrifice by the way yeah generally i need it no i i
do you know what the reason why when i was younger i wouldn't have thought it was a sacrifice and then i started reading all this stuff about
the importance of like you know 18 19 and 20 even 24 year old steve would have thought you know i don't need to [ __ ]
anybody and i can just i'll be fine i'm a lone wolf yeah and then i fully went for the whole recluse
thing like wholeheartedly and i was broke so i had no choice anyway
so i was broke and i was just not this renegade that was determined to build build businesses and then i started reading some stuff
and it talked about the importance of like meaningful connections and relationships and i realized that i didn't really have those and if i was going to become wildly
successful then it would just be me and my louis vuitton bag set up inside of my house and i and then and then i
started to change my perspective and thought steve you know what you need to create a little bit more openness or balance towards that stuff
so i tried a little bit more but that doesn't i see i see i have incredibly meaningful
relationships and incredible connections i have my friend i have like five or six friends who are
my world i mean i'm incredibly close to them they are they're kids they're you know my god children i feel very very connected i
don't feel isolated in any way i don't feel like i'm missing out or sort of not having to and i actively
participate in the lives of my friends kids and in my friends lives and i think that that's my connection that's my tribe you
know i mean they and you know i would go to war for them and it's it i just don't think that that added bit
of a companion for me right now you know i'm not saying not forever but i'm not sure that bit for me is
something that i need and i think that it's that there's a difference there because i do agree with you i think you should absolutely have to have
connection the human condition is to feel connected to feel part of something to to feel you know sort of the that you'll
have a purpose within your community and i think having your own community and having your own tribe is crucial
i don't think that needs to be through companionship with one other human being there's a pressure that you talked about
the societal pressure you know and i've got to be honest right i'm going to be completely honest because i would be really dishonest if i didn't
say this i have been guilty of when i have a friend who is struggling
in that department feeling like i need to help them because again that's my own world if you
pressed upon them i'm thinking well in order but in order for me to be happy i would need that so i need to make sure you have that thing right
that pressure especially for women is intense post 30 and it causes a ton of anxiety i see
it in my direct messages from strangers um not easy well it's interesting though so
when i'm 42 now and the pressure drops away because i think you get to the point where people think it's rude to ask if you're going
to have kids because they're like can you still have kids okay right fine you get to that age right but but certainly all through my
30s when you're going to settle down do you not want to have children and i and i feel very very lucky
that i feel the way i do i've never really had a biological clock that's ticked ever and i've never felt the need for
companionship of one other person like i said my tribe is very important to me but
and i think that's potentially biological so i think i'm lucky i don't because i do i have friends who
you know they would they're desperate to meet someone they're desperate to have children they're desperate to move on to that bit of their life and
i've just never felt like that so it and i feel very lucky because of that because i think if i'd have felt like that my whole life would be very
different does nurture play a role in that because i know it did for me yeah my my parents were toxic for each other
like watching my mom scream at my dad for seven hours a day every my mom's like this african nigerian woman and that the this
decibel she's able to achieve is like gold medal worthy she is unbelievable at shouting right and she can do this
amazingly high energetic scream for seven hours a day without flinching and i watched that as a kid growing up
my dad sat there this passive english man who didn't say a word ever and this african woman just
just torturing him with this loud sound and me thinking like the lesson i
learned was relationships are prison and for this is the lesson i like for a man
you are trapped and it's torture so any time when i was young like 16 a girl would like me and i'd
chase her and i'd try and get her on the playground whatever minute she said she liked me deep feeling inside of me of like escape
quick so i would like come up with all these reasons why girls that i just spent the last year pursuing
why we were not right and we couldn't be together and she needed to leave me alone and i i didn't notice that until i was
like 25 and then i started to work on that part okay but nurture does that play a role do you think in your
views on relationships or men or whatever or women or whatever i think it probably plays a role in my view of
having kids because my mum was adopted so my mum literally didn't know who her mom and dad was she
was kind of picked out of an orphanage by my grandparents um and never hadn't until she had david
and i had never met anyone who looked like her you know like we all you know connect to our families because we've got families
similar features whatever she'd never had that and so my mum loves my brother and i with a kind of
wonderfully oppressive kind of dominate and it's you know she she just loves us
with everything that she's got because we're we're for a whole host of reasons but also i think because we're the only physical
you know sort of biological connection she's ever had and that love always used to scare me a little bit
you know not from her but i used to think like i've got dogs and i worry about my dogs and i've got
like nine god children i've got two nephews and a niece and the minute they get on a plane or they go i'm panicking like what if the plane
crashes what if they die what if it's like i can't handle it and i'm like jesus if i'd have had my own kids
that would i wouldn't have been able to handle the that amount of love i know that sounds ridiculous but i
think that always played quite a big part for me that i was like the responsibility of it the constantly
having to worry about it the constant all of my female friends who have kids
they live in a state of almost permanent anxiety because they worry about their kids all the time in a in a love way you know it's like
that wrong love you have for a puppy um but and i don't think i ever i've
never felt that i wanted that in my life i never thought that i needed it and i never felt that i wanted it i always felt quite like
no i'm good i've got the right amount of love going on in my life i don't want that additional
responsibility and burden in many ways of having something that is always ever present and and would
cause me i think quite a lot of anxiety is that in part because you have so much
responsibility and naturally honestly worry that comes from your other love in life which is
your career yeah for sure yeah because that's the way i feel it's like a kid as well i really have yeah yeah and it's why i don't think i need a
companion because i already have i get so fulfilled from my job i get so
i get so much from that and so much from kind of working in and around people and having that kind of
i've got the community of my friends and the community of my work and i think those those two things i find very fulfilling
so the idea of having a companion or children or anything else in the mix of that didn't really ever appeal to me in
interest i mean i was i was engaged to be married when my brother got uh served his band say 2004. and i've
been with the guy for like i don't know seven years and i remember like moving into our how we bought a house
together in shepherd's bush and we moved into the house and i remember like vividly putting the key in the door
turning the lock and thinking i don't want this like i don't want this i loved him to bits he was an amazing guy but i was
like i don't want this kind of i don't want to be in a normal life with a normal husband and a
house and kids and i just didn't want it i wanted something different i've got a tattoo that says a lifeless ordinary i just wanted to just do it
differently and i don't know where that came from but i've had it my whole life that kind of i just don't
i just didn't feel the need to conform to society's kind of pillars overcame you go to university
and then you're going to get a job and then you're going to meet a guy and then you're going to get married then you're going to have kids i was always like not interested
any idea why no and i'm fascinated by it because i feel very blessed because of it because it's like i say i think it's it
given me a freedom that a lot of people don't have had you wanted it had you wanted that
you know you know the typical life that society says people have to live and followed all the timelines and
milestones do you think you would have been able to achieve as much as you have i was in my head my ego was going i
would have been amazing at it i'd have been like a boss um no because
i don't think you can i don't i you know i'm i'm a feminist i'm a you know i'm absolutely passionate about equality i'm
passionate about women's ability you know women can do anything that men can do and should have the opportunity to do that but i equally don't think it's possible
to have it all i really don't i don't think you can have and i know there are women who do and perhaps off to them i think it's
incredible you read about these women in the city who've got like five kids and they're ceos and it's like
fair play to you but i couldn't do that because i would feel constantly compromising and i don't like compromise
and you're obsessive a little bit in terms of your focus i don't like compromising i yeah i
probably am obsessive makes it sound a bit like it's it's i'm not in control of it i'm in control i'm aware of what i'm doing
but it's a bit like i so i'm we were talking about having a peloton and you know i kind of feel if i'm going to go all in
on my fitness and my health and get lean and everything from my 40th i got like down to 65 kilos i was like a boss
and i was like all over it but then i was a bit like crap i've got to do my job as well and i sort of feel like i'm i'm not great at doing
having two or three focuses i can i can go at one thing and be brilliant at it but if i start
adding in layers of complexity like i can stay on top of my health i can stay on top of my fitness
but i can't if once i start going down there right i'm gonna get super lean i find it hard to manage my work do you
know what i mean so i don't know there's obsession or whether it's just my opinion i'm myopic sure yeah if people were to you know people they
How to be successful like you
read about you online and they say you've been the ceo of this amazing sports team you ran your own agency before that
you're now the ceo of bell's staff a lot of people especially young women are going to think that's exactly what i
want to do they're going to think that's amazing there's always a disclaimer that comes with all of these things what is the
disclaimer in terms of the cost of the success you've achieved what are the things that you know if i'm
you you would turn to me as a as a young aspiring ambitious person and say by the way before you follow in my
footsteps here's what you need to know you know i wouldn't have fun because i think yeah i really wouldn't
i i feel exceptionally blessed i feel really i love what i do i've loved the journey
i've been on like all the mistakes i've made and like i said at the beginning you know i've been very very lucky to be allowed
to make all kinds of mistakes and then not follow me around it's like i've been kind of
carried and supported and encouraged to to fail and to try and to do stuff that other
people just wouldn't have got the chance to do so i'd be like no go for it like don't don't
worry about it like don't worry about [ __ ] up don't worry about making mistakes let's get on with it what would you tell me though that i had
to have in terms of my qualities would you say okay well if you're going to follow my footsteps then you're going to need a little bit of this and a little
bit of that it's so hard isn't it stephen because you can't follow in someone's footsteps
that's true it's impossible and that's the thing i think that people you know i would say you can't you can
have your own footsteps and you can go into your own thing and jesus if someone says to me at 25 this is the career path you're going to
follow i've been like there's just no way there's no way i could tell someone how they're going to do that because it's bonkers i explain to people some you
know people like oh you know tell me a bit about your background and i i hear myself saying it i'm like that's
bonkers so i don't you can follow in someone else's footsteps but i do think it's like a bit like the beginning i was like you
know just be yourself you know be nice to people be approachable
take the opportunities when they're given to you recognize that sometimes things are scary and you're going to have to do it scared
and actually change is sometimes the best thing that can happen to you and you know all those things that you read
in cliche memes on instagram they're pretty much true you know what i mean it is it's and you've just got to
take that approach in life because you're not going to get another one but it's not easy fran it's the stress
of your job it must be pretty intense you're running now um a big company that's you know in the
process of like sort of turning themselves around and kind of reinventing themselves to some degree and i know the stuff that you have to
deal with because i've dealt with it yeah but i'm not curing cancer but it's i feel like a lot of it's relative
right still big problems are big problems for relative to the challenge you're facing so like that's i guess tell me about
that perspective though because a lot of people would be like oh my god that's a tough you know you're in a tough job and there's problems everything i'm so
lucky steven that's the thing i think you're like i'm so someone you know an incredibly successful
man bought a business three years ago and has said to me it's not working very well i i really like what i've seen you do in
the two years i've been exposed to you could you go and run it for me it's like yes yeah i'll go and do that
what a great opportunity and i'm and i'm just it's i just feel very lucky and yeah they're big challenges and you
know brexit at the moment's bonkers and all our shops are shut because i've covered and i'm having to meet and work with new people but
you know i wouldn't change it for the world i think it's i think i'm i think if you can and this is where steve peters has been so powerful
because he's like it it's a bit about it not defining you you just just try your best dude and that was you
know what uh jim ratcliff actually text me i text and say thank you very much for the opportunity we're not friends we don't like hang out
thank you so much for the opportunity this is incredible because i hadn't spoken to him about it at all it was all via sort of you know determined in the business and he just
he just replied and said fran the only thing i can ask you to do is your best and you know when you're like
the freedom of that the the op and that's what dave b has always been like he's like you can just do your best friend you can't there's nothing more
you can do in life and i think if you release yourself of expectations and what's the standard you've got this
don't get me wrong i did not feel like this for the last 10 15 years this has been in the last probably two years
that i started to realize you know what what is the worst that's gonna happen like what's the worst case scenario here
bellstar folds let's say or when i was in the cycling team we didn't win the biggest bite race
or you know whatever as long as no one's dying as long as nothing's you know that as long as people are okay
the people are okay i'm kind of i'm kind of all right with it you know it's
just there's life and one of the things i mean i completely i completely understand i tend to believe that anything caring
about anything beyond your best is like anxiety and worry and useless yeah it's like that mark twain quote isn't it it's like there's a men they'll
spend their whole lives worrying about stuff that's never actually going to happen and isn't it that's what worry is because you're worrying about something it hasn't even happened yet or that sort
of um there's a brilliant renee brown podcast where she talks about foreboding joy
and it's this idea that you something really exciting is happening but all you're thinking about is [ __ ]
what if it goes wrong so rather than enjoying the joy of it the kind of you know she
uses the example that she's on the plane to go to her first oprah appearance and she's like i spent the entire plane journey
there worrying the plane was going to crash then i spent the whole car journey there wearing that i was going to make a mistake on the show or say something
stupid then i spent the whole time in the green room worrying i was wearing the wrong outfit and at no point did i stop and think i'm
going on oprah this is amazing and it's that isn't it it's like i think you can burden yourself with all this
responsibility and all these kind of negatives and actually it's like we just
want an opportunity why don't you try and flip it try and see the world in a bit more of a positive light and i feel like that
that's something i'm really working on for myself because i just think like i say we only get one of them you get this one opportunity i've been very
lucky there's nothing in my life touchwood that has caused real trauma or you know that i feel that
i would go back and change and i think when you're halfway through that's not a bad place to be
Belstaff
you took the job uh in the middle of the midst of covered yeah it was october the 1st first started october
the 1st that's brave in retail i know i'm crazy that's well
yeah yeah brave no but being positive being optimistic about it you're coming into this business and it's um i mean it's been smashed in all
directions by all things um what's your what's your what's your what's your approach what's your strategy what are you thinking
i mean at the moment well the first three months in the business i just wanted to get to know everyone there so i did one to one to everyone
i think it's really easy to kind of go into business with preconceptions of what's gone wrong and what what you'd fix and i tried i spoke to all the kind
of mentors i've worked with over the years and said like what would you and they all gave me the same advice which was
speak to people listen don't make any rash decisions you know wait get up get a proper plan but give
it you know the kind of 100 days piece and initially i was like i don't need to do that and actually you
just really do you know so i've just spent just trying to understand how it went and the other thing is understand the industry you know like i
literally knew nothing about the other than i buy clothes i didn't know anything about fashion so so yeah so and now my plan is i you
know as is always my ambition i want to do the best possible job of it i believe in bell staff as a brand um i
think it's an incredible brand with an incredible history i think the product is amazing i think the design team have been doing a
brilliant job over the last three years getting the product to a place that's really true to who we are as a company
um and i and i would really love to take it to profitability and beyond you know i really i really believe that it's
possible to do that and i think you know we're lucky to have the backing of jim and ineos to support us through what is going to
be quite a significant period of transition and change but then i think we build the foundations for growth and go from there and retail's changed a lot
yeah totally you know thinking about the high street and how you know in e-commerce and the
internet now like there's anyways we saw debenhams being bought by boohoo and it's also just
bought topman and some of the other arcadia brands it's a moment of transition that's been
accelerated by this pandemic what's your thinking about the changes with in retail i mean god
i'm so early to it you know but i mean i think like anything it's just i think it's
accelerated what was happening anyway right like the high streets were were dying people were moving online
i think the rapidity of that change has just been you know it accelerated massively so
people's behavior around how they're shopping was was on the cusp of quite significant change i think
that change has flipped massively so you know people are much much happier shopping online even like an older
generation who historically wouldn't have been i do fundamentally believe when we all start opening up again people are really
going to want to go shopping you know and i think people are going to this idea that people aren't going to go to the shops i'm not sure i buy it because i think it's
like yeah you want to get out let's go and do stuff even you might want to stephen
there's always hope isn't that you know i see shopping is not actually for the purpose of shopping i see it as an
experience and i see the internet as a place where if i almost the utility and shopping is like a
thing to do right yeah so i do i do wonder if retail will will seize hold of that part and have the
experience experience yeah exactly i think that it's going to have to because i don't think it's ever going to be there to be making money
so i think it's going to be about adding on the experience of the brand for people particularly for our brand you know we we can create an experience and a story
and a narrative that other brands maybe can't you have a 96 years old so yeah we've got all of that heritage
that i think we can speak to so i think i definitely think that experiential piece will be quite a big play over the next few years this
Are you scared of dying?
is a morbid question but i like to ask it sometimes i think sometimes are you scared of dying
no no are you no i was when i was religious up
until about 18 years old and then once i realized that i was going to the same place that i came from which was nothingness and peace
it was quite a liberating feeling and i thought death was actually i would dare i say not a good thing but
um not something to be scared of interestingly i had to uh when would it have been so
three three years ago i crashed my bike and landed on my head and i got like i mean for some reason
whenever i crashed my back i landed either my face or my head and i landed on my head towards your brains it's just
i wish and um our team doctor at the time was like because i'd got a bit of concussion he was like i think you
should go and get a brain scan he's very over cautious so i went and got an mri and mike they've made my mum come up because
i don't have her husband so after that that's the one downside actually to being single is that whenever you have
to have like somebody come and look after you it's like mum i'm 42 years old but please could you come and stay at my house um so my mum
had to come up because of the concussion i wasn't allowed to go home on my own and i got this phone call from a brain
surgeon who had been given my mr they looked at my mri and they'd found all these patches in my
brain and he was like there's these we've found is are you he rang me and he's like are you with someone and i was like
yeah and he's like oh we've got yeah and he's like we've got a [ __ ] just tell me bedside manner he's
improving um and he said um we've got your brain scans we've gone through them and they're
we're seeing changes in your brain and you know when you're like but i've never had an mri so how can you
how can you have how are there changes anyway long story short i've got all of these unusual patterns
in my brain like patches that could be they were like they could be potentially the starts of tumors they could be
just your i know right they could until you went through excuse me rude i had to go and like so i went with
my best mate actually and go meet the brain surgeon he talked us through it and i mean she it was one of those hilarious and
horrible situations all at the same time because he was sort of going through because she she works the nhs and she's
like what could what else could it be if it's not team as well could it be and he's like well you know have you ever been like a very heavy
drug user and we're both like no and she was like yeah she was like this week lizzy we don't need to go into
this he means heroin she's like oh yeah no no we've never done heroin um and so and she was asking all these questions
and so basically i had about a year period where they weren't sure what it was they still aren't i still have them
and it's symptom-based so they're like we could do biopsies and see what it is and i'm like nah you're all right um or or if i ever
develop symptoms which would be you know sort of electric pulsing or anything like that and i think that period is
quite good for me because it and it's probably where a lot of the positivity in there actually doing what you only get one chance thing came from
because i i was a bit like [ __ ] if i have tumors kept growing in my brain
that's quite intense and what does that mean for my life like what would i change like what would i do
differently and i genuinely i remember being sat in my living room having everyone had gone home by this
point and i sort of had had my first proper other ski it's like a two-hour mri which is quite intense
and i was like you know i wouldn't change anything i would carry on living my life the way i live it now i wouldn't change anything i would i
would probably go deeper and harder in some of the things that i really enjoy because i like my job and seeing my mates i
would keep spending the money the way i spend it i literally wouldn't change anything and i was like and it felt it literally felt quite freeing it was like
great this is this is good because i think a lot of people would get that kind of diagnosis and be like right [ __ ] what do
i need to do differently and i didn't have anything that i thought no i wanted i don't want to change but interestingly my
my job has now changed and i think deep down the reason i had the chairman conversation the reason i was willing to
say yes to this opportunity at bellstaff is had i maybe not had that incident and had all of that
associated thinking and sort of bit of deep deep sort of soul-searching i maybe wouldn't i maybe
would have said no it's right i'll stay at cycling but i just thought you know what [ __ ] it let's go and give it a try
what an absolute blessing that is to know to know that you wouldn't change anything i think i am i have this sand timer
is it behind me somewhere is it there it's usually sat behind me but the reason i have a sand timer in my
house is because it's that sort of visual it's the only way you can really see time at some point i realized that um i was
getting older and that you don't notice and that you can fall into the trap of thinking and as i think most people do that will just
like live forever yeah and it's not until you realize that life is finite you have those those moments that you realize that you
know like at some point i'm gonna die and seeing my time pouring away is that reminder of like is this
important and am i making the right decisions am i living true to myself um and i wrote a little article about
that called deathbed thinking which pretty much says the same thing which is that giving you that perspective of from your deathbed potentially you know
what what really matters remarkable um i mean i'm so i'm so
inspired by your story and every time i sit down with someone um who's become a success in their
career or their you know step issue i i it feels like there's similar themes but so so different in so many ways
What does the future hold for you
what what does the future hold for you do you think do you know any ideas you're going to end up world
domination right no exactly no i would believe you if you said that that's the funny thing i took that
seriously i don't know what the future holds and i don't really mind like i don't mind i sort of as long as
as long as my family and friends are healthy and happy and as long as you know actually that's all that
matters as long as my friends and family are happy and healthy and then i'm pretty cool with whatever the world throws at
me i'm i'm sure it will be a laugh it'll be fun everyone else seems to need a plan no that's that's five year plan three
year plan don't get me wrong i used to have five year plans but they're all hilarious when i go back and look at my five year plans i'm like oh i love how
ambitious i was like where's that yacht
i think when i was a kid i was very i remember actually when i set my agency up my best mate and i set it up together and we got a coach
and we were about 22 23 and the coach was like right go off into separate rooms and write out where
you want to be in 10 years time and then come back in and read them to each other and we were best mates like we lived together for like three or four
years set a business up together he was dating my best friend we came back in and he and we had them base right like written
on a piece of paper like holding from each other and he was like right i want to be running a successful business earning a
good salary i want to be living in a nice house with a wife and three children um and i want to be healthy and happy
and i was like oh [ __ ] you've done it you're listening i want a yacht and a chair i want to have loads of
money yeah i was literally i had this like really materialistic list about wanting to be like successful
in a global sensation and have all this money and all this cold 23 22 23
did you have stuff growing up material stuff yeah we were quite not i mean when mike was my dad my dad was in the
raf so to begin with you know middle class but then when he left to go to hong kong he went into civil aviation
in kind of the glory of the expats so definitely very very lucky and i got you know business class travel everywhere yeah so
it was pretty next level yeah it's incredible that you've wanted it for you it's so bad but now i wouldn't i
wouldn't want that list now but it was just it was that really interesting like oh okay we want totally different things
and i i didn't have partner i didn't have kids i didn't have a nice house anywhere i was like i wanted the i wanted the universe you
know i mean i want to go over there and do something massive well you've smashed it fran and i'm sure you've you've been paid well along the
way for that um money the money becomes irrelevant though right the money is not the money is just a great tool for
helping my friends and family for doing cool stuff with people so having experiences
i spend all the money i earn doing stuff with the people i love
give me an example uh took my sister-in-law to dubai for her 40th birthday with my best mate we stayed on
the palm with an amazing time i've sort of took my brothers back to hong
kong for his 40th i take my friends on holidays i yeah i just
go and do stuff with the people i love experiences i spend my money on experiences going and doing stuff seeing stuff but always with the people i love
and none of my mates can afford to go to the hotels i go to so i was like well i'll just pay because i don't want to stay in a rugby
showtime so i can relate well listen thank you so
much for all of your time today it's been truly fascinating and even you know researching your background and your mindset has been um really really inspiring and
energizing for me and i can relate to so many elements and the other other elements i'm just amazed and impressed by so thank you for
your time i know you're incredibly busy person so it feels like an additional honor for you to have said yes to come and chat to me today
um and where can people find you i guess just you know these days it's pretty easy you just google someone's name but yeah i don't do i i have a private
instagram and i do i'm on twitter but i don't really use it very often so and i'm rubbish with linkedin well if they want to speak
to enough i'm sure they'll find me they'll find me yeah and thank you so much for inviting me it's been fascinating i've really enjoyed talking
to you thank you thanks people ask me for book recommendations
all the time and i finally got one for you it's a book called happy sexy millionaire
which is authored by me i spent the last almost two years in jungles around the
world in costa rica and indonesia in solitude writing this book it's the most important thing i've ever
created and there's this crazy thing when you write a book because you spend so much time pouring your
heart and soul into it and everything you know and all of the revelations you've had in your life and then there's this barrier which is
that people have to buy the thing in order for them to get that thing that means so much to you i wish that wasn't the case
it's just the way the industry is and in order to get that distribution and to get it on shelves you need a publisher so
please please please if you can if you've ever liked anything i've ever produced this podcast my instagrams
anything i've ever said read this book there was no ghostwriter i wrote every single word myself there's
some real surprises in there it's an honest sometimes hilarious incredibly vulnerable hopefully valuable recount of my life my
journey everything i've learned across across the way and really the answer to being fulfilled to being happy and to
achieving success it is the most important important thing i've ever created so i implore you to go
to amazon now or wherever you get your books and get that pre-order and everybody that pre-orders the book because pre-orders
in this crazy publishing industry count as way more than just a normal sale if you get that pre-order i'm going to
put you into a group with everybody that's pre-ordered it and i'm going to send you some exclusive stuff so the first things i'm going to
do is a series of voice notes which i think are um are going to be pretty powerful i'm going to give you access to some tickets
which nobody else will have and i'm going to do everything i can to thank you for for giving me that sort of nine quid of your money whatever it is
happy sexy millionaire you can pre-order it everywhere now and if you do get that pre-order please do dm me because i'd
love to thank you myself

you

Transcription:

Intro
you were the vp of twitter obviously donald trump has just been booted off twitter permanently what do
you think about that there's a 70 year long study out of yale university looking at what
the the secret of longevity and happiness is and the secret of longevity and happiness is
work the thing we spend the majority of our lives doing today's guest is an expert on exactly
that how can you be an expert on work bruce daisley spent the last
five to ten years studying what makes work joyous what makes it miserable how we
get burnt out and what matters the most when it comes to work he's been named one of the most influential londoners in the uk has been
named as one of the most influential britons in the united kingdom bruce daisley's book the joy of work became the best
selling business hardback book in 2019 he has his own podcast so he's one hell of a talker as well
and as the world has transitioned over the last 10 months to this zoom-centric remote working lifestyle i think now is a great time to ask
ourselves the question what makes work enjoyable how can we get the most out of work how do we avoid
burnout and how do we maximize our motivation bruce has the answers so without further ado my name is
stephen butler and this is the director ceo i hope nobody's listening but if you are
then please keep this to yourself
bruce you were you wrote a i feel like that's an understatement you wrote a smash hit book about
work called the joy of work and i've seen this book absolutely everywhere it's been an absolute phenomenon
so you know considering the fact that the world has fundamentally shifted over the last nine ten months because of this pandemic
and the way we work has changed so much i wanted to get your view of this remote
Your take on this new remote working culture?
working zoom um sort of working culture that has now been forced upon us just before i let
you answer i'm gonna give a little sentence around around my take on it i hate it um and
when when in march when we were forced out as a ceo for business to tell my employees that we're gonna be working from home
and we have this amazing office which gives us all this community um i know that about 50 of my workforce
liked the idea but i 100 hate it for a number of reasons what's your take
so i think at the outset i shared some of your reservations brony brown talks about this thing which
is collective effervescence and it's a it's a good way she's she's coined to turn for something you see
quite a lot in social science that even the introverts amongst us actually quite like being around people
in in some scenarios and we get far more of our energy from the tribe
were in and the people were surrounded with then would probably admit and so when it first happened
look the defining thing about work for me is laughing every day i if i laugh every day and i you know in
the organizations i've been in they've been at times incredibly stressful we've had
you know at times when i was at twitter there was just for good reason there was like big headlines
demanding stressful scenarios but either the sort of the dark humor
that you find in those moments or the moments of levity that you can just get if you're around people that
you trust soldiers talk about this or firefighters talk about this you know you can find human and i used to love that so the idea of
shifting to a world where somehow we're plugging into the matrix and we were losing
that camaraderie that kinship that we get from being around other people i wasn't
necessarily the the biggest advocate of it i think what's clear though
is that we've fundamentally moved into a different world and some of those preconceptions that we might have had
might have been partly ill-judged so so so working through those things that the number one thing we know uh 91 of
people say they want to continue working in some capacity when you look at the numbers of that
people say broadly say they want to work at home three or four days a week so there's
some firms saying we're going to let people work one day a week or two days a week at home people workers want to work more than
that so there's going to be some degree of of balance and we're going to achieve an equilibrium
so that's the demand side of it and in fact when you look at all age groups young or old there is a slight
difference so younger workers have said that they were they're happy at home but they they it's
close to how happy they were in the office and we can partly understand that a lot of young workers don't have
home offices they don't have nice desks they're sitting on their bed or they're sitting on the table that
sits at the end of their bed so they're working in slightly different scenarios but even they report they're more
productive and happier than than that they were in a big open plan office so that's the first thing older workers are
significantly happier if you've got a bit of space it seems to correlate with you feeling really happy
so broadly all of the evidence suggests actually the experience of it has been at least
unbalanced positive so then you look at the the other side and i guess it's firms
and it's really growing evidence that firms are recognizing that something has fundamentally changed
bloomberg did something interesting the business people they did an analysis of all the earnings calls so all these transcripts of like
big bosses reporting to shareholders what they think is going to happen and
bloomberg say that already about one in eight firms are talking about making their offices smaller the ft did something
where they said about half of british firms are already talking about their offices being smaller so
whether it's that demand side or whether it's that supply side almost certainly we're going into something that's going
to look and feel a bit different to what we were used to before if you had to guess um i i completely
resonate with that i think even for our organization we realized how much money i'll be honest how much
money we could save by not having an office because it's not just the rent it's the the cleaning the electricity it's the
food in the cupboards you know the maintenance of a what was a 20 000 square foot office in manchester
uh and you you stripped back those costs and you know it was that you were forced to realize that it is possible for there to be another
way and i think at first we were we were skeptical that our business could run in
completely remotely then we realized it could and then we moved into phase three which was like okay but what have we lost now and it
was it was it was definitely a phase three thing because in phase two we're like oh everything's fine in phase three we're like now we've got
a problem because we've lost the uh the sense of community that our
company was giving to our employees and for a company like ours community was a huge part of our our
value-add you know we are the sterile stereotypical like millennial office with like the slides and the ballpark
and the freedom and um and a real sense of strong community where pretty much everyone lives together
and so in phase three of this sort of this sort of mental journey what we saw and i actually resigned just
after in about september time what we saw was a bit of an exodus of our employees because now
they're sad at home they're looking at their to-do lists and that they're now thinking the
remuneration or the value i'm getting from this job is this amount of money and i'm doing
these set of tasks so now i think i can get more money down the street at that place that
has no working culture whilst i'm still going to be sad at home and it will be a similar set of tasks
and it was it was astonishing it was astonishing how many people um are being completely honest because i
have no reason not to be honest we almost never lost good people the month just before and after i left
we we lost our the largest number of employees we've ever lost by a fault factor of 10.
yeah and it's fascinating so let's look into that because you're exactly you spot on these the big themes that
are emerging now firstly how can you make people feel like the part of something when the old way they felt part of something
was the energy they had when they're around people right you know there is some buzz and and it's not an
exaggeration i've chatted to some of the world's leading experts and they say good workplaces do have a buzz
to them they have almost like this tangible energy um and i think that's one of the challenges we've got
now if you've got a situation where people on video calls back to back and you know it might be not with the
big boss it might be with clients they're dealing with or it might be with customers they've got to keep happy
but if there aren't back-to-back meetings with those people then they can just feel well look that's
going to be exactly the same wherever i go we're not going to have the same energy and there's far more evidence that
when people feel part of something bigger than themselves it's transformational so i've been i'm
writing something about resilience at the moment a book about resilience and what you discover is that actually
what you hear about resilience is that people tell you all these myths about resilience that it's this individual
strength or it's this it's this trait that we can do develop and what you discover about resilience
is it's normally a collective thing it's because you feel part of a resilient community you
feel like you've got the strength of others to draw upon you feel like you can tap into something one person in some of
the research i was reading said you can't be a resilient on your own and there's so much truth in that
now what does that mean for the way we're working right now well if you've got someone in a bed seat or a studio flat or a flat
chair and they're sitting on their own all day and they feel lonely it's almost certain that those reserves
of resilience are being tapped and you know there's one thing that psychologists talk about all the time it's this notion
of of affect it's sort of it's a fancy way of saying mood it's a psychologist a way of saying
mood and what you discover about affect is that the the mood we're in is really
influential on a lot of the things on our experience of life and the uh creativity and our sense of
collaboration so scientists talk about positive affect and negative affect and positive affect best way i can sort
of frame uh positive affect it it suggests that like the mood we're in transforms some of the decisions we make
and the best way i can frame that is that when you're a kid growing up whether your main carer is a grandparent or a
parent or a a guardian but you knew from the age of four or five you knew that it was a good time to ask
for something and a bad time to ask for something you knew based on the mood that your carer was in that there was a good time
to ask for something a bad time but affect the mood we're in affects uh decisions well the situation we're all going
through right now is not positive affect it's a negative affect loads of people are feeling burnt out
average person during lockdown has been working about an extra 45 minutes a day that's on the back of the average
working day has gone up by two hours in the last 10 years so people are finding themselves in this
lonely unaffiliated disconnected sense of exhaustive burnout so it's no
wonder people are quitting their jobs because they just don't feel like the good version of them that they used to feel like you know the contrast as well
so this idea of contrast where you can remember how your job used to be and if your job used to be a 10 and now
because it's because a central part of what made it a 10 say the community or the culture in the office or you know that sense of camaraderie
or that sense that you know you were a group of people working together towards a goal now you're kind of sat in your bedside on your own on the
end of your bed doing a to-do list um if your company was a 10 because of that culture and it's now dropped down to a
six something in my mind makes me think that those companies will actually hurt more
versus the companies that were like an eight before and an hour a six um and that's part of what i think with
with our company social chain because culture was such a big thing that people must be thinking oh my god what the hell is this
um being sat alone and we try i think you know i can't speak to the company now because i'm no longer there but i know there was ample efforts with all
as with all companies to do these like zoom bingo things and that lasted a month before everyone got sick to death of that but you mentioned
What causes burn out?
the word burn out there uh a very popular phrase a topic of much mystique as well i think um i saw
your ted talk about the topic of burnout and i saw your your thoughts there i guess my my question is what causes burnout
in your view yeah there was a really interesting there was a a really interesting book that just came
out last year and it was based on a a successful article that had sort of blown up on
buzzfeed by a woman called an helen peterson and she talked about she the premise of her article really
good article worth searching for is the the millennials of the burnout generation you remember that one i think
maybe you showed it right there's all these matchy matches and what she said is she said and she'd encountered it as a journalist
she's thinking i'm feeling something i wonder if i could capture it and she was thinking is there such thing as errand paralysis
so what she means by that is that she was getting to the end of like these productive working days
and then she would get back to her flat and she would she would open a bill or she had she had something she needed
to do and she just didn't have the energy this high performing really successful person didn't have the
energy to get those things done and so she was thinking in her head is this some sort of weird
um this sort of duality that you can be really accomplished at one set of things but you can't
others she started looking into it and she realized it's not that you're avoiding one thing
you're just exhausted and her lesson was that any time we teach we treat our energy as infinite that's
when burn out comes and it we so often do it we we treat the idea that we can work
all the time and the best examples i can give you are the ones where we actually check in on ourselves so i i
used to find myself day job working at twitter worked on twitter for eight years i used to
uh when i was especially guilty of this i used to have back-to-back meetings on monday what's the consequence of back-to-back
meetings your inbox is is exploding it's it's absolutely overloaded and so i used to get home on a monday
night get myself a cup of tea deal with all my domestic responsibilities and i would sit there
and work and do emails for about four hours and just try and catch up with what i was doing
and i quite often i would check myself and about nine o'clock i'd be spending as much time changing
the music as i would doing emails or one long email that's like a two-pager who sends these emails these
criminals sending long emails but i'd find myself reading this you know that feeling where you read it
i'll just read that again and then read it again and what you discovered there's this science for this it's called ego depletion
and the people who look into this say that our brains are sort of far more finite far more limited than we
might imagine our brains are far closer if you want a metaphor for it our brains are far closer to the batteries on our
phone than the infinite broadband that we we normally deal with so your brain's sort of got a certain
amount of charge in it and when you use it and so the way you'll you'll witness this is maybe you walk into
a situation and someone asks you a question at the end of a long day or whatever and you're like hang on can you just
just give me a minute just give me a minute or someone asks you something really complicated just as you're about
to oh okay hang on can we just give and effectively our brains are sort of far more finite
once you recognize that you start thinking okay i wonder if that should influence the way i think about
doing my job and and of course burnout is one of the things where we don't treat our energy as finite it is
it is uh finite but we don't treat it like that and the end result is then we just feel like we're running on empty
we're running on vapors and so when you look into it the world health organization uh recognize burnout as a real
phenomenon and they say that burnout is is all about when our energy feels spent when we feel
emotionally exhausted they talk about this other thing called depersonalization where when you're really burnt out you don't
necessarily construe other people as full and
empathetic individuals but sometimes you're a bit sort of dismissive of other people or you're a
bit reductive of their motives or you start seeing people around you as an annoyance so in the old days if you ever
found that the person you sat next to their chewing or their tapping was driving you crazy that can be a little
bit of an exam example of deep personalization so it's a real phenomenon it's uh i think to my mind it makes you
rethink the way you work so if you knew okay the most i can do every day
is eight productive hours of work and you can you know there are evidence to suggest you can do more than that but if you
started treating it like that and said maybe actually if i'm honest it's not a really high intensity productive hours
but maybe it's five or six really good hours and then you know other stuff is dealing with email or dealing with
with phone calls it i suspect it would change the way you made decisions and you see evidence of this barack
obama used to have someone who followed him round who uh barack obama never chose his
lunch in eight years because this person just made all his decisions for him and you see albert einstein said something
similar einstein used to wear that same outfit every day and uh it was because he knew when he
got to his lab when he got to the the place he was making uh decisions he knew that if he went there and he
hadn't cluttered his brain with all these little micro decisions he was he just felt a bit more
imaginative inventive creative so we see evidence of it in other people's behavior but normally when it
comes to us we don't treat our brains like that we don't treat it like something we need to protect
our energy to protect we we tend to treat our energy as infinite but that's why burnout comes just
does the type of work you know you talk there about eight hours or five hours or whatever it might be does the type of work you're doing and
the amount of intrinsic motivation you have or joy you get from it impact your
likelihood of being burnt out yeah because like because that's what i that's what i suspected in my life
because the people that i've seen that get burnt out and this is all anecdotal and there's no scientific evidence really to
support these these assertions but people that i've seen get burnt out the most typically typically especially during
the lockdown working alone often often freelance um often doing a repetitive task
usually doing things that aren't that enjoyable and i had a friend actually come here and sit on the sofa which i've talked about i think in the last few podcasts
and he basically told me that he was feeling a bit burnt out um and uh he was struggling to get out of bed
and go and do the go and do his work in the morning he's a he's a freelance freelancer working on his own in his house he used
to work within teams during pre pandemic and i i was saying to him like think about the things that make your
work enjoyable and what other you know what are the things about work that are intrinsically and
motivating to you all those things have gone right now so now you're just left with waking up alone sitting in front of a
computer and maybe because your intrinsic motivations or the intrinsic joy of your work has been stripped maybe
you're now um encountering burnout i think that resonates with me as well to some degree like if i've ever got close to feeling
unmotivated or quote unquote burnt out it was when i was doing things alone pre-social chain
on my own just for money well there's a couple of things there so two things so like this i think is
all related to resilience so there's two things there the first thing is that the evidence we have is that when we feel an absence of
control we do we generally feel more burnt out so let's think of examples and the research on this some of the best research on
this is about nurses so very timely for the moment we're in right now when nurses choose to work extra hours or you might
have known friends when you were doing jobs before your career where you know i used to work in fast food and some of
those dudes used to work 14 hour shifts and you're like wow where did they get the energy but they were electing to do
it and the evidence we have is that when people choose to do those things it often impacts them less they they
feel like they've got control over it so you know i these guys who used to work with burger king king at me with me and they were doing 100
hour weeks but because they were choosing to do it because it was really important for them to afford a car to do things
they were what you discover is that when you're electing to do it does seem to give you some degree of
protection so control is a really important part the more control we feel over our lives so why might you
now be feeling burnt out because imagine if your company has you on 40 hours of zoom calls a week or your
inbox is always full or you've got a difficult person you have to deal with a client relationship who's phoning you
all the time you might be feeling the absence of control or your your friend who's the the freelancer might be feeling like i'm
just i'm not in control of things but there's a couple of other really important parts and they're about our identity and about
the the sense of community and you get really good evidence of how
when we feel part of something bigger than us and feeling that connection being around people is a really important part of
that it tends to enrich us it tends to to protect us and you see really good
evidence of this you see when people go to hospital if they have like a heart operation or
they have something serious when they come out of hospital the people who reported that they were
part of groups before their chance of survival their chance of avoiding depression
is massively higher than those who live in isolation and look that's the
experiment we're going through right now that you might have wonderful friends that are at the end of a zoom line or a
messenger link or a whatsapp but if you're not around them and to some extent some of the energy we get
from them is dissipating and i think that's the challenge that a lot of us are in right now it's just a very lonely existence we've
got now all of the things that we found nourishing enriching life-affirming a
lot of them have been taken away from us now the challenge go on i was just gonna say i was gonna say um
actually there's a lady that sat in your in your chair yesterday anna hemmings and she's an 11 time or
11 time world gold medal world champion amazing olympian etc etc and she was
speaking to the fact that at one point in her career when she's when she she was training in london to be a kayaker so she's like an
eleven-time world champion kayaker right and then at one point in her career they decided that they wanted her to go to the olympics so she had to
learn sprint kayaking right the coach was in florida so they took her away from her team in london and she had to basically train
on her own via using an email that her her coach in florida was selling her
and after doing that for a couple of months she got chronic fatigue syndrome wow so she was out for two years she said
she couldn't lift her hands and shampoo her and the thing that brought her back was the realization
that taking away her from her team as someone who was a bit of an extrovert and got her energy
from people had um set off a bunch of alarm bells in her body so the the reason that she managed to
recover and come back and win more world titles after two years of literally having this chronic fatigue
syndrome was by realizing that and putting her back with her teams and changing her training which is wow
what a metaphor for what we're going through right and it shows how the mind is so intrinsically connected to the body yeah
people don't think that loneliness or removing you from your tribe
can disable your body yeah or your energy but although there's remarkable amounts of evidence on that so there's a
woman in the u.s called julianne holt lunchtime who's done like a colossal survey
and she appropriates she says loneliness is the equivalent of smoking 15 cigarettes a day
and so you know it has this big impact on us and loneliness is as bigger than obesity in terms of the
health impact it has on you and that's what we're going through right now and for all of these things that we've tried to sort of create these
artificial intel alternatives zoom quizzes and all manner and things like that they just don't
have the same connection of feeling surrounded with someone there's
some evidence as soon as you start looking into these things it's extraordinary what an impact people have on each other
so these one piece of evidence i went up to to oxford to meet the woman who did this research and she took groups of rowers
similar to to the kayaker took groups of roads first and there are oxford university roads you've seen them the colossal
the monsters and she she put the first group individually on rowing machines second group she said okay i want you to
be on a a made-up boat you know you're going to sit on your rowing machines but you've got to be in stroke with each other
and she wanted to see firstly what was the different experience what she noticed was that the firstly
they did about the same exercise it wasn't like someone worked harder than others but she measured the
endorphin levels you do that by uh you put these arm cuffs on people you sort of you subject them to pain and then you
see how much pain they can take and the endorphin levels of the people who'd rode together was twice as high
as the people who'd rode alone and you know you see this with choirs people who sing inquired you know you
can grab strangers off the street get them to sing some abba songs together and you say to them at the end
of it how do you feel they say i feel utterly elated now that's not because singing our songs on its own does it it's
because when you feel some connection with other people even strangers it seems to be
transformational it seems to sort of elevate our mood and all of that has been stripped from us
so you know if you've got i guess you can try to do some approximations of it but all of that has been stripped from
us and i think that's why it's it's inevitable that we are feeling
flat energy-less we it doesn't feel the same right now how do we fix that though and this is i think it's going back to
the start of the conversation why i hate it i hate the lack of connection i hate the lack of community i think are you an extrovert would you
say oh god i really don't know i think on one hand i'm a massive introvert yeah i i i'm people know me i don't like to
do i don't like small talk i like to sit alone for weeks on end i like i went off to the jungle for four weeks in september alone
went off to the costa rican jungle alone so i like that although i have this kind of like you know public speaking and social media brand
so i actually don't know although a lot of introverts like that ability to switch on the public speaking side and
but i think actually the more you look into the introvert extrovert thing it's sort of a compartmentalization that doesn't
necess the vast majority of people sit somewhere and sure exactly i'm the same as you um no but
these uh i i think look the point you raise is there's no easy substitute but there is some evidence i saw an
amazing piece of research and it looked at couples who lived distance relationships
so you know in the uk distance relationship means you're half an hour an hour's drive from someone in the us it means you're like a three
hour flight so they did a piece of research 40 000 couples living distant relationships
and they wanted to know so these were unmarried so they wanted to know the ones who made it through a year what what was the thing that made it through
a year and this was research was done three or four years ago so it's not from a different era of technology but the ones who stayed with each other
for the long term phoned each other every day and you know when they they were asked what you talked about
they said oh we just talked about trivial things so i think so many of us have got into
this frame of mind of thinking well i liked her a photo and i sent a
quick whatsapp saying what i sent a voice note horrific use of technology but they said
but you know we think somehow we've serviced the relationship by doing these things
and actually when you come down to it and maybe future generations will be different but it's it's often quite analog it's
that sense of feeling seen and appreciated so i suspect face time might work the same way
but so many of us are sort of are overwhelmed with these performative zoom calls right now where he's sitting there
with like a celebrity squares a blanky blank uh array of faces in front of you i know
and i wonder if it's that sense of being seen and being heard that probably connects and cuts through a bit more
yeah i think so yeah i just think work is just so much more than the work right i think
especially in the world in the world we live in at the moment where we're getting lonelier as a society i was looking at the stats when i was
writing my book about you know the the when they ask americans for example how many people they can turn to at a time of crisis it
used to be three people a couple of decades ago now they're like medium answer is zero yeah and um i think it was theresa may
that appointed a head of loneliness where loneliness are for the uk and i've seen the stats so i think work is one of the few sort of
i don't know institutions where it still binds us together um and we're not between four white walls tapping glass to order food and
alone speaking to our nan through a piece of glass so it's a shame that that that community that part of community's
gone but anyway moving on creativity something you've talked about at length and
What kills and causes creativity
um for me i've i've always believed that i'm least creative in the office i've always thought
i'm more creative in the gym and in the shower than i am when i'm when i'm sat in a boardroom with a bunch of people
and i know this is something you've spoken about so i wanted to get your take on where we're most creative what kills and causes creativity
yeah i mean look firstly i would all i ever feel in all of these situations is that i feel like i'm a
a vessel that's passing on other people's knowledge so i've found myself being consumed with all these things and
interested in their learning so look let me tell you um what i've i've discovered that
neuroscience is really intriguing the most compelling thing about neuroscience is when you look into it uh neuroscientists used to work on
experimenting on animals you know i'm not i'm not keen on that i was like i was
you know in a protest group about animal experimentation when i was younger um and they used to look at brain
injuries so that used to be the main way that neuroscience worked and it's only the last 20 years that brain scans have had any degree of
sophistication but what they've discovered in like the time that they've had brain scanners is some of the things that they presumed
about the way our brain works aren't necessarily right so let me give you one example but they used to put
people in these brand new brain scanners and they would watch what their their brains did they give them a puzzle they
give them a rubik's cube their brains would light up in these sort of different places and then they'd notice what happened
when people stopped playing on the puzzle and their brains would light up in sort of
loads of places as well and so it was it was baffling what's going on right now they'd say to these people they say oh right sorry i
was a million miles away i was daydreaming so okay right that's interesting your brain's lightened up when you're when you're not
thinking about something when you sort of switched off and so the way that neuroscientists categorize this broadly they say
these three systems of cognition first one is like when you're doing that rubik's cube or
when you're typing an email it's called the executive attention network so it's the main thing you're focusing on
and then you'll know while your executive attention network is watching netflix or while you're writing an email you can
also be aware of like the room you're in that's called the salience network and the third one the third
so there's three of these systems the third one is that one when you're daydreaming the one where you're a
million miles away the one when you're in the shower which is called the default network
but what we discover is that people generally report having their best creative ideas not
when they're frowning into their laptop screen but when they're in these default mode uh situations so you might have it in
the old days if you're on a train somewhere or on a plane somewhere loads of people i've got a friend who says she has all
her best ideas staring out the windows of planes yeah and so you know if that was you then this year has been
an uncreative year but um my favorite example of it is a really famous screenwriter
called aaron sawkin he's written the west wing he wrote there was a um there was a film he had
on netflix just before christmas called the chicago seven he's written all these big things very famous for zingy dialogue so he
wrote the social network film things like that sort of you know um really sort of really what's
better than a million a billion like he's written all these zingy lines and he's realized that uh he has all his best
ideas exactly like you in the shower he said he had he told hollywood reporter magazine he had a shower
installed in the corner of his office and he has eight showers a day and he was asked by them
he was asked by them hang on is this like some weird ocd thing he said not at all i find that
when i you know so i'll be sitting there thinking of something trying to come up with an idea but it's
only when i disengage my brain to something comes to me an idea comes to me and so
what you described is exactly what a lot of these people whose job is to be creative
have recognized and as soon as you know that you start thinking wow okay i need to think differently
about being creative because creativity can then be when i'm sitting at my desk i'm
sort of taking all this inspiration in stimulation ideas but then it's about disengaging
going for a walk going for a cycle ride going to to do a workout might be the moment where the idea hits
you and i don't think necessarily we think about that enough you know if you go back to this idea
that your brain is a bit like your phone battery then some of those moments that effectively can recharge your battery
can be the moments where creativity hits you and inspiration hits you so i think sort of rethinking the way
that we treat a productive week of work of you know these blocks of work
but then moments where you know it might be your personal is you go for a walk every lunch time
that can be far more creative and productive than you might imagine well how do we make our work environments more conducive with
creativity then is there a way or do we just resign to the fact that that's not going to be the best place for our creativity and if we're going to
reach our creative potential it's probably going to be away from the office i think it's about recognizing there's a
yin yang there's a balance of work and and imagination
so i i always loved the example of um charles dickens charles dickens obviously um like
incredibly productive i think he wrote 15 novels 200 short stories he edited a weekly
magazine about a mile from here you know sort of incredibly productive we didn't work afternoons
and so charles dickens would sit down at his desk at eight in the morning he'd write for about four or five hours and then he'd go and walk and he'd walk
10 10 miles every afternoon and that was like him lost in his thoughts you know
striding through east london probably sort of imagination popping when he sat down the next day he had
loads of ideas and i think some of us have eliminated that
sort of the brain fermenting ideas we've eliminated that a bit so
you know it might be that your way to do this yourself is just to make sure you just got some down time
or you've just got some time where you know you put music on but you turn podcasts off or you just
you try and get a bit more balance in how you're uh using your energy so let's conclude
this point about work and creativity say that i today made you the ceo of a company that had
100 employees um and you could design from scratch the the working environment how often people
worked and some of the sort of key sort of principles and foundations of that working environment what kind of
things would be important to you based on all you know so let's look into what happened in lockdown the first part of lockdown most
people reported that their engagement went up and why did their engagement went up their engagement went up because they
were solving problems like we'd never worked like this before everyone was you know the first moment
you're getting on a zoom call or a google hangout or you're getting on these things there's like you know even though you're in this
crazy situation there's a degree of excitement fight or flight almost right and and so what do we know about that we
know that people felt that they were involved in firstly a bit of team collaboration but secondly they were
helping solve problems and so you know the whole organizations computer sales
have gone through the roof whole organizations that had no laptop computers so they had to arm their teams with kit
and so people felt really engaged by the fact that they back to what we talked about earlier had some control they had a a bit of
influence so number one thing that we discover is the more that people feel that they can have an
impact in their job and it might be something similar simple they're they're just responsible for a
couple of things themselves the more that they feel that they've got some agency some control themselves
they feel motivated in their jobs when do we feel unmotivated in our jobs when our boss tells us what to do but we
don't get any input into it we don't necessarily think it's the best thing to do we're doing
repetitive things that don't feel very rewarding so the best thing that any of us can do think well how can i make
teams feel small and teams feel like they've got a shared sense of accomplishment and pride in what they're
doing so that's what i would be saying what you discover is 100 is a really nice size actually any time a
company goes over 100 what your discovery is you lose a bit of some of that
camaraderie you better almost there's a few organizations that do this when you go over 100 split it into two
teams because your that sort of cohesion you get works really well when we
we've got a familiarity with each other and what happens is when you go over that you start losing it
and you think we want we want it to feel like it used to feel it's never going to feel like that humans don't work like that so
far better to say you know we've got two teams that love each other but we're we're working on separate goals so
keeping things small is really critical and there's lots of evidence of the smaller you can keep things you
almost get the economies of engagement compared to the economies of scale that when people feel they're part of
something that they're having an input into their engagement is higher they they they work more effectively
so i would say that would be the defining part making people feel like they've got things that they're responsible for
and generally all of those things encourage active engagement what you find when you
look into some of the stats they're terrifying so and when you globally there's an organization gallop to this workforce
survey opinion poll company and they they do this workforce survey and they say that globally
13 of people are engaged in their jobs when they look into it what i mean by
that is that these there's almost as many people there's about 22 of people who
would actively disengage their jobs so by actively disengaged they kind of hate their organization and
they want to bring the downfall of their organization so anytime you meet some someone on the tuber in the street they're almost twice
as likely to want to destroy their company as make it succeed but then the vast
majority of everyone else over 50 percent of people are just disengaged they're not actively
disengaged they're just passively disengaged so work for most of us is something is something that sort of
feels arduous we don't necessarily enjoy we don't necessarily value the decisions and you'll know as
someone who's run a company where culture was the defining thing you'll know that when you get it right
it can be this superpower where you know you're on high octane fuel compared to you know
the energy can feel low otherwise and so just getting those things right generally is far more about
people feeling a personal connection with the people that are around feeling like they're contributing something these things play a really big
part we talked a lot about the joy of work obviously the i guess the antithesis of the joy of work is the misery of work
and at some point when work feels miserable um people are faced with this quite um this quite confounding question which
is how do i know when to quit and we talk that we know i think there's so much written about how to start and when to start and
starting being the thing but obviously the thing that comes before starting usually is knowing the right moment to
quit people don't quit sometimes and they spend many decades in a miserable job and
you know then their fear of quitting almost becomes stronger because they're getting more comfortable and more entrenched so i wanted i've not seen you talk about
anything about quitting before but i just wondered if you had a take on when the right moment to quit a job was or i know it's an incredibly personal
nuanced thing but people i can i was thinking then i was thinking what are some of the things people
really want to know right now one of them i'm sure is like i hate my job i don't have control my boss is an
do i quit i'm gonna tell you a secret for the past five years while building
social chain into a 700 person global social media powerhouse i've been using a service that i've never really
mentioned some of you might know that service it's called fiverr f-i-v-e-r-r
it's my little secret if i've ever had a project where i've needed affordable skilled freelancers to help me whether
it's building a social media application that made my company three million pounds or just a video i needed editing or
help making a logo or making a website i've used fiverr now that my secret's out the bag here's
what i'm gonna do for you if there's a freelance service you need or a project you need help with a logo a website a voice over a video you need
made anything at all go to fiverr.com ceo i'll put the link in the description
that's fiverr.com ceo message me the service you want from the
website and every single week i'll personally send you the credit to your fiverr account so that you can get that project
done thank you to fiverr for the sponsorship and for supporting entrepreneurs and freelancers around the world i'm looking forward to all of your
messages i've been working my way through these huel nutrition bars this week um as you
know i love the ready to drink cure flavors but you will have also got these salted caramel bars
and i'm a big salted caramel nut which i've been having and if you're if you're someone that does like to chew
not just drink your food then i really highly recommend the salted caramel flavor there's also another flavor called the raspberry white chocolate
flavor which i've been very addicted to over the last couple of weeks but again just like huel it's nutritionally complete
you get all of your your proteins you get essential fats you get it's gluten-free as well
and you get 26 vitamins and minerals from these bars
tastes amazing and i'm a big salted caramel fan give it a go if you do send me a screenshot on instagram or
twitter or linkedin and let me know what you think again as someone that skips meals this is an absolute lifesaver
How do I know when to quit?
i was thinking what are some of the things people really want to know right now one of them i'm sure is like i hate my job i don't have control my
boss is an do i quit yeah look you know big
questions you probably could tell us more than that um yeah i think you know the uh the
critical thing about that is is probably checking in with yourself and asking you know do i feel any sense
of reward by my from my job obviously it's not a great time for anyone right now to
be debating doing something that makes them economically precarious
that so you don't necessarily want to risk something that is going to put you in a difficult situation but i
think you know evaluating our jobs generally when you look into the research when you say to people have you had a good days
a good day at work it generally comes down to whether people feel pride in their organization
and whether they feel like they've made meaningful progress in something they've been working on so meaningful progress actually can be
difficult right now if your job feels like you're the expert in emailing and
video calls you sometimes feel like you've made no progress for weeks you haven't done anything for weeks and also if your
organization is struggling this is a really interesting phenomenon because some organizations pre-covered were in
uh were growing so naturally when you're an employee in those organizations you're dragged up with it you're giving
promotions and pay rises and there's the cash to fund that now organizations are in decline or a lot of
them are hanging on and so you're not getting a promotion your pay's been frozen you might have be on a pay cut
you might be furloughed and it feels like suddenly you've gone into decline in your career because the organization
you're in is in decline um and i think that also causes a lot of people to start to think
well you know i might my whole life up until this point has been about progress and climbing the ladder why am
i going down the ladder yeah i didn't do anything different or wrong you know it's a really interesting philosophical thing about that because
the whole idea of the career at korea is the invention of the last 40 years you know
uh ancestors uh grandparents our great-grandparents never had the idea of a career where i
was going to be accomplishing something and developing and changing you know the job you were going to be
doing next year was the job you were doing last year well done and the job that your kids were going to do was going to be the job that you did
and the the this idea and it brings with it a degree of insecurity this idea that we will be on this
developmental path is a construct look and it's a construct that suits the economic system we live in because it
makes us all we strive to be accomplishing more than we did last year and to be earning
more than we did last year but it's a construct for the last few years whether it's the origin of
happiness i'm not 100 sure if i was going to put two things alongside some of the things that you've talked about
that sense of feeling part of something feeling connected to other people i think is a more robust route to
happiness than feeling like i'm on a career trajectory even though that can the the illusion of
that can be incredibly powerful it's interesting because you know with there's this thing called like gold medal depression where like michael
Childhood trauma in the elite
phelps he set these set these tarts one thing i kind of investigated in my book is the idea that
we think stability we think chaos we think we live in chaos and and in search of stability but the
moment we find stability i.e completed goals and um you know roof over our heads and
everything's normal we actually descend into chaos so in fact we're meant to keep this is a
philosophical idea i guess but we're meant to keep our lives in forward motion in that chaos because when you look at people that have
achieved all their goals and they have nothing left to accomplish they so often fall into some kind of depression and lack of purpose and
meaning i think jordan peterson talks about it i know benjamin said a lot about it that you know much of um i was looking at the
stats around life expectancy in the uk and the us and over the last two years it's declined for the first time ever
but and they say when they say why is that they say because the opioid crisis and say why is there an opioid crisis and they say well because
there's a lack of meaning and so i i began to realize that in my own life i think i'm meant to keep myself
my goals way out in front of me almost unattainable um and keep myself striving and i've even
seen it in my person which i've talked about a little bit on this podcast the days where someone came along and said here's 50 million will buy a company or we're
going to go to the stock market you're going to be a millionaire were the most confusing days of my life because i immediately didn't know what
my point was anymore i wonder what there's something really fascinating so there's a there's a study of
olympic medalist a british study really fascinating piece of work it's called the great british medalist study and um it was commissioned by the
british olympic association so they wanted to know what was the what was the creation of a
champion and they did this fascinating thing they did they gathered 20 what they called super elite athletes so
these are athletes you'll know them all of them are household names they don't name them in the study but it's people like kelly holmes it's people
like the big iconic names and uh these were people that every time they went to
a championship they would win gold or they would win they would be right in contention then
they took a second group and they called these elite athletes super elite elite and these were people who went to championships
but kinda didn't meddle or if they meddled they meddled third biggest difference between them these
ones had all received significant childhood trauma the elite ones the super early best ones had achieved
significant childhood trauma let's start counting the cases so kelly holmes she was bullied at
school she was the only child of mixed race ethnicity in her village she said she
experienced continual racism tom daley his father died when he was
training yeah um you know you look at countless examples of these things the andy murray was you know greatest
british tennis player maybe greatest british sports person he was at the dumb lane shooting the only mass
shooting in british history so all of these people have experienced significant childhood trauma and what happens is they tend to direct
their energy based on what we know they direct like they're fortunate there was a coincidence that they were
gifted supreme talent and what you discover is childhood trauma normally correlates with addiction
so if you know if it correlates with anything it correlates with obsessive behavior but both of them have
something in common you're trying to fill that void and so these people are fortunate that they've been gifted with this
super elite talent that they can fill the void with striving for something and the people who ends up at addicts
with the same challenge don't but they're still striving to fill that void and so there is something in you know
it's it's almost inevitable that these people who are striving for the elite uh accomplishment hoping to fill this
this hole that sits inside them of course when they get there they realize it was all an illusion it's like a mirage in the desert but you know there
is something in what you say i mean i've got i just i mean completely like i think when i i sit here and speak to people
that are tremendously successful and the one thing that i've seen in common with all of them actually think i said it to joe wicks when he was sat
here two weeks ago was they all seemed to have some real severe childhood trauma that no one else has experienced
and even in my i said to joe i said you know my i've got a friend who's a billionaire he's not happy but he has had this deep
obsession since he was a kid because of some things that happened with his father and his father making him feel
that he just wasn't enough or he wasn't adequate enough which has made him obsessive about success to the point where it's
unhealthy um and he's got there now he's a billionaire but he's not happy at all he's he's you know he's tremendously
unfulfilled the same with eddie han i went and eddie holmes on this podcast a couple of weeks ago as well
and he he is the most relentlessly obsessed person i've met um just non-stop eat to the point where
he'll say to his kids like he'll he'll tell his wife and kids that they are second priority to his box to being a boxing promoter
you ask him where that's come from he said you know my dad my dad always made me feel like i wasn't enough it's really interesting though because
it depends i'm intrigued then how these people pay it forward because andre agassi
supreme tennis player great tennis player married to the greatest the up there equal greatest tennis players
for all time uh he's married steffi graf and um and he says that his dad bullied him constantly
like his dad was never happy he's the only place his dad who was a persian iranian cab driver could
afford to own a tennis court was in las vegas so they moved to las vegas and his dad bullied him into becoming a tennis
player and andre agassi fantastic autobiography wrote about how much he hates tennis
hates it with every single bit every fiber in his body and he says i will never do to my kids
what my dad did to me and so it's like this really interesting origin of success is the thing that propels you
this driving force that propels these people who just keep going relentlessly is it
something missing rather than something extra and i think that's the interesting conundrum
i don't think it's predictable and this is the thing because i think you think okay well if someone has trauma they're going to become successful or
they're going to become an addict or if someone has a upbringing that lacked empathy from
their parents then they'll become an or a serial killer but in the case of joe wicks he was he talked about how he had you know he
looked at the doors in his house and they all had fist holes in them his dad was an addict his mom had these problems and
and he is the single most empathetic person i've ever met you know when they announce the third lockdown he does a livestream crying his
eyes up because not because of him he's fine he's saying i can i'm feeling the pain of people losing their jobs right now
and you think well if your dad was you know you grew up in a home full of domestic abuse right and violence
how can you become the most empathetic person that i've ever encountered genuinely genuinely empathetic this guy
like i've never seen you know um i you know because everyone says about you know pee with joe
and they all like send him the memes every time there's a lock down of him like putting his shoes back on or whatever but the guy gets really down really really really
down because he knows that other people are hurting never seen anything like it however here's my question so we talked
The Trump Twitter ban
about childhoods um making people very interesting there's one guy in particular who is
notoriously had a very um interesting childhood which made him a certain way
donald trump and his father um you know the story of donald trump and his father being you know um
you were the vp of e-m-e-a of twitter um obviously donald trump has
just been booted off twitter permanently what do you think about that but also i wanted to ask you where if you were jack
dorsey in that at that time would you have made the same decision
number one it's so incredibly hard and i think the i mean i always felt lucky i worked
four years at youtube before twitter and the time that i worked at youtube
there was a lot of um mass shootings and there's always mass shootings in the u.s
but there's a lot of mass shootings and the phenomenon at the time was that a lot of the mass shootings
it was being discovered that the people had youtube channels and so i remember sitting in a meeting with lawyers in the
san bruno headquarters of youtube watching them debate what the the right moral thing
to do was in these fascinating to watch things that were being invented challenges that no one had conceived of
five years before now you've got these things and so you're watching all these things going on
and um and so you know when twitter was invented when twitter was invented it was a way
15 years ago it was a way to text all of your mates at once and so there was a short code and it was
a way it was it took like your msn messenger status and it sent it to text messages that was
the idea before everyone had internet connection on their phone so that it feels like a different lifetime now
but just an illustration to be 15 years on from that debating whether you d platform the most
powerful most well-known is he the most famous person in the world maybe the most famous person in the world to
de-platform that person is such a journey to be on and i know the people
i mean i know jack i know uh the the other person who made the decision and i know that they don't make any of
those decisions lightly you know it's like it's really uh weighs on them but to my mind
it was a singular situation where firstly i saw some people on social media saying um saying that this was an illustration
that the employees of tech firms were woke and it's just really interesting equivalents because six people died
in that event and if you watch back all the footage of what led to it then it
it doesn't take a huge leap of logic to say i can see why that created that so six
people died and i think it was at the end of a long period where increasing numbers
of the tweets by the president and the people associated were being labeled with this isn't true
and you you do reach a point where a lot of critics were saying where does your responsibility kick in
here do you have no responsibility for what your platform is being used for i
think knowing the people concerned that that was the last thing they wanted to be to be in the position where
they were making a decision angela merkel has come out saying she's she feels uncomfortable with it
and i can definitely imagine that everyone in twitter felt uncomfortable with it it was one of
those difficult things everywhere you went for the whole trump presidency people would say um
what are you doing why are you not taking this down and of course you know the first thing you've got to say is irrespective of anyone's opinion and
that's the only way you can look at this that this is an elected leader of a country and so you know irrespective of anything
else for a private company to be saying that we we take an opinion which transcends
uh the election result is a really uncomfortable one so i know that it would have been a
really careful decision i think a really deliberate decision jack's been on podcasts and any places
uh i'm joe rogan talking about he believes that bands shouldn't be forever so who's to say that you know there
wouldn't be a root back on these things but i do know that the decision was probably made
carefully reluctantly i think i think it's the right decision i think is the right decision and i think the
timing of it was probably right i i would be you know it felt
it felt at the moment it took place it felt like the intensity of dialogue
and the toxicity of dialogue was reaching such a stage that you know six people already dead
it's just like this could get this can escalate even further and i have to say since it's happened it does feel to me
like a bit of the stress in the room has gone someone said something uh about i think
president-elect biden said um the you know a natural order of things you don't think about your leaders
every day you kind of know they're there you've got context that they have an awareness but you know this
sense of peril where you're thinking about your leader and what might happen every day just contributes to bad mental health
it's not a healthy place for us to live in so you know i would guess that there would always be a route back
for people even if they've had a permanent ban jack said that but i i do think it was
the right decision i i am i'm really not sure i think
i consider myself as someone that's on the left i guess to some degree or maybe left to center left but
um i it does make me feel a little bit uncomfortable because you're right it sets a bit of a presence for the future
in terms of how we deal with um opinions we don't like things that might
be considered to be inciting violence would you have done in this case i think i think i would have um
suspended his account um temporarily like the facebook approach
yes i think that was i think that was probably a better approach all things considered um i think because trump is a very
unique very powerful individual i would have also had someone i'm not sure if this happened but someone from
twitter contact his team and really have a dialogue about it and lay out that we can't allow our platform
to be a place where we're like denying the election results and therefore inciting you know these kinds
of things and basically do and i would have used this suspension period i think to have that conversation
uh um but yeah but i think with the removal is it sets a bit of a strange presence and i did wonder before this moment you
know social media is very left it's a very it's a very like a liberal place
i think if you were to just look at social media you would think that the labor party you're always going to win typically as well because
you think i think so because i think that's more a reflection of who you follow because
you know i definitely think there's plenty of pockets of people who are huge brexit supporters who clearly i
mean the numbers say that there's more of them yeah but it's just i think the brexit and the conservative
narrative is less akin to like the virtue signaling that you're rewarded for on social media
so if i say uh child a lunch boxes for all right everyone's eager but if i was to i
i would prob i might even lose my job or be canceled or be criticized if i said oh no we don't need to fun give as much
money to the nhs or something so just seems like the liberal the sort of left talking points are a little bit more
acceptable on social media and the right ones might make you lose your job or get you cancelled or you know what i mean i
think it's about tonality rather than uh perspective i mean look you know absolutely it's not going to play well
if you're in the market for likes to say that i think we need a tighter fiscal policy
and you know and less benefits for people he's going to play differently i wouldn't necessarily agree
that the platforms have a specific bias though i think you know
of course it's my echo chamber yeah generally you know i've witnessed plenty of strong
opinion on both sides likely as it was my job to try and
ensure there was a a degree of good conversation in those things and i i've probably not seen that
because i've only seen my own little echo chamber and i'm young i'm you know i'm surrounded by very left
uh people in my organization and stuff so i probably surrounded myself with that narrative a bit more but i just i've always felt that um
Where does social media go from here?
where does social media go from here i mean it's it feels like it's a really pivotal moment we've got this big case with
facebook at the moment in the us where they're trying to you know considering breaking up facebook and we've got trump being banned from
twitter we've got parlor being pulled from the app store and amazon web services um it feels like we're in a bit of a i
don't know maybe we've always been in this constant debate of what social media is and where the lines are but
what what are some of the big changes you see coming to look i think it's pretty clear that regulations
coming in some in some capacity uh i think to be honest i think
most of the big organizations would welcome it when it comes to choosing to de-platform people whether they're the
president or whether they're troublemakers having some rules that are agreed by an independent
authority would be welcome for most of those platforms i think you know it's really uncomfortable when
organizations are losing sleep being on the inside is really uncomfortable when you're losing sleep about
should we be doing this can we be doing this how do we account for doing this uh jack daughter did a series of tweets
a couple of nights ago trying to he's formidable i think trying to demystify how decisions are
made so no win almost everyone who reads it will be critical of it but you know he's trying to say look
this is how we reach that decision um i think there'll be degree of regulation i think that's probably a
good thing i suspect some of the big groups will be broken up and you know facebook and google i think
will probably be broken up and the question will be whether they are willing to embrace that and do it
and all of the shareholders and all of the users and all the people who work there benefit or if they resist it and you know the
lessons of microsoft bill gates and steve balmer will say we lost 10 years of our company
because we spent 10 years resisting uh regulation resisting control had they
just given up to that they'd probably microsoft's in a good place again i think biggest company in the world again
but you know they uh they would have been in a better place to to avoid those things so um i think regulations probably coming i
think it's probably a good thing do you think they're gonna break up facebook yeah you think they will yeah in the next five years
really so you think they'll force facebook to sell whatsapp or instagram or something yeah
or both yeah or both yeah really almost certainly i would guess youtube will be sold from google as well
really yeah blimey that's crazy better go somewhere is it better for a
consumer so number one if you own any of those shares every time that these breakups
uh the all of the value of the firms is worth more than the constituent parts so from shareholder point of view it's a
really good idea to pick the right moment but break yourself up and um and it's good from a consumer point
of view i often sit there big youtube consumer if you're a youtube consumer you said go
going hang on this used to be like the big daddy of video they've missed tick tock they've missed
twitch they've missed like all of these big opportunities that youtube was
right in the box seat for they've missed all of them why because big firms generally are slow and don't innovate
and so it's better for everyone if you've got people experimenting doing new things and you
know if you've got a layer of regulation over the top of that saying these degrees of norms of
behavior that you expect it's it's much better for everyone and it's really exciting i think
in the case of facebook mark mark would respond to that and say we've got 10 years or 15 years whatever it is now of
experience moderating terrorist content and you know really you know horrific types of content we've
built ai systems which are the best in the world and we're removing you know we're spotting 90 of posts before they're reported and
this has taken us you know decades and billions of dollars of investment to get to this point if you take instagram and put it in the hands
of an i don't know an adobe they don't have that experience they don't have that um data that they don't have the ai systems and
so it's not going to help for um missing misinformation and it's a misdirection though isn't it i mean
that specifically if someone is saying we have learned we've developed machine learning that can do these
things that sounds like a marketable product that sounds like something that shouldn't be the point of difference
that shouldn't be your differentiator that you've got better capacity to deal with those things but rather that should
be something that some entrepreneur avails to other firms and i think you know sometimes we can
get locked into an idea of thinking oh the narrative that we're being given is the right one here
but rather more than thinking actually if someone could put a layer of safety over the internet
that used that machine learning to spot things that were really heinous that that used that learning to make sure
that no one had a bad experience wow pinterest could use that linkedin could use that
tic toc could use that it should be something that everyone could plug into their products and then you
immediately start saying wow there could be gaps in the market for new products here maybe there's a version of twitter that's mega safe
maybe there's a version of instagram that just has a different aspect to it
so you know my view would be absolutely we've learned these things but the notion that somehow
that safety of experience should be a proprietary benefit rather than something that is afforded
to everyone is just i think a a a bit of deception and a bit of
misdirection the other talking point mark zuckerberg would rebuttal you basically because i've looked at his arguments for
not breaking up facebook he says well what have we got a monopoly in we're not as big as imessage in
messaging we're not as big as this platform for uh he and he rattles through the platforms and says what what are we
bigger what are we the monopoly on and um he says there's tons of competition we've got tick tock
our heels pinterest twitter you know uh google you know these platforms so he says you know
where is the monopoly here um and i have found that kind of compelling i know again it's a bit of a
misdirection but i i can't tell you what he's the what what facebook have the monopoly on
yeah well firstly monopolies don't have to be more than 70 i think you know i think by the rules
for monopoly in the uk it's like more than 20 30 percent of a market so you know so so to be monopolistic you
don't have to be dominant but you know when you've got three of the top five apps you start questioning whether there is a
degree of undue influence look i've got no dog in the fight um my view personally is that
i i suspect these firms will be broken up and the question then becomes do you serve your employees better
do you serve the people who use your apps better do you serve the the state of society better
by just going with that and saying let's do it but let's do it joyfully get on with it and i suspect
personally i think you know some of these organizations are going to be presented with the the challenge some of them will go
okay i'll break we'll break ourselves up and others will say actually we're going to uh we're going to position with this and
just the less than microsoft is you lose 10 years of your life by resisting talk a lot about the joy of
Whats next for you to keep joy in your work?
work we've talked a lot about you know your past experiences at youtube and twitter what is next for you when you're
thinking about what's going to give you joy from work in the future what are you thinking about um i'm writing a book
about resilience uh are you able to tell us the title yeah i mean it's the title is a big ongoing discussion okay i'm not at
that stage um which is just about all about the things we've talked about how resilience is actually a collective thing rather than
an individual thing um i've really enjoyed sort of doing things like that i i i'm doing a couple of things on
climate change so i worked with an organization last year yeah yeah so i'm working with alcohol's
climate reality now but um i did something with an organization last year that's trying to reduce our plastic
footprint and you know so so there's a few things like that and i really enjoy those things because they
i think they're non-linear i think you know what success looks like is really hard to judge
and it's all about trying to achieve things so i did something through october where i presented into
about 100 70 different companies i presented climate change into 70 different
organizations and you know connections have started from that so the al gore's climate reality is al gore did
that film an inconvenient truth about 15 years ago probably short in school my dad made me watch it right sat me
down and said to my brothers and sisters you got to watch this and he's turned he's work on that into an organization
and it used to be he had to pay 7 000 to go and be trained in las vegas now he's in the era of zoom he said
anyone could be trained on it for free really so i trained the only commitment you have to do is you have to commit to
spread the word so hence i did about you know all these presentations getting out and and spreading the word um and that's
really energizing sort of because i think a lot of us feel a certain way towards climate but
feel powerless about what can we do so uh i've done a bit of that hopefully i'll i'm i've got a few more
things coming along on that so will you ever get back into the world of social networking i i really want to
avoid doing that so that's why i'm working hard on podcast and writing because if i can pay
the bills doing that you know full-time jobs are really demanding
and you know my my social media consumptions remains i'm a huge user of twitter i'm a huge
user of tick tock and uh so my social media consumption is still there i just don't want to
i just don't want to work in those organizations again why just you know they're really exhausting
you know like you work really hard i had so much fun working at twitter and youtube before
but you know you do long days especially working with california up in the morning and you you're working
late at night so i don't want to really go and work in a big company again i'm going to conclude this podcast by
Whats the one thing you'd do to make work enjoyable for everyone?
just asking you you know for you and from everything you know about the joy of work and what makes work joyful and fulfilling
if you had to just focus on one thing that was the most important factor for
you um in work what would that be um there's a 70 year long study out of uh
yale university looking at what the the secret of longevity and happiness is and the secret of it
studied these guys for like the whole of their lives and the secret of longevity and happiness is love and friendship and i think
work is far closer to that than we might imagine when we feel a connection with the people we work with
it makes everything worthwhile and i think hidden in all the chat about productivity and strategy
and and you know market fear and usps we lose the fact that when we feel most
motivated by work it's when we feel like we're doing it with other people and so that's it for me i used to a
great day at work was when i laughed 12 times and you know and it was almost it felt trivial to mention that it felt
like oh why do you love your job to mention that i just love these people i love being around these people i'm energized
by these people feels really embarrassing to admit but i think that's the secret of it when we
feel part of something our jobs can feel defining that can feel part of our
identity bruce thank you um that loops perfectly round to the start of the podcast in my expression
that i think remote work as hell so but also it's uh it's something that yeah i've come to learn over the last
nine months i'm sure a lot of other people have um thank you so much for all the work you've done on work generally because i
think it's a conversation not a lot of people are having or breaking through with and some of the ideas you deliver in
your book and just generally in your content across youtube and your social channels linkedin your articles on there
i think really are helping to dismantle a conventional and sometimes toxic
framework for how work has to be so on behalf of someone that works and has teams i want to thank you for that because it's been um it's a value that
the world needs but also thank you for the conversation today thank you it's an absolute pleasure thank you

Transcription:

Intro
all of that stuff prevents us from being at our best we can only be truly great at what we do
if we believe without doubt that
my guest today is an 11 time european world champion in her field anna hemmings she has a remarkable story
not only is she this incredible elite athlete not only did she get to the olympics twice
but she's undergone some of the most incredible mind-bending adversity to get there
she's now a coach she's now an entrepreneur she's now an incredible businesswoman and she has a remarkable story to tell
you she's also a mother and a wife and all of these things and she's she's really incredibly self-analystical and
self-aware and as her journey unfolded and as she rose to the top of her career she got news which all athletes must
consider to be the worst news in the world i'm so excited for you to listen to this conversation you're going to get a tremendous amount
of value and i'll be honest as a host you ask the questions but in this conversation i had more
realizations than pretty much any conversation i've had with a guest before without further ado you can see i'm excited my name is
stephen bartlett and this is the diver ceo i hope nobody is listening but if you are
then please keep this to yourself [Music]
Why Kayaking?
kayaking it's um it's not this the type of sport that
a child would typically dream of getting into so i guess my first question to you is you became
a world champion in kayaking you reached the very sort of peak of your your your career in that sport how did
you get into kayaking yeah you're absolutely right it wasn't something i was going mom mom please don't be kayaking
um i did lots of different sports as a child and i loved sport my mum was always
trying to get my brother and i partly because we enjoyed sport but sometimes just you know summer holidays
going to a week of tennis camp do a week of basketball week of this and it was just something that we tried
i loved being on the river you know the thames in the summer is gorgeous right you know it's pretty miserable right now
um but in the summer it's lovely but also the club was competitive it was it was elm bridge canoe club and
it was probably one of the best clubs in the country at the time so this is late 80s and
and they were all about racing they were all about competing they were all about you know working your way up to the
national championships getting on the great britain team going to the world championships making the olympics that was their mission it was to produce
racing athletes and that played into my competitive nature really well
so i think it was one i love the you know the nature of the sport but also i'd
stumbled on a place where i could be competitive i could race i could
um i had access to these brilliant coaches i mean as time went on i was there with at my club there were
people who were going off to the olympic games who were going off to seoul um olympic games then four years later they
going off to barcelona and so i was surrounded by people who were going to world championships achieving
great things and making me realize that actually
this is this is possible so i've got two questions there the first is what age were you at this
point so well when i first stepped into the kayak that first summer i was just under nine years old and and i
can't say that at that age i was going by first day in the kayak i'm going to go to olympics it wasn't that and it
probably wasn't until the following summer that i actually really started to train and
go regularly and really get into it so you you said there as well about you were surrounded by people that had
these big ambitions that i'm guessing you probably never even considered and i think for i think
that's such a valuable but also interesting lesson about like the company people keep
generally because i can imagine that if you were in a different kayak school surrounded by different people that
didn't have that level of aspiration you may be and this is a presumption you maybe wouldn't have
believed that it was possible for you is that right um so i yes i agree
um i also had discovered the olympics probably around that time and
was inspired by the olympics and i do recall from that young age thinking just the olympics is just this
amazing event so i think really early on i had a dream about the olympics um and i
didn't know what sport that would be i you said you had a dream did you see
yourself actually getting there in a sport someday yes really yeah i did
i i did watch the olympics on television um i recall los angeles i definitely recall
watching um seoul and really being into that so well you know by seoul i'm like 12 years
old i guess um watching thinking i want to be an olympian i want to be in that event
one day and then and then kayaking came along and
and you're right it because of those people it didn't feel like because i guess
probably when you're watching it on tv it's like oh this is this thing that other people do and it's far away and how do you ever
yes we'd all love to be in the olympics moment not everyone but you know but how realistic is that and
then i stumble upon this sport and this club and these young
athletes are going turning up training they're just like normal people to me
but if they can do it and these normal people who just work really hard
can get there then why can't i i'm so fascinated by it and you probably saw me being very inquisitive because
i'm in my head i'm trying to understand how um what the factors were that came together that took you to the olympics
and like i think in all of our journeys we can um we can attribute some level of like
coincidence and luck to various stages and i think one of the moments of like luck from what you've
said is like being around the right people to some degree because um yeah i've just i think especially
lately in my life i've really been able to look back and say you know what if i if i hung around with a different group of people if i didn't have you know mum
that was like this or i didn't have those five friends um i probably wouldn't have uh believed that like that as you i find
it really interesting you say the word normal people because i think we all view ourselves especially when we're younger it's like normal people
and we think that norm when you look at the tv as you say like you don't think normal people can do that stuff on there and at some point someone like bridged
the gap and was like oh by the way normal people do that and i think that's a moment that i had in my life which i found really
interesting from what you've described there there's like the thing where the like the third wall shatters and you realize
that all of your icons and like you know the people you love are also just like we're just like you yeah i think that's
super um inspiring so we've talked a little bit about circumstance and like the the luck fortune part of it and
being in the right place at the right time but also within everybody's journey there is a lot of
intention there's a lot of like often discipline i imagine what what are the things about you that
Why you?
maybe the few defining things that maybe other people don't don't have i always have to be
careful with this question because no one wants to blow their own trumpet but i'm like why you like why are you not someone else we've talked about
circumstance but what are the things that you within your character got you there versus everyone else who
might have quit or not tried as hard it wasn't as competitive or whatever that's difficult um i definitely worked
hard um and lots of people work hard right and i worked really really hard and i think
i think one thing that made me even more determined was that so as i mentioned already when
people see a think of a kayaker they often think of someone quite tall yeah they often think of aurora right and and they're different sports
but most people think roar and they think super tall big and and i am a little bit small
um not typically the typical size for a kayaker so generally a little bit taller um broader
shoulder i'm five six six um and i was i was told regularly too small um
one of my coach actually um the club coach he was also the great britain team coach came up to me at a certain point
um when i was really into the sport and said i just don't think you're ever going to be big enough or strong enough to ever
be a great kayaker knowing that i was really wanting to be a great kayaker
and but also knowing that i did some other sports and was kind of going maybe you should go and do those because
i know you i just don't want you to um put all your heart into this and not succeed how did that feel
devastating right this is the sport that i'm falling and fallen in love with um that i'm this is
probably i'm about 12 years old so at this stage i am training quite regularly i've already
been to the national championships i've got my sights set on being in the great britain junior team
devastating but i think because of that i i just went well i'm just going to keep
going i'm going to keep trying i don't care what you've said i don't care you know this is what i want to do um
i'm going to give it a go and i love it and i think i'm doing okay at it right now and i'm just gonna keep trying what that
did for me was made me made me work harder to prove that
actually because i was told specifically you're not big enough you're not strong enough
and yeah i can't change my height but i can become stronger and when i was at the peak of my career
i was the strongest girl in the gym in the great britain team i've got to admit i saw the photos i was
bench pressing 100 kilos yeah you were strong and so and i i was determined
that no one's going to tell me i'm not strong enough because i i can't change how tall
i am but i can change how strong i am why did it matter though why did it matter to be successful to you at this
good question because a lot of i think about that moment where someone tells you you're going to fail whatever we've all
had that moment i think every successful person's had that moment and people typically google one of two ways they'll either go forget this then
you know chuck it in or whatever um or they'll have the adverse effect i almost
don't know anybody that sits in the middle you either get really in you get some kind of insecurity which takes you either one way which either
means that i'm going to triple down and become obsessive or i'm gonna avoid um avoid this at all costs
and i tend i tend to think that people who this really really really intrinsically matters to
for whatever reason are the ones that go the positive way and use it as motivation yeah definitely i'm i loved winning um
why i love the i love the joy of i loved i i loved winning but i also
loved improvement and i loved it getting better quite often i was told
so they're in kayaking there's singles doubles fours k1 k2 k4 and i was always told
you know not big enough not strong enough but also definitely not big enough or strong enough to be in a k4
definitely not big enough to be in any of the crew boats k2 k4 you need to be big and strong for those boats
and i probably shouldn't say this but they they used to it felt to me defined big and strong
as fat and if you were so i was skin and bones i
was really skinny and so i didn't look strong but they thought someone who looked
chunky had a big backside was strong okay and i'm like no that
that just because they're big doesn't mean they're going to be faster than they're going to be more valuable in that boat than me
so do you think you're like underestimated unfairly yeah i do and and that so winning world
championships in a k2 getting to olympic games in a doubles was very satisfying for me um
whenever i was able to prove that actually you don't have to be what you're describing as this kind of
shape um that's not what makes someone fast and useful in a kayak in a double kayak
or in a four so that used to annoy me i saw you talk about uh
Healthy conflict within teams
one of the things mentioned when i was doing a little bit of research on you is this idea of like healthy conflict
in teams could you explain because i've never heard of the term i could imagine i could guess what it means but i'd love you to explain what
healthy con conflict is in terms of teams and so in a
team um it starts with trust if we don't have trust in a team then we
can't have healthy conflict and healthy conflict is when we healthy debate so this is about being
able to know that all of the people in the team have the same objective the same
um we're all gonna got the same goal we're trying to achieve the same thing and you put forward an idea and you and
and i i disagree with that idea but if we don't have trust in the team and you're the boss then i'm not going
to put my hand up and say i disagree i don't think we should do it like that i think we should do it like this
i think that this is the way we should go i think we need to go down this route we won't have that argument and an
argument debate conflict whatever you want to call it if there's not enough trust in the team
if you think that you're going to be shot down if you think you're not going to be listened to um and then the problem with that is
that we then walk out of the room and you've probably been in meetings right where people all
sit in the room and they all nod and go yeah brilliant yeah we're all going to do that and then they walk out of the room and they go
you got another thing coming you think i'm going to do that and they do that because they haven't had their say
they haven't been able to disagree and and back and forth with their ideas and have that debate even if your idea
isn't gone with they at least want to feel like i've had my say
and i've had my opportunity to put forward my thoughts and my opinion and my suggestion
but actually at the end of the day this is the best idea for the team
then fine let's go with that but at least i've had my opportunity to speak up and you talk about you know that sounds
very sort of analogous to like relationships as well because i think you know like romantic relationships right people get a little
bit peeved if they don't feel like they're being heard and had a chance to express themselves and also when they have that
when they do express themselves quite often it's perceived as in the name of being right or winning
versus in the name of like progress or solving the problem it's like me and you versus each other versus mean universe is the
problem right yeah how do you build the trust foundation they're like what's the how do you get a
team to trust each other and whatever because if that's the foundation of healthy conflict i'm like how do i you
know what can i do to so one of the things that that you can do and this is why you know i work with
teams and leaders and it's about vulnerability it's about being um able to be vulnerable with your
people with your team um being able to admit weaknesses admit mistakes
um it's about being able to say i i don't know the answer i don't know where we're going well i
don't know what i don't you know i don't know how to deal with this or i you know just
being able to be vulnerable and and that isn't always easy to do
but when you start to do it it gives permission to people you know if you we do
workshops where we're trying to build trust and people always say you know at the end we might ask them something like um
share something about challenge from your childhood and when we when people go around and
they share and we say what what made it difficult or hard to do and they say well it made it easier
when someone else went first because once you've opened up and you've bared yourself a little bit
then i feel oh well he's done it then it's okay and no one judged him and and no one knocked him and and it's
like okay well i can do it too and knowing that no one's and when there is that trust then we know
that actually i'm not going to be that's not going to be held against me whatever it is that i share
it's not going to be hard against me in the future it's not going to be um used and i'm not going to be shot
down for it you a lot of this is like about the psychology of how people think and operate and i know that you spent some
Key lessons from your psychologist
time working with a psychologist or a sports psychologist when you were rising in your career um i find that
super fascinating but i'd love to know what some of the key sort of lessons you learned about high performance or about
i guess like self-regulation um from that that psychologist as it relates to becoming a world champion and
you know yeah yeah um yeah so i did i worked with a sports psychologist for from the age of 16. oh really yeah so
really young and and i think that um was part of and you talk about um you
know you asked me earlier what is it that made me a little bit different or why did i succeed when others didn't and i think
part of that was um have you heard of growth mindset yes
yeah yeah so i think that my i didn't know about that then and neither did you know a lot of people but my mom um was pretty
quite growth mindset and and i and instilled that quite a lot in me for example she you know this idea of
just constant learning constantly wanting to learn and be better and recognizing that we can be better all the time we can
improve um and looking outside for other areas of expertise learning from other
sectors and all of that and she was the one that you know it wasn't like i was struggling with my mental strength and confidence or
anything it was just what else do we need to do what who else can help us who else can what you know we don't have all the answers
we want to learn we've got to learn from everyone and i always encourage clients in the business world you know who who can we constantly
be learning from all the time what was the what are they like some of the key things yeah and also what i think
what are they trying to do i i guess they're trying to make you the best athlete you can be but what are the things stopping you
from being the best athlete you can be ourselves yeah exactly most of the time we are the ones that get in our own way
how how do we get in our own way the doubts the the thing the thoughts that we think um
the doubt that that seeds um the nerves overcoming us so so becoming so nervous
that you become paralyzed almost um choking under pressure focusing on the wrong
things not being confident in yourself um yeah so many things that we do
fear doubt is a really interesting one there's fears doubt anxiety nerves lack of confidence all of
that stuff prevents us from being at our best and that essentially is what was one of the one of the big parts
of what a sports psychologist is helping you to do when an athlete when you line up and there's nine of you on the start line at
the olympic games all of them all of those athletes were trained hard they're all in amazing
shape they're all super fit they're all you know strong they're you know physically there's
not a huge amount of difference between those nine you know i think about 100 meter sprint
at the olympic games there's not a lot of difference between them
what is it that makes one of them win on the day and not often it's often not the strongest fastest fittest who wins
on the day it's the one who's the strongest up here and i really believe that
that this is often what stops people from fulfilling their potential
and that's why i love helping people with noun yeah yeah absolutely their mental game is what stops people
from being the best they can be of all the things that we do in our minds you talked about fear doubt
anxieties all these kinds of things fear and doubt like lack of self belief not believing that you can or
How do people overcome their limiting beliefs?
all those things that's probably one of the most common sort of mental games that um holds us back or um limits us from our
full potential um how does how does one go about overcoming their own limiting beliefs about themselves like they think okay
well no i can't do that everybody thinks they can't do everything it seems these days like i don't know why maybe it's just because of what i do for a living but
um i'm just surrounded by an audience of people that have real limiting beliefs
and i wonder why but i also wonder how you help them overcome their limiting beliefs big question
it's a huge question how do we overcome our limiting beliefs it's actually something that i work on a lot with
when i'm coaching clients um identifying beliefs that uh so you know
we would start probably with what are some of those limiting beliefs and start to unpick how are those
beliefs where how are they serving i wouldn't be interested in necessarily where they've come from
i would be interested in how are they serving us right now and how are they not serving us because
sometimes there's we're believing them because they're serving us for a purpose they're helping us in some way but often
more often than not those beliefs won't be serving us um so starting to unpick that um
you know almost like what are the pros and cons of having this belief here um right now that i can't achieve this
or that one of my limiting beliefs was that i'm not very good at sales um you know i was
i had to i have to you know i run a training consultancy i have to you know find clients and um how you
know so what's a more helpful belief um and starting to one pick what would be a better way of seeing
this what are my strengths and what would be a new belief that would be serve me better
i think at some point in your journey you probably not at one particular moment but gradually i imagine you
started to build evidence within yourself that you could be a great kayaker
and i imagine that was over a long period of time probably there wasn't one day where you woke up and thought [ __ ] i'm good right yeah exactly and i think
um that is a big part of where we get our confidence from is like our past experiences yeah so whenever we do
something we we start to build a bank of memories and when we're at the next situation
that is similar we can choose to draw on the bank of negative experiences where
we cocked it up or we can choose to draw on the bank of positive experiences where we succeeded and we did it really well
and the trick is and you know if we if we and if we're not conscious about it chances are we might pick the experience
of when we failed and then that's when we start to regurgitate all those thoughts and feelings of embarrassment and anxiety
and nerves and and that doesn't help us and that's like that probably would then
hinder performance absolutely it perpetuates the you know the doubt and the because
you're reminding yourself of all remember last time when you did it you cocked it up and you messed up and you did it then you then [ __ ] it up because
you're thinking and then you [ __ ] it up because and we think in images yeah and so when you think of something that you messed up
you're seeing yourself doing it right you're imagining it in your mind right here and now and so the trick is to consciously
recall the positive experience the past successes and if there's nothing in the bank
exactly of that experience there's chances are there's something similar there's always something similar and you
know so i would work with clients to identify what are all of the successes that you've had not just
in that specific scenario but let's let's look at lots of different successes and
then let's pick out what are the what are the attributes
that allowed you to achieve those things because quite often someone will go oh well i
achieved that but it was because the weather was good on that day or i achieved that because my team
my team did it really it wasn't me so it's about starting to unpick actually what role did you play in that
success and what are the attributes that allowed you your strengths your attributes that allowed you to achieve that
and then we start to build up the bank of successes and the strengths and the attributes
which we can transfer into any scenario how much do you think people
and this is i don't know why i'm asking this question because it's not quantifiable but like to what extent do you p do you think people underestimate their
potential generally oh massively like would you say like over 95
because i think i'd say over i think i'd say people realize what like typically the average person
realizes about five percent of their potential and i only real only say this because
again like you said i'm was very normal kid from very my parents bankrupt like we i dropped out i got kicked out of
school poor grades everything but this one thing i had and i always say like the one thing i had was i genuinely
believed that i was gonna be where i am today just for no without a ton of evidence just generally
believed and in fact the one of the reasons why i believed it was but not because i had any bank of successes yet
but i had a little bit but it was actually contrasting me to my peers when i was 14 and
thinking i think that i have skills they don't and i think that if these are the people
that become adults then i will have i will always have that advantage um so that was my way of like
and so when i like cocked up my grades and gcse and when school starts with that narrative
that okay well you got an e so you're gonna be in have an e life you're gonna be broke and unhappy like no you're wrong like um so i get my
mother you were you were gathering evident you were looking at your strengths which is part of the puzzle right you
may not have had the experiences and the evidence of the achievements and the certificates and
all of that but you what's more valuable is what you had is the non-tangible stuff yeah because
if we go through life only assessing our success on the
tangible stuff yeah then our confidence our self-belief actually in their two different things
will be quite fragile oh yeah i can i can see that because you're always assessing yourself against
a trophy a trophy or society because you're compared to oh i got this
award against all of these other people and and and i won this trophy and i went past this grade and i
and it's always against somebody else and a society rather than looking at the intangible attributes
that allowed you to achieve those successes because that's what isn't measurable against society and is
transferable to other domains and this is the and you're completely right and i've never actually thought about it that way
before because i've always tried to figure out why at 14 i was convinced that i would be successful
and 18 i wrote my diary i'm going to have a range of sport before that i'm 25 i'm gonna be a millionaire from 25 achieved all of those things
just knew i would but it was pure as you said it was purely based on and it's almost a strength audit or skills order
versus other people that i knew and i thought oh those skills are really good skills and they'll take you far but
school is about tangibles like and i'd say a grade is a tangible yeah so school says okay you got a an e so
unfortunately like it creates the impression from all angles you're gonna be poor like and you're not going to be that
successful but timmy over there who's got an a he's really going to kill it as a surgeon you know and and i think so how
you make it out alive out of that system and still with your you know self-esteem and self-belief intact is
remarkable what i and i think that what you had is is better than the certificate yeah yeah because yeah
but but what it does is it allows you to go this is intrinsic in me no one can take
it no one can take that away and my self-worth isn't based on a certificate
and a trophy and an award how do you give people that well so you work on identifying those
strengths what are those strengths we do this all the time we work with clients on what are those strengths and where's the
evidence of those strengths and when they start to see the evidence of those strengths well you know so i'm i i'm working with a
client and you know so one of your strengths is being an authentic leader um one of your
strengths is building relationships where's the evidence of that look at all these people what do you do about weaknesses though
so would you highlight their weaknesses i think it's important to highlight both i think it's more important to
work on exploiting your strengths and i would um so we do a lot of diagnostics
we use behavioral profiling and all of that kind of stuff and all of that will bring up both and i think it's important
to really be aware of your areas of development but ultimately if i'm sat on the start line of the
world championships and i'm focused on my weaknesses and all the things i need to avoid my
confidence is fragile yeah chances of performing on best slim and so in that moment
i absolutely need to have on the tips of my fingers what my strengths are and i need to know them and i need to be
able to exploit them and i think the more you work on those the better
what do you think about this idea of like labeling yourself in your line of work and the the broader labels we give ourselves even if it's just like bad salesmen you
What do you think about this idea of labels?
talked about that being one of your like previous little limiting beliefs or labels um i think they're not helpful and i
think it's really important that we're aware of those labels that we're giving ourselves and the awareness is the first step right we
can't change it if we don't notice it so we need to notice the the label in the first place and then
it's a bit you know it's like it's a limiting belief really isn't it um and so is that label serving me is it
helping me achieve my end goal it feels like it sometimes because it's making me fit in and it's giving me comfort so
i see this a lot with people that will say i am a in my case i'm just gonna use my case i'm a social media ceo
and i so i've been a social media ceo for 10 years it gives me some kind of like community
to be part of it gives me a sense of identity but at the same time it stops me from being all that i can be
and this is one thing i was going over in my book is like now i've left my company it's so tempting to just start another
social media business but like there's so much more i can do and so what i'm asking this question cause i'm in
the midst of really thinking about it is like how do i just resist my labels and be
a [ __ ] dj i'm doing i'm doing this big theatrical show and working in biotech and um i don't know i just this
idea of like liberating yourself from your own labels has been super relevant to me um i think that
um it becomes your identity is a bigger part of the problem you know it's like when an athlete
retires from sport it took me and it still takes me i catch myself saying
you know i'm an athlete i'm not a business person and i go oh i um you know i don't have a
background in business yeah i've been running a business for 11 years and i was a professional athlete for 15 years so it's almost this
you know i have almost the same amount of experience in business as i do in in sport yeah i labeled myself for so
long and i be that became my identity and your identity is ceo of a social
media company and so that's who i am and it's hard to let go of that because it's part of
who i am yeah and it's comfortable right and you know you know who that person is what the
behavior of that person's like and and you're stepping into a new role that
what does this new person look like how rewarding has that been for you to kind of i guess reinvent
yourself from being an athlete to now being an entrepreneur and a business person was it worth it that's what i'm saying was it worth it to step out of that label
yeah totally and and we should all have multiple careers um and i think as time you know as we're
living longer and longer we all will have multiple careers and i think we need to find the courage to step into new careers all the time
and reinvent and and just recognize that there's so many skills that we can transfer
from that other career label identity and bring into the next one and that's
what will allow us to succeed into the next one and recognizing that we're never going to grow
unless we step out of that comfort zone and yeah get a little bit scared of who this
new person could be or would be or should be and we'll find out and that's the exciting thing is we're
going to find out how do you for some people that's terrifying yeah the thought of like throwing
themselves into that place of uncertainty that they have to travel through before they get to their new self how do you get someone to
come willingly into uncertainty to leave that job or to you know take on that promotion or to
pivot in their career when they're scared of the unknown or you know it's like well
then i would think about what i would think about rather than what i'm afraid of i'm thinking about what i'm excited about
and so rather than i'm afraid of what i'm going to leave behind or i'm afraid of what might happen i'm more about what
could happen and when we focus on what we want and what we could have and you know it's a it's optimism isn't it it's about what's
possible and what could i achieve you know and you asked me earlier about you know some of the things about
sports psychology and visualization was one was a massive technique really that i learned from my
sports psychologist and employed and still use all the time and i think when you can start to
visualize what that new role person identity could
be and when you bring it to life with all of your senses and see it really vividly then that's
exciting and what what could i achieve and what could this look like
and and the power of visualization is that your mind does when it's when you see it really
vividly your mind doesn't know the difference between a vividly imagined experience and a real life experience
Your process of visualisation
what's your process for visualization and now is it something that you do actively you set time aside and do it or
is it just something that you naturally now do when you're pursuing a goal
so a little bit of both as an athlete it was definitely something that i would sit down usually i'd be lying on my bed
i would have done some relaxation because the more we clear our mind and relax the easier it is to visualize and to see really clearly
and so i would it would be a conscious right i'm gonna spend the next 15 minutes or even two minutes or five
minutes or whatever time i had visualizing my next race and seeing myself execute that race plan
as perfectly as i can and in exactly the right way and i would visualize
everything from um if it was the olympic discipline and we've got nine boats on a start line i'm
seeing my i don't know which lane i'm gonna be in when it comes to race day so i'm seeing myself racing every lane i'm seeing myself with with the headwind
with a tailwind with it raining i'm seeing myself [ __ ] up the start because that might happen
but then i just going to recover from it and i'm going to see myself recover and i'm going to see myself win from behind i'm going to see myself win from the
front i'm going to see imagine you know they'll start being delayed or it's a
full start you know all these eventualities so that when it comes to the event i'm
prepared and it can just all unfold and i'm not phased by anything that happens but but
most importantly i've seen it happen the way i want it to happen and then i believe that it can happen
and what visualization also does is when we when we're visualizing a goal for example
it starts to activate the subconscious to generate creative ideas about how we
can achieve our goal it's it's it's my i don't know how it works and why it works but it's
mind-blowing and it does work and and it starts to um get your brain to
perceive and recognize the different um resources that you need
to achieve your goal it's like the law of attraction and it starts to activate that in your
life and bring in the people the resources the environment the circumstances that you need
to achieve your goal and so now what do i do i probably i do spend some
time consciously going like i'm just going to spend two or three minutes visualizing my goal i'm seeing it happen
i'm seeing it realize um but then other times i'm probably just
you know driving in my car and subconsciously you know like daydreaming almost but i think the
the conscious right i'm gonna visualize now is really powerful because then you
start to really it starts to ingrain in the subconscious
so the law of attraction stuff i think sometimes it can take people one of two ways because i do believe in
Your discipline and how to apply it
visualization my visualizations over the years have been very like the daydreaming stuff but then also when i was like
really really really broke and living in moscow in like a boarded up house i would frequently look at stuff that in
the future i wanted so i'd look at these like mansion houses and whatever and that was me kind of just
um setting my i don't know trying to peer into my future life the bit that i think sometimes gets lost
when we talk about like the law of attraction it's almost akin to like when you set
off in the morning you put your satin have him and you say this is where i want to go i want to go test go but then if you don't like put the key
in and put your foot down you're just going to be sat in your garage and but there's something about knowing
where you want to go and as you say like almost programming your brain to trick your brain to think
to completely be convinced that you will get there that i then that from my experience then makes you take actions
in that direction so like i'm sure you then you visualize yourself as a world champion but then you're like you go in
the gym and you you train like a world champion because you that's where you that's your destination
and the the the the opposite is also true like if you visualize yourself not being world champion what's the point you know you know um so
my my real question here is about all of the actions and the discipline it takes
especially as an athlete to get you from where you are to that visualized destination
i'm really keen to hear about like the discipline the consistency because you're in a physical very very physical
endurance race and you know it's like i think muhammad ali said like it's one in the gym it's one in training
a lot of it and we all struggle with that we all struggle with like showing up on monday when it's raining so like what's
the what's the key there so i think i think you're absolutely right you know when we visualize
it it gives us the motivation to believe that it can happen yeah yeah and that's
that's at the core of it because if we don't believe it can happen then what's the point and so yes we absolutely have to take
action but we need the motivation to take action i can't say that you know 100 of the
days that i was training i was oh yeah i can't wait to get out there go training it's pretty freezing outside it's like
the middle of winter on the water and the river thames and it's like ice
um yeah that wasn't appealing every day luckily the funding came in and we got to go travel and train in
warmer climates in florida and wherever else um but yes there's this
you know goal that's the world championships it's the olympic games it's you know those big dream goals
that are highly motivating but on those day every single day
i'd be lying if you you know if you could say that goal in four years time is what got me out of bed
on that rainy freezing cold you know january morning but isn't that the answer then like it
was just take like do today well yeah so it's but but also um i do a lot of work
around intrinsic motivation and understanding what drives us and and we're all we all have different
drivers and unsurprisingly one of my drivers is a sense of achievement and so my driver wasn't necessarily
on that particular day oh i've got a train really hard because i want to win the world championships in two years
time my driver was probably more that my coach has set targets every month
that throughout the winter for you know for five months of the winter we would have targets every month in the gym there would be certain
exercises in the gym that we've got to hit um we would do tests on we would do time
trials on running in swimming and on the water um so as part of our cardiovascular training so and for me
that was really um i loved hitting those targets basically that monthly
right so if i do and i know that if i do this training today then i'm going to get better and i've
got a test on the weekend and i want to hit that target i want to want to smash the target actually because yeah then there's a good chance
i'm going to win the world championship it's not just hitting the targets i need to smash the targets and so that sense of achievement for me
was a big driver for other people in my team it might have been and on actually on other
days it might have been actually i want to get out and go train because i want to see my teammates because we have a laugh and there's banter and it's fun
and i enjoy the connection and the sense of that being part of a team and the community and and all of that and so it's this the
affiliation that's driving me on some days and but for others
you know i can think of some of the girls in my team actually a sense of recognition was a big driver so needing that you
know ah today you know you worked really hard you've you know you really put everything into that session you know hearing that from
the coach or you know look how far you've come or look what you've you know the progress you've made or
so everyone and so when a coach can tap into that knowing what is it that's going to get
you out of bed today that's when we start to get the best out of people or the best out of ourselves
and so you know when i work with with leaders it's about what motivates and drives me intrinsically not just the carrot and
the paste pay slip and the promotion and you know and and all of that that's the external stuff which isn't very
sustainable we need to know what drives us in as
individuals but also what drives our team and tap into both of those and start to ask what what is it that
am i getting that every day and if i'm not how can i get that from work
what is it that i need to get and also really interesting you know if you're a leader of a business and you're working
with a team are my drivers influencing how i operate with others in my team you know
so if my driver is a sense of achievement but your driver is to make a meaningful contribution
and i'm pushing you guys no we need to we need to we need to win this and we need to get the next pitch and and you're like no i just want to really
help these people i'm pushing my driver onto you and that's not working for you
so it's really important to be aware of what my driver is and know that it's not the same as yours chances are yeah that's a good that's a
really good point and i think i've probably as someone that probably values a sense of achievement and
forward motion and progress above all else at times when i'm trying to motivate people especially like friends
i'm trying to sell them on the value of achievement when they're probably just not asked about a particular thing i don't need to
win yeah i just want to doesn't matter to me i i want to fill ownership of this piece of work
yeah actually that's what's really important to me and how do you find out what someone's driver driver drivers or motivations or
How do you find what drives other people
intrinsic motivations are is there is there a system or like a test or yeah so i the work um there's some brilliant
work from um a chat called dean spitzer and he talks about super motivation and this idea that there isn't you know we there's
intrinsic and there's extra extrinsic motivation so what we use a diagnostic actually when i work with clients
and it will identify it forces you to to pick because you know we all want you know
maybe some recognition or some achievement or to feel like we're making a contribution or to be with people all of this but it
really forces you to identify what really is your big driver um
so yeah so i use that but i mean i think when you talk to people you can start to you know the more you get to know
someone and you ask them questions and you see the way they operate and and you see them light up when they get certain feedback or when they're
doing certain pieces of work so we can start to get a feel for that just when we get to know people i
you when you know i asked you there about the that like discipline and consistency and what gets you up every day on like a
rainy tuesday or whatever and it was interesting that um you kind of like shortened your horizon
or your skirt like people i think people typically think they they want to get to the top of the mountain so they think okay
um let's make a plan to get to the top of the mountain but you were so focused on these like short-term shorter goals which meant
that i guess your progress sort of almost like invisibly compounds um to get you to the top of the mountain
so instead of like we want to get to staircase number a thousand we're like let's get 10 let's do 10 stairs today
and then 10 stairs tomorrow and 10 starts and 10 sets and by the time you know it you're at the top of the mountain right
yeah well literally i i am four years ago i climbed um mount tubcall of course you did as you
do and um i we went with there was probably 10 of us
in the group one of them one of the girls that was on the group was a friend of mine and she had i don't know why she joined the group
but she had a fear of heights oh god um and we're climbing a mountain and it was fine for the first day and a half
because it's just like a windy road the morning of the summit it's literally
we're going up we feel like we're going up a steep mountain and you're and there's boulders and and she literally
cannot she's so scared of heights and i can't do i can't do it and eventually
i was like julia you just need to focus she what her biggest fear actually was also
getting down okay um looking down and thinking how i might get but how the heck am i
going to get back down because that looks really scary and it's slippery and
there's there's screen so the ground is loose and i'm like don't even think about that
right now all you need to do is take one step at a time one meter at a time that's all i want you to
focus on and one meter and one meter and one and we'll figure out the rest and you might not even get to the top who knows you
might you might not we might start but just do one meter at a time and then
we'll figure out the down bit and we'll take it one step at a time on the way down because that's all we can do right in
that moment is take one step at a time and it's the same whether it's a goal to achieve
you know x turnover in a business or this many sales or whatever the business is or whatever walk of life yes we need to
know the end goal but actually we just need to focus on the process
because the summit looks scary but one meter doesn't look scary exactly and if you just do one meter at
a time and also you know or whether it's the fear or oh my god it's so far away we've got another four hours
to go it might be you know whatever it is well actually let's just do the next five minutes
and let's see if that is feasible because it probably is right can i do one yeah can you take this next step yeah i
can definitely take that next step okay can you take the next one can i take the next one and that feels really feasible you
mentioned earlier getting at the very beginning of this conversation getting news i think when you were about 24 25
that you had an illness called chronic fatigue syndrome i'm now going to be incredibly naive and
narrow-minded when i when you read chronic fatigue syndrome you think tiredness that's what you think right but um but i
know it's a lot more crippling than that and i know that it's a lot more devastating that especially for an athlete
um talk me through finding out you had this this this disorder but also what it meant for
your career and how it changed things heal this week

messages talk me through finding out you had this this this disorder but also
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome
what it meant for your career and how it changed things so yeah i
like you say was 25 26 when i was uh diagnosed with chronic fatigue
syndrome and yes it's more than just fatigue um it's not just i'm tired today it's being
devoid of energy exhausted almost on a permanent basis it also for
me included muscle pain to the point where the my muscles were sorry muscle ache to the
point where it was painful to the point where i couldn't stand in the shower and hold my hands up here to
wash my hair for more than 10 seconds because it was too painful
um some people have symptoms i didn't get this so much but sort of
you know like can't concentrate can't focus brain fog um some people
are actually bedridden um some people are actually in a wheelchair um luckily i wasn't as bad as that but i
was bad to the point where yeah i couldn't i i couldn't be in my kayak
paddling for more than 10 minutes at a very light gentle walk type pace having gone from winning world
championships for two and a half hours at a very high pace to can't get my hands to hold my hands
up here i i was literally two months earlier able to rattle off 100 press-ups in one go
and then can't hold my hands up here for more than 10 seconds so that's the that's the physical
element and that's only the physical element but the mental and emotional battle was
just as challenging because you can't you can't see it so it's not
you know i i was got frustrated to the point where i actually wished that my skin was covered in spots so
that people could see that there was something wrong with me and could understand that i was going through something that i was in pain
that i was you know unwell but i looked fine so i got diagnosed with the honest in
2003 beginning of the season it was like april and then
so following year is coming up to the olympics 2004 some training for the olympics or wanting to be training so six months
later it was only six months later that they actually diagnosed it because it takes six months for them to eliminate
everything else and go oh this is fatigue that's been going on for more than six months therefore you have chronic fatigue syndrome
and i re i went off to florida um and the sports team doctor was saying
right you need to do this graded return to exercise they think they originally and they still thought it was overtraining
that's the immediate assumption right athletes tired muscle ache must be over trained um so they diagnose
you they um offered me this program of right gently build up your return to
sport um so you start with 10 minutes at a heart rate of 115 i can't remember
and then 15 minutes at 115 and then 20 minutes and 30 minutes and when you can get to 40 minutes then we can go up to
120 heart rate and so on and so on and so i went out like my training group and my coach were all in
florida so i went out to florida to train and and i just couldn't get past 20 minutes um
and so i went out to i went to see a doctor in florida and the doctor he ran some blood tests
and basically like i still looked like an athlete i'm still pretty muscly i'm fair i'm
lean i'm in florida i've got a tan and he basically looked at me and said
well we've run all the blood tests there's nothing coming up nothing there doesn't appear to be anything wrong with you you look really fit and well
i think you're fine and so that just this frustration of i can't see it and
therefore there must be nothing wrong you know it's just mental health right you know people who are suffering with depression or anxiety or
whatever it is we can't see it and so we don't know it and we don't understand it and so the mental
and emotional battle was really challenging and um even people in my sport not
understanding what's wrong with anna oh she she can't cope with it anymore or she's too lazy to train or whatever
they're saying all these things and and that's hard um how did it make you feel
so in the beginning um frustrated devastated confused
um sad lonely so many different things and
frustrated because also we didn't really know what it was and the doctors are saying it's overtraining and actually when i reflect on the
previous two years i'd had episodes of fatigue which i now know were episodes of that
same illness but that only lasted for two weeks or three weeks or six weeks and i would stop training or i'd really
cut back on training and then i'd be able to come back and i'd be fine again and and so i
only know that it was i knew in my heart when i went to see the team doctor that one day and i
remember it that it wasn't over training because for six months i had been doing less
training than everyone else in my group i can't be overtrained i'm doing less
than everyone else because we were so conscious of this uh ana's over training that i wasn't i wasn't it was just was
not over training and the doctor is like oh you've over trained jesus and that i just and then that was it i
didn't train again for 18 months um and i did i did i after working with
the sport the team doctor i went to other doctors i tried conventional medicine i tried alternative therapies
and and nothing was working and that was the the hardest part as well was that
one you can't really tell me what's wrong with me and two you can't tell me how to deal with this and and then you know i went to see
one doctor and he said basically there's no cure there's no treatment and you're don't
don't don't think you're ever going to get back in a kayak you never you might get back in a kite but you're never going to race at that highest level you won't race again
so that was that was a pretty big moment um he said that to you yeah and how is that to him yeah just
like this is this is my you know this is my identity this is who i am this is my life this is this is my career i still have
ambitions left to fulfill and i don't i don't want something like this to end
my career i want to end it on my terms when i choose that i'm done and so
yeah that summer watching the olympic games on the telly and athens um it was devastating and
but i guess i always believed that i would find a way i was like there has
to be a solution to this there has to be a way out um and i i guess that
i'm a very optimistic person and a very much a possibility possibilitarian
i call it that i don't know if that's a word but believing that it's it's possible yeah that there is a way
out there has to be a way out and and i guess i didn't know
whether there was but i just had to i had to believe that there was i had to believe that i would get out of
this and then i would find a way back and that i would get back to training and racing one day otherwise what what what did i have and not that
my life would be over if i couldn't paddle but just that's what that belief i think
is what kept me going um in that in that time and and eventually to cut a long story short
i did find a treatment for the illness and i did recover and i didn't get back um
but it wasn't an easy journey do they before we got into what the treatment was in your recovery do they know what's happening to you
like physiologically when you have um that disorder have they do they know what what's
causing you um [Music] the problem is is that there are many different schools of thought okay
and it depends who you talk to and it depends which doctor um and what clinical or study or what
study you read or which one do you believe i believe
based on the treatment that i did um which was a treatment called reverse therapy and
this was founded by a chap called dr john eaton and back quite it was it was only just
um it was quite a new therapy when i did it back in 2005 for um and
essentially the symptoms are like alarm bells going off in your body so
these symptoms the pain the fatigue the exhaustion that can't focus any of the symptoms that you're experiencing
are alarm bells and your body's way of telling you that there are things
going on in your life that your body doesn't like whether that be pressures
stresses relationships environment emotions all sorts of things that are
triggering these symptoms and these alarm bells and basically if you don't listen
to the alarm bells they'll get louder and louder and louder to the point where eventually they just
go right done you're just not going to move now you're not going to until you listen
up how how how loud do i need to get before you're going to listen and for me it was to the point where i
couldn't train when i can't train i'm going to listen up because now it's really bad and now i
need to pay attention and so um i i'm i'm not particularly
articulate explaining what the physiologic what's going on physiologically but that's that's
my interpretation of what how the symptoms arrive and how you deal and and then
what i did so that the the treatment that i did is about identifying what are those triggers what are those things that um that your
body and mind are saying i don't like what were they and so for me um non-expression of
emotion is one of the most common triggers and that certainly was the case for me to the point where
i didn't open up to anyone really i have really close
friends i have family i have a sister i'm really close to and of course i you know shared it with them but i cried
on my own for sure but i never cried in front of anyone else i didn't really express how bad it was
in fact to the point where people would ask and you know how are you doing yeah i'm fine i'm fine and i would just block it out to them
all the time and that was just making it worse and actually when i started to
one of the biggest and most powerful steps that i took was opening up to people to the people closest to me sharing what
i was experiencing with them allowing them to see my struggle and my
vulnerability and let them help me that's that was a big turning point for me
um was being able to just express that emotion and share and open up
because par what i was doing was i was isolating myself by not sharing it and that was
perpetuating it um and these emotions are worry or pressure that you're
experiencing because of the sport or what were these emotions that you were suppressing or well so when
not when i was competing or you know before with the in the beginning the emotions were different but in the middle of the
illness like not just not sharing it with people not expressing how
hard i'm finding this how um tough this is that how sad i am how frustrated i am
how just i can't cope anymore kind of emotions those emotions i wasn't even expressing in the middle of the illness
you're being tough yeah i'm being poker face anna who has learnt to do this because that's what you do in sport
right isn't that isn't that almost like there's a bit of a paradox there that the thing that made you successful was also the thing that kind of
undid you to some degree it sounds like well so that composure and resilience yeah so
when you're on the competitive arena of sport and you turn up on race day poker face on game face i'm tough
whether i've missed the last two weeks because of an injury or for whatever reason you're never going to know that
because i'm i'm here today and i'm i'm on fire and you know i'm ready to race um and
that's brilliant on the race arena but outside of that
not helpful not helpful in so many ways in terms of building relationships in
terms of building trust you know we talk about trust earlier um
Benefits of being vulnerable
you can't build trust and relationships unless you open up unless you express vulnerability so true i think
that's one of the reasons i struggle with my relationships my romantic relationships is because i bring the tough guy thing into my into
like my personal life sometimes and um it doesn't ever help
and i think the the progress i've made actually in my personal relationships as you've said has been by like admitting more that i'm
wrong and like saying how i feel and being like i you know what i mean and that's but that's not conducive with
the whole like resilient tough guy business thing that i have to do i don't i don't think they're mutually
exclusive it doesn't feel like they are but you're right like they're definitely not mutually
exclusive but um they're two different people trying to achieve two different objectives
in business there's a sense of like you know you've got to really like stand up for yourself you've got to be ruthless to some degree in some
situations especially when you're dealing with teams and there's [ __ ] landing on your desk every day and you're getting horrible horrible news
and you have to put on a brave face for your team because you just found out that your whole server's been hacked and they've basically
half of them have lost their jobs or the pandemic has just struck and then going like
i know what you're saying do you think of certain moments i think i'm thinking one particular moment which i always talk about in this
podcast where on the way to work i got this news that we've been hacked and i've got i got 100 or 200 people sat
in the office in front of me that are now looking through the window and thinking what's going on and my my need to be composed and optimistic at
a time when i probably was panicking a little bit inside i think got us through i think if i'd walked out there and been
like listen guys i am [ __ ] it here it might have but in my personal life it's very important to have that
intimacy and vulnerability i think there's um a balance actually and i think in business
you are if you are able to be a little bit vulnerable and i'm not saying vulnerable to the point where you look
really weak but vulnerable to the point where you're honest and you
might go do you know what shit's happened and actually i'm a little bit scared
but we're going to find a way and i don't know how we're going to figure this out right now and and it's
not great and but you know it's about having confidence in who i am
and what we do and confident in the people around us and my team and you lot and all of us
that we're going to figure this out yeah so there's a balance there between i'm human
and yes i'm scared like you because this is [ __ ] and this is a bad situation that we didn't
want to happen and let's admit that let's put that on the table and be honest about it because people we build trust with
people when we're honest then we show a little bit of vulnerability and humanity and
that's how we build relationships because otherwise we're just putting up this tough guy front all the time who
doesn't have any feelings right and you can't relate to that can resonate can't connect yeah how do we connect with people
whereas actually oh you're just a human being who's scared too and i'm scared and therefore
it's okay to be scared but actually i'm scared but we're going to find a way so it's confidence
and we're going to figure this out because we we are good at what we do
you know our definition when we do our resilient leader workshops is a resilient leader's confidence and has
confidence in who they are and what they do and understands their areas of strength and their areas of
development and finds a way to bounce back and create opportunities and so if i'm confident in who i am and
what i do yeah i can admit that i don't know what to do right now
but i know that i have the skills and the resources within me and my people that we're going to figure
this out i don't know what that way forward is yet but i know that we're going to find a way
what if okay so what if you um and this is me playing devil's advocate what if you don't
know that you're gonna find a way so say you're scared you don't think you're gonna find a way and you think it's all over
say you've got i don't know 500 employees out there the wait waiting for you in the middle of the pandemic to make us make a statement to the team
do you walk out and lie if you within yourself genuinely as the ceo of a company don't you think it's over um
because of i don't know the pandemic has just happened and the business has evaporated when you walk out in front of your team
surely you've got to just lie to their faces to some degree like you've got i think that you have to believe we always
no matter what the situation is we can only be truly great at what we do if we
believe without doubt that the future is bright yeah some leaders don't
naturally you think of you know just some people don't so by like probably probabilistically there's
going to be some leaders that when the pandemic struck thought we are finished and that as we said earlier about like
the self-fulfilling mindset will actually probably take them out of business and i just i don't know just because i
don't think i've ever been comfortable in my career to tell my team that i'm scared i've i don't think i've ever actually
been scared because i am i kind of resist in moments where
i probably should be scared i'm so focused on solutions that fear or joy all these other
feelings don't really seem to be relevant or useful to me but i don't think i could bring myself to tell the team i was ever scared when
i was at social media maybe you don't need to say i'm scared but it might be that you know what yeah this is [ __ ] yeah
yeah yeah i could do that and and actually right now i don't i don't know how we're gonna get out of
this but i do have confidence in my ability and all of us together as a team that
we're gonna find a way the leaders have to lie sometimes i don't i don't i think we need to be
honest i think that we need to be transparent and the more
we can be transparent and we can be honest in what we do the better relationships we build the better connections the more trust we
have in a team and we figure it out together i agree
Overcoming your disorder
yeah so going back to your i want to know so what exactly did you do in terms of you know um daily
to overcome your disorder was it was there you addressed you know you started expressing yourself more was there
anything you you had to take or was there you know so there was no medicine there was no pill there was no
massage treatment there was nothing like that it purely is a recognition that the mind and the
body are connected and therefore i needed to figure out what these triggers are one of so to give you a bit of context
so um i leading up to the sydney 2000 olympic games i left the coach that i was working with
that had got me to become a world champion but i now wanted to go and race at the olympic games and he was very much a marathon coach
and and encouraged me to go find someone who really specializes in sprint racing
so i ended up for three years having a coach who was based in another country and i would go and train with them
sometimes and then i would come back to the uk and i would train on my own and he would
send me the training program we'd speak on the phone he'd email it to me i'd do the training and i would basically train
a lot of most days i would turn up to the training do the training and i was motivated enough to be able to
push myself really hard to i had no problem with training on my own in the sense that i
you know some people can't push themselves hard and i haven't got the motivation to turn up and do that but the problem
with that was that i and i didn't realize this at the time
i was isolating myself and i think i um so i i wasn't engaged there
was my club i was at my club but i would turn up to my club and they'd all go off and train separately and i train on my own and
then i'd often turn up at times when they weren't there i wouldn't engage with the british team really much and i was just ice more
and more isolating myself and then getting frustrated because i didn't have a coach she was by my side
and i thought that all i needed to do was train hard i thought and the reason i stuck with
this coach was because he was a great coach and i thought the training program was brilliant and i thought all i need to do is follow
a great training program and work really hard and i thought that was enough
and actually i didn't i'm not a robot and i needed i needed human connection and i needed
emotional support and i needed a place to vent and i needed to be able to show frustration and when the
training was hard or when i was exhausted and i had no one to even talk to on the riverside bank you know i'm talking to the ducks
you know it's like i had no outlet for my emotions i had no and i didn't even speak up and tell my
coach that i was frustrated that he sent me the program only two minutes before i needed to be at the training you know i was going to train and
because there's this five hour time difference and and i just was probably quite unhappy
but didn't realize because i was so focused on the goal and the end goal and
got to train hard and this is what it takes that i was so not in tune with
what was going on emotionally and i was at my best when i was training in
a group environment with a coach by my side every day supporting me other i'm an extrovert i get my energy
from other people and there i was spending my days alone doing this really intense training
program on my own that is not conducive to a really good
mental and emotional health and so it was really clear that that was
not yeah that wasn't sustainable and that was why i had these periods of oh yeah three weeks falling apart and
i'd have to stop and um and then when i'd get back to an environment that was i was happy and it was all good and i
would train hard and i'd be amazing and i have full of energy and and i and i had my best year and then i would change and the environment
change and so my environment and the people around me and my emotional happiness was some of the things that i needed to get a grip
on um it's so fascinating that people really underestimate the value of human connection but also the
The importance of connection
environment we're operating in like hugely i've had a conversation with a friend and he'll be listening to this podcast because he's never ever missed
one um he's he was working at my old company's um social chain for many years and he's
he's gone freelance and he was talking a little bit about feeling a bit burnt out he came to my house he's saying feel a bit burnt out i'm lacking
motivation in the mornings and things like that and when i was a freelancer before i started the company and had 700 people
around me all day i just couldn't find the motivation to like go to my laptop and send the emails
but the minute i was in that environment where we had this kind of like shared goal and i had feedback and
community my motivation was higher than anyone's in the world but i don't think people appreciate enough
the the importance of the environment and the community that you're operating in and i think there's a certain thing which people don't talk about which i've
talked about this podcast couple of weeks ago which was this idea of like freelance depression and even like you're seeing it with the world now from working remotely
having to get up and like now you're realizing what your job actually is because before
it could have been like seeing susanna and hearing about her weekend and engaging with the office dogs and this and the sense of community
you've kind of conflated them with your tasks at work and now it's just your tasks now you're
waking up and on a computer looking at your to-do list and so i think freelance depression and
it's almost what you've described there is this like inner lack of fulfillment because you've lost
what was a huge part of what made this pleasurable enjoyable but also your so i guess your support network
yeah um and that's why you know we talked earlier about motivation and what gets you off in the morning and
actually going in to hear about susan's weekend or you know to see your friends and the
connection and the buzz from the atmosphere and and that might be what gets you to work not the tasks that i've got to do but
actually the people i'm going to hang out with and that environment and we need to understand what is that environment that
we thrive in and i think people are realizing that over the last 12 months you know
and especially the extroverts have found this really hard and if you live on your own and you're still and you're not able to go into
work you're a speaker you speak around the world and stuff and you you love speaking but the minute it
becomes just speaking to a laptop over zoom to 100 people you realize that
maybe it wasn't just the speaking that i enjoyed right yeah yeah yeah exactly i don't just enjoy hearing my own voice
yeah i enjoy telling my story over and over again i i love the connection that i get and
the feedback and the you know i can't even hear people laugh at my jokes that i think they're supposed to be funny
i don't even know if they landed or not um and you know when you meet the people
afterwards and you go and engage with them and how are you going to apply this and what are you going to put into action and and all of that stuff that's that's
that's the energy that i get when i go and do my work and
that's that's missing right now um and you're getting it a bit but not in the same way and so
and i remember actually one of the very first things i did with my sports psychologist he got me to do
i think it was like a myers-briggs type assessment identifying what kind of personality
type i was and i was a stable extrovert and and i don't know what he ever really
did with that information but looking back now that's such useful information so for someone
if someone had known that and they could see that i was training every day on my own without support without people to
feed off that's where i get my energy of course i was losing energy and tired i wasn't getting your body was sending
you a message i'm like i need people to get energy and i'm not surrounded by people that's just one
example of one of the triggers but you know so it was about finding out what do i need to thrive
it's fascinating uh we had johanna hari who wrote the book called lost connections on this podcast his book is
behind me one of my favorite books of all time he's coming back his whole his whole um book is about the real the nine real
reasons for anxiety and depression and to kind of conclude it in in a very sort of narrow way he talks
about these feelings we get of loneliness and lack of motivation and anxiety and depression when you look
at all the studies and he was someone that was depressed and given the pills and you know they said oh you're broken chemical imbalance when you look
at the studies it's it's almost indisputable that much of it these days is because of social factors and our
lack of human connection they've got examples where they've given a guy in uruguay goat who was depressed and because he's
got now that connection with an animal he's his depression his symptoms of depression almost evaporated
but the lives we live in 2021 between four white walls if we want food
we press an app if we want you know to see our parents it's through a piece of glass and living alone in these industrialized
cities it's actually completely against our innate human programming and he says one of the
things he says which i've written in my book as well is about how these feelings are our calling to get back to being more human it's
like your body calling like loneliness is this calling like get back to your tribe you know what i mean and then
and i and it sounds like [ __ ] because it's like well my loneliness isn't the thing but what you've just described there is
quite literally something that's happened in your mind having a real substantial almost
devastating and crippling impact on your body and health the thought that your mind
can disable your body is um terrifying on one hand but also kind of
like a really powerful important you know but if you think about many
illnesses ailments from [Music] getting a you know crafting people will
get a headache when they're stressed people will get a migraine when at the end of a stressful period people will
get sick sick you know so there are so many illnesses that can be considered
as emotional but manifest physically yeah it's crazy so it's not
the first example yeah and and you know like your loneliness is my calling to get back it's an alarm
bell right you're feeling really lonely and it's a warning sign to you it's a message
to say you need to do something differently in this example get back to your tribe and in the same way that my body the
alarm bells were i'm going to make you so tired that you can't train so then you're going to listen
and you're going to figure out what it is that you need to do differently to get back to training
in a really healthy way and when i returned back to training i was able to change
lots of things about my environment about the people i was with about the pressures i put myself under
you know all of these things that i'd figured out and then i trained harder than i had before
because i was in a really healthy environment and place and i was listening to my body and my
mind they call it mind body and i was able to tune into that and go
every time i was anywhere near just not feeling quite right i'd go what
what's my my body telling me right now what is it that's going on that it doesn't like what do i need to be aware of and then i
could thrive after that it's a big shift in conventional thinking because whenever someone exhibits
physical illness people say oh what tablet does this person need you know what's the chemical and and
that's why you'll get lots of different if you research cfs there's so many different schools of
thought oh it's a post-viral fatigue it's you know there's lots of um
yeah i guess um physiological explanations for it
and maybe and there's probably lots of you know clinical research behind that suggests that it is i don't know but my
experience was that something else and that's all i can go by really and you came back
to the sport competing again i'm guessing yeah so i returned two years later and won the world championships
and european championships in 2005 and then went on to win two more times after that and compete in beijing three years later
it's incredible so now all of that's you know that part of your career has um ended
What’s next for you?
very very successfully and you've you know you reached the real i mean you were the world champion multiple times looking forward at your
your your the career since then and into the future what matters to you and what's getting you out of bed now and what's
making you um excited for yeah life um i love
helping others now helping others sharing learning from my experiences in sport and taking those
lessons and bringing them to other people mostly in the business world and developing people you know
i had you know spent a lifetime with coaches who were developing me um
or the athletes and the team and it's the same thing it's about
developing people you know in bus in sport it was about getting results through people
developing those people to get results in sport and now i'm using that to get results
for people in business by developing people and and i get a real
kick out of you know if i'm coaching someone and coaching a director or a leader whoever it is i was coaching
this morning and seeing them have that aha moment about a limiting belief um
you know getting the new dream job um engaging with the team being a more
confident leader whatever it is i love it when i see that change and that transformation in other people
helping them to change habits to change behaviors to excel to get the best out of themselves that's what really
that's what motivates me now is is helping others to fulfill their potential
well listen it's been um an incredibly interesting diverse conversation one that's made me um have a couple of
my own personal epiphanies so i thank you so much for coming today and sharing your story um where do people find you if they want to get in
touch with you where's the best way to reach out so annahemings.com my training consultancy call is called
beyond the barriers so be on the barrels.uk i'm on linkedin um we'll find you they'll finally turn on we can find a

Intro
they just don't have the education so our own doctors do not have enough education in something that we do a third of our lives
if you are waking up in the middle of the night and it's been happening to you over and over again to resolve the habit you're going to
have to
sleep it's a thing that we all do every day but for some reason in our society it's still a little bit of a mystery
how many hours should we be sleeping what is sleep debt is there a perfect sleep routine should
i wake up at a certain time why do i get sleep paralysis insomnia why do i have these dreams
my next guest stephanie romichevsky worked with nasa and harvard medical school to understand
these questions stephanie currently works as a sleep physiologist helping people cure and understand their insomnia and
sleep disorders so without further ado my name is stephen bartlett and this is the diver ceo i hope nobody is listening
but if you are then please keep this to yourself [Music]
What the result of not sleeping properly?
stephanie the first question i wanted to ask you and i've got millions and millions of questions to
ask you because this is a topic which i as i said before we started chatting on air
um has really peaked an interest over the last three years i've never had so many of my friends in my
sort of close circle ask me questions about sleep send me articles about sleep and i don't know what's happened but as
a nation and as a as a species i think we've got really really curious about this idea of sleep and also its
importance the first question i wanted to ask you was a was how important sleep is but
i think a better way to understand that and the answer is to actually look at
the consequences you've seen in your line of work um for people that have
bad sleep or that have insomnia um so could you speak to that a little bit i can that's a big big question yeah um
what i have seen over the last 16 years of my career is not people coming in dying because
they aren't sleeping or with really really significant illnesses i've seen people
very anxious very stressed very low because their sleep is poor and they are
extremely worried about it and i've seen people who are you know at the top of their game and doing
really well in life but are completely crippled by these sleep problems but it is the fear
of bad things worse things happening to them that is keeping them as stressed and upset as they are so
it's quite interesting because i think the the things that bring people to me to get their sleep treated
are exactly that that fear is actually what i'm trying to alleviate rather than
um fixing their sleep because i think they're going to get so sick that something terrible is going to happen to them
and so it's a really interesting question to ask how does sleep affect us the reality is we actually we or why do
we sleep we don't know actually why we sleep we know what happens when we don't sleep
but i think we're getting very very confused between those of us that struggle with sleep and
those that are actively depriving themselves of sleep like the ceo who says
i'll sleep when i'm dead for example sure um but you know those of us who are
actively trying to sleep when we can't and we will do anything and we we make
our sleep opportunities larger and we still can't get sleep we're not depriving ourselves of sleep we're doing
anything we can to get sleep so i i worry about the amounts
out there about sleep at the moment and the way that it's the information is being disseminated because i think
that's where we're going a bit wrong and all the tracking of sleep and all the tech that comes out i'm not saying it's
it's a bad thing i'm just saying that it's almost like we haven't quite caught up with all the information that we have
and we can't cope with it quite the way we need to so you speak about the tech that we have
Where is the bullshit?
now apple watches all these little you know smart devices that are telling us how many hours a day we're sleeping
and also there's you know books there's probably a couple books on the shelf behind me about the perfect night's sleep or the perfect morning routine or
the perfect time to wake up where is the [ __ ] oh my god again another massive question um
there is so much of it it's it's all it's so nuanced you're going to have to ask me some specifics because
there is so much there that actually is i mean well the first thing the biggest thing i
would say is you know going to bed at exactly the same time every night dictating your bedtime is
probably the worst piece of advice i've ever heard and sends people off on all sorts of different tangents which does not help
if anything it makes their insomnias worse because they go to bed in the dark not able to sleep getting
more anxious heart rate going up what should they do instead stay up until they're sleepy
don't worry about it enjoy yourself relax do the things that you probably don't get time to do because you're busy doing
all the other things during the day is the problem i have with that approach which is the approach that i think i've
adopted maybe a little bit too much or incorrectly is if i stayed up doing the things that
i want to do what happens is i'll stay up till 7 am just looking at youtube videos and learning about rockets and looking at like stocks to invest in and
stuff that's that's me to a t i at some point i have to put my laptop down and be like steve just you're going to feel awful tomorrow if
you can looking at this investment fund that you think is interesting yeah absolutely so to a degree you can i
mean we can manipulate our bodies to do anything in a lab i could manipulate your body to sleep when i wanted it to
sleep um but that's taking away all the environmental factors all the behavioral factors of your life
um and what you're doing now you know what it's not the end of the world you know you're obviously coping with it and you're healthy and the problem is you
probably won't be able to sustain that and unfortunately we are built in such a way that kind of goes with the
the light dark cycles on this planet um and so to a degree you are sort of going against that and unfortunately we've got
lots of other we've got lots of research showing that after a while you just can't do that forever without implication
um so it's not i mean if you think about it insomnia is just a different pattern
of sleep you've just trained your brain to sleep differently and you're still surviving with it it's
just that most of us don't like that because it's not the rest of society in the way that they're sleeping
and our friends are sleeping and it feels like we're the only ones awake in the night i bet if you didn't have all those
things to do and you weren't the way you were and you were up at night and everybody else around you was asleep
it would start to feel like a very lonely um anxious place we're not very rational at night we're not really
made to think in the middle of the night so not incredibly rational so i don't think it's the end of the
world what you're doing but at the same time put it this way i treat a lot of entrepreneurs
when they've retired and they're still fairly young but not in a good place because they have not followed anything that
was fairly going along with what our physiological processes want to do our bodies are all about regulation we have
clocks in every cell in every part of our body and they like regulation they like
time they like the timing of things to be ready and and regular and when we keep changing
those goal posts it might seem like we're being uber flexible but actually the reality the reality is
is that later on down the line you'll probably find that you won't be able to cope with it as much
and how does that manifest itself for me so so for you if you just carried on the way you were then unfortunately yeah we
probably would see that um maybe you were getting less sleep than you needed um it probably would be
harder for you maybe when you settled into a routine where you were working around the same hours every day
say you got a certain kind of role that you had to do which made you know you had to have a certain schedule
you might find it quite difficult after a while to stick to that schedule and you might find that you aren't able
to sleep as much as you want the duration and the quality will be impaired and so you might start
all the research around sleep and how important it is for you you might start noticing things like
your cognitive abilities are less so your memory things like that um your ability to
produce cytokines so the proteins that help us with keeping ourselves healthy and keeping
inflammation at bay and things like that all those kind of things will be reduced your healing so when you go and weight
training or something like that or you go to the gym and you want your muscles to repair they're not going to be able to do that so well and of course that over time
short term it's not a problem over time long term that's when we start worrying about
more significant illnesses and um disorders that are happening as we get
older and so that's why we see lots of research showing that as we get older maybe some of these
things like alzheimer's might be related to how we treated our sleep when we were younger however
i hate it i hate mentioning things like that because i think it frightens people and the problem is
with frightening people is that they go into what they think is most logical things to do so they might go
away after this podcast and think oh my god i've just got to go away and get my eight hours because the rest of the
information is telling them out there that they've got to get this eight hours of sleep every night um and of course they can't just get
that you can't dictate to your body how it sleeps there is a process it follows it and so
unfortunately you can never force yourself to sleep you can force yourself not to sleep and that is partly how you fix a
sleep problem but you can never force yourself to sleep but you can induce anxiety and stress and depression
through that and lack of sleep so yeah in um
if you're an expert in this field so you must as you kind of spoke to there you must get pretty i can feel it when you're speaking get
pretty pissed off when you see unhelpful information um being pushed on i don't know social media or online or
through books these sort of simplified narratives what are some of the most um common misconceptions that you speak to your
What are the common misconceptions
patients about you've mentioned one there about this like eight hours of sleep being the optimal yeah and even when i put out
on my instagram earlier what are the key questions you want to ask um i'm speaking to a sleep therapist expert today um
i'd say the vast majority or at least the medium question was uh do i need to get exactly seven or
eight hours sleep every single night yeah um yeah so that is definitely the biggest one we get um
you do not that perfection is the enemy of the good have you ever heard that term because at the end of the day it's true
yes your body loves consistency and regulation but that does not mean you have to get eight hours of sleep every night think
about it differently think about it over a month for example we love this idea of the way the way we look at time is slightly different to
the way your body looks at time and over a month you might actually be all right so maybe one night you get
six and a half hours the next night you get seven and a half and then the next night you might get slightly different as long as it's fairly consistent and
maybe eighty percent of the time you're doing fairly well and you're you're giving yourself the right opportunity to sleep
that's okay your body's gonna do it you know it will do what it needs to do and and with that a caveat to that is
this understanding of sleep debt so we don't understand sleep debt properly people think it's an eye for an eye
i lose four hours i must gain four hours well what happens when your body being as efficient as it is doesn't
actually need you to gain an extra four hours of sleep to recover you your expectation is that it should and
when your expectation doesn't get met you get upset about it and you change your behavior and that's when you start getting sleep
problems when the reality is your brain is so smart that even in the certain amount of hours
that you get normally at night it can recover you from that sleep deprivation by just improving or
increasing the sleep stage that it thinks you miss the most for example but because we have a lack of education
we believe we don't get some sleep we need to regain that sleep and when we don't regain that sleep
that's when the anxieties and the stress is over not sleeping start so that's a big one the sleep debt one the other one is this idea that fatigue
and sleepiness are the same things so yes when we don't sleep well we get a lot of fatigue
so fatigue is anything from feeling like your body needs to rest to needing to shut
your eyes to pain to your brain buzzing because you've been working so hard for like 48
hours straight and you don't know what to do with yourself but the only definition of sleepiness is the ability to shut your eyes and within
a few minutes you're falling asleep so if you were saying to me right now steph i am so so sleepy i'd probably say to you well you
don't look it because right now you don't look tired in the way that i would expect you to be falling asleep i mean you wouldn't be
able to sit still you you would be sort of probably your eyes would be shutting all the time dozing off having little micro sleeps
that sleepiness and that's what we should really be understanding as a cue to sleep so in the evenings if you're
not feeling that then don't be don't be worried give yourself permission to stay up later
because you can't dictate what happens to you during the day and there are so many variables that affect your sleep you are never going to be able to
control them having good sleep hygiene how many good sleepers do you know have it so good sleep hygiene is all these
things that we get told we should do so the 10 top things that you should do have a warm bath never drink coffee ever
again um never have alcohol you know all these things that you're supposed to do but if you look at good sleepers are
they following all those things no they're not and they're still sleeping really well and that's to show that most of the time
sleeping poorly comes down to brain training and the patterns we get ourselves into
you start going to bed early you might be able to get to sleep earlier but you're probably not going to be able to
have that sleep all the way through the night because at some point or another your body's going to be like well you've had enough now but your expectation is
you should be able to sleep till seven and why didn't i sleep till seven or if you lie in you keep changing the goal post of
your wake-up time which is the most important thing that you should be looking at not your bedtime um if you keep changing that
goal post your body doesn't know when to feed you it doesn't know when to make you feel alert because you've changed everything and so of
course you're not going to be sleepy at the right time the time you wake up is the
much more important time to be focused on yes the things your morning routine is going to be way
more important than your evening routine when it comes to your sleep at night but be because people see that as a far away
time compared to when you go to sleep they don't really focus on it in fact haven't we been taught in this society
that lying in as a luxury i can't believe that we have made it okay at the weekend
to lie in so much but during the week one of the only things that gets us up is work it makes
absolutely no sense to me i'm not saying it's the worst thing in the world i'm not saying i never lie
in but i don't use it as a compensatory method for a bad night's sleep because that's when you're going to get into
trouble because that's kind of throwing your your your schedule up is that what you're saying yeah
yeah so if you line on the weekends and you're going to pay for it at some point yeah why are we not looking you know if you
have to lie in so significantly every single weekend why are we not looking at during the week and thinking why am i doing this to
myself at the time when i need it the most i would choose to get less sleep and then
at the weekend i'll just compensate and people and you much of the conversation around sleep and society
talks about the amount of hours and it's almost like the amount of hours that i was in the bed
um what's your sort of rebuttal to that because quality over quantity every
single time every single time and if you have good quality and you need
longer your body will tell you and you will get more sleep but people are so obsessed with duration
and i i think people don't understand what i mean by sleep opportunity i mean every single night most of the time so
about eighty percent of the time i will give myself a seven to eight hour sleep
opportunity sleep window but i do not mean that if i'm not sleepy i take myself into a dark room and shut
myself down i just know that it's there i've got a bedroom a place i really want to be to
sleep that is available to me during those hours and i will not sleep outside those hours and that's the
that is the big thing is you can dictate to your body when you don't sleep but you cannot dictate when you do and
by doing that you will force your body to be in a nice regular cycle it's actually really really simple once
you know how to do it and every time i fix someone of their insomnia there and honestly 50 60 years of insomnia
they often turn around to me they're like i don't know why i wasn't taught this when i was younger and i do believe if
we taught everyone how to sleep properly give them a proper sleep education when they're little i wouldn't exist
How should I be designing my environment
insomnia wouldn't exist you talked there when you referenced your own bedroom i think you
spoke about it quite lovingly it's about this place i like to sleep how important is that how important is it to sleep in the same place and for that
space to be is there a certain way i should be designing my bedroom is there like a bed that's good or like a pillow
because there's lots of fads around yeah yeah there's a lot of fans around i think your environment is important
but i can't dictate to you what that is because we're all so different um yes it's true
you don't need loads of technology in your bedroom to sleep i'm not saying technology can't aid our sleep because i
think in the future we're going to come up with some crazy cool things that are going to really help us i just think right now we're not quite
there i think the least you have in your bedroom that reminds you of the day is really important so obviously screens
and light is very important when it comes to sleep but i think people mis are missing a trick when when we say
don't look at your phones we're not just saying don't look at your phones because of the light exposure we're saying it because it's reminding
your brain of something that you did during the day and so your brain being the smart thing that it is is thinking
okay well i'll um i'll i'll increase your cortisol and i'll reduce your melatonin which is
your stress and your sleepy hormone uh hormones um and i'm gonna help you be
more alert because you clearly want to be alert right now and so your brain thinks it's helping you
and then you're thinking hang on a minute i just looked at my phone for like three seconds and now i'm buzzing why and it's just because your
brain is your your behavior is so much more influential on your physio physiology than you realize what do you
What do you thunk about the snooze button?
think about the snooze button um i think if you have to use it on a regular basis you need to start
questioning why you always need to snooze unfortunately the research shows that snoozing does not benefit us
at all and actually if you think about it if if you are a snoozer you know how many times does that
actually make us feel better exactly delays sorry no i think it's
nonsense as well i did i one of my modules when i was doing psychology in school was about sleep and
um understanding the different phases of sleep made me realize that the snooze button is i think totally pointless because you
have to be in a certain phase of sleep for you to get real benefits and within 15 minutes you're not going to
How to sort your sleep tonight
get into that phase right absolutely um a lot of people when they you know when they
knew that i'm speaking to you today um they want to know how they can sleep better in the short term tonight they're
looking for some kind of quick fix to the to a problem they've had for a long time what would you say to those people
okay so the first thing i'd say is that you're never going to find that reactive very quick method it's never going to
happen and even if you find it i promise you it won't work in the long term it might control your condition in the short term
but not in the long term i can teach you how to re to sleep but it's going to take you
a a a few weeks not a night um but in the meantime don't worry it's okay like part part of
this is i just there is a solution so what i do is called cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia it is not the same as cbt for
depression or anxiety or anything else um and it is just about retraining yourself to sleep and building up that
strong sleep drive you have to do that over time but in the short term i usually tell
people that they do not need to worry nothing bad is going to happen to you and the reality is
that it's more your mood that will affect your day when you wake up in the morning than the bad night's sleep you just had
so i know we've got evidence to show that when you have a bad night's sleep your cognitive abilities etc are going
to be um reduced however if you think about how you generalize that
you're not you're not going to lose your job you're not going to perform horrifically in that meeting because you didn't get a good night's sleep
it would be far better for you to go to bed later and make sure you're lovely and sleepy and only get four
hours than to go to bed eight hours before that meeting and toss and turn and be fidgety and
stressed and anxious all night that's what i do i still get nervous when i have to do like a lecture in front of 500 people of course i get
nervous but instead of you know focusing on my notes just before i go to bed i'll put everything aside
i'll go and enjoy myself do something i really love to do i'll get ready for bed a bit earlier
than usual just so that i do not have to think about anything when i get sleepy and when i am sleepy even if it's two
three four hours later than usual i know that i'll go and have a really lovely
three or four hours sleep and then i'll wake up and i'll be like great i know i'm gonna be a bit sleepy today but that's only gonna help me sleep tonight
and i'm gonna have an epic day i don't care that i'm a bit sleepy sleepiness is amazing sleepiness is such a good thing
for you why are we teaching people that sleepiness is a bad thing you need sleepiness to sleep
i've got two questions though the first i'm sure is it feels like a very um related sort of question to what
Do you sleep well?
you've just been talking about there which is do you sleep well i'm sure you get asked this all the time at every party every
time you it's like asking a comedian to tell a joke right yeah yeah it's like how was your sleep okay so most of the
time my sleep is fairly good because i've been lucky enough to be educating myself through this for
the last 16 years but it's not good all the time because it's totally normal
after some kind of life stressor new illness some dramatic change in our society
like we're seeing right now for your sleep to change and for it to be poor okay it is totally normal to have sleep
problems we will all get them you will never find someone who does not have a sleep problem at some point in their
lives but there is a difference between somebody who has a short-term sleep problem and when the initial issue resolves
itself the sleep problem goes away and the person who has now unfortunately got
a long-term sleep problem the difference is the behavior it is not the person it is
not some trait that you have over someone is not something genetic there are there are all of those things
that do feed into for example insomnia but the reality is the thing that seems to perpetuate sleep
problems is not usually the original trigger so we cannot blame the divorce for example 20 years ago i'm not
divorced but i'm just making an example so 20 years ago we get divorced and it's a really stressful situation and it
stops you sleeping for a month okay but now you're remarried and you're perfectly happy but you've got a 20-year
insomnia problem we cannot blame the divorce for that anymore and also somebody else who's gone through the
same situation same illness or divorce or new medication would not have had that sleep problem 20
years later so what is it and i believe and we know that most of it is your
behavior after a few weeks of a sleep problem most people will freak out and they'll start changing their behavior
so they might start lying in they might start going to bed early they're trying desperately to improve
their sleep opportunity because they believe the mere act of lying in a bed for longer is going to
miraculously give them a stronger sleep drive and make them get through whatever it is they need to get through when the reality is and this is usually
how we treat insomnia or one of the ways we actually deprive you of your sleep opportunity so we don't deprive you of
sleep but we do deprive you of your sleep opportunity so we only allow you to be in bed for a certain amount of time and that fixes it
but that's frightening because with teaching people that sleep is so bad or not sorry not sleep is so bad but
sleepiness is so bad that they don't feel that they can build up that strong sleep drive without something terrible
happening to them so the way we are disseminating knowledge right now is not working and we have got to find a
The Therapy you offer
way to change that you talked about the type of therapy you offer cognitive behavioral therapy for
insomnia one of the elements you've described is this sleep deprivation which is in essence you're
stopping people sleeping i'm guessing throughout the day to focus them on
their sleep opportunity um yes so it's less about restricting their sleep and more about restricting
their bedtime so often when you come across somebody who's had a sleep problem for a fair while enough to come to see me
they're usually spending more time in bed than they are sleeping so for example they might be in bed for around 10 hours but they're
only sleeping for say six hours and so what i would do is i would restrict them in the first
instance only so it's only mildly to six hours in bed because or five hours in bed whatever they're sleeping
for i would we would we would never really go lower than five hours because at the end of the day we're only
um sort of guess it's all a bit of guesswork here um and that's important that it's like
that and we're not over tracking sleep because that's has its own issues um and then for a week or so i'll keep
them on that schedule and try and get them to strictly stick to it which is quite scary for somebody who thinks the total
opposite way is going to fix them even though they've got no evidence that it works it doesn't matter they've been doing it for a long
time so it's quite hard to get someone to do this and then once we can get them to sleep for around 90
of that five or six hours whatever they spend in bed then we can start increasing their sleep
time out very very slowly but people sort of get very over eager about this it's called sleep restriction
therapy um or there's lots of different ways of calling it and people get over excited
about it and they're obsessed with reaching that 90 percent efficiency so they can move on and add time but i try to always explain to
people and indeed i do online courses in sleep that they can do themselves and i'm always trying to explain to them
it's not about adding more time imagine if you are getting to five or six hours sleep efficient every
every night for seven days as an average that's really good that's so much better than the broken sleep you were getting
before think about the new quality that you have built how amazing is that when's the last time you went for a week
and you had that consistent sleep and when they start thinking about it that way they're like oh my god yes this is so much better
and i'm even able to add more time now and we slowly incrementally start adding sleep out and that's how
you fix it i mean it's not everything because you've got to work on the mindset you've got to work on the re-educating people what are those other
pieces of the therapy yeah you gotta so first of all one is the
sort of sleep restriction as you called it yeah one area is you we need to you've got to be
re-educated on sleep much like we've been chit-chatting away today that's how i will talk to someone
and i will try to help them understand um i'll try and pick out a lot of the things that they talk to me about
um but it's trying to help them understand where the myths are where the facts are with sleep because a lot of their ideologies around sleep
will be directly influencing their behavior and so as soon as you can change that and it's not as simple as just saying
that's right and that's wrong you've got to keep doing it and they need to trust you and and you've got to find a way in the right language to
speak to that person once you've done that you can start with the sleep restriction and then of course whilst there is no
evidence that relaxation or anxiety reduction is going to directly and reactively fix a long-term sleep
disorder after you've started improving your sleep drive and using the sleep restriction therapy to do that
then yes we do need to start looking at how do you bring yourself back to balance during the day
is it stress and anxiety that got you here in the first place because you're working too much and you got yourself into the wrong patterns
how are you going to process more during the day how are you going to balance more during the day we need to look at those things but we
need to look at them with the right expectations which is that they are not going to make you sleep because once that expectation is not met
you feel really inadequate and then you feel like nothing can help you and then you get hopeless and out of control and lonely about your
problem so all this lots of different sort of elements like a pyramid to try and help someone
Caffeine and sleeping pills
with their sleep and you know people um cat caffeine has become a huge part of our you know we live in a society where
people take caffeine to wake them up and then quite often they'll take certain supplements to shut them down again like sleep
new supplements or um various knighthold i think is one of them right i don't know yeah yeah um what's your take on all of
all of these chemicals we're using to kind of regulate our alertness and then our tiredness
they just they can't work overtime so all the research shows that eventually you either get used to them they stop
working they make you feel really uncomfortable i don't think there's anything wrong with for example sleeping pills or using
caffeine in the short term things like that um but starting to use them long term they have their own
all of them have their own side effects and over a long time of use aren't very good for the
body and but in general they're just not going to they're not going to suddenly miraculously reset your sleep button or
anything that's people seem to think they're going to do so i don't think relying on these things in the short term is a bad thing every
now and again but if you're relying on them every single time you have a sleep problem you're effectively making it worse
because your brain isn't learning anything it is literally just being giving a cheap method
like a fake sleep almost and that is what you get from a lot of sedatives is sedative sleep which is not the same as
the cycles that you go through usually to sleep well so you're not getting but psychologically
we believe that sleep is better than no sleep and actually i don't necessarily agree with that in a
way i'd rather get no sleep than a really rubbish sleep knowing that my body will like build up
a really strong sleep drive and help me later but people are so terrified of that that they that psychologically they just need
to feel like they've slept but if they had a bit of better education around sleep and they understood how it worked more
then i don't think people would be trying to grab all these things all the time but we live in a reactive society
we're not very proactive as creatures we want we want it now and we want it done yesterday what about caffeine that's
such a huge part of everybody's well pretty much everybody's daily routine people they you know they'll say i have to have
this coffee to wake myself up yeah i have three or four of them a day and then what impact does that end up
having on sleep so caffeine is very interesting because genetically we are all
either sensitive or not sensitive or somewhere in between with caffeine so it's very hard to say nobody should be drinking caffeine after
this time yes it does have a very sort of it has a big afterlife so it definitely
or half-life so what we mean by that is that um you know it's going to have an effect on you hours and hours after you've had it
but depending on how sensitive you're to to it you are you know but at the same time there's so much more you
can do if you started waking up at the same time every day you would start to feel refreshed you would be one of those people who wakes
up and is like yeah i'm ready to start the day imagine if you just used your body the way it was designed to be used
i'm not saying caffeine is bad i definitely wouldn't say you can't drink caffeine but if you're
starting to use it anything in life in anything chemical in a compensatory method because something
is wrong that's when you need to start questioning it but in general having caffeine in the morning i don't think
there's anything wrong with that if you enjoy it great but then there's lots of research that shows that even your performance
isn't significantly improved by having caffeine you might feel like you're able to buzz around everything more but your
actual efficiency isn't necessarily improved i i wonder you know because i think i was looking at some stats
Whats causing all these sleeping problems?
around insomnia and sleep so sleep disorders and the stats are pretty staggering and
i don't know how to say this but i just don't tend to believe that humans after all these thousands of
years of evolution have been born with quite an apparent or seemingly apparent um
problem with sleep so it makes me think okay so what is it in our social um environment and society
that's making us struggle with sleep is it our over obsession with the
perfect sleep that might be one element and this you know and all the fear and anxiety around not sleeping perfectly as
you've described and we're actually doing pretty good yeah right and labeling ourselves as insomnia you know because that word
i'm an insomniac or insomnia it's thrown around pretty yeah absolutely or is it the you know the
tech in our lives is it the the over stimulation of the you know the technology we have is it overworking
what's your take on that because i feel the same about depression and anxiety as well i look at the stats growing over
time um in ver with various sort of mental um illnesses and i think surely we weren't
born um with chemical imbalances as is um said in um yeah i love them
yeah i so it's a hard question to answer i think that there is element there's
lots of different elements i don't believe that the stats are as accurate as they probably seem
for example i believe that before you know the industrial revolution for example we had um sleep problems i i mean i
no i do i believe we did it's just that i believe we're recording things now more so there's that aspect of it
there is this aspect of we over worry about things and you know at the end of the day while someone keep you know lots of people out there
keep telling us that actually um you know if you sleep less than six hours you will die early
but actually we're not actually seeing that today um yeah how much am i reducing my life
expectancy with my poor sleep the thing is okay so if you know you've got poor sleep you need to improve it but
hopefully it's not going to be long term you can actually get some support for that and get it sorted if you're
actively keeping yourself at five hours when you know you're a seven hour sleeper then yeah you're going to reduce your
life expectancy but if you're naturally a five hour sleeper and they do exist then that does not mean the same thing
that you're going to be reducing your life expectancy when genetically you can't you know that's for you
um it's really difficult to understand i think um you know electricity has a big
part to play so again i talked a little bit briefly at the beginning about the light dark cycles of this planet
and the way that we are designed or not designed but you know we're built on this planet we we seem to have
evolved that way um and so we we we definitely do need to be
in general not uh working and resting more at night and we we work better our metabolisms our
brains function we're more rational during the day um and so with electricity has become
many problems i definitely think the scaremongering and the fear and the tracking of sleep
has definitely caused in the last few years a boom in sleep problems or at least how many people are coming to us for help
and with the the pandemic what impact has that had on people's sleep heel let's talk about heal for a second
i've spent a lot of time on this podcast talking about the ready to drink your bottles which are my favorite for convenience reasons it means i don't
have to mix anything but this week as my goals in gym and in my health in my physique have started to
evolve i've started using a new product that i wanted to tell you about and the reason why i've started using this
product which is called huel the black edition is because there's 50 less carbs
33 more protein um zero artificial sweeteners and it's of
course gluten free i wish i had something like this to be honest when i was a student
because it's literally one pound 47 per meal i think you get about 17 or 18 meals out
of one bag and if you're someone like me that in this phase of my life that's trying to build a bit of muscle get a little bit more lean whilst
also you know reducing the carbs a little bit then give black edition huel a try and try the vanilla flavor if you
do get a chance because that's um for me is the the tastiest flavor of them all and do you know what i'm gonna do next week
in the podcast i'm gonna take my top off okay so i'm gonna um show you the impact that uh
all of this being a huel again has had for me you're gonna have to tune in next week and you're gonna have to watch it on youtube to see
that but um i'm gonna show you the the before and after of using huel and uh uh and before i
used to okay so that's something to look forward to or maybe not with the the pandemic what impact has
What impact has the pandemic had on peoples sleep
that had on people's sleep it's had a huge impact so um in various different ways so the first way is that
everybody's routine changed and because we couldn't go outside and move as much as we once did we couldn't get
as much light exposure as we once did we didn't get as much stimulation social stimulation
so our brains weren't being used in the same way plus we all had this sort of uh thing to look at on the news all the
time so we're actively sort of looking at something that is stressing us out and making us anxious so various different components
no wonder sleep changed but it would have been totally normal for that to happen your sleep is
adapting to your new environment and so when people start worrying about this i try to get them to
calm down about it because actually if your sleep wasn't working properly you just wouldn't be here okay so to a
degree our sleep is doing a bloody good job for us um and we need to be better about it we
blame sleep for everything um and actually there's so many other variables that we can control in our
lives that will have an effect on us but yes during the pandemic we saw um or we still see
there's plenty more problems with people struggling to get to sleep maybe they're feeling really buzzy and they can't get to sleep maintaining
that sleep so people waking up in the middle of the night and they're just like what why am i waking up sometimes they
they've got million thoughts a minute or um sometimes they're just thinking of nothing and they don't know why that's happening
we've seen more dream recall very graphic dreams and we believe that's because obviously
when your routine changes and you don't have to work and ironically i always say to insomniacs that actually when they're
working and when they've got busy lives it's a lot easier to treat them than when they don't have a routine
because routine is everything to our bodies i wish we understood more how much our bodies love to be
regulated and going to work and doing exercise and going to see our friends and going to the gym
and eating at regular intervals is telling your brain so many signals the light exposure you
get is telling your brain about how much melatonin to release for you it's fascinating but we
do need regulation and the biggest thing that changed during this pandemic was our routines
What control do we have on our dreams?
people people have a real desire as well you mentioned the the the fact that the pandemic had caused very like vivid
dreams people have asked me so many times if they can control their dreams how do they stop themselves
streaming so vividly or um and some people having you know recurring nightmares and things like that
what what is your answer to that what control do we have on our dreams so you can you can learn to that's what we call lucid dreaming so
you can learn to lucid dream the problem is it's probably not very good for your sleep in general um so effectively when we remember our
dreams it's because we have been woken out of rem sleep so rem is actually a very active stage of sleep
it's not your deep sleep it's actually quite a light stage of sleep some might argue that's even a different state of consciousness and not sleep at
all so rem is a really strange time it's when we believe that more of our memory
and our psychological restoration is happening in consolidation and things like that and part of rem we tend to
have more graphic dreams but it's it's you being interrupted from that state which you
may not remember in the night it could just be a van driving past in your rem sleep and it wakes you into
a lighter stage of sleep like stage one or two sleep and so in the morning you think oh my god i really remember my dreams or maybe
your alarm woke you up in the middle of rem sleep and you're like oh my god i can really remember my dreams as opposed to the times when you're like
i didn't dream at all last night well of course you did dream it's just that your rem wasn't interrupted so that's why you're
remembering your dreams when we try to control our dreams usually you have to kind of control that
interruption a bit and so i haven't looked into it properly in terms of lucid dreaming because it doesn't really help me do my job i don't
really want people to learn to lucid dream because then one they're going to be remembering their dreams more and if they're
remembering their dreams more than their sleep is more interrupted and that's not good for your sleep we want you to go through the cycles of sleepers
as uh you know as comfortably as we can and so that you get all the right percentages and all the right restoration
and and healing and everything that you need from your sleep and so yeah it's an interesting concept
i don't think it's very helpful to healthy sleep but every now and again especially kids
i find when i'm talking to children they seem to be able to control their dreams a little bit better like flying
for example they concentrate more on it that's why so they have more time and they concentrate on
it which is quite a fun thing maybe we should all be doing more of that daydreaming and stuff
it's actually really good for problem solving um so yeah it's fascinating and and there's a lot of
famous people i think einstein though don't i mean i don't know if i'm right about this but einstein and various other
geniuses would do things like hold a um egg or or a spoon or something um
so that if and when they fell asleep that spoon would drop and then they would wake up because they felt they had all their best ideas
i can see you looking at me and thinking about doing this to get better tonight but it's not very good for sleep
to keep interrupting it like that um so you can yes you've got the power to manipulate sleep however you want but
at the end of the day if the goal here is to keep you alive for longer and to feel refreshed in the day
and to have your best ideas consistently and to be healthy consistently then you
probably want to do sleep right the way it was designed and what about what i eat before i go to bed a lot of people talk about that
How does what I eat effect my sleep?
that's another uh thing you know if i order food really late someone will turn to me in the room and go oh you should be in at this time
you know what i mean what do i say tomorrow okay i've said it before a good sleeper does all the wrong things
and they seem to be okay but they're probably not doing all the wrong things all the time so yes
the the later you eat you're basically asking your body to metabolize and asking it to sleep and it does
not like doing both and so one of them will be um compromised um in terms of um
anything that you can eat that will have a significant effect on your sleep there's no real research there is
research to show things like you know if you if you eat enough cherries or you have enough milk or enough turkey
it's going to give you some kind of sedatory effect but at the end of the day
it's you'd have to have a stupid amount of those kind of foods to have any kind of effect it's not going to help you sleep
healthily from day to day that's not going to suddenly boost the quality of your sleep um
significantly and so i would argue that unless you have some kind of deficiency in a vitamin or mineral
that is affecting your sleep then you probably don't need to be looking at the food you eat in general as i'm sure
a lot of people will say but in general eating a healthy balanced diet where you have what you would call naughty foods
and good foods and in balance all that stuff is really good for you and probably the only piece of
advice i'd give around eating is again regulating how you eat so if it's breakfast lunch and dinner you like to
do trying to do that at consistent times every single day is going to help your body understand when you want to be
awake and metabolizing and when you want to be sleeping and then not sleeping too late at night just so that you can
make sure that your body metabolizes well and sleeps well and can i sleep too much is that such a
people people there's this myth again in society where people think that they overslept and now they're knackered
Can I sleep too much?
right so yeah so you can it usually when people say they've overslept if we actually looked at them in a sleep study and
they've overslept for the amount that they usually sleep and they didn't need it probably the quality of their entire
sleep wouldn't be amazing um and that's why they were able to have this dribble drabbily longer
sleep and and it's not it's not going to be very helpful but usually when we're talking about that research that shows that
longer sleepers actually can get sicker um is because the quality of their sleep is impaired by something
like sleep apnea or another sleep disorder which is impairing the quality of their sleep so
yeah so poor quality sleep you're gonna sleep longer it's kind of the same as having insomnia because you're not
really sleeping and so therefore you feel you need to sleep longer and you wake up and you still
don't feel like you've slept as much as you needed to if you're sleeping really well from night to night you don't need to sleep
more so your body won't really let you so if the quality is good and you've reached that optimal time
you'll notice that if you do try to sleep longer it's quite if i looked at that sleep for
you in a polysomnography study so i looked at your brain activity the quality of it is just like a snooze
is probably not going to be the same it's not going to be but it's very rare you find someone like usually they're deprived of something or
rather or they have been sleeping properly and then they sleep a bit longer you hear a lot of them a lot of
These top tips about sleep
successful people i think it's it's part of bragging you know bragging about how little they sleep that's how i only sleep three four
hours a day and i think it's pushed this idea into a society that in order to be successful you've gotta
sleep for you know just two or three hours or four hours whatever but then on the other side you have this total contradiction which is
in order to be successful you need to wake up at 6am and drink green juice and do yoga and like sleep for exactly seven hours um and it
and it i guess this kind of speaks to the original point which was um that there's so much over-generalization
and uh through an attempt to sell you something whether it's the book or um
my authority or to get you to follow me yeah i kind of preach this secret yeah quite easily replicated for all of
you right yeah that's causing us to to be like uh be smart
like smacked with these contradicting narratives around sleep um which is making everyone a little bit confused um what's your sort of take on
all of that because you know as when i was growing up i thought you know if i want to be successful i've got to just sleep less
and i i think if i'm being completely honest with myself i think i used to be proud of how little
i sleeped yeah i thought it was like a war like a badge of honor you know yeah yeah yeah yeah but now i think i'm getting a
little bit older and i'm i don't really give a [ __ ] for what people think yeah good good um uh so yeah i i definitely have seen a
change around in this recently but yeah there has been this thing about like clean sleeping it's a bit like the whole clean eating
thing it's a consent it's a it's everything that you've effectively just said um but people trying to say you need to do this that
and that to have the perfect night's sleep actually that doesn't really exist once you know how much sleep you need
around make sure you have that opportunity most nights that you're how do i know though um so i guess you
referenced genetics you said there are five hours yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so i guess um a more relaxed way of looking at it
is when you go on holiday after the three four days of recovery from you know work life um what happens
you know left your own devices what happens and that's a pretty good way of looking at it if you're looking at a really
scientific way then sleep restriction therapy so what we would put a insomniac
through also will show you how much of a duration that you need right now because there'll be a point where you can't keep
adding time your body won't get you to 90 efficient and that's where you know okay maybe this is around the right time
for me and sleeping mental health i feel like it's i don't know my guess would be that it's
The correlation between poor mental health and poor sleep
somewhat kind of a a cycle right i think poor sleep might lead to poor mental health and then poor men's health might lead to
poor sleep is that accurate you're absolutely right but it doesn't matter what came first the chicken or the egg the main
issue is especially in medicine and i've just done a piece of research and that shows that undergraduate
medical degrees only teach a median of an hour and a half of sleep so this is why this next
thing happens a lot because they just don't have the education so our own doctors do not have enough education in something that we do
a third of our lives so historically or traditionally when you go to your gp and you say i've got a sleep problem
they'll tell you you've got depression and insomniacs will be able to relate to this and it is because
in general we look at sleep or poor sleep as a symptom of another condition now even if it is
even if you do have a significant mental health problem and it is causing you to have sleep issues if it's been longer than three months
you now have a entrained sleep disorder and you need to be treating the sleep problem as a
primary condition in itself and the one that i would treat first is whichever one is most prevalent
so whichever symptoms seem to be more distressing for you at the time is where i would start but i would be fixing
for example the depression and the insomnia separately and the results show that
when you treat insomnia you have less relapse of depression because you have actually
resolved one of these things that unfortunately was perpetuating everything so it doesn't really matter where sleep
comes into it but you've got to give it its own podium it needs to be it is a pillar of health
and you need to treat it that way you reference a good sleeper and bad sleeper what's the uh what are the
characteristics of a good sleeper and bad sleeper
characteristics of each so everyone always thinks i'm going to say well a good sleeper does this and a
good sleeper does that but actually the only difference i have seen over however long doing this is
that a good sleeper is somebody who just doesn't worry that much about their sleep they are very grateful for their
sleep and they're very you know you know they they give themselves a fair opportunity they don't always
sleep well they don't you know sometimes they have sleep problems but they don't get overly bothered by it and they notice that
their sleep when left to its own devices will go back to whatever it needs to be about 10 of
insomniacs we never see because they don't perceive themselves to be having a problem and they're not sick and dying isn't
this somewhat uh i guess a metaphor for the for the rest of our lives as well where
typically much of the problem is people thinking that they have a problem or their own perception of their reality because i'll be honest
um everyone around me doesn't think i sleep very well but i've always thought that i slept really really well and i've just
i think refused to buy into the idea that i'm a bad sleeper they think that because i'm up at strange times sometimes i'm traveling extreme but i
i've never worried about my sleep when i go into my room eventually i'll fall asleep and at some point i'll wake up
but i guess the point i'm trying to make there is as well if you look at what's happening in the world with the pandemic and you know people
feeling certain um feeling like they should be a certain way is actually making them
that way people feeling like they should feel self-pity is making them feel self-pity and um as someone that's been to
rio de janeiro and seen the um the favelas there and spent time in the favelas but also i've been to india and
spent some time in the harvey i think they call it which is you know known as the slums which i think is a derogatory term
um i've seen people in this in the slums in india who were significantly happier um
than people that i know that are very you know relatively cushy and i know it's all
subjective living in the uk and it just but people hate when we talk about these these
these things because it gets the mirror of blame and responsibility and it just turns it
back on themselves and says maybe you're the problem yeah maybe the way you're thinking is
the problem and maybe you can do something about it yeah absolutely you've hit the nail on the head um
i like i said about 10 of insomniacs we we never see and actually if you think about it
insomnia is just another pattern of sleep and you have a certain pattern of sleep right now and
if it's not broken do not fix it i firmly believe that and if you ever have a problem well you know where i am
um but hopefully you never will because you'll follow your gut follow what you feel is right
um if that turns you awry then fair enough um get some support but actually
you you really have hit the nail on the head and i really do believe with a bit more understanding and education around sleep and that it's not
night to night your sleep doesn't work like that i get yes we do need to most of the time
sleep night to night but it can survive without doing that um it is it's incredible if we spent
more time understanding how amazing sleep was rather than fearing when it doesn't happen and then blaming it for
absolutely everything we would be in a much better position we would cherish it more and we would um you know love it more
but not overly put pressure on it which is ridiculous sleep cannot force you to lose your job sleep can't
do though or lack of it it just can't um but our belief that it does is making this problem worse so yes it
is a hundred percent a mindset i spend most of my time not training people to sleep again
but actually trying to help resolve that mindset one of the last things i do when i finish with a client is i have to
go through and help them understand that sleep is not the be-all and end-all because actually even to treat their
sleep i have to get them to focus on it and actually i need to take the focus away now and one of the exercises i do
is i tell them look i now want you to think that we're in a world where sleep doesn't exist and when
i do that people are like oh my god that would be awful because it would just be one long perpetual day we'd never finish our day
just philosophically and psychologically how would we deal with that and actually i'm like yes that's how you should be thinking about it because that
time even when you're not sleeping is beautiful and we should cherish it um and also if you didn't sleep what
would be all the other variables that would affect you and i start getting them to think about the rest of their lives and all these other things like
exercise and eating right and they're just the basics who you interact with when you watch the
news the bills you paid that day whether you walk to the dog um all sorts of things pain um noisy
neighbors uh your commute to work how many of those things actually have a properly significant impact on you but
you'll still blame it on your sleep and then it's a perpetual cycle because then you start compensating well i'm not
going to do this anymore i'm not going to go to the gym i'm not going to see my friends i'm terrified it's going to do something that affects my sleep
and then your sleep is worse because your body's now thinking oh so she doesn't need to get good sleep at night because she's not doing anything
in the day anymore and so you make it worse and worse and worse and that is one of the biggest things i see
in a long-term insomniac is somebody who's literally stopped living in order to fix the problem why do we
think that's going to fix the problem it doesn't what about a bad sleeper then so we talked a little bit about the pro like the profile of the characteristics
of a good sleeper what's a bad sleeper so a bad sleeper is somebody who really does um they get bad sleep and suddenly they
start worrying about the lack of sleep and then what they'll do is they'll look up how do i fix my sleep they'll come up
with 10 regimented rules and they'll start becoming obsessive and ritualistic about those rules
they'll stop going out in the evening and they'll start having the hot one bath the herbal tea and every single thing
that they have um they think and they know it doesn't work but they're so terrified of not doing them because
that's all they've got to hold on to now that they are um you know they they they
can't go away from it and actually trying to take teach those people to sleep better is is harder than somebody who's a bit
more relaxed around their routine because they've built these things up so hard you know what's really funny is um
what you've described there is a person who is so keen to solve a problem that probably
isn't that much of a problem that they've they're in search of these techniques and tips and secrets and
shortcuts and whatever probably a lot of the people that felt compelled to click on this podcast today to listen to it and
you see the same within uh success and ambition you see this
like this certain group of people that i'm gonna be honest okay are almost never really successful
but spend the most time trying to be and when i when i think about my success so when i read these books about oh the
the perfect way to be successful here's 13 tips that all successful people share i think
this is total [ __ ] nonsense because my sleep is i sleep whenever i feel tired as you say
i eat blah blah blah you know i don't do yoga i don't like meditate every day i don't i don't
follow any script or blueprint i just kind of go with the flow and do my best every single day and show up and try and
be better tomorrow like if that that's as far as it goes for me there's no looking in the mirror and saying steve you're going to be a
millionaire steve you're going to be you know what i mean all of that feels like nonsense to me but the people that seem to
um do those things the visualizations in the mirror the mood boarding my future like they're not
they are never the successful ones all of my successful friends don't do that yeah yeah and um and i i maybe i think what i'm saying
is i sounds like the same applies to sleep yeah where like the the people that get addicted on techniques and tips and
tricks end up having the worst sleep overall yeah what have we missed i'm asking you this question because
What do you want people to get from this podcast?
there's so many unknown unknowns i don't i don't know a ton about sleep again because i've never really cared that much about it right so
is there anything that you think we've missed any specific topics or i think i would love it if people came
away from this podcast and gave their sleep a little bit of a break and in the same sort of with the same idea i'm sure
there'll be people out there thinking yes but when i wake up tonight in the middle of the night what do i do about it so i guess this is
one thing we haven't covered to understand that if you are waking up in the middle of the night and it's been happening to you
over and over again this has become a habit and therefore to resolve the habit you're going to have to do something
consistently you're not going to be able to solve it in one night it's just not going to happen however if you're waking up and you're getting
stressed and anxious do not lie in bed it's not going to help you you've got a different problem now
you've made yourself anxious and stressed and you need to alleviate it leave the bedroom go and enjoy yourself
it is not going to wake you up you are already awake your sleep drive clearly isn't there to take you back to sleep so
go do something else make sure you get up in the morning do not lie in go and have the epic day enjoy yourself go and see
your friends or talk to them over zoom or go and do some exercise get outside get some light exposure be happy and
content in your life focus on other things and go to bed when you're really really sleepy and when it happens again the
next night do the same thing and i promise you eventually you will be able to get out of it but if you lie
there and you get anxious and stressed and you try and force yourself to sleep you already know
this doesn't work you're trying it over and over again so don't do it so that's the thing i would say i hope that when people listen
to this they come away and they're like you know what i'm not as worried as i was about my sleep i'm actually going to
chill out and i'm going to be all right about it but if i do want to improve the quality i've listened to what she said there's
some key things there i'm going to i'm going to try do those few things but it's about the little things so it's
not about doing 20 different things it is just about literally get up at the same time every morning stop overcompensating stop diluting your
sleep opportunity when you don't get good sleep make it smaller build that sleepiness it's actually good for you don't freak
out nothing bad is going to happen and you you talked to one particular point i wanted to come back on there because
i when i asked my audience about the questions they had for you again about i say 15 20 of them were all
about i keep waking up in the middle of the night yeah yeah what to do so you're saying get out of bed get out of bed and
go and do something that you love do not yeah do not go and do something
like clean the bathroom or do something boring go and do something that is going to be distracting
for god's sake we're always going on about how little time we have you've got more time now so go and use it go and do something fun
i'm not saying get up and go to work i'm not saying that because i still think this is your sleep opportunity and
if you want to retrain your brain to sleep during this time then you've got to sort of do things that are i'm not saying you need to
relax relax relax because i think people get stressed at that term and they're like i can't relax i don't know how to relax don't make me do this
so i think what makes you happy do some things that just make you happy whether that's looking at old photos or
just doing something that you love it is okay okay it's not gonna be forever like i said
you cannot force yourself to sleep but you can dictate when you don't sleep so as long as you're not
overcompensating by lying in or going to bed early because you're so worried about the sleep that you've lost
forget it it's gone there's nothing you can do about it so just move on and do the right things and i promise
you you will start sleeping better but the more you freak out and you're worried about what is going to happen to
you if you don't sleep another night in a row the more you won't be able to fix the problem great
where can people find you uh so i'm at sleepyheadclinic.co.uk it's gone pretty
international now because of the covid is literally i'm online now um and sleepyheadprogram.com if you have no
time to speak to me or you just want to do it yourself um i have set up this online course that you
can do which i'm very excited about with two awesome business partners who are just as crazy and passionate about
sleep as i am and hopefully we can start seeing more people um and and build on it and make it an
even better experience so yeah listen thank you so much for your time today um sleep is a thing that i think is as i
said at the start the podcast has been increased in relevance um in our society
in my personal conversations online through instagram through books that aren't as you say necessarily very
helpful so it's been um very refreshing to to hear
a almost a counter narrative to the kind of very binary specific um quick
um secret orientated like hacks that people push online and that's uh i think will do a ton of people a lot
of good so thank you so much for coming thank you so much for having me thank you thanks

and this is why tiger woods keeps working this is why warren buffett keeps working it's why richard branson keeps working
the only way in which businesses or people will become successful and truly perform to their optimum this
amazing question is probably the best question i've ever been asked
[Music]
camille thank you for joining me today it's a pleasure to have you here so early in the morning i i typically on this podcast will won't
introduce people because um i i'll do a little bit of a pre-introduction but your
your background and the work you've done specifically with high performance people and successful people is so compelling and fascinating that i
feel like i want you to introduce yourself and i've read through your bio multiple
times it was deeply inspiring and i think without an introduction everything we
talk about from here without the perfect introduction which i feel like only you'll give everything we talk about from here on um
might not have the the context it needs to have so who is jamil creation
i'm a performance coach and psychologist so i've spent my time working with some very
good sports teams some very good business teams some successful people and i guess what
i do is i help people cultivate a mindset for success so i always say that for us to act differently we need to think differently
i'm going to create different behaviors different actions this is about creating different thoughts first so i guess what i do more
than anything else is help people change their mind so i said there's new new opportunities new possibilities that will come from
new perspectives so a lot of my time is spent working with people not to give them new skills
but more to allow them to understand the skills that they've already got and then create a perspective for them
to use it differently so um as a performance coach i think everyone can be better
everyone can perform better at terms as a matter of i guess trying to create the mindset the attitude um i guess some of
the precursors to those to the performance which are which are beneficiary which have benefit to them
and so you said that everybody has the skills and i i you know i i see that in a lot of my friends i
see that they have a lot more sort of um natural capabilities than they've managed to sort of give the world
through their actions if someone has an ambition to be something if they have the ambition to be you know
a sports uh star and you've worked with a lot of athletes and you've worked with business people or they want to start a business
what you tend to see it and what i tend to see in my inbox is a lot of people with intention but there
seems to be something preventing that intention from turning into action or like behavior into an
achievement yeah yeah and i think you know turning ambition into achievement is the key because most people will have
good intentions most people will be wishing and hoping to be better there's a big difference between wishing
and hoping and believing and executing upon it so i think that the people who genuinely execute on it
probably want it more for a start at a monastic key no one's ever wandered around the bottom of a mountain
and then simply found themselves at the top and it does take that determination the resilience it does take the ability
to execute upon ideas to drive success so i think the key is the desire which
is fueled by having a purpose a mission a vision towards what that end goal should look like
a lot of people um can't quite they say one thing they say that their
their purpose is to go to the gym yeah for example we all say one thing and do the other
yeah and why is that like because it's sometimes hard to distinguish with someone whether that's their real sort of desire
or whether they're kind of like virtue signaling to themselves if they want to be something or you know they want to start that
business or become an entrepreneur be you know get a six-pack but then their actions show that
quite a different story so i always wondered that with my some of my friends always think are they do they actually want that or they just
it's very easy to say that this is what i'm after and much harder to do it and i think one of the reasons why is
because um we have to invest we self-invest so we probably all know these um kids at
school who are great footballers at 14 15. you think you know what they're gonna make it they're just brilliant they're gonna make it
um or great track athletes at 12 and you know and you just think they're special but they don't make it
and the reason why they don't make it is they don't self-invest so the people who make it are the ones
who um will get up on a rainy friday morning and rainy saturday morning to go and practice whilst their mates are
in bed the ones who will practice on a friday night when their mates are out drinking
and so talent is not enough you need talent plus teachability so talent plus the ability to be
open-minded agile in our thinking to commit to practice and turn that practice into something which develops
our talent even further so there's lots of people with talent and business lots of people with talent
and sport um but i guess that we need to be open-minded enough to invest in how we practice our talent to become
successful so you know there's no there's no substitute for practice i get lots of golfers who say to me that yeah can you
make me better yeah and yeah the number one golfer in the world will practice more than any any amateur you know and
you know their lies the truth but you know we need to we need to apply ourselves in a particular manner and so
we need to be practical about how we exercise our talent you create good feedback loops to
understand what we're doing gain better personal introspection and self-awareness
to allow us to use our talents differently how do you give someone that purpose though like i'm trying to think like
so we know we know practice is like so incredibly important to master something but my i guess my question is um how would you
give someone that motivation because i i i guess you can't give someone purpose a lot of
us spend so much of our lives trying to to motivate people right to motivate friends families you know
siblings whatever it might be i'm wondering if there's a thing we can do as like loving
friends or whatever to to give someone that kick yeah so i mean a couple of points i guess on that in regard to
discovering purpose um it can't be done for someone so
i always said purpose is never achieved it's attained on a daily basis so the mistake that people make with
purpose is they confuse it with an end goal so here's my purpose and have this vision statement of what they're seeking
to you know achieve or create whatever it might be and get practical and tangible about it
but purpose isn't that purpose is achieved on a daily basis that um sorry purpose is never achieved it's
attained on a daily basis and this is why tiger woods keeps working this is why warren buffett keeps
working it's why richard branson keeps working it's because it's never achieved it's attained on a daily basis so i think that you know
we need to find something which is purposeful to us um and then we need to lose ourselves to
it on a regular basis so once we start to become more purpose driven and express ourselves in a
particular way obviously being a good colleague being a good business leader been a good sports person is not seeking to impress
it's about seeking to express and be ourselves in the context of our work so once people can find that um
within themselves um then i think they can direct their energy and their focus in a particular way
and become much more purpose driven in how they go about their daily activities but you can't give someone that purpose
it has to be theirs and i think life is about timing i think some people find that very late some
people find that very early and um and it makes no difference we're all individuals in regard to
helping other people make change we're almost too quick to go towards behaviors so we tell
people to be different all the time tell our team members you should be more collaborative guys i don't guys need to be more innovative
and tell our children to keep their rooms tidy so we're constantly talking to people about
behaviors say to our friends that you should give up smoking or eat healthier whatever it might be
the only way in which you change actions is by changing thoughts so we think and then we feel and then we
act that's how we work so if you're constantly working on actions we're telling people to be different and this is why new year's
resolutions fail from tomorrow i'll be different start doing this i'm going to stop doing that and we start talking about actions and
behaviors um we need to go back to the um granted a precursor of all our
actions which is our thoughts so the only way in which you genuinely drive commitment rather than compliance when
it comes to change in your team in your friends you know and yourself is by changing the words and pictures in
your head or their head to drive different feelings and then different actions there's um a little tip which i sometimes give
leaders and so i said leaders never say to your team you're gonna make a change you say to your team you're gonna make a change they won't like it um say to your
team i'd like to try and experiment they'll they'll be on board with it and um we'll give that a go that's okay
so even just a difference in language to allow someone to think differently or make them feel differently and hopefully
therefore choose to act in a different manner and how how would i get someone to change their thoughts
you know i think um i think the best way is gamification um what holds people in place is what
they believe to be true and then so um so people will sit around a boardroom table
and i'll discuss strategy and i'll say you know look you know we can do this but we can't do that and they'll have a viewpoint on budgets
on consumer buying behaviors on on compliance and governance and that's what holds this in place
so what we need to do is break free of some of the parameters that we think are in the way so if we got people
around the boardroom table and said look guys let's just this strategy piece that we're going to talk about let's imagine we got an unlimited
marketing budget for it if we had an unlimited marketing budget for it i know we haven't but if we had
what would we be doing how would we be doing it um you know if we had no marketing budget what would we be doing now what we're
doing here is that we are helping people to move outside of the mental tram lines that we all operate under
and under habitual thinking so let's ask some what if questions can you imagine that you know a life if
you weren't smoking i told what it looked like i don't know what you'd be doing today if you weren't smoking what'd you spend your money on
that you saved on cigarettes just played the game of what if so let's break free of some of the things which
are holding people in place by um not by conflict not by arguing and and debate in a
confrontational manner but finding some common ground and working from there and the common ground
is let's play a game and you you said that you know about people finding that purpose um in their
lives you we hear this uh phrase um a lot which is
find your passion yeah and i almost feel that it's it's in many respects quite harmful because
it that question is kind of loaded it it assumes a singular passion for a star it
sounds that you can discover it like an easter egg and then and also um the the context in which that
question usually sits in it implies that once you find it then it's you know then it's the the the
it's a can of unlimited like happiness and orientation forever and then that's
yours and it i just feel like sometimes language can be harmful because it it simplifies very complex things and
sometimes multifaceted plural things you know so i wondered if that you know that phrase uh find your per find your passion was
something you um you felt similar about or yeah i do i mean yeah it's true that passion can be
a significant multiplier of human potential so you know if people are passionate and
engaged in a business they can direct their energy in a in a worthwhile meaningful manner
so so so it's it's worthwhile but you're right and um that you know there's a big difference between
passion big difference between happiness and joy um some are in the moment at home i
think joy is in the moment and i think happiness is something um that we continually continually
adjust towards um your passion can be a significant multiplier of human potential
particularly in the workplace so it does have a place it is something which is useful to
understand and then ultimately it always comes down to personal introspection and self-awareness for me
and i think that um we need to work harder at understanding ourselves and when we are constructing a mindset
which is conducive to performance so we optimize our potential when we're in a particular state of mind
and that state of mind might be passion it might be relaxation it might be enthusiasm might be
enjoyment but we need to almost get to know ourselves and know that um there are certain
things which enable us to do others and once we work backwards and understand what that looks like maybe we
can gain some more consistency i say to a lot of sports people and to a lot of business people that
consistency of mind gives you consistency of play and i'm convinced of it and the more
consistent we can be in our thinking we understand um the building blocks the component parts to success
yeah the more success we can have and how does one establish consistency of thought because i completely agree with that i
completely agree i've seen that in my own life when i've been consistent with my thinking i've managed to you know
perform the same habits every day um but then sometimes i'll lose consistency in my thoughts
because i lose um [Music] i lose i guess i lose attachment or sort
of my anchor with my my why yeah and i talk a lot i've talked a lot in this podcast over the last couple of weeks about
this realization i've had this year with the gym which was every year february march i was incredibly
motivated to go fired up trying to look good for summer yeah and then obviously once you look good
and summer has ended it's almost like you've lost your anchor right so you get into
september and the why which made you go and to think consistently every day has been is evaporated and i'm tr i
can't get myself to go to the gym in october right you look in great shape for it this was the other
video i realized so this was the year i realized that this is the year i booked the trend for the first time in my life
because i realized that i thought to myself every single year i i do it for this period and then i
stop and they're two different people august steve and october steve don't know each other they're like you know what i mean
they're like twins that were separated at birth and so this was the year where i realized what i was doing and why
i was losing my motivation so i thought [ __ ] it you know i'm gonna anchor my why to something a bit more uh long term
and without a timeline so i said to myself listen i persuaded myself of all the reasons why i want to be healthy and view my
life as one season and that's what's allowed me to persevere and also i got a bit pissed
off with myself i thought you're really like that like like you're that vain and you're like you
know but so yeah do you know i mean i always think that consistency of mind comes from
understanding the intrinsic quality of our decision-making processes and i say that a lot to people in sport
and in business so yeah you can make a good decision and have a really bad outcome you can make a bad decision have a good
outcome and this is why i've worked with leadership teams who have confused luck for genius and really bad decisions with a great
outcome you know markets have changed competition's done something something's just worked in their favor um so um so it's really important for us
to not judge our decision making by our outcomes and we often do so we'll say this is a
good decision because it resulted in this or this is a bad decision it resulted in that and we can only understand the outcome
retrospectively so it's wrong to measure our decisions by the outcomes and we need to go back to how we made a
decision in the first place and once we start to understand the intrinsic quality of our decision making process
we can become more consistent in how we make decisions and therefore have more control over those outcomes so i think that you know
two things i don't i think that and then we'll use you as the example here steve um that consistency of mind will come
from knowing how we make decisions okay i understand that we put our weight into evidence how much we use
prejudice and bias and opinion whatever it might be but let's understand how we make decisions and in that way we can be
consistent in um how we apply our logic and thinking and feeling try and determine some best outcomes and
then the other thing and um as you've just positioned is reframing let's stand back and create some time
and space to understand and um you know why we do things and why we don't do things
now i always say that um the people are most successful and i've had a pleasure working with six sports people who got
to number one in the world i can guarantee you one thing i had in common was that um um they um they never made big
changes and um it was small changes so i'm a big big believer in the one degree of change
if you take two parallel lines and you move one by one degree it may not seem much at first but it's a really big difference between
where you start and where you end up so um everyone's trying to you know make a dramatic change and see change from
tomorrow i'm going to be different i think it's about doing something a little bit more than what we've been doing it matan a bit more consistently
and then the other thing with these people who obtained you know what i call um super achievements at home so they
did really really well um is that they actually worked on their strengths they started to understand what was good about them
and do that some more so we think to be better as human beings i'm gonna be better as a
business or a team of people we need to fix our weaknesses um i'm not sure that's true i actually
think it's more about understanding our strengths and playing to them so um i've actually worked with teams
before in business and in sport who have actually weakened the strength by trying to strengthen a weakness
if you think about it it's ridiculous and actually weaken the strength by trying to strengthen the weakness we need to be careful
so i think understanding what's good about us understanding you know where our behaviors come from in regard
to the thinking before it and then reframing some of those words and pictures and i guess that's what you've done with your gym
example because i guess change some of the words and pictures in your head to therefore feel differently which has
resulted you and acting differently yeah and i really you know i was i was valuing intensity over consistency and
intensity wasn't sustainable right so i was going through the summer like to the gym two times a day i was starving myself like eating things that
i i didn't want to necessarily eat yeah and the the consistency came from being a bit more um
realistic with myself being yeah you know if you missed the day of gym it doesn't matter you don't have to perspective yes perspective isn't it yeah and i
think do you know it's funny because again something so many sports people have worked with and business people who
will lose perspective they'll lose the tournament and it's dreadful you know win a tournament i've made it you know
this is it this is turning point for me now they win a big contract you know in business and you know this is us now we're set up
you know or they lose a contract and um and life has never been so dreadful um but i think that we need a
better perspective on things so their ability to think more long term term to be more forgiving you know to
understand with more um reality at uh what's good and what's not so good
is probably the way forwards and in terms of responsibility it's a it's a topic that's fast
consistency is a topic i've been so fascinated about over the last year as i've reflected and done has been sort
of introspective about the things i've been able to achieve whether it's getting millions of followers on social media whether it's
growing my business or going to the gym it seems that the the very ironically consistent theme across all
of them was consistency it was being able to do perform x habit for a long period of
time and then you have that the eighth wonder of the world shows up and things start compounding in your favor very quickly usually um but the other
term that i've been fascinated with is responsibility and as i've i started out as an 18 year old kid
dropped out of university disowned by my parents no money at all and
the one of the things that i noticed as i look back on 18 year old steve versus a lot of other people that i see
that that are living in the same [ __ ] area i was living in and stealing pizzas like i was stealing them
um was they don't take responsibility for their situation they kind of see themselves as a a
victim of the situation they're in whereas when i was in that situation not only did i not view it as my destination
i was literally taking photos of the the nothingness in my fridge and the how dire my life was because in
my mind and i started keeping this diary on facebook which i really randomly wrote in my diary that a tv company had
asked me to keep this because i didn't actually know how to tell my own diary right that i thought i was gonna
show the world this someday um i i didn't see it as my destination and i
took full responsibility of my circumstance it wasn't anyone's fault but my own and i was gonna change it but then one of the things that makes me
concerned um about our generation and about certain political narratives and certain
themes i see on the internet is like a an avoidance of responsibility
for your life and the the default to blame someone else and i'll be honest it's something i see
more in the western world than i do in the african village i was born in yeah you know so
i wanted to know if really from you like what role responsibility plays in people's outcomes
okay that's a big one yeah um you promised me some easy questions um
no so um responsibility is huge it's just massive it's um it's it's one of the pre it's one of the
predetermined of successful outcomes is our ability to take ownership and accountability so
circumstance and situation push and pull us in different directions on a daily basis the world is complex it's
uncertain it's unpredictable all of those things the people who perform best have huge levels of
responsibility and ability to respond to those circumstances and situation no matter
what they are to drive the best outcomes or opportunities so i always said there's a circle of concern
water cooler conversations the stuff that's going on you know around us circumstance situation incidents and
accidents then there's a circle of influence and the circle of influence is where we make choice that's what it's about
so responsibility is all about choice for me i absolutely guarantee you now that the
circumstance the situation is not a predictor of success and um because we know of people who
were born into privilege their great role models had good access to opportunity to wealth
they had good guidance and good support and they ended up dying heroin addicts in prison we know some
people born with a physical disadvantage now a lack of good role models now the lack of guidance lack of support lack of
opportunity they grew up to be some of the most successful people who have ever walked this earth so it proves beyond doubt that attitude
is more important than intelligence or facts and i genuinely believe that to be true in all areas of high performance that
attitude is more important than intelligence or facts i always say give me i will over iq any
one of my teams i'd rather if i will over iq because high technical expertise and talk about the western world at the
moment high technical expertise is no longer as valuable as it used to be and the reason why high technical
expertise is no longer as valuable as it used to be it's because we can google things that's why so knowing a lot
isn't where your success is going to come from yeah it's not what you know which is important it's how you think about what you know
and how you bring it to life with your character and personality to determine the best outcomes or
opportunities so you know i genuinely believe that the only way in which
businesses or people will become successful and truly perform to their optimum is taking full accountability and
ownership we need to almost move away from circumstance and situation which is a distraction
so um the more that we realize that our success is dependent upon us and not on situation the better and
because the world is so unpredictable i need to simply learn to dance on a shifting carpet
not see the rug being pulled from under our feet you know life is a game of continual adjustment
and it doesn't matter what happens it's how we react and respond to it to determine those best opportunities or
outcomes and i think that you know it's funny because initially i'm working a lot of businesses and um on culture on team
um people strategies and the focus on responsibility has never been higher
mainly because we've been asked to stay apart people are having to determine their own work schedules people have to
determine their own working week and um they're going to have to take responsibility for driving the best
outcomes and whilst they're not surrounded by team or working with directly with a leader
so it's been a greater call for responsibility i wonder whether in answer to your question i don't know
the answer to this um i wonder whether we'll see a better shift or greater shift towards more
responsibility in the western world because i agree with you i think that many of us will see ourselves as a
victim of circumstance and situation and not necessarily see the beauty in the chaos because of it
you talk there about the the internet as well in the power of the internet and how that's been a bit of a leveler which is yeah which is a really
wonderful thing i think um what how important is it do you do you think when you think about the
successful people you've worked with to be a sort of self-driven
learner beyond school um did you see in the specifically in the sort of upper echelons of like business
the ones that are the people that are most successful are proactive sort of self-driven yeah i
think i think it's true i think that um i've said that our only sustainable competitive advantage is to
learn faster and better than your competitors so you know and you think about that for a business you think about that for a
leader you know you think about as a sportsman it's probably true isn't it you know our only sort of sustainable competitive advantage is
just learn faster and better than anyone else two powerline lines yeah yeah and i think that you know and i think that
i think that how can we learn faster and better yeah if we're not proactive lifelong
learners and so you know and i think that you know learning isn't necessarily about being taught um we don't necessarily need
teachers um it's a strive for greater curiosity you know i think curiosity is worth more than creativity at the moment but
it's a strive for greater curiosity it's a matter of being massive being open-minded it's a matter of being um
agile in our thinking so we can deploy resourced of opportunity as it becomes visible
um it's about um it's about self-discovery so it's about a variety of things which
are based not necessarily upon traditional learning but more in a way in which we can open
our mind up to experimentation and feedback you know and understanding ourselves differently and
i think the best leaders um you know have this ability to you know reimagine repurpose reinvent
i don't think they're beholden to a particular or wedded to a particular mindset but that's for a lot of people that's
terrifying the thought of experimentation and being agile and reinvention i've seen that in my own business i've
seen over the years i was um i was known as being the guy that would walk in i think a lot of
business leaders are walking in the morning and be like we're going in a different direction everyone come in this room we're going to launch this part of our business and we're going to
take it we're going to experiment and i i would often say to our team that experimentation is like at the heart of
all of our strategy it's like why especially as a social media company where our platforms social media changes every day there's
new updates pushed by facebook and instagram every day um so our company slogan was keeping
keeping brands at the forefront of what's possible which meant that we had to be agile but i'd often see people in my organization
that were really against change fearful of it they would take you know they would
resist it yeah you know uh and i i i am i wonder how you if it's i always
wondered why it was i think some of them had levels of imposter syndrome so they were
you know they were just uh just trying to get a hang of the role they were in and not do more that
you know they were already you know but i wonder what your thoughts were on that i think i think people don't like change because they don't know what it results
in and that's one of the things so let's take um let's take uh moving your desk yeah
someone sat at our desk for ten years in a particular office he said you know what you need to you need to move down the corridor
i'm going to make a move but uh people weren't like the slightest um if you said to them that you know you
need to move down the corridor you know we really appreciate the move we're going to give you a million pounds at the end of the year because of it
they'll be trotting off with their potted plant in hand i guarantee it so i think that because people don't
necessarily know what it results in why should we invest in doing something different which is uncomfortable because
it goes against our mental tram lines our habitual thinking so now you're asking me to compromise my
patterns and i don't know what for and i know what's going to result in um it could be good it could be bad so
therefore i'm not sure i want to go to the trouble without investing in this change when i
haven't determined you know the result of it as human beings we like patterns um that's good and it's bad
and um it works in our favor sometimes sometimes it doesn't so we like patterns and so we like
consistency and we compartmentalize and how am i getting a viewpoint on the world and in fact if you look at um
the office is a good example the office is a great example of keeping people in patterns you've got your phone on your desk here
your computer there come in at a certain time working a certain way take your lunch at a certain time
so we're conditioned to work in a way which is reflective of the consistency which takes out variance in business so
you think that management has been around for about 100 years and the reason why management's been around for about 100 years
is to reduce variance at time because then you can guess then you can scale so businesses got bigger a lot bigger
100 years ago and um because of the ability to keep people habitual so um so because we've become
conditioned to do this and everything around us keeps us in in in a pattern that we quite like being in
as soon as we start to move outside of that there's a level of discomfort so i guess leaders can allow people to
make change atta and embrace change um i guess there's a few points one it's always best if it's co-authored and
co-created right um so let's involve people in what that change looks like um it's always best if um
we look at our organizations or teams as a community instead of as a team or an organization
at the moment communities are outperforming bureaucracies and hierarchies when it comes to maximizing human talent
so let's try and form a community and um let's co-author and co-create and and then um let's have a look at um
peer recognition peer coaching peer challenge it doesn't need to be a top down thing done to people it can be something which
can happen from the inside out you know it's meaningful when when something is endorsed by others
that that you know you are that you feel an affinity with sure what when you read about the steve jobs of
the world and the elon musk's of the world they seem to buck all of the a lot of the trends that you hear in like management coaching they
seem to be very authoritarian you know i was reading about from i was reading steve
elon musk's biography and there's stories of him just like calling someone into the office and saying how much does it cost to do this
they'll say 10 million he'll say do it for 5 and do it within 30 days and they'll go away feeling puzzled but they'll get
it done yeah he has this culture of like intensity and when you start he says to
the teams that this will be the hardest you've ever worked in your life but it'll be the most worthwhile but it'd be the hardest you've ever worked
and and i you know and then steve jobs as well i've heard the stories of how he was you know how he built the company at
medlo park and um he seemed like the antithesis of what you would read about in a business book
but obviously these are two of the most successful entrepreneurs the world has ever you know seen so i
wondered if there's a i'm trying to appreciate the like
how they've achieved their success by being so different from what all the business books say from all accounts they're you know what
i mean yeah i mean i think a couple of things i guess that you know you find what works
for you um i think what they have on their side is they have a really big
purpose statement it's a really big mission so there are lots of companies with mission statements but very few on a
mission and i guess that when it comes back to um the point i made earlier that passion
been a significant multiplier of human potential i guess that these people have the ability to engage people
so to tell a story attempt to inspire and motivate so i guess that you know there is a
there's no doubt lots of logic and time there is no doubt lots of rationality which is used in their
management leadership style you know but what you're describing to me in the people that you're describing
i think you can really get behind something that someone passionately believes in and is something which is worthwhile and
purposeful yeah on such a grand scale so i think when they're talking about um and things which will change humanity
um i think it's possible for you know us to be swept along at him on that particular vision and
so maybe it does mobilize people in a different manner because of who they are what they believe in and what they're
trying to achieve yeah no that's probably true i mean yeah you think about i mean the example i'll give you is jfk
well yeah i mean i mean jfk do you think that jfk's speech about putting man on the moon you should read it actually rather than
look at it um it's a rubbish speech when you read it the term and the reason
and the reason why is that there's no logic to it until there's no rationality so he says we put a man on the moon and
the reason why he gives that we should put a man on the moon is because it's it's hard and not easy
which is a rubbish reason to do anything it's hard that's why we're gonna do it yeah so um
but not only did they end up doing this it mobilized the whole nation behind the space race and the whole
nation behind science in fact um the reason why was that because logic was low
inspiration was high it was such a um it was such a literally a moonshot it
was literally such a big goal and so ambitious so expansive you know
that people bought into the dream and i wonder whether and i don't know you know
the examples you gave at steve jobs and elon musk whether whether people just buy into that dream and they buy into
what they not necessarily what they're seeking to do but what they're seeking to create and maybe there's a lesson for all of us
who manage and manage teams that maybe it's not about trying to you know get people to do stuff it's about people
to you know to create stuff is that you know my time to be part of something which is worthwhile
and meaningful and sell a big vision and tell the right story
and you know engage people emotionally you know all of this stuff about psychology i know a lot of stuff
i read a few books yeah you've read a few books about a few books a week last tuesday yeah you know don't tell my clients
um you know when people come across people like you they think that you've got all the answers and
because you've got all the answers or at least an answer to most things um they think that you must live
a life of sort of perfect decision-making couples children have the worst worn
shoes yeah exactly um so yeah what what do you like at living these things that you're aware of
speaking of performance one of the things that's integral to performing at the highest level is nutrition it's something that i
i guess i took a a long time to finally believe but that is why having hewlett's
response for this podcast is such a privilege because there was a time in my life especially when i was early in my business career
where i wasn't getting the vitamins the minerals and i wasn't having a sort of nutritionally complete diet i was
if you look at some of my old photos i was definitely lacking protein as well and a lot of that maybe it was an excuse
was because i was um i was busy and when i discovered huel when a guy called
mike walked past me in the office wearing a heel t-shirt and shaking a little bottle and you know upon my curiosity of asking
what was in that and why he was drinking it it really really did change my life and so here's what i want to do
you know this particular podcast today has been about high performance and mindset and how we how we become our best selves and how we
teach our teams to become our best selves i'm going to give away this week five
boxes of your big boxes right all you've got to do if you want one of those boxes is hit the subscribe button

but if you're listening on youtube then please um just leave a comment down below and any comment you leave enters you
into the competition and i want to know what you think of huel so um it's as i say i say it with
full honesty it's changed my life and i really believe that those of you who aren't getting your sort of um all your minerals and proteins and
all the good stuff i think it can change yours too what do you like at living these things
that you're aware of yeah i'm rubbish next question
and the reason why is that two things that one um we're all human because we're all human
you know we're all prone to make mistakes in our doing and our thinking um and i think that being you know
better never stops so therefore we've got to continually adjust you know we don't find hints tips gimmicks that make us
better and then we just apply them regularly and it works so i guess there's a level of
inconsistency which is reflective of the fact that you know that
i'm a human being who tries to do better you know give me an exam on a regular basis on an example well you're aware of the
truth but you're just not oh you might you know on the amount of time so as you know i've been a guest speaker for 10 years now so when
the world is normal and sane you know i would um go off four days a week
anywhere in the world so twice a week i was abroad and i'd speak to a few hundred people i'd stand on stage i'd do an hour's talk
about performance psychology and i'd come off um so i did that for ten years four times a
week and um but um but i'd often come off and think
cause any good i say to the stake at stake i would come up to me and say that you know that was really brilliant this is
exactly what we're after it's perfect are you happy oh yeah it's exactly what we're after but you sort of covered the brief yeah
yes yeah absolutely it's exactly what it was send me an email let me know the feedback and then
you get you know maybe even get some feedback which is like you know you get sort of scored out of five it's almost like 97 percent five and um
i'd be scouring for the threes and twos and think that you know there's like you know 500 people there's that sort of five people who put two
and so it was all right i just think [ __ ] but um but uh but i'd be wondering why
what did i do wrong what was real and it's unbelievable it's unbelievable the amount of times i've sat in front of an audience
and um and you know maybe 300 people there there's someone with their arms folded like that and they're just like i think he doesn't
look engaged you know and so out of friend of people there's something there's most people writing down things or nodding or
smiling or whatever it is it's amazing how many times i can pick out the one person who doesn't seem to be enjoying
it so i think i think look i think it's a couple of things that i'm i'm always prone to you know we
actually we wait quite highly stuff which we think we're not doing well you know we're trying to fix what's not
right about us what's not good you know you know what we should have done and um what we could be doing um i think i'm
still prone to that rather than sort of enjoying the you know the success that i've had really what about things in your personal life
in terms of like like you know health and like being a parent
and like yeah pursuing goals and ambitions you have in your personal life what about those things
yeah i think that you know um health-wise i need to take some advice from you we should i'll lie down and tell you all
about it i keep i keep meaning to i keep meaning to run more and get to the gym more there's always an excuse
um so you know i'm the most demotivated motivational spooky
life's pretty [ __ ] and um so um so yeah so i think i need to work out
more um i'll tell you the one thing that gets me and um i've got three children i got sort of um four four-year-old twin girls
and a nine-year-old boy um is that you know as a psychologist and um yeah i'm pretty good at i've sat
in front of some sort of pretty difficult clients some really difficult clients you know some people at the absolute top of their
profession and um and they're they're [ __ ] screwed in their thinking and um and you know and you know i've
dealt with it four-year-olds and nine-year-olds just do me i can't you know i just you try and apply psychology to it it
doesn't work so the level of frustration that comes about in regard to being a parent again this is my point that you
know all human beings and um so um so you know you try you try all the influence persuasion and
negotiation and all the psychology and all the techniques that you know that um it doesn't work on four-year-olds
it doesn't work it's so funny the guest that was here yesterday joe wicks are the exact same thing he said i'm like a you know calm guy but he just said you
know when i my daughter i'll tell her that i want to just put her down so i can clean the counter and she just won't be
the irrationality of it is what it does yeah and um so you know you know it's funny because um
i've had some really good sports people sit in front of me and say you know give me you know you've got something that makes me better then
and then you give them something and they go away they come back a week later and they say i tried that it doesn't
work have you got anything else it's a bit like going to the gym working out for half an hour going home looking in the mirror and says yo let's
crap that i don't like the gym film refrigerator um and so and this is my point that that you know
it's not about tools gimmicks and hints it's about striving every day to be better than what you were yesterday
um i worked with a golfer it was very very good really good um and you know literally
top 10 in the world it's about a whole year and uh with just a piece of paper in his pocket
and he used to play with his piece of paper in his pocket um and it used to just say um what did i enjoy today and what did i
learn today 2 questions on it and then in the evening he just answered those questions so that whole year forget the numbers
i'm not going to look at numbers i'm just going to answer this question so i've had a good day i've had a bad day doesn't make any difference i'll
just answer that question these questions what did i enjoy today and what did i learn today had the best year we ever had and i'm just answering
those questions yeah and in a way there almost needs to be more simplicity to not using tools
and techniques not to try and apply psychology to a four-year-old you know but to just try and consistently enjoy
and learn on a daily basis so i guess in regard to like you know yeah i'm still prone to say
god i need to get running okay i've been drinking all week i need to do some exercise at the weekend
um and you know again it's falling into the trap of the i've been at the mercy of the shoulds
and musks rather than thinking about at um you know what am i enjoying what am i learning
what surprised me this week um you know where am i experimenting and
what have i discovered you know this week about myself and then once we start to talk like that maybe we can so i guess apply more
consistent thinking and therefore change our doing so you want to run let's use that as an example
yeah i need to run more definitely i need to run more why do you need to run more and um do you know because i want to
improve my heart and lung health i think i think i've got tonight it's all right for you because you're young and fit and
um but um but i think i've got to an age now where i realized there's more of an importance on exercise so you know before i could just
i'll just do it anyway you know pick up running every now and then i'll be able to run i go to the gym every now and then i'll have a great time at the gym for a
couple of weeks and then i'll skip it um yeah but now you know but now it's it's different a term you know now i
sort of feel at them as though you know i could be fitter it should be i think this year has also sort of illuminated that for everybody
at the importance of health i think it's made us all well it has for me made me think about my health a lot more
no not for the vain reasons that you know young guy would think about their health because they're trying to trying to get laid or something but
because you know i i want to live longer and i want to have more memories than those kind of things did you know near ielts he wrote a book
called indistractible i know yeah i'm not familiar with i've read it you're probably familiar with the book yeah i know the name but i am yeah he
said this quote to me which really changed my life and i think about it all the time okay when i find myself procrastinating from doing something or
whatever he said that typically we think we're humans that are seeking pleasure but we're actually living in
the avoidance of discomfort and when i think about the things that i procrastinate against or whether you know we're at six
seven o'clock in the evening you think i can't be bothered to go whatever it does ring true to me that i'm actually
avoiding some kind of psychological discomfort yes and so i now whenever i feel myself like this weekend i had
had this big project to do i also had this talk that i had to do um for my manager dom and i found myself
like and then i've got the book my book which i had to do go through the whole book from start to finish in a day
and i'm like low-key finding myself oh just clean the countertop because that's important
and i said i stopped myself i thought you're avoiding the discomfort associated with sitting down for nine hours until six am
in the morning and doing the book and it wasn't until i realized why you know what i started that term has
been like this flashlight that i shine in like the corner of the room we're after hiding the you know the thing that
i don't want to do now so i wondered if it was you know for some in in regards to your running if it's in some respects similar like
you're avoiding some kind of discomfort where you think i'd rather play i'm convinced of it because running such an unpleasant
experience for me it's a really good example i can't stand it so but you're absolutely right that uh
that you know i totally agree with you that you know we we do sort of go about our lives trying to seek
moving out of that space of you know of of being uncomfortable this is why we don't have conflict
conversations in the workplace this is why we don't challenge our own thinking this is why we don't like change and uh
you know we like we like to operate from a comfort zone that's what we do um so yeah no i agree with you i think i
think because running is such an unpleasant experience for me that's absolutely awful um i'm probably
avoiding it because i just don't want the experience whereas riding a bike isn't so bad for me um so so yeah so
maybe therefore but um instead of sat there at four five o'clock thinking god i need to go running in an hour
and i really don't want to i'll go tomorrow maybe maybe what i should be saying is i
need to go running no you don't um why don't you ride the bike why didn't you yeah why don't you just have stairs
um okay well i'll have a go on it after this but um we should have done a whole
interview on that i'm gonna kill two birds with one stone i hate running as well it's like i hate
the impact on my knees yeah just i don't want to be outside yeah that'll be swerving past people so i got the peloton um it's low resistance
it's fun super engaging and gamified because you see the data you see everyone in the world and where they're placing you see
jenny 55 in north carolina's beating you yeah make me feel bad
i hate jenny forever that just makes me realize how unfit i am and how much i hate other people who are fitter than me
but i mean interestingly it proves how fit you are because you said you don't like running because of your knees and swerving past people
i don't like running because i can't breathe so you're already winning chicken egg that'll be cured if you
start running um but but on that point of um of psychological discomfort um
how does somebody in your opinion
face a challenge that they know is uncomfortable like you know to be honest i don't i don't
want to go to the gym or do all these zoom calls all the time it's not like
you know i'm not getting comfort or in pleasure out of doing two hours zoom calls at the moment about
like you know biotech or whatever it is the thing that i'm involved in but i'm doing it and i wanted to know in
your case what what does it take someone who like doesn't want to do something because they know it's uncomfortable to
say do you know what [ __ ] it i'm gonna do it today yeah and is it does that go back to that
point of of having that like long anchor purpose yeah i think it does i mean
mohammed ali said i've i've hated every moment in the gym but i did it so i could live the rest of my life like a champion yeah and it's in in a
way it's true isn't it that that you know there are there are component parts to success um and i think the
two of the interesting one is and the one that most people probably relate to is failure
so people don't like to experience failure but you know for example failure is part payment towards success
so the price of success is always paid in full and in advance the price of success is always paid in
full and in advance you can't be successful and you start making mistakes you can't be successful and start having your two hours zoom calls but uh you
know in a way you need to fail we need to have these awful conversations we need to kiss lots of frogs we need to
you know do deals which don't work but i mean you do all these things to enable you to be super successful so um there's lots of things that um
again it comes back to reframing if we see it as part and parcel a stepping stone towards a greater advancement
they're probably more likely to do it you know if you see failure as something which is we're trying to avoid and it's just
awful and you know and it screams to me that i'm useless um then we're probably going to stay
within a comfort zone you know if we embrace failure then we see it as part payment towards success
until we see it as something which is um an active contribution a stepping stone towards
you know being better maybe we're more likely to indulge in it and not have the discomfort that we associate with it so now i feel
that um it is always good to think about you know what you think about that end goal have that purpose that
vision the mission you know what you're seeking to achieve and create um and then think about what those
building blocks look like because you know all great achievements are the result of many small achievements
um you know you had joe wicks here yesterday he wasn't super successful overnight
and he probably kissed a lot of frogs i'm sure you talked about it you know um know his business and korean personal
life went in all sorts of different directions like ours at um and you know it's not necessarily
as we said earlier it's not necessarily what what happens it's it's our interpretation of what's
happening which will then enable us to use that as feedback towards something better and do you find with a lot of the high
performance people you've worked with that their childhood is a definitive
reason as to why they are the way they are today i'm going to try and articulate this if i can
but i've i from speaking to guests on this podcast and also from a bit of introspection to be honest
i tend to think a lot of people that have extraordinary outcomes have often had
some kind of extraordinary early experience and i'll give you a couple of examples
the a lot of the billionaires that i know are really really successful people that i know um cite their father's disapproval
as the reason why they've always had a chip on their shoulder and they've always strived obsessively to be enough right because
their father told them they weren't enough yeah um have you seen that in successful people that there's the
the thing that makes them just a bit [ __ ] weird is often a you know i think one
particular instance with a friend of mine a comment their mother made when they were four that they just can't shake
yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean i i'm not a psychiatrist so i don't delve into
backgrounds in the way that maybe someone involved in psychiatry would yes as a performance coach i tend to
work with how people are now basically and um tell me about what you're thinking and doing what you're trying to achieve
and more so than to try and deconstruct you know or analyze some of the you know the earlier experiences um so that's not my thing
having said that though you're absolutely right there seems to be some sort of correlation between
extreme experiences and then how people interpret or translate them and in fact you know as you're talking i
was trying to think of the book i can't think of a book i wish i could now and they talk about in this book the fact that so many super
successful people politicians actors um business people lost parents when they were young and
there's a direct correlation believe it or not it's a direct correlation between people losing parents when they were
young and then becoming super performers be incredibly successful um and the psychology behind it was that
you learn independence and um it's almost easy if you've got these loving fabulous parents who
you know hopefully you know many people have got um you're not as independent you know
whereas you know if you lose a parent young you end up sort of doing things for yourself a little bit earlier
and so maybe that going back to that responsibility the ownership piece and i'm having to sort yourself out
and um you know means that people learn some of the skills which enable their talent to then be used differently in the
future but there is a direct correlation believe it or not i wish i could tell it's like the real psychology in the actual
article in the actual piece in the book um but you just reminded me when you're talking about it so i do think that some
people do have these extreme experiences and i think that um it's almost easier
to get to know ourselves and get to think about life and contextualize things um you know if
we're experiencing things which are outside of our i guess our normal field of vision i i
resonate a lot with that i um you said you know lose a parent but the reason i resonated with that is because
i've said multiple times on this podcast again um that when people have asked me why why i was successful i i cite that when
i was younger my parents weren't ever in the house and that made meant that i had to find a way to make money to feed myself or
you know my mum was never in the house when i went to bed and she was never there when i woke up because she was just she slept at her shop sometimes my dad
worked in london for six days a week which was four hours away and i and it was only
of the four of us in our my family the four siblings that wasn't the case for my older siblings when they were
younger or when they were my age my mom and dad were in the house every day doing date nights together and then when i grew up by the
age of 10 i could leave the house for three days or two days and they wouldn't actually know that i'd gone and so that meant that i became
like this sort of self-autonomous kid at like 12 13 14 50. and then started businesses at 14 and then you know
went off but you could have gone the other way as well couldn't you oh you know with 100 you know with that
level of freedom and autonomy but not the maturity and you know to deal with that freedom
um my friend my best friend said to you and i'll never forget where i stood when he said it in this takeaway shop he said stephen
you're either going to be a criminal or a millionaire and it was because i had that my
independence created this connection where i knew that my outcomes were going to be a direct result
of my behavior i always think of like school dinners as the perfect example
for a lot of my childhood maybe up until the age of about nine my there was always like two quid on the counter which is like okay you take that to
school and then by ten the two quid wasn't there anymore yeah so it was like waking up in the morning and being like how am i gonna
eat today i'd have to find a way so i'd go and sell cigarettes or you know i'd like i knew that there were cigarettes in this this room
upstairs which my mum had got from nigeria one one year so i just went to school and i was just shopping cigarettes or chewing gum and
it was that that connection i made super early that my outcomes are a direct and only correlation of sort of
connected to my behavior um so i resonate with that a lot and it kind of explains the difference between
four kids that grew up in the same household and one the three of them went to university llc cambridge whatever and one of them dropped out of everything
got kicked out of school and became an entrepreneur it's true isn't it so it's not necessarily the um
yeah the experience is how we translate that experience and exactly how we channel our feeling into something which
could be productive or destructive you could have become a criminal and a millionaire and got a job at this tory government
you could be
yeah but the last thing i really wanted to ask you about was um you know this idea of distractions
social media is uh made it incredibly easy to distract ourselves and you see you know teams becoming
much more distracted at work because of all these screens and you know the digitalization of the world and individuals and
what are what's your thoughts on on why we're so distracted and how to overcome it yeah um it's true that we are distracted
i think focus and concentration have to be practiced so many things can be improved
so um whether it's resilience whether it's concentration whether it's courage all these things
can be practiced so many think courage for example i say courage is like a muscle the more you exercise it the
stronger it gets so it's possible to exercise all these things and be better at them and i think that um it's fine to be
distracted because it's actually quite nice to have different stimuli and different um provocation
and so we just need to choose when it's good to have that provocation and change and when we need to
concentrate we need to practice both now um uh here's the thing for you adam
is that as human beings we don't multitask so multitasking is a lie so for all the um all the girls and all
the women watching this and um oh listening to this um i'm sorry to tell you it's not true you
don't multitask better than men it's true amen it doesn't happen we're both equally as bad now we're both
useless at it so what we do is we do rapid switching so we don't multitask we just want to talk about exactly um this is why
actually um i can't remember it was a couple of years ago that the um the blackberry network went down in abu
dhabi for a weekend from friday to monday had a 48 decrease in car accidents that
we get really because as human beings we don't multitask you don't like check your text and drive well it
doesn't work so um so i think that we are living in an age where it's easy to be distracted
and some of these distractions are incredibly useful um we need to come back to greater responsibility and choice
and um let's choose at home you know when it's fine to do that and it's fine not to be and um and practice
you know these levels of concentration of focus that we may need for certain tasks but we may not for another so i quite
like times when i can sit down and read a book or absorb something or think about something
and narrow my focus sometimes i quite like sort of tv being on music being on at um
phone next to me on the computer because actually um i'm sometimes picking up on certain things
which um for a level of creativity can be quite useful and a bit of provocation a bit of a bit of
changeability in my thinking because i get distracted by something and come back to it i find that as well i find them for some
bizarre reason if i if i go for a walk or if i go to the gym uh inspiration floods into me but when
i'm stood sat in my office trying to think of stuff it's yeah almost impossible the shower is another
weird place where my ideas seem to show up all at once and it's like i'm not like this isn't hyperbole i'm not
exaggerating at all like if i if i'm sat here and i'm trying to think of something to write or whatever yeah i go for a walk and sometimes i put my
my music in it's like non-stop and i find that quite you know
interesting yeah teams are often trying to think of ideas and creativity and if you say to people where do you have
your best ideas and have asked people that question whatever your best ideas do you know what they'll say well i'm walking the dog
and when i'm in the shower just about to fall off the sleep um on the commute over breakfast uh you
know um they'll they'll they'll come up with all some recreational drugs they'll come up with all sorts of stuff
but no one will ever say in a boardroom with some mints on the table and a jug of water
no one will ever say that but but where do we where do we um you know try and create ideas in the
business at all we get them around this boardroom table no one ever said don't get me wrong you can't get your team in the shower with
you maybe you've tried i don't know what it's like around here maybe you've tried i don't know yourself better but um but yeah maybe
yeah maybe we can't do that but we've got to find a way of trying to you know uh create a more natural
environment for people to flourish and i do say to you many organizations i say to them that you know you're
too quick to train the people rather than fix the environment you know people say oh i need more innovative people they don't um you know
we need to train them on innovation no you don't let's try and create a culture an environment where people
are free to express themselves the problem we've got is that you know we're so we're so convergent in our thinking and
uh you know we start off as divergent thinkers we start off making really weird connections
um i had a six-year-old once um asked me what does the number nine smell like
amazing question i think that's probably the best question i've ever been asked well do you respect the interviewer
today i was going to say that but um but you know what's the number nine smell like it's a great question um yeah was the last time you heard a
ceo ask that question they don't um you know children ask these divergent questions because they make the
connection between two things usually unconnected um and then you go to school and the school says
why are you asking that we're doing numbers today just concentrate on the numbers um and then we go from divergent
thinkers to convergent thinkers and our careers get better because of it our businesses get better because of it
and making simple connections you know margins down okay we need to do this you know revenue's down okay we need to do
that um but what do we need in today's society in today's world
and um i think we need convergent thinking i think we need to move back and and get into that divergent space
again and yeah who are the most successful people you know at the moment and people are making really weird connections
people who this is where uber and airbnb and all these things come from it's from people who are making a
connection between two things previously unconnected because they're still divergent so let's try and create some
environments where people are free to explore experiment free to break some of the rules and to talk
about things which are um which are not easily put together and i think that that's the best way in
which we can see the opportunity and possibilities in in this changing world in which we live in
how do people find you what's the best uh yeah i think i mean uh twitter or linkedin really i don't use anything i don't use facebook or
anything like that so um for your website so you're on my website into me people contact me through my website but i used
uh i started using twitter again and but linkedin is great for me i can imagine there are about 30 000
people on linkedin and that's really where where i sort of communicate have you um
how do you find social media just out of interest in terms of life i'm a bit like an alcoholic who can't get the top of the bottle
yeah i mean i mean i love the idea of it but um you know i am you know i i think
oh god i should be doing more um but um but i but i just don't
people say that you should if it's not you should you should do yeah well but you know what it's funny one of the advices that i give people at the moment
if it ain't broke you should break it because um you know we almost need to give up what's allowing us to be
successful to allow us to be successful and um you know i know it's a counterintuitive argument it makes perfect sense to be
honest i mean that's the definition what innovation is right yeah it's breaking the blueprint so so i think that you know and again look
it's probably my running isn't it it's one of those things which are uncomfortable so i probably don't do it so um so what i should do is is
try and find out more about you know social media and then i'll have a look at your social channels after and obviously we've got a lot of
content from this so we can send it to you in a way that will do perform well if you post it so listen thank you for your time
today thank you very very generous and it's a really inspiring conversation that's uh i actually want to read it's one of the few conversations where i'm like i
really need to re-listen to this again and maybe with my notepad out and really take notes because there's so many
ideas that are really really profound at times that i'm like i'm trying to hold on to and then because you're because you're full of
them i'm i'm going back i'm thinking you know what i mean because there's so much intelligence condensed in such a
short period of time very kind no i really mean that as well yeah
sometimes i have experts on that have really well studied in their field and the things you say as someone who's
ran a multinational business with 700 employees for the last 10 years of my life i'm like perfect sense and i i really
want to i could unpack all of those individual topics more but yeah thank you such a pleasure to have you thank you thank you for inviting me

Transcription:

intro
this is the first podcast i've done this year where we had tears um and not just once and uh i don't
really know how to introduce this conversation i guess i guess the thing i want you to
know is that things aren't always what they seem and um
really that humans will feel the same we all feel the same emotions the same peaks the same troughs
and no matter what it looks like on the the outside things aren't always what they seem i'm
stephen bartlett and this is the diver ceo i hope nobody's listening but if you are then
please keep this to yourself
Achieving my ultimate goal in 18 weeks
visualization that's a very relevant word i think to start this conversation because in our last conversation last
year when i asked you what you wanted to be remembered for what you wanted to do next in your career you told me that you wanted to have a
legacy for getting kids all across this country up exercising and really into exercise sort
of similar to how jamie oliver completely changed the way we view like school dinners and things and i remember jamie oliver was the reason i was eating
apples instead of mars bars when i was younger and then just like a couple of months
later the pandemic happens and you're getting
millions and millions of kids in this country up dancing and into exercise
only a couple months later it like boggles my mind i've never seen someone say something so big such a big ambition
and then only like a couple of months later do it on a scale which nobody has ever done it before
that's what happened i remember when we met and we talked about that moonshot thing the idea of like having a goal so big and so outreach
that you feel you can never you know almost never attain it and that was my vision it was to have that legacy of making an impact you know and
i do think about james he's had amazing success as a chef as a you know an author but i think about the jamie's school dinners the man who went
into the schools all over the uk and said look this isn't this isn't enough our kids can eat healthier and i
feel the same about school fitness and exercise and pe not just about obesity and the diabetes
thing but i think about our children's mental health and i said to you that i want to have a legacy where i can create
absolute you know national change and national um create awareness around fitness and you
know lockdown happened and within you know 18 weeks that happened so it was almost like a 10-year dream
happened in 18 weeks and i'm so proud of that i've reached that many people take me to the start so lockdown happens
where does this idea come from like what what happens how does and then i want to hear like when you saw the numbers the amount of people tuning in
every day and the impact it was having how did all of that feel it was an intense moment in time but it was also something
i did visualize and i did i had been working on so i'd been visiting schools i'd on the uk tour
i went to ireland northern ireland i'd visited schools i'd worked out with hundreds of kids in these schools and that monday i was
supposed to go on another tour me and nikki were going to take the camera you know it's my brother nikki um and like i've always said there was
no tv show there was no money there was no budget it was just me and nikki going and doing what we love which is connecting and i suppose reconnecting
with the mission and purpose that i have because when it's all digital i do sometimes feel like it's just numbers and is it
is it real people so i have to go and visit the schools and actually meet the kids and do it so on the monday i was supposed to go
out on the road we had about 15 schools chosen and boris announced you know there's going to be this lockdown so
it was 12 15 a.m i was laying in bed on the thursday night and i text nikki because i looked at my whatsapp the next day and i text nikki
saying i've got this idea and honestly i saw everything i saw a hashtag i saw a logo i saw the name
i said it's going to be called pee with joe every day next week do it let's just try it for a week nine a.m
um monday to friday i announced it and loads of pr you know loads of school newsletters you know school news letters or twitter
tweeting it and i was doing espn cnn like global pr and i thought this is going to be really big
but still had no idea how many people would tune in on a monday and on the monday we went live i stepped in front of that camera and i was really
nervous and 850 000 i think it was live streams and i thought wow if you think about how
many kids that could possibly be and then day two was the biggest one so day two was 954 000 live streams which is a
world record it turns out yeah concurrently it was almost a million people watching at the same time
yeah it blew my mind then i i realized there and then that that was like families that was kids it was schools it
wasn't like individual people so really it was probably tens of millions of people a day and i felt this amazing sense of purpose
like i was there for people that when they needed me the most because everyone was locked in you know whether you had children or not you were like
confined you felt restricted your mental health was going to suffer that day and i was there like to to be there and just have fun and i never once one thing
i was really cautious of never mentioned lockdown never mentioned covid or the or you know anything to do that was like it was a
safe 30 minutes where we could forget about things i put the music on we were dancing around being really silly and
that was a gift that was my gift to the world it was just a bit of laughter some feel good energy and a real boost
in their mood when that finished i know that they were happier and you must have got a lot of calls from the big sort of production
companies and tv companies wanting to like buy it or or to bring it to tv right within a few
days so you remember i told you the story about the channel 4 thing i was trying my hardest to make the uk tour thing and a documentary
around schools fitness but they never had the budget that no one could do it well within a few days the head of channel 4 like the top guy i can't think
of his name called me up personally said joe what you're doing is amazing we'd love you to stream the workouts on channel four and
i i was like dude like i'm doing this on youtube i've got kids in sri lanka and south america and india
and like even like madagascar and the maldives taking part in these workouts i can't do this on channel 4 i need to
be global and i'm so glad i stuck with that because that really allowed it to go globally it allowed everyone
all over the world to take part and don't forget i was getting a million live streams but by the end of the 24 hours there was seven
eight million views crazy so total 80 million views on the 18 weeks so 80 million
individual views but how many families or schools are doing that so it's tens of millions of kids and
that was my dream so i just can't believe it happened but i'd built up that trust over eight years
you know as the body coaches joe wicks as this mission driven person anyone could have the same idea
but maybe they wouldn't have had the same reaction because like i said i put out so much love and energy and positivity and visiting these schools
that those teachers knew i was going to live deliver a really fun and safe session for their kids 18 million people is you know when you
sat down with me last year we had this conversation you said you wanted to to do this nationally right you said you want to get kids exercising
nationally there's only about 60 million people in the uk you managed to do 80 million people all around the world
on a global level but also at a time when people really needed that kind of
energy the most at a time when the country was you know fearful and people were trapped indoors and not
exercising as much as they they could have been so i you know we can talk about the the p with joe
Feeling lost
thing for a long time but the thing that actually fascinates me more is what happens afterwards
so you've just that goal you set out to achieve you achieved it quick how does it feel after
well you talk about that gold medal syndrome you know of people having this like coming off tour or coming to back
from the olympics and they have this kind of feeling of like feeling flat or not depressed maybe but confused and
lost and that's what happened i moved into this new house and i thought i've got this lovely house why am i feeling flat and for the first
two weeks i was there i was missing my old house in richmond because my children were born there p which i was in that living room that
you interviewed me in and it was like this i left this energy behind and moved into this new life and i was like why am i
feeling like this and i realized it was because i'd lost my purpose i'd been disconnected from that audience every day
um so when i felt that the first thing i do i jump on my instagram like i said to you i used to do dms and voice notes
and i reconnect with the messages i read the youtube comments so that i know two million people a month for
doing youtube workouts before the lockdown i'm now getting six to seven million views a month so that's real people that
have changed their habits they're still doing it um and it reminded me why i did it and also
i had wonderful letters i had two two or two or three i'm gonna say it's probably nearly like two or three thousand like letters and
cards and things that seems mad but i had this stack of things to go through so i sat in my office for two days
you know laughing crying like feeling this love it was like this wave of love when i realized what i'd actually done during that time
it wasn't just about me getting kids exercising it was like widows it was single parents it was people with anxiety and depression
living on their own and in all the all the different places in the world it was really emotional so i did feel lost
but i've reconnected with that because now i'm still doing my youtube workouts i'm still delivering free content and although there's this new product in
this app coming out i'm so passionate and committed to doing that one workout a week that i will never neglect that free
content and that audience that are there that still may never buy my app on my books you talked about buying a new house
probably a bit of a dream come true in many senses um but again you speak about it being kind of anti-climactical like in like
not feeling like that expectation that when you've got that big house because i've seen the house it's a nice house you should have felt
like confetti should have come down and you should have felt amazing and but you kind of described it like you didn't feel that like that yeah i kind
of thought you know i was i was gonna move anyway but it was like the the the lock down accelerated because we had paparazzi outside and i
wasn't used to that you know i wasn't used to being having like folks taking a meaning when we walked to the park and we lived on a main road so it's quite public and
people would knock and and sort of say hello and it was fine but sometimes you just want a little bit of privacy like when you switch off
so we found this lovely house and it's you know it's got a nice driveway it's got a beautiful back garden and when i was in there i just kind of
thought why aren't i double as happy i've got more space i've got more garden but i genuinely
felt like i left that part of me behind in that house that was so purpose-driven it was all about pee with joe it's where my kids
were born so i suppose it's a lesson and i really talked about that when boris announced the lockdown number two and i'm sitting
there in my kitchen i've got all this space i'm thinking it doesn't matter if you've got a massive house we live in a one bedroom
flat we all feel the same right now we all feel very disconnected very lonely you know we miss our friends and
family we need to socialize we need events we need live music we need dinners so so it's just a really important
message that it doesn't matter what situation you're in we're all feeling the same and i really wanted to share that message and it definitely helped
people open up the conversation because we're all struggling you know mentally with this with what's going on and yeah you know
you've talked about it before you know ordering the car and the house and i think we're driven by these things and consumerism like we we're always
wanting the next thing but what i've realized you're in this lockdown is i'm happy exactly where i am with just what i've got
and that's a nice feeling it's really nice when you realize that another rolex another car even another motorbike or another
holiday it doesn't it doesn't give you what you really think and i think people listening that are desperate for that life i think we
all come to the same conclusion eventually whether you're 30 or 60 we will all level out and realize that what's important is our friends and our
connection and our love to the people around us it's it as you say it took me a long time to learn that lesson and
i the the phrase that i was having 27 aren't you something like that yeah you ain't taking that long
you've got i think you're very when i listen to your podcast i think you've got a lot of wisdom i think you've spoken to a lot of people and you've
you've absorbed a lot and i think you've really taken into your own um your own life and philosophies i
think i think you know what i think it is i i've also been really like self-analytical as in i will
have a thought and i'll have a feeling and i'll try and grab onto it and hold that out in front of me and go why are you feeling like that so the day
as you kind of alluded to there where i realized i was going to be very wealthy and i start looking at cars and houses
i get this feeling of like the feeling you described with your old house which is i think if i get this i'll actually feel
poorer in some way i'll lose something like if i and then i thought to myself well if i get this one
what's next if you get a lamborghini aventador the the best [ __ ] sports what's next and then i was like i'm
gonna just keep go and then me realizing that if i if i always start believe that my happiness was somewhere else in a
promotion in a new car in a big house it will never be here if i believe that i can't possibly be
happy because i don't have x i will never be happy because once i get x it's like a mirage or a rainbow it
just moves out further in front of you yeah and you see that with a lot of celebrities a lot of musicians like talented people that get everything so
young you know they get to that point where they start you know they go into depression and anxiety and it can you know manifest in drug addiction or
you know all kinds of things but yes if you're constantly looking for the next thing or almost living in the past with old
memories and what you used to have like you talk about down contrasting and up contrasting like that thing you said
changed my life just thinking stop thinking about what you did last year how you went to america and you went to coachella think about what you're doing today and
not worrying about that and it really just brings you to a it's like a medita it's like a meditation it's a thought a simple thought where you can
actually start to bring yourself back to the moment and like like i said i it could be a quote it could be a podcast it could be an
interview little things just sometimes it opens up a whole new thought process isn't it and you start to think actually you know
what that's amazing and also i interviewed fern cotton and she said one of these lovely quotes is
nothing in nature blooms all year round you know where we're constantly i need number one podcast i need the number one app i need to have
um you know the best book i need everything's got me number one i need to be doing everything every month for the year but i've realized that
in nature like nothing blooms all year round and that again made me realize it's okay to have quiet months and not be in the media
chill out relax because something good will come late on a year you'll bloom again and during summer and i think so little things like that
really open up my mind and i'm evolving quickly i think since i become a parent as well um you start to
be much more empathetic and you start to understand and you feel a lot more when you've got kids i don't know where it comes from but
i'm i think a lot more about other people's feelings now more than i ever used to i actually wrote down um when i was
watching your video that you did during the lockdown where you start discussing your own mental health and you saying i've just watched boris's announcement
and i'm feeling really [ __ ] but in that video you also say i'm feeling [ __ ] at the thought that
there's loads of families out here that are going to lose their jobs and stuff and i wrote in my notes right like incredibly empathetic like
you are incredibly empathetic and it kind of it made me question like where did he get that from because that is a trait i noticed in you last time as
well most people in the middle of a lockdown when they just found out that we're going into our second lockdown don't think oh my
god all these other people that are going to lose their jobs and you i could see it in your face and i know you're a genuine guy because i've
been with you we've gone for dinner you know outside of the podcast i know who you are i'm like he genuinely genuinely cares i
think it's grown him i think that feeling has grown in me but where i used to be like you know when you're a teenager you're a young adult it's all about you it's like me me
me and then you you know you find a partner and you start to realize it's about your partner and it's about your kids but i think yeah like the more i realize
that we're all connected it's that thing of connection you know it comes from sometimes a meditation or a feeling of like
we're all we're all in the same experience and you know i've had i've been very lucky like the
body coach brand has grown you know my youtube audience has grown like the sign ups of the planet it's all gone insane and so i think
about other people in small business i genuinely care about fact i think about families that have run like restaurants
for 30 years or had you know properties or had like amazing nightclubs or you know amazing restaurants that are
suddenly going under like that it affects me and that really when i stop and think about all the pain and suffering in the world it
really brings me down it really kind of brings my energy down and then i have to kind of exercise or do something positive because i start to
feel a bit sad because that is the world right now you know there's billions of people that are going for a really difficult time
and so my reaction to that is trying to inspire them to move to eat well to exercise because i know that it
can counteract any kind of you know financial pressures or stress that's going on if you exercise and you lift your energy
and you and you put good food in your body you know even temporarily you're going to feel better and it's going to change your mind so
that's my gift you know i try and inspire people to exercise and feel good for you know even if it's once a day or once
a week it's enough to change the way you feel about yourself and your life we went from a little dinner a couple a
couple of months back i don't know i think just after the first lockdown before the second one um and
i was i came home really inspired on one end but just i couldn't shake this thought and i i
hate to go back to it but i couldn't shake this idea that you just had the biggest achievement of your life
with this p i mean outside of your kids in my opinion um out with this p with joe format that
just shook just spread across the world right and the joe i met at that dinner was
somewhat despondent as you say like confused and um as you say like really unsure
about why you weren't feeling on top of the world and also really unsure about what you do next to
to kind of like top that i guess and it really stayed with me it stayed with me for like a couple of
weeks what did you think do you think i'd be more like energetic and and and proud and like ambitious or what
every every person on planet earth would have thought okay so joe set out to achieve something and he smashed it out
the park he is on all of the tv stations congratulations on the mbe by the way that's a whole nother conversation we'll
get to that mad he smashed everything at the park
um he's got to be just absolutely buzzing we were sat at the dinner and there's people coming up to us
asking you for pictures halfway through the dinner as well but you weren't like that and even though i've written about this in my
book at great length about gold medal syndrome and gold medal depression and my own experiences i still when i saw that in you i was
like [ __ ] people need to hear about this because you were i'll be honest right
that was the lowest i've ever seen you really oh yeah i suppose i i was concerned no i mean
look i was i was really looking forward to seeing you and i was it was i was you know we hadn't been out for a while but i think coming off the back of that pee with joe
i was emotionally drained i think you know physically i can do workouts all day i've done it dude i've done a 24-hour workout like i
can move my body but i think the energy of performing like going on stage stepping in front of the camera
when i wasn't in the mood for it when i had to like pick up every i was literally carrying everyone's emotion and energy and trying to and i
do believe in energy that we carry and we push it and we sometimes hold negative energy we sometimes hold things locked up from years ago and
i was just i suppose fatigued emotionally fatigued at that point but i've bounced back you know i'm back in the zone i'm filming workouts
again and i'm um i'm refocused like i said on the on the purpose and the mission which is like
fitness rule and i've got the app is one option i've got the books there's one option but then also instagram youtube you know there's so
much free content because i don't want anyone to feel like the body coaches premium brand and i can only get him through that paid
subscription no i'm still gonna give you one workout a week on youtube and i'm still gonna do my instagram recipes i'm still gonna
share my daily stories and motivate you um and every now and again i might mention the app but it really is
just like for people that want to give it that extra push you know and try something a bit different so as we park pee with joe you know last
Goals going forwards
time you sat down here you put out into the world your your goal your ambition and it came true
so i think you know let's tempt again uh what is your what is your goal and ambition now going forward in
terms of your purpose well i think what i what what happened i achieved was a short-term thing you know
it changed behaviors but they had to they had to do it because they were locked in parents had to keep their kids moving um
you know schools weren't providing pee everything was closed so it was a temporary thing it was the start of a movement but it's
the legacy is still continuing that movement you know continuing to visit schools continuing to speak to
heads and i don't see it as a government thing because i've realized that you can actually just speak to local schools and they have the ability to change their
curriculum well they have to follow the curriculum but they can change their timetable so if they want to fit a 15-minute workout
in once a day with their children or do it um you know at the end of the day they have the ability so again it's about continuing to grow that
mission to create content maybe it's a separate platform which schools can use but it isn't over because like anything
motivation drops it might it drops for me it drops for you um different times of the year and with young people
they're very engaged at the early ages in primary school but when they start hitting their teens they're in the devices they become more
resistant to exercise so the challenge becomes tougher as they get older so my mission now is to continue the
school's work when i can go on the road start visiting schools again creating content you know
i'm hopefully creating a tv show around that you know like jamie over school dinners was only six episodes in my head
it felt like it was weeks and months and months of content so you know i want to do the same thing i want to create a really amazing series
whether it's um you know netflix or bbc or channel 4 where i can continue that conversation to get one teacher or one dinner lady or
one um head of a school to believe in the power of exercise for their children so i really feel like i've just started
there's so much more to go i think you have as well and you know so like we what one thing i've learned from doing this podcast and
speaking to guests like you is that and even eddie hearn who we had on last week is how pivotal and how defining
our early years are and you are like a really fascinating guy in so many ways we talked about your empathy
Your childhood
your achievements um all of these things suggest that you're because they're such
extraordinary things or out of the ordinary things suggest that you probably had quite an
out of ordinary childhood whenever whenever i meet someone uh who is achieved out of ordinary things i
always think okay tell me about your childhood so how was your childhood joe oh so you think you don't think it was a stable
child do you think they were saying a bit more that motivated me to yeah i think i think um and it
doesn't necessarily mean it was like a really bad childhood or a good childhood i always you know and i actually did childhood psychology for two years which
people don't know about this is why i'm so fascinated by like all the freudians um psychology and and how one thing that happened
i've got a friend who told me that one thing that happened when he was a kid he still remembers to the day to this
day and he holds that one comment that someone in his family made to him as the reason for his
probably his single biggest flaw in his personality and it was just one comment on one day from a parent yeah
that's that's that's amazing and that's the power of um yeah the power of a negative thought like if someone says
your teeth are a bit crooked or you've got skinny legs like someone could say you've got lovely teeth your whole life but you still think your teeth are
crooked yeah and that's happened to me in the past i got invisalign because one a girlfriend said to me you know your teeth are a bit wonky really you
know and and someone said about you know this is a true story when i was 16 i had glasses but i was really embarrassed i
was really shy about it and the girl i was going out and said i said something like i wonder if i'd look good in glasses and she
she said oh no you'd look silly in glasses so i never wore them for two or three years i just hide them in my car
drive to our house take them out and you know it's that thing of we really take on these these thoughts and
it can really affect our confidence and that definitely definitely happened to me as a kid but i suppose
my childhood was very chaotic you know it was very unstable my dad was a drug addict from a very
young age so you know that was it was a bit like you know he was there one minute next minute he was in rehab next minute he was he was back
on the gear you know and he my mum would take him back and it was all good and then they'd be arguing and you know i lived in a council flat with
um really thin doors so it was like um it's like plywood and so
there used to be holes in the wall there's be holes in the door because i remember um i need to think why are there holes in
the door like and i look back now i know it's because mum and dad used to fight and argue and you know it'd be like it was a symbol of aggression and
impatience and intolerance and then it'd be gone and so i always i didn't have a positive role model in
terms of in terms of a male and also when it comes to marriage you know my mum and dad never got married if they were married they would have been divorced a
hundred times so i had similar beliefs around marriage and commitment to you like to hear you
talking about it like i i suppose i had the same feelings when i was 25 i didn't believe that people stay together people are
committed that marriage is going to work that you know people get through tough time because it was always like when it got
[ __ ] and tough my dad would piss off and we'd be back on our own again so you know again it was a tough childhood
but also i had a happy childhood i didn't i don't feel like resentment i don't look back and be like i wish it was different i wish my dad was there
because we got a great relationship today but it definitely affected me you know the destruction of drugs in my household
and what came with that all the chaos really put me off ever wanting to smoke weed or drink
alcohol you know i was so scared that i was going to enjoy it and i was going to become an addict i thought it was a genetic thing i thought i don't want to be a drug addict so i wouldn't go near
it so it definitely um it definitely shaped me you know and when i look at where my love and generosity and empathy
comes from it's my mom like my mom is she's so kind and loving and she's so always putting other people first and i
think that definitely shaped me as an adult i didn't actually know this stuff about you before i didn't know
that you'd been through such a um traumatic early childhood and as you were saying that i was thinking
[ __ ] hell it's remarkable that you are who you are and that you have such feelings of empathy and you're just
such a kind human being having gone through such a you know violent and traumatic
childhood and i guess that is credit to your mum um i suppose yeah i look back when i get
asked in interviews now like where where did your generosity and your kindness come from and your kind of desire to want to help others it's about
help you know i'm happiest when i'm helping others so if i know i'm helping someone or i'm helping millions
i'm really happy and so when it when it stops i felt i'm not i'm not i'm not i haven't got my purpose i'm not
valuable but i've realized i am still valuable i'm still helping people um but yeah my mum you know she left
school at 15 no qualifications she met my dad in a squat she had my brother when she was 17. then she had
nikki she had me when she was 19. she's like a kid and when we used to go play she's like people she says that your sister
she looks so young you can't imagine like um but somewhere along the line she taught me value she taught me respect
you know if i had to be home at 10 o'clock on a friday night i was home at ten o'clock my mates were down apart till one two
for him because their parents let him run loose and they were the ones graffiti and they were the ones smoking weed they were the ones that got in you know in trouble for
you know crimes and whatnot so my mum was really considering she wasn't parented her dad
left her when she was a kid she was she was a banner when she was a baby so i don't know where her love comes from but she's got this
ability to just love and and be so generous and when she went to university she went back she said i want to study
she she went to become a social worker so the first thing she'd done with her life was going to help people that you know young offenders people that had
been through abuse and and all this stuff so it has to come from her it's a motive it's my mum so when i took my mom for
dinner um the night before it was going to be announced and i said to her like we're celebrating my birthday tonight
aren't we because it's we we were having a late birthday there but it's something else yeah miami and i said mom um i've got an
mba and she we're in the middle of lucky cat restaurant in london and she burst into tears and i'm like
in the middle of the restaurant crying with her and she's like when she was younger like all her friends used to say you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] parent imagine the
pride and it is it's she raised me like i have to put it down to her you talked about your dad then said you
said that you've um after all that you'd been through and all you'd observed and his addiction and his battles with addiction you've got a
good relationship with him now yeah we we do because you know addiction never goes away like
he's you know he does his na meetings it's a part of his life but he he needs that he needs to have a
fellowship and a network of people to talk to like i don't understand addiction i've never been addicted to anything so for me it's like
it he needs that that network of people he can talk to and that's obviously the moment mostly through zoom but usually it's like n a meetings
you know you go and have a talk and you you feel better and he's had you know he had therapy but you know he's learned he's he's became he's evolved like again like
his dad left him and i understand my mom and dad because they went through so much trauma my mom was
abandoned when she was two years old was living in a she was in a um you know an orphanage
and then my dad the same thing he's that left him like he didn't have you know he didn't ever say i think i
don't think my dad's dad told him he loved him until he was like on his deathbed when he had cancer so like i understand where that addiction why my
dad chose to like do that with his life and i understand why my mum had ocd like because i know what she
went through as a kid i know what she went through as a young teenager and so you start to understand it and then you start to really love your parents even
more because they protect you when you're a kid they're just protection they can't tell you what they went through they can't tell you this stuff so it really like
makes you realize how much trauma they've had and where that's manifested
and so now like my relationship my dad is i understand him i understand that he he has seasonal depression during the winter he's really low and he'll have a
holiday and he feels great and he comes back and he's up and down and that's him and i just have to kind of love him and although i'm quite
consistent with my emotions and you want everyone around you to be happy all the time don't you think i'll buy him a motorbike i
send them to the maldives or you can go and stay at my house in america it's all temporary it's all it doesn't do a lot you know so real
connection comes from like communicating reaching out spending spending time with him like he's happy when he comes around and we
go for a walk or we got on our skateboards together you know we've got electric skateboards so it's about reconnecting and being with
him and he he needs that my dad needs to see the grandkids he needs to see my brothers he needs to see me and um
yeah i've just learned that like i said that really nice quote that the the antidote to addiction is
connection not push him away i hate you i can't stand it why are you relapsing again why are you going into depression
you know the mind's really complex and you have to understand that people aren't going to always be how you want to be and you
have to love them unconditionally but if you ask me as a teenager i would be too angry i'd be like [ __ ] that no like i can't deal with it i
don't have a dad but that's a drug i don't speak to him i wouldn't have had the emotional um ability to deal with that but now as an
ad i'm 35 and i can understand it a bit more a little crazy because um i love that
quote by the way and it i think johanna hari is a real uh sort of yeah i think i've got his book on the
shelf behind me about lost connection from yeah that's yeah i think russell brand mentioned it to me and i thought wow that's such a nice thought
and that's what the book is about it's about the real reasons for depression and anxiety fundamentally stem back to a loss of connection of some sort
and it was telling when you were telling your story about the generational sort of cycle that's going on there your mother's you know your dad and her
upbringing and then your father's dad and how like it was a lack of connection it seems
that put them into the situations they were in and then that lack of connection made them a certain way which then nearly made
you treat them with a lack of connection as well and i think it seems like much of the
reason you're able to break the cycle is because you've realized that and you're like as you say bringing
bringing him close despite you know i talk about this a lot with my friends that have um an estranged parent or have lost a
parent and i always tell them i was doing it this week i was saying you've got to forgive them for
their own faults because their faults have come from some kind of trauma and tony robbins
says it as well he says you've got sometimes we've got to forgive our parents for being imperfect not being the parents we hoped they were yeah
it's so true and like you said you you know memories memories can form like your literally
change your characteristics and your personality and your belief system and i had really negative beliefs around commitment around um
you know people being faithful people sticking together like when things got tough to people and even i'd be affected if like
celebrities that i really loved like they'd break up i'd think see that even they can't stay together i just thought no one stays together no
one's loyal no one's no one's ever like actually happily married and stays together but now as a married man with two kids who i love
i'm really really like i don't believe that i believe that you can be happy i believe that when i see an old couple on the bench you know 78 year old couple
i love that i think how amazing they've spent their life together i want to be like that i want to be a couple that are stuck together so
it's you know my child has affected my um my my love and commitment as a as a relate in a relationship to
rosie but also as a parent like i don't want to be impatient and intolerant and snappy and swear and shout but
that is my default setting that's what my head's trying to do when indian miley screaming at me i want to slam the door and walk out the
house or i want to scream and shout back at him because that's what i that's what i had as a kid so i have to actively work against that so
although i might be screaming in my head i just take a breath and i like almost just sort of um yeah just take a
moment to just sort of calm myself and then i can react very differently but that is a that's a muscle you have to train it
because otherwise i'd just be screaming and shattering all day long you know so that's definitely it's hard
to do that when you've had it all your life when you just got you know screamed that shouted at it's just it's like what you know it's
default it's a default yeah like it truly is like a it's like a computer program and you have to sort of try and undo that code um and i read a
book called um calm calm parents happy happy kids and it's that thing you can either fight
flight or or pause and have a breath you can fight and swear and shout and scream and slam the door you can
run out of the house and just deal with it and let them deal with it and just not even deal with any emotion and show no emotional control or you can
pause and have a breath and that's the secret it's just having that right in these two years old her brain is not rational she
can't understand why i really want to just clean the side and put her down on the floor right now and so like you've got to literally remind
yourself every time and then you can start to really respond differently we're all human you have days where you
you get it i have days like i mean course i have days where i shout and i lose the plot and i feel terrible but also i know that
she won't hold it against me like the amount of times i was showered at i i love my mum to death so it's not like
she shouted at me i think she's terrible and i don't love her for today like i think it's okay to not be perfect not be a perfect
parent and the other dad had a row of rose and i said i'm i'm sorry i'm not perfect every day i'm sorry that some days i'm surprised
rosie's my wife i said i'm i'm i'm sorry that i'm not perfect every i love you so much i'm so
affectionate and sensitive but if i'm stressed and i've got something gone sometimes i'm snappy sometimes i'm impatient and
i don't shout the kids i might shout at you and i'm sorry and it's nice to say that out loud and have
a bit of a chat about it because then you kind of move on and you can just you know get on with it and you learn from it you're getting busier right with
the app coming with the app stuff you're doing you're getting more requests than ever before surely dude i'm so i've this has been the year
like i've i mean i've worked hard really over the last years you know during the growing stage like with social media you know it's hard building
You must be really busy
an audience and then i kind of had great success with the books and now like you know this a year
since p with joe um the 24-hour challenge i i then done wake up with joe which is three workouts a week for a lockdown two
because i thought they need to exercise people need to move i'm i've now had the book pr i've been doing radio interviews i've
done the channel for so the bbc children need 24 hour channels i've not stopped like i don't know how i'm still
going but i now at this moment need more energy than ever because this is the busy time this is like leading up to christmas i'm also doing a
january bootcamp five days a week i'm doing live workouts through the app you know which is great because it means people are going to go
i want to give it a go and it's a really amazing way of marketing the product but i'm going to be exhausted if you think about your state and your mood and how
you feel within yourself in the midst of all this like chaos and then we've got the pandemic rattling on outside as well
what impact has it had on you um all of this busyness and now you've got
two kids you know that are you growing up and screaming at you and don't want to be put down
have you felt a change i deal with it in different ways like usually i have these like blocks where i'll i work for like two three months and then
i go right i'm gonna go to santa monica for a few weeks so let's go and have a nice week in dubai just to unwind and leave the phones and
stuff and i've missed that i've missed that just that reset button because i've had a i'd like a couple of days away um just
when lockdown was over but it wasn't enough because i actually spent my time filming workouts because i said i was gonna do
three workouts a week so although i was there relaxing i'm still there and my what i do is so physical like
you know being being physical and doing exercise but also doing if such an amazing energy through the camera is so draining but
last week has been the most emotionally draining i was doing like radio interviews with um
like jamie oliver and ricky gervais and uh doing all these things i'm it's out of my comfort zone completely
and then i had phone calls every every hour on the hour to promote the new book so that is a different type of emotion and
when we talk about the body code so you know i am the physical body like the energy and nikki is like the cto he's the
brains he takes all the stuff all the things i can't the process stuff nikki's on a laptop doing zoom calls nine hours a day like managing this
agency and all the other marketing stuff so together we have this perfect kind of relationship where
we are working as equally as hard but we're taking we're doing what we can do sure so i don't feel like burning out
but i do think at the end of january i need to block a month out so i've taken the month off hoping to go you know somewhere nice
like i love costa rica i'd love to go with the kids amazing you know just just just unwind and basically when i have that time
down off the offline and i'm not filming it really re-energizes me when i come back i'm like i'm like resetting like
body coach volume 2 ready to go again sort of thing you talked a little bit there about marriage earlier and you've also
you've also heard me on this podcast talking about marriage right i want you to tell me where i i'm getting it wrong yeah and
also why you think i'm getting it wrong so i listened to two episodes of your podcast and i i really hear i hear myself and you when
Marriage, tell me where I’m going wrong
i was like 25 and i was a lot and i feel i feel like a part of you is lost because you've got everything on the surface you could
possibly want you've you've smashed it in business like you've got an amazing story and you've got you know incredible success which is
wonderful but there's maybe you're missing that deeper connection with one person you know you've got amazing friends and you've got a great network of people you
work but i do feel like the love between one person you know it's different it's a different kind of relationship but you
can always lean on them so when i was 25 i was in a relationship from 19 and i really i was running away i
couldn't commit to i didn't i used to say like exactly what you were like this marriage is like this
religious thing it's a contract and why should that person get half of what i've gotten what it's not gonna work all my other
friends are unhappy they're all divorced you know one in three marriages so the more you tell yourself that the more it becomes true and the truth is
how you feel now is how you feel and what you believe now is what you believe but when you meet someone and you you
realize and when you do fall in love in whatever sense that could be it was almost like with rosie i was telling her every day i
loved her and it wasn't enough it was i needed to tell her more i needed to have something
stronger between us so i said can we have a baby you know then she felt pregnant we had indie so for me in my head the ultimate
bond between two humans and he's another child and then when she was pregnant i never thought i would get excited about the
idea of like proposing and getting married but it was just it just changed my mind has changed
as i started to think you know i love this girl i don't want to be waking up you know every other week with a different girl
in a different hotel i'm like that's not who i have been and it's never who i'll be so i love being with i love being close
to one person i think i'm quite um emotional right there um and then after to marry me we had this amazing wedding day and
i do love being mad and i just think when you have kids and you start seeing your children grow and you
you see how wonderful that can be how much joy they bring you i just think your perspective will change over time and you're just not there yet it might you
might not get that till you're 35 you could be 45 i was 30. i met rosie at 30. okay and
i've been the happiest since i turned 30. honestly i've just been i'm commit because being being honest
and being committed is two of the most wonderful things being sneaky being deceitful not being honest or being
jealous and insecure they're feelings you do not want to go through your life with so when you find someone you know be
committed and be loyal it's a really it really takes your love to another level you believe in the you know there's a bunch of words people use in
uh in this in this realm of like love and marriage uh they say you know you gotta find your soul mate i don't
know if it's soulmate but everyone says oh hard you know loves hard work marriage is hard work it isn't
it doesn't have to be hard work not if you're with the right person of course you could get with someone too young marry the wrong person it all goes wrong
and you know that's a bad experience but it doesn't mean that the next relationship won't be better and you can't improve and learn from it
but you know i do feel like rosie is is the kind of female version of me like when we met you know we were just having
so much fun and she's she's a wonderful parent i watch her and i see how patient she is i think i learn a lot from her because
i i've got like a two or three minute kind of tolerance of marley screaming and screaming in my face where i just have
to walk out the room i just can't handle it whereas she can be in there like 20 minutes all through the night and i'm like because
yeah with indie crying or marley teething i think it's amazing she's just got this natural
innate like motherly patience and love and tolerance so i watch that and i literally like go i need a bit more of
that and i sort of learn from it but yeah i mean you know maybe maybe you might have one relationship last five
years but i do believe that when you are in a relationship like give it all don't don't be thinking this is going to end soon this
my last one didn't work out i know now it's going to break down and we're going to end up breaking apart we're gonna end up leaving each other
she'll have an affair i'll i'll leave her it won't work that just it's hard to be happy in that situation so i think take every
relationship and just maximize it to the best of your ability like you would with
someone that you were of a business partner if we went into business together you're trying to try and make that partnership so like
awesome and so effective and efficient and it's the same with a relationship you've got you know keep keep
keep doing the things that make you happy and and yeah i think with rosie like just having a night out going for
dinner um and the you know the secret is if you stop kissing you're [ __ ] if you don't kiss your girlfriend and
you stop kissing you just bypass each other and you don't because everything starts from a kiss i mean
it could become a massage it could become you know you might do a bit of hanky-panky but if you stop
kissing that one thing that intimacy i feel like i feel like everything breaks down seriously
can you kiss him it's one of the it's probably the only thing that i've thought about going and seeing a therapist about is
like i have a fairly negative pessimistic let's say
perception on romantic relationships um and i think i've identified that
on one hand i'm my expectations are probably like somewhat unm unmutable and then on the
other hand i kind of see relationships as being like a bird in a cage is the best way where does that come
from like so i know your mom and dad and they're arguing at each other my parents that's the only th that's the only
marriage role model in your your base and your opinion on yeah so i i have these v but when i say my parents screamed at
each other i'm like my mum i've never seen since a human able to
perform this screaming match she did nigerian woman if you don't know nigerian women i do visualize it like around the
kitchen table the sound is un like you've never seen my dad actually said one day he said i your mom was
screaming at me this is i think when we lived in manchester probably before i was born your mum was screaming at me and i went
out like went shopping did all that she had no idea i came back and she's still screaming she had no idea that i'd left
the house and the the the the sound of it i i have this like mental image of my
dad sat passively just this like passive white guy just sat there watching tv just looking at the screen
and my african mother like kind of stood above him just bellowing into his face at full volume for like six
hours she didn't lose energy we talked about like exhausting yourself she didn't lose her energy and she would
follow him around the house and so i looked at my dad and thought he's trapped and this is what my you know that that
experience of seeing your mum shout is that effect is that like affected your you know your
you know when you argue are you confrontational are you like because me and rosie more like silent tree and we sulk and we're so stubborn and we'll
like go two days without talking we don't scream and shout each other you are you quite shallow i will never shout
i see you're calm never i will not do it i i will the minute so i will try and explain myself in a very
calm way and then i'm like okay i'm going right away i will like do you ever say sorry do you ever admit you're wrong
or do you find it hard for me so if you'd asked me that question two years ago the answer would have been like no i
never say sorry like because i always kind of think i'm right and it's like my way or the highway in the last year and when i was i got
with this certain person um who i won't name and she kind of taught me to like grow up a
little bit and and i started to apologize for things and i started to learn to apologize a
little bit more but i'm i've got to be honest i'm not going to lie it's like the whole point of this podcast is not to [ __ ] lie like i'm still not that good at it it is hard
i'm the same i find it hard to say sorry in the moment but i do if i go away for a little half an hour an hour have a walk or do a
workout i do come back and i go i was a bit disrespectful there i do apologize but yeah it's an ego thing it's like you just gotta let your guard
down one thing i say about relationships which i really think is valuable i can't remember where i heard it i read it but it was about
you can be in a relationship with someone and this expectation thing where you want them to do everything perfect and be everything in one and be like this
amazing like just like unicorn right but you might find them really attractive and really
funny but intellectually they just don't challenge you just you can't have conversations about what they don't understand you but you can ring me or nicky and we you can
get that that that that part of a relationship with from someone else so there's no pressure on that person you're with to like be really
intelligent really understand business and really understand social media like that's something i've learned that sometimes you have to love the person of
what they've got you know love they're they're really affectionate love that they're really caring considerate but maybe other elements of their
personality you have to get from someone else because the chances of you finding the unicorn it's so rare isn't it
that you're going to find that and also you like you might be amazing at certain things but you might not be good at one yeah i'm not a unicorn this is the
problem who is he from no wonder no one's a unicorn really no one's completely perfect because
when you're in a relationship you want the other person to like you know do everything like you and it'd be interesting the same things you
like rosie's not into you know motorbikes but i got my brother and my my my little brother george and
my dad so i kind of get i scratch that itch and i come back and then i spend time with rosie and the kids so it's
really about finding the needs that you need as a human being in in maybe in multiple people and then
you can really just focus on what you love about your partner it does help you talk to a little i
talked a little bit about that about going to therapy have you ever gone to therapy so this week i had my deadline for my
book happy sexy millionaire which you can now pre-order and it's been an absolute
labor of love over the last couple of years and because i had the deadline on sunday i was head
down smashing it out um typically like me forgetting to
eat my meals and things like that and um and this is where he all saved me once again and i was in my office until 6 a.m
in the morning i was getting very very tired i had two heels and um i had dinner as well and it's for
me that was the perfect that was the reason why i've teamed up with huel because someone like me in that situation would
basically either completely skip meals i would not get my sort of vitamins and minerals i wouldn't get protein
then i'd start feeling like [ __ ] um because i didn't have the time and that's as i've said in this
podcast before the reason i've um i'm so attached to huell the company the brand the
the founder julian because it really does save my ass and it has done for three years and if you ask someone like
me you know that does have uh a very time limited life then i really really
recommend you give huel a shot i really recommend you you give berry flavour huel a shot because that
is my favorite flavor and um yeah so this week i just wanted to shout out because you definitely saved me on sunday
when i had my book deadline and also go and check out my book happy sexy millionaire it's quite nice it's like um
yeah it's nice i talked a little bit about that about
going to therapy have you ever gone to therapy i call it the gym but yeah i think my therapy from a kid and i look back
like for sure like i was stressed i didn't want to go home i would be always out the house always
playing sport i think it was my therapy and i dealt with things through sport and maybe that's why i became the body coach but i think
Therapy
i had um i had one therapy session with a counselor at once um because i was basically in a
relationship i didn't want to be in and i needed to talk to someone about it and i had that session and i i just
spoke and and verbalized everything i was going through and it was almost like just by saying i was like i know i need to walk away from
this now and i i went home and that was it so it was a re it was an investment it was like an hour of my time
um i i spoke to someone because it wasn't my mum who's invested my dad who has invested it wasn't her parents and
my friends who really cared about her it was like a completely neutral person and it really helped because it changed
the rest of my life because i left a relationship i wasn't happy in i met rosie i got married and i had kids
you know and this is the situation i was 19 when i met that girl i was backpacking i was in a bar in australia you're very different
10 years later so maybe maybe there can be such thing as a relationship that's really great at a certain time in your
life but then when it's not right and it isn't working having a child and marrying that person is definitely the wrong thing to do
and i didn't really realize that until i met rosie just how how unhappy i probably was in that last
relationship so yeah i've had it once and i think if i n if i feel like i need it i'd be open to
it i've got a lot of friends that do it it's like i see it as like personal training for the mind isn't it it's like why not why not take care of your brain
and your heart and your mind and that can be done through therapy so i'm open to it um i just haven't felt i haven't had the
calling i'm more interested in um i really like the idea of doing an ios ceremony can we do it together do you
know why i'm just i listen to your podcast i listen to like certain people that do it and i i'm drawn to it because of that gateway
Psychedelics & mental health
and opening up that even more love and more connection when you realize we're all so interconnected and
obviously you can meditate for 10 years or you can go and do an rsc ceremony and apparently you get it's like a fast track
to that feeling but yeah you've talked about it have you have i mean i was in mexico and tulum and they they were doing like peyote
ceremonies out there and i i just couldn't quite convince enough to do it but i would love to do ayahuasca one day like go proper into the amazon do it
properly with a shaman and like you know feel feel that mother nature they talk about that feeling of like the earth and
that are connected to the human race it must be a wonderful feeling have you ever done mushrooms i've never done mushrooms now i've never
i've never done drugs so i couldn't really um i've never done anything like that i've never done mushrooms or ayahuasca but i
the more sorry i've just i've just invested almost a million dollars into a psychedelic company that's using it to
kill men's health disorders we talked about this didn't we yeah for the psilocybin so my dad was involved in the trials um the imperial
college london he's involved he was basically um one of the uh not the guinea pigs but yeah he
it was a trial between psilocybin um a placebo and an antidepressant drugs and obviously the the studies come back that
like this can really help and it's a natural it's a natural product from the from the earth so yeah i can see that
growing in the next few years for sure when it when it gets appropriate has it been approved in the u.s for like yes it's impression and stuff um don't
quote me on this but uh it's an it's in the final stage of fda approval psilocybin so it's very very
close and there's a company called compass pathways which has just gone public and is as of right now worth about two billion
which is really dive sort of leading the pack and developing psilocybin but it's crazy that i've not tried it but
i've looked at all the research and development videos and studies and data and it like blow blew my mind are you are you
tempted to try yourself are you scared and nervous about it cause i know the numbers i've been through i've looked at every drug and i've seen
where mushrooms and psilocybin um rank in terms of the harm they could possibly do to you and the harm they can
do to others when you're on them it's below alcohol it's blown like every it's at the bottom it's the bottom thing on the list
yeah it's been shown to really um really help with addiction and depression and trauma from that so
yeah i suppose i wonder what experience about for us who maybe we're not depressed and we're not anxious i wonder what that experience would be like but
yeah you know i listened to a lot of podcasts you know tim ferriss is big on it rogan you know yeah
it's just kind of it feels like this scary thing but it's because it's been going on for thousands of years you know we've kind of tribes and
it's not some dirty chemical drugs been manufactured in the lab i think it it's non-addictive it opens up so what
they say is it opens up like neurological pathways that maybe is all these memories locked did you hear the tim ferriss podcast he said
like he'd done an ayahuasca ceremony or maybe it was psilocybin and he had this vision of trauma that came
through that he completely blocked out really yeah so he got he experienced them child abuse like he
literally didn't remember it and he had this vision and all these memories of being abused and it like completely like
opened up his mind he's now obviously sharing about it but that was like something so it's quite in a way you don't know
what you're unlocking you can unlock really beautiful memories and amazing things like it can also show you like
quite traumatic upsetting things but either way like you can learn from it i think you know what i did this morning is the
the the founder one of the founders of the company a thai um which is leading the charge in
terms of psychedelics they're really developing about 10 different compounds in the space i i said to him i need to get you on
this podcast would you come on and so he's he's um as far as i know he's an incredibly successful biotech guy he's been doing
it for decades and um he's going to come onto the podcast and really talk through all of these things so like ibogaine and psilocybin
and all of that so that would be interesting fascinating i've been listening to that one yes but listen ayahuasca
mushrooms psilocybin if you want to do it then i've been saying to my all these people in this room now
i would say let's go and do a retreat with like a shaman and um they've told me what the best way to do
it is like the best retreat the best shaman the best place i'd love to do something like that yeah i would be up for it i mean it's
it's a real person it's like personal growth like you read a lot of books i'm not well read i wish i had more patience and
more time and well i wish i had more um commitment and discipline to reading but i do i do i'm drawn to it and it always
it almost they say like it will call you like my dad's i've done an eyewash or someone in wales and he said it just calls you like the plant mother
nature like you'll have a calling one day and it'll be like i'm ready at the moment we're just sort of experimenting with the idea of it and
your dad did the psilocybin trial with imperial so what was his feedback to you after he did it yeah i mean it was um
it sometimes takes a little bit longer to integrate you know you have the experience and you know it's in a very controlled room
like it's in a proper like clinical setting so you're like in a hospital room and they're holding your hand and talking through it and i'm not sure the exact dosage but he got
blasted with a decent dose of psilocybin um and yeah you know he saw some things and it unlocked a little bit of
you know trauma and some visual stuff that he saw but again it's just about moving forward it's about it's about taking what you
see and integrating into your life and saying i've had these experiences but how can i be present today how can i enjoy
my life today and you know with depression is i don't think it's going to be cured i don't think you can cure it like that
because of the way the brain works but you're going to learn to deal with it and and spot the signs and kind of counteract it
quicker um but yeah he had a positive experience for sure and he's he's really proud that he took part because he
he genuinely wants to help people like he said if if people can come off chemical antidepressants and be given a
really beautiful natural um you know natural product that can actually help them feel happier and
especially for that post-traumatic stress syndrome disorder like people dealing with some really really harsh stuff and they're getting
blasted with you know antidepressants which are very addictive and it's like morphine isn't it it's like it's not even
it's not even like good for you so they're very addictive as well i don't think you're going to get the same thing yeah the side effects are really really you know crazy um
sometimes i think that opioids i think the opioids yeah antidepress i think opioid i think antidepressants are like opioids
or amphetamines it's one of them it's like it's basically the drug that you know you do not want to be taking in a very small dose but over time it can
real generate real addiction and you see it in america like the prescription drug addiction over there is is really destroying people's lives over
there my next question you would have heard this on the podcast if you've listened to the eddie hearn one uh it's kind of a new question i'm
asking and it's a question i really really love because i think it gives a unique sense of perspective um you're an incredibly busy guy you're
If you were to die today what would you regret
running around at the moment doing this that and the other you know all over the place um if you found out god forbid touch
glass um that this week was your last week for whatever reason god forbid or you walked
out here and you got hit by a truck what what would you regret
having not done or not doing more of i really wish i had like this long list of
bucket things i wish i'd done but i'm i've always even when i was at university like i would
go traveling in my half term my summer holidays i always i've always maximized life to the
at that moment in time you know i've always i've never kind of i've never regretted or like missed out on things i've always
traveled with my friends i've always you know done the things i want so if i had a week left on earth
i wouldn't really regret anything i'd be proud i'm proud of what i've achieved in this short time i'm 35 i feel like i've
i've been good i've done some good things i'd probably bring everyone together and like throw my wedding party again because my wedding day was wicked
like all you know your best friends and all your mate your mates and we had fun fair and we had all the food and we were
dancing and i think i'd try and recreate that if i knew i had seven days i'd get everyone together and say look it's my last week
come down let's have another blowout and have a party um but i wouldn't regret yeah i just really wouldn't i think
it's a shame to live your life like that you know regretting and wishing your child was different wishing you know you you i've and i've got
friends that kind of live in that mindset of always looking back and almost thinking about a moment in time if they just done it differently they
were like life would have been different today but you can't think like that you can't get stuck between the future and the past can you because that's really
really depressing whereas if you actually just think look i've done what i've done even the bad things and the times i
wasn't nice or disrespectful like i learned from it and today i'm a better person for it a lot of people
when you ask them that question they reflect on like a lack of balance in their life they'll say oh god i work too much i didn't see the kids enough and
and those kinds of things that's typically what you hear it's like you know i really wish i spent more time with this person or
or that person i think if i was to answer that question i'd probably feel i'd probably say that i'd say why didn't i spend enough time with my
family i think the reason is because a lot most traditional businesses like if you're a grafter eddie hearn always on the road always
around the world you know footballers again away every weekend they're training their you know traveling about musicians
away from their family and it's hard for like you know stability stability and so they do sacrifice a lot for that fame and
success whereas my fame and success has come through an iphone in my kitchen so i've really even before lockdown i
filmed all my workouts at home so i have a great balance where i can do what i'm doing and be successful but
also leave my phone for two weeks and go away and not not worry about it or i can you know put my phone down like i i spend
quality time my kids every day i'm adamant about that so i do you know breakfast i make them breakfast every day
i have two and a half hours so between like five and 7 30 where i don't have my phone and i do dinner time bath time but story
time like i love it it's like my routine and i know get one set down i can go back to work or you know watch a film
but it's having little moments at just having that structure so that you don't feel like you've missed out and you ask them how their day's been and indy's
favorite thing is like she loves cooking and she loves doing her handwriting so even just running in there and doing 10
minutes with handwriting with her i mean she's two years old and she's doing the alphabet she's she's got like these dots you follow the
dots and just seeing her with a shaky hand to like now a month later she's banging out the a to z and
it's like immaculate that's that's fun it's amazing so i'm not missing out on these moments although
i'm really busy i'm also optimizing my time with them as well if you know i mean when you said that india's really into cooking i thought
she's going to be the next body coach and then i thought oh god i wonder if joe would want her to be on social media oh i don't know i had this
dilemma with rosie you know when i was bringing out my cookbook my weaning 15 book so i got a book deal and i was genuinely enjoying that journey i
Social media
was learning to win indy for the first time i didn't know what to do i was working with a nutritionist and i shared so much you know we got 50
000 pre-orders and i worked hard for them pre-orders because i shared everything you know i shared the dinner i was it was camera
at breakfast it was camera at lunch it was indeed you like that darling do another one of them like so i shared so much in order to have
that success but now i've kind of i've just gone a little i just don't want the phone out during dinner time so
i'm producing less content i'm not producing as much recipe stuff because i want to have that
time just with us and i used to just film every gusto recipe every recipe was on instagram so yeah
i've had to sort of step back a little bit and there's no way you're going to keep your kids on social media it's just whether they're 10 or 15 they're going
to eventually get it but would you like to though if you could there's two buttons in front of you one of them was she won't
join social media until she's 21 and the other one was she'll join at 10. oh 100 no if i have if i could have my life
about social media like i have an unhealthy relationship with it and i you know i watched the social dilemma on netflix and i was like i
cannot believe how addictive we are how these devices are so well designed i would hunt i know
i wish me rosie and and the kids weren't on social media but i know i wouldn't have been the body coach p
which i wouldn't have happened so it's almost this like trade off it's like a trade of business life you want to have the success and
have this amazing life and also reach millions of people the only way you can do that is social media it's not tv it's not radio it's
social media so it has its pros and cons but i i hope that i hope that we kind of
we can somehow learn to control this mental health epidemic that we've got going on with social media and the
narcissism of instagram i just hope that we're trying to go actually you know what that was cool in 2010 and 2020 but maybe now let's be
more humble let's just be kinder and let's like share useful content do you know what i'm trying to say yeah because it could
you know india she's gonna get she's gonna get her phone she's gonna open it on that first day when she's 10 years old
and she's going to see kylie jenner in a bikini on a yacht in a louis
vuitton bikini on a massive yacht looking back at it with her ass looking perfect and perfect
boobs and a perfect face and perfect hair and india's gonna stare down into that phone and think
okay yeah what's my life yeah and it isn't it's that comparative thing and it it happens to me like i follow a lot of
instagram accounts and you know my explore page is basically like motorbikes or it's you know fitness models and it
it's like because i'm in that in that in that kind of atmosphere in that um world and it does you think oh these
guys are in such good shape you know i'm looking a bit skinny i'm a little bit positive like whoever you are you still start to compare yourself oh god
it affects your confidence whether you know it subconsciously or not and you know i wish i was more tanned i wish i was on holiday i wish i had a bit
more muscle with this i wish i wasn't so skinny or i wish i didn't have a little bit of body fat on my tummy this year because you
you're just bombarded with these visual representations so yeah i think that in that effect it almost like you
can't really stop that if you if you're looking at it all the time you can't it's almost like you have to just
unfollow someone's account you said didn't you said like unfollow the accounts that don't serve you yeah and i've started doing that if i get to
one and i go why did i follow that bang unfollowed you know what it is as well so i was when i wrote my i started writing well i
finished my book now but when i started writing the book um people are quite crazy at the time the title's happy sexy millionaire
and in this one chapter i really focus in on comparison and this is a bit of an exclusive and i
go through all of the studies on why we compare ourselves to other people and why we compare our
you know our car to someone else's car and the conclusion i came to is we're not actually gonna ever be able to stop
comparing because our brains are wired that way for survival they like that's how our brain works it's
very very lazy if you show someone three tvs in a shop an expensive one a middle one
and a a cheap one statistically people will pick the middle one because they think
that one's gonna break and it's [ __ ] that's the cheap one and they think the expensive one is maybe two flashes so it's just
if you show them three stakes on the menu statistically people will pick the one below the most expensive yeah you know even i actually when you
come to say that i sort of feel the same like i'll be like no i don't i don't need that you know the wagyu one because
i'm happy with a 20 pound one in the middle whatever yeah you're right it extends across everything if i said to you joe would you rather
um drive 10 minutes to save 10 pounds on a 200 pound jacket or drive 10 minutes to
save 10 pounds on a 20 20-pound jacket people go well i'll draw i'll save the 10 pounds on the temp
on the 10-pound jacket and you go why it's 10 minutes it's going to cost you to drive and you're going to save 10 pounds
but the rain is just assume it's like the very the conclusion yeah what's the summer
because i'd like to know what you're sharing about that the conclusion is that our brains are so so lazy they make such
lazy snap decisions and conclusions because those snap decisions helped us to survive when we
were when we were 10 000 years ago alliance running towards you you can't [ __ ] like right okay is it you've got just like so our brain does
it at super speed and and in the context of social media it's like i loved my nokia phone
yeah until until the new one the iphone comes out right i was the proudest kid in school showing
everyone oh look snake i can do snake on here yeah but then but then the minute that same thing which hasn't changed in value
exists in a world of iphones which is what social media is it's like me looking at kylie jenner immediately
even though i haven't changed in value i am less than your brain tells you i agree i agree with that and i i feel that myself
sometimes when i when i watch that show that the netflix documentary um the social dilemma did say all of the guys that created the
products that created the like buttons all those people said my kids aren't on social media yeah and that's the alarm bell it's like saying
you know it's like um that joke of you know i wouldn't trust an eye surgeon who's wearing glasses like i'm getting
my eyes laid on saturday by the way but they say you know don't you know if that person that created it and that does it
every day is saying to you like get your kids off social media it's not good for their mental health and that is what it is it's not about
it i don't think it kills ambition i think it just really affects people's mental health and their self-esteem sometimes that's
irreversible and you could be like a young teenager that has an eating disorder you know all
through your life or is um is binging or under eating or you know not respecting your body and
that can really stem from like how you feel about yourself right so i i try and use my social media to obviously promote
healthy food and fitness that's a positive part of social media and i think your content is positive i think some of the quotes that you share
like they know like the ten things and all these little sometimes i really want to go bang wow like it's just a nice little
light bulb moment so you're using it for positive and we have to just always focus on that focusing the people that are bringing
the good stuff out of it i think you've probably heard me say before that my the way i use my instagram i genuinely believe has like
saved my life a little bit because i would have before if you scroll down my instagram right now you'll see what i
was like oh picture of a lamborghini picture of a louis vuitton bag and then at some point when i became a
ceo of a company and i felt a sense of responsibility not to be that guy i thought okay so how can i use this i'll post quotes and because i've done
that for the last like i don't know two three years it's meant that when i do have it means
that i don't buy stuff to post it yeah and i if i'm in a helicopter going over sri lanka sat next
to my girlfriend which i was no one will know because i actually don't have a place to put it so i'm now making decisions on your
close friends list i'm so glad i'm on that that's why i get through your nice villains yeah that's
only there's only 100 people on there but like i i don't have a place to put it and so when i'm making the decision
it's not based on social media because i'm not gonna be able to tell really anybody other than like a couple of my close friends my question
though which is kind of attached to that is about money something that a lot of people probably won't talk to you about
now listen it's always uncomfortable it's uncomfortable it's just awkward everyone articles come out like joe buys this much
What roll does money play in your life?
you know this million pound house it's like why is that important but i just know that people are obsessed aren't they ask what
you want to ask and i'll be honest yeah so an unavoidable consequence of success like the thing is the reason why i'm actually not uncomfortable about asking
you this question is because if there's anyone on planet earth on off camera that i know
has the most genuine sincere intentions it is you probably of all the people i've met i'm like i can't think of a guest i've met
who is more sincere about their intentions more oh thank you steven you're all maximum sincerity right so
some people are as well but you're maximum so um i've got no problem asking you this question which is an unavoidable consequence of your success
over the last year previously is money right it's what allows you to have a camera to dp with
joe right of course yeah so this year i mean you've made a lot of money
right like every year um what role does money play in your life just be honest with me
it's a it's that it's that thing of you know it talk we talk about you know freedom of time and like you know owning yeah i've always been
about time and being with friends and family so for me it's like it's removed a lot of stress because when i was a kid i
remember money was a stressor like we you know we had um we we never had food in the house so my
mom would have to go to my nand and we'd have to get like borrowed pints of milk and running next door you know when you're on a council
stay it was quite common you'd go and ask for a pint of milk or a couple of i remember asking like a bag of sugar for our cereal and stuff so i i didn't
have any money growing up and you know i was on school dinners you know i was my mum was on
benefit so it was it was all like iceland two for one buy and get them free it was crap food and that affects
that affects things as well you know the food you're eating but i suppose for me when i started to make money it was a gradual thing i didn't win the
lottery and wake up a million pounds you know i i released my online plan and one person signed up
and then it was 10 and it grew and it was gradual and so it was a nice way of becoming like with my followers it was a
nice gradual thing i didn't just jump off of love island with two million followers and have money thrown at me and i think
that does affect your ego differently and i think anyone that's young that gets thrown into the media with money and
fame it would affect you in a certain way um so it definitely allowed me to have more
freedom and to take care of my family i think i'm not someone who has been successful and left
people behind that would make me seriously unhappy i've helped my brother out i've helped my dad you know i got my mama house
we've done amazing holidays together with all the boys you know they know i'm there if they need me and and that's that's a nice feeling but
yeah the question is around motivation around money as well i feel like as time has gone on i've become less motivated by it and i remember that story said
about you're up here and you could have run down the center and even got 20 grand i have days that too where i think i could go and do another gusto post and
10 000 people might sign up or i could go and film another workout and it could get two million
views and i have and when i feel like that i have to remind myself of like why i do what i do and and that mission thing
about there's someone at the end of that youtube video just waiting for a new workout and they live in scone for when they've got no man in their proper skin
and they're waiting for the workout and i remind myself for that so yeah money money allows it just allows freedom it's
less stress and money was always something we always argue about i think maybe my marriage i'll be honest is easier because we
don't argue about money and maybe your mom and dad used to argue about money like school uniform the new trainers you wanted the school tripped me on this guy
i remember like going on a school trip was really hard for mum and dad we couldn't afford to do the school trip sometimes and
you know they would always work really hard and it would you know sometimes i did sometimes i didn't so i think having a bit more man in the
bank means there's less pressure on you as a person and therefore you can sort of you can go through life a bit
easier but i had to overcome as we talked about kind of earlier i had to overcome that that feeling though like that
[ __ ] if more money isn't gonna have an impact then what the hell are we doing steve like what are we
doing here because you know 16 year old steve told me it was money was the whole game and you get more of it get more happy
it's just like that your happiness goes up with your bank balance your ego inflate because i i can i can imagine when you said about you know
i used to go to like china white and punk and like you know shoot over there and i never had money i
was skint i was a university kid i had like 20 quid in my pocket i'd be in there on a freebie but i imagine if you had man at that
time you'd be the one with the bottles spraying it about and all the lights and all the girls come with the big flares is that what you were like did it
inflate your egos you know spend more money i i and i've got to be as self-aware as i possibly can be here
i um i don't think it's ever had an impact on my perception of myself however i did like i've nev i genuinely
feel the same opinion of myself as i always have since i was
three like i've it's never changed i bet people around you changing like because they knew steve had the dough and you were there
to come over i was rolling into clubs and spending i remember this one club in manchester called neighborhood they had this little star next to my name because
i was like the number one spender and i'd walk in there and get five bottles of dom praying i didn't think i was anything else but i was still doing it
like that's a really important point to make like you you hear about these rich [ __ ] and these like young kids that like
they get all this money then they start treating people like [ __ ] and they change all of my friends say to me you haven't changed at all yeah you just
we're still doing it you just bought you just i suppose you were like the facilitator you just you were the fun how did you exactly brought people together and you
and you could have the fun and i think you know maybe fight a bit more at that time maybe i would have done this because i do i mean my thing now is going to a
nice restaurant so i love going to like zuma or nobu and having a meal my friends i didn't have that kind of
flashy kind of like nightclub vibe but you know at the time the thing is at that time that was what you wanted to do at that time you don't do it now and
i think if you had fun like it's good it's all good but yeah money i've got out my system yeah get out your system
and it's weird because i'd i looked at those people in the clubs and i'd looked at rich people and thought oh god like yeah when i when i become
one of them then i'll be super happy so then you go and do it i went and got this massive packing mansion in the
countryside and i'm sat there like nope yeah spray the bottles for a year and you're getting all the bottles free and you're
like okay nope so when you um when you like when you you exit and you know or even before
that you've been financially secure for a long time has your motivation dropped or increased because i
at the moment i'm feeling quite demotivated but i'm more excited by the legacy and the potential of like
building the body codes to a point that in 20 years time i can look back when i'm a bit older and go i started that i created that company
you know that's still going do you did you find a really good question lost motivation because you're like you know what
i can chill now i ain't got i ain't got the hustle in me anymore it's a really good question and again i've been writing a lot about
motivation lately so i think i've got a pretty good answer to this um you know one of the the best sort of easiest to
answer this question is just referring to my gym routine i think you might have heard on the podcast i said in one of the episodes that every
february march i'm the most motivated person on planet earth to work out and i say to myself i'm gonna get i'm
have a great body for summer and then summer comes i drop the photo on social media summer
ends and i literally can't bring myself to the gym because my motivation my why was anchored to a timeline which is
somewhere in summer and looking good and so the minute i post and everyone likes it it was like i genuinely couldn't get
myself to the gym and i was going like two times a day before and this relates to our motive our other motivations in other parts of our life
like when you lose when you lose the anchor with your y which is what you described after p with joe yeah you've got to [ __ ] find it again
it's like the gold medalist you've got to go and find it again and you've got to re-anchor yourself to something that hopefully doesn't have a short-term timeline against it
gary vaynerchuk says the same thing he says the worst day of my life will be when i buy the jets it's been his yeah that's his thing isn't it it's
forever this is moonshot and you you i didn't hear that before that that term moonshot is nice because it's like joe
so big don't just do something you know you can do in six months do something you think will take you 20 years this is what the conversation we
had right yeah that's what you said and i went home and i was thinking the same as it's nikki i said i love that i love the idea of a
moonshot what's our moonshine he's like well our moonshot is that we build the body coach and we have an exit so that someone comes along and
buys it and it continues to flourish for years to come because otherwise i was the it's like mr motivator smashed
it in the 80s or 90s whatever it was and i would have just been the body coach the mr motor of this time
unless i build it to sell and i build it to sustain itself and grow and continue to help people and that's
really where my heads are now i think i've had a shift in my mentality towards that but i did lose motivation at several parts of my life and it was
always as i described with the 20k and email downstairs it was when i was doing things without
that real intrinsic deep sense why so when before social change started i had no
motivation to do any marketing for anybody or to send emails to anybody and then search chain starts and i'm going to the [ __ ] ukraine at 3am in the
morning i spent what was it i spent 11 of the 12 months last year in hotel rooms happy
driving for this mission of building this company with super key thing with people i loved yeah right because
it didn't have to be social media we had a purpose we had a worthwhile goal
i was working with people i loved towards that worthwhile goal and i felt competent in doing so if you have those three things like competence
a worthwhile goal and you're working with people you love yeah and lastly i'd say a sense of control like autonomy because
a lot of people don't we have that in our lives a lot of people working in factories and other industries don't have that sense of feeling of autonomy over their
time and have you got the hustle now could you like go back and do the eleven months on the roads too no no no i remember used to always being in
the airport always rolling that little wiggly thing around i thought it must be like no matter how much money you're making no matter how much money
and how much you're building there must be an element of loneliness and that exhaustion where you think i just need to be like settled in one place and now you're
in london think you're sticking about are you gonna hit the road again um great question and it's something i've reflected on if you told me now
to fly to the ukraine and do a talk i'd be like [ __ ] off i've said this to my assistant i can't
understand where it where the motivation came from and it's because i've lost it i've lost the anchor i've quit social
change so when i re even with this mindset i think go to the [ __ ] ukraine and do a talk at 9am
to a bunch of people for an hour [ __ ] off yeah he lost it i've lost it
because because i've quit so my anchor's gone and i can't even get myself back into the mindset however i will get my anchor back at
some point yeah and i'll find something else that and i'm not trying to find it at the moment yeah just it's nice to slow things i
think the lockdowns helped us just think we don't need to be on this hamster all the time like it's alright a
few months of the year like you said you know nothing in nature blooms all around like you can have a couple of quiet months because you know you know your event didn't happen i
really wanted to be at that event in manchester but i'm hoping that happening i i need to come back it's gonna be huge
yeah i know i mean like you showed me the music i got me and nicki got mad like goosebumps just listen to the music you're gonna play
um but yeah you've got loads of heady i think it's important to just have these months where you go i'm not everywhere at the moment but i
know in six months i've got this great project and there's your moment to bloom and that's kind of where my head's at now rather than like come on what should we do now let's do
another this let's let's do more of this i'm like it's okay to be not busy and not be successful for a few months
and to create a void in your life that's what my mentor said to me he's one i think he was one of the first investor ever in spotify he
said steve i met him after i resigned and he said steve listen it's so tempting to just sort of grab the bull again and just go and run and
run and run and run he said but the reason you were successful before is because you were really hungry yeah so he said create a void in your
life resist the temptations just to run back into something and just let it be the concept that's probably
not easy for me to understand like just the i'm getting it now though i'm getting it now because i like i said i've always had like
two books a year i've had a dvd out i've had merchandise pots and pans you know
protein stuff i've always had something but actually now i know i need to just chill out and take some time off because
i can't i don't want to be hammer i don't want to be selling stuff to some people all the time i want to just be get back to my free
content what i'm good at what i start you know the organic stuff that i generally started doing in the beginning because that's when i'm
happiest when i'm getting millions of views on my youtube channel i love that i love that people are actually like doing those workouts it's 15 minutes of
my time but it's helping someone really transform their day and so i'll continue to um you know push that mission which is to
get people moving and if it's within this one person a day like it's enough sometimes i just reflected them when you said that
i think of one of the conversations we had in that restaurant which was you were saying you know i've done the pbj and what's next and i'm saying i was i
remember saying she's like joe this is a false peak because like did i say this yeah i said i don't think i'm going to achieve
anything in my life that's going to have more impact because there may never be another lockdown and there may never be like 80 million
people in their living room doing my workouts again but you were like joe don't be silly there's something else there's something that has to be like
if you don't you're going to lose it you can lose motivation so yeah you said the thing about the moon shot like imagine eradicating
you know whatever it may be like going for that real like still steve steve jobs or bill gates like
vision of like changing the world it's exciting it might never happen but at least have a crack but you have that you this is why i refer to it as a false
peak because mountaineers when they're climbing they look up the mountain and they see these peaks and it because of the perspective when you're
climbing a mountain it looks like the top and they stop and they go oh [ __ ] that
was but it's a false peak and i think for you this is going to be a false peak because now you have more power than you've ever
had so you have this i in my view again no not telling you live your life you have a responsibility to you're a
[ __ ] mbe you know everyone knows your name now and you've got the power to do things on a global level that even
i'm not sure yet you realize you're capable of doing and i think when you realize what you're capable of then um
you're gonna find a why because listen you you can't waste the power you've got you just simply can't and there's a lot
of pain out there there's a lot of people getting fat there's a lot of people not eating right and they need someone that has your power it's like
it's like you know life is giving you this this responsibility and gone joe listen we need you and i think that's i mean that's enough to get our bed for
every day that is the goal mate and it's so lovely to hear you say that and i do believe that we have a purpose and we have
we have an energy inside us and i bumped into this guy once on the street in london and he was really i think he was a shaman of some
sort and he he he basically put his hand on my shoulder he does my workouts and he's like there's something about you like you've
got an energy there's something pushing you forward isn't there like it's more than views and fame and numbers that there's something inside
yeah like there is it's this energy that is constantly like just go and film the work i know you're tired but do it and
it's that that's that thing of giving i i'm my happiest i'm giving and sharing and the minute i stop that
even if i sell the body coach you know i know that that moment will come where i feel like you know i still need to be
doing what i'm good at and still needs to be reconnecting and that is my energy that's that and i didn't have that i was really lost and
confused until 25. i came back from this trip to america i started to become a personal trainer
and it was like i just knew in that moment this is what i was going to do and i've just put all my energy and love into it since so yeah let's see what we
can do in 2021. thank you so much for your time joe it's been an absolute pleasure and i'm super excited to bring you back on for a third
time once you've conquered the world and we'll be like we were sat here and you said this and then
and uh it's been a pleasure man and i really do enjoy your podcast i take little nuggets from it i think you're always sharing a positive message so
keep doing it um it's good to see that you're growing and building and i am i hope this episode does really well for you
thank you i appreciate you all good luck thank you for sharing all of your wisdom and learnings i'm continuing to be
inspired by you i can't wait to see what you achieve in the next few years now go and get your moonshot can build a rocket

Intro
this week on the diver ceo we have a returning guest jake humphreys he is an entrepreneur he
is a tv presenter he's also now a podcaster and jake has spent the last
year on his podcast sitting down with some of the most high performance people some of the most accomplished
people in their industries from acting to business to sports you name it and so because of that experience
because of all the insights he's gained over the last year since we last spoke i wanted to sit down with him and
compare notes we have a lot of high performance people on this podcast too i wanted to understand the similarities
i wanted to pick into the minds of some of the guests and what he's learned from them how are they the same what makes them
different and that's what we're going to talk about today so without further ado i'm stephen bartlett and this is the
dire of a ceo i hope nobody's listening but if you are then please keep this to yourself
What are the key lessons you've learnt in the last year
you've um you've had what 30 people on your podcast today you've got
a lot more coming up one of the key questions that i that i wanted to ask you because it's you know
something that i asked myself is what are those like key lessons that you've learned you've interviewed
you know high performance athletes actors authors um and really sort of high
performance people from all industries what are the key lessons and the themes i think there is one key lesson that was
summed up for me by matthew mcconaughey the oscar-winning actor who came on my pod recently and his phrase is don't leave
crumbs and what he means by that is like when you're making a decision
don't leave stuff behind don't make a bad decision now that later on you've got to go back and pick that crumb up and be regretful about it and
that's brilliant because sometimes when we talk on the podcast we talk about really like big
blue sky thinking you know like we've talked to you about social change setting up social change sometimes to people that are listening and that can
seem like unreal almost untouchable because it's this huge multi-million dollar business that
you've created but actually don't leave crumbs is about making the decisions for a big
big business like that and creating something amazing but also like make sure that you don't have an extra
drink and even in case it leaves you with a hangover tomorrow and you've got work to do or make sure you simply choose your clothes the night
before so you're not doing it in a rush and like i still leave crumbs all the time like i'll tell you when we uh when we
interviewed matthew like he's the first hollywood actor we've had on the pod so for me it was quite a big moment
and i thought i really want to be looking good for this so i thought i'd have a shower and a shave before we do the interview and i was having a shave in the bathroom
my wife was in the bath and she was going to come down and like listen in the corner in my study because she was like she loves dallas buyers club she was
excited and uh she starts having a shave and she goes it's 9 54.
i was like and i thought it was like 9 30 or something we put the kids to bed and then the next thing i'm running
downstairs i haven't done my hair properly i'm on i've got two wi-fi zone because our upload speed living in the
countryside is horrendous so i was then on the wrong wi-fi i then looked for the script i'd written for the questions for matthew couldn't find
them and i was like i was the last one in i'm getting beaten to the interview on my own podcast
by a hollywood actor and i left crumbs and now that's a good lesson for me because i do it all the
time and i think that you only learn about the crumbs you leave by doing it and i just i just really want people i've had a few
negative comments that have come my way about the podcast direct messages from people saying um
you're getting this all wrong we're in a global pandemic i'm having a really hard year and here you are with a podcast that's
just celebrating success all the time and showing up how um how we're all doing badly compared to your great guests
and for me the podcast is a that hurts me to think that because i don't want anyone to come to
the high performance podcast and leave in that way but it's the absolute total opposite of that because when we talk about what
lessons can you learn from people on the podcast the other biggest one is they mess up all the time i think
i genuinely believe successful people make more mistakes than anybody else because they're constantly challenging themselves to do
stuff and you you're no stranger to making decisions that at the time you just simply don't know
but you have to find a way of making that decision um and i'm sure there are times when you've made 10 or 15
life-changing decisions in a week you know the the the point about those crumbs and you know rushing down the stairs
when you realize that you were like what could you have done in hindsight to um to prevent those crumbs being left
behind per se i just need to be really honest with myself that i have weaknesses and i need to address them rather than thinking that everything's
fine and i am notoriously late i am always a few minutes late and always my new year's
resolution is this is the year that i'm not going to be late is but it just i'm surprised you know that you're
late because um the industry you work in i know it's very and look at all the guests
i've had on my podcast we had um sir clive woodward who won the rugby world cup and you think of all of the discipline
and the rules and the mindsets you need to win a rugby world cup the number one thing that stands out for him is something
called lombardi time which was created by the players and they lombardi obviously is a famous
name in american sports and they call it lombardi time because it's a name that sort of resonates with winning and it was 10 minutes early
so if you say to any former england rugby player what's lombardi time they'll tell you 10 minutes early so listen i'm hearing this stuff steven on a
weekly basis and still not getting it right and i think it just goes to show that we are human we have
we are fallible and i do think we have blind spots which there are some things some people find really hard i don't there are some
things that is not an issue for other people and it is a recurring problem for me to deal with
but no one's perfect and how do you emotionally feel about the fact that you have blind spots
in terms of like do you beat yourself up about it yeah yeah i think so
yeah um i think it's a really common phrase isn't it to hear that you're your
own biggest critic i think i'm probably less my own biggest critic
than i was previously like when i first started in my presenting career and i used to come off air on the
formula one i would solely focus on the bad stuff on the issues on the problems and that
was instilled in me by david coulthard because he'd step straight out of a formula one car straight into broadcasting and
tv is a friendly and lovely place to be most of the time you know we're really good at telling each other how great we are and we had
our first production meeting just after the first race and i was just grateful to get through it it was my
first ever bit of live formula one so i was just glad to have survived so i was ready for this lovely you were great you were great you
were great this was great we started the meeting and david coulthard went well sorry
can we just stop and that this is unheard of he goes i'm just not interested in this and the
producer was like sorry i don't understand he's like i'm not interested in sitting here and going through all the good stuff
how does going through the good stuff make the boat go faster why are we not talking about the bad stuff and that was a revelation from me
i was like yes the good stuff's already good so you focus on the good stuff now i have a different mindset and
bearing in mind my first race was 2009 so this is 11 years ago and for a long time my focus was on
the stuff that i was struggling with or the stuff i wasn't very good at or the times where i didn't feel life
was very good so i would look at a bad month or a bad year and go right why was i not flowing why was i not
really in a happy place why was this why don't we focus more on the good
stuff and that is my mindset change that is the thing that i for 2021 that is going to be my focus
let's focus on the good stuff so we realize what the good stuff is just do more of it let's focus on the times when you were flowing and when you were
feeling great when you were barreling around the place and when you were the guy and when everyone wanted to work with you what was i doing what was i eating how
was i sleeping who was i spending my time with what was feeding me what was making me feel
fantastic that's probably a better place to focus on i particularly after the sort of crap
2020 we've all had i feel we've become a nation maybe even
Your experience with failure and anxiety
a planet with this light obsession on failure to not fail anymore to be good and it's
almost like a badge of honor isn't it like i'm sure if you said to me three or four months ago how's your relationship with failure my
love failure love faith bring failure on that's how i learn failures where i grow i need to be on the absolute edge so i'm
failing all the time i want to fail forwards and i want to fail often like i still do but when i fail when i
leave crumbs when i'm late for an interview with matthew mcconaughey i'm not thinking why did that happen
because then i'm focusing on the failure i will allow it to be there and i will do my best not to do it again
but i'm gonna try for 2021 to think about the good stuff man and just to see how that changes things for me
super interesting you know do you focus on your failure um i i don't focus on the failure i
think i was just i was actually asking myself that question when you were talking i was thinking do i am i someone that dwells on failure to
be fair i don't i'm very very good at being detached from it all i think i talked earlier in this podcast about
this like um video game mentality that i've taken on my life where
i see my my worst days and to be honest a lot of them no i
think it's just my worst days as if i'm playing a video game and that i am
i am not what's happening and it's and i i think that detachment from what's happening
has allowed me in my most chaotic moments to remain calm it's allowed me to form a
sort of calm within my chaos so if i have a big failure or i really really [ __ ] up and i'm i'm disappointed
with myself or whatever i'm very good at detaching from that um so i think i think the absolute
absolute ownership of what you're doing for me is powerful which is is that the total opposite of what
you're saying because like whatever i do i have to absolutely believe it and own that decision because then if it goes
wrong or people question it i can say listen i really thought it was the right thing it's like the emotional detachment it
means that i'm not i don't think that i'm going to die although i am totally responsible for changing it so i can think of i'm
thinking specifically about the day where um i was driving to work get get the emails and the text messages
saying that our whole server's been hacked and every client we have has been sent really really personal specific abuse by them
from our email server that's come from my business partner's email that looks like it was meant to be sent to my assistant
but the client was just accidentally ccd and this happened this happened about four years ago five years ago
so i'm driving to work and i'm getting all these and in that moment one has a choice whether they want to
fall into the problem and become the problem and become consumed by it or if they want to hold it out in front
of them and deal with it there yeah if it consumes me i'll be crippled with anxiety crying in the corner
but if i can hold it out in front of me and realize that this isn't gonna kill me this isn't gonna end me
yeah this isn't you know but this is something that i have to deal with out in front of me then it becomes much more um possible to
be rational and to think in terms of probabilities and i've come to learn especially over the last year or two
that when you can um make your decisions based on probabilities of the outcome you can make really really good decisions yeah um
you know i was thinking a good example of that is actually um a friend of mine yesterday texts me and
he said to me that it's interesting he said to me that
at his marketing agency his clients passwords have maybe been
exposed to one outside individual so there's one guy another company that might have seen all of his clients
passwords and he said steve i'm going to call all of my clients now and tell them that all of their passwords have been exposed
so i said let's go through the probabilities here if you lined up a hundred people like the guy that might have seen these
passwords how many of them would do something malicious with that information we both agreed it was probably less than one percent
of like reputable people that would take a bunch of passwords and do something malicious so i said okay so one person out of 100
or less so your probability of harm is less than one percent um what's the probability of harm if you
call all of your clients and tell them that all of their passwords have been leaked probably greater than one percent
yeah so let's think about ways we can get that less than one percent down to like zero so i said
email all your clients and tell them you've done a security review and that um you you highly recommend they all turn on two-factor
authentication today and that means the probability of harm goes from less than one percent to zero
and but he was like in the in the emotional mindset he was just like i'm going to call them all yeah apologize because you probably felt a duty of care
but if you do the two-step authentication i suppose you're still it's like you zero yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah music to zero percent
it's a duty you're balancing their duty of care and you know how do i remove harm from my clients but also
remove harm from my business but he was so emotional when he called me that he wasn't thinking rationally yeah
and that's why holding it out in front of you allows you to think in terms of rational employment perspective that perspective is so
important to have like i've always had like this irrational fear of imminent disaster
so when i was a kid i used to come in from school my mom would go and walk the dog and she might be 15 or 20 minutes most kids would just watch cartoons
i would be like out the window after 10 minutes singing where's my mom where's my mom and then these little voices come in my head all maybe
something really bad's happened to her maybe she's like slipped over and banged her head and or maybe she's lying in a field right i
might have to go and find one my mum is and then she reappears i'm like oh thank goodness even now with my kids if i'm out someone
they go around the corner i don't just think to myself i'll walk around the corner and my kids will be there until i can see my kids again and there
might be parents listening to this that relate the worst possible things that could happen to one's children is a
is happening to my kids until i can see them so i find myself like speeding up or saying to my friends yeah hey let's go and sit over here so we can keep
just literally so i can keep an eye on the kids and then i'm a little bit of a hypochondriac so i fear that and then
when my phone goes and or someone sends me a message going hey jake can we have a chat later like it could be someone from
whisper or it could be someone from bt sport or someone about the pod i don't go yeah yeah cool i'll call you later i'm like oh what could that be
my brain goes to worst case scenario and i found myself really quickly going so it's got a really important call to make
my heart's racing 10 to the dozen and then as soon as i if i find out what it is i'm like oh
thank goodness where does this come from i don't know because there is no skeleton in the closet like a friend rang me the other
day and the message that you gave me was he's separating from his wife which is massively sad but he rang me
and said listen i'm really sorry to call you with this um quite awkward news i'm immediately thinking oh my goodness right
what on earth can this be but in my head it's gonna end everything it's gonna cost me my marriage my kids
my job my house isn't that ridiculous but i now have the perspective that i know
this is how i am i've had this since i was like 11 or 12 years old i know this is how i'm made so that is a
really powerful thing for me because i then think when i feel this feeling beginning like when my kids go around the corner i now
say to myself listen your kids are going to be fine playing the other side of a tree
you know yourself well enough to know that this is just a rational anxiety it's your brain and it's just playing a trick on you
that's all this is you talk a lot about responsibility yeah um there you just said this is how i'm made yeah
that sounds like giving up responsibility yeah yeah so now i think i'm taking i yes you're
right you are totally right but then i feel like i'm taking the resp i'm slowly still learning even at 42.
i'm taking the responsibility back by saying right i'm not going to allow myself to get anxious about that because i know what i'm like if i'm the
most chilled out person in the world and i find a reason to be anxious maybe i should be worried about that i'm going to tell them about the lift
jake so we're on the fourth floor here and uh jake jake came up uh
knocked on the door looking pretty sweaty and said uh i just took breath he said i just took the stairs because i
opened the lift and i didn't trust it this lift there's never been any problems with it if you look at the stats around deaths in lifts or things
you and me are not hanging out today that seems somewhat connected to what you're saying yeah i think you're probably right yeah
maybe i should have taken the lift because i know that everything will be fine in the lift and i should know that i'm a bit claustrophobic but
i think it just goes to show that again and you've spoken about this so powerfully over the years on your podcast is that from the outside world
you look at someone like me and think wow a couple of kids few businesses great house nice broadcasting career
what a lovely carefree life he must live every day man is riddled with little anxieties and little worries
um a few years ago probably almost to the point of derailing as we've discussed on your previous
podcast with me but now knowing myself knowing yourself is so powerful because
only then like can you love yourself you think that's also somewhat linked that you said earlier on about that comment you
read where people are like jake you know you shouldn't be doing a podca happy podcasting sad times basically
yeah the fact that you remembered that and you referred to it as hurting you seems also somewhat correlated to this
yeah i think i don't know i think it's a i think it's a it's a fair point
i find that a harder thing to get i find external criticism is a harder thing for me to deal with i
find that more i find that a more difficult um thing to own in my head why
um i think because probably human beings just want people to like what we're doing i mean i find it confusing as well
because i think if you're being offended by my high performance podcast like
wow that that shows the level of offence that some people can take because i really want i honestly
want it to just be a holy positive experience from the moment that someone clicks subscribe or starts listening to
the pod to the minute they leave i just i just want people to be happier to get
takeaways to live a more empowered life to go and be successful i honestly believe it like
it comes you've got thousands and thousands and thousands of reviews on your podcast yeah it's rated five stars
people pour their heart out telling you how much they love it how much value it brings and we're talking about this one guy i'm
a human i suppose am i i think you slightly over index a little bit in terms of caring about this stuff though
and i i actually you know when people asked you know what you're like after meeting you i said he's just such a nice
guy such a good guy and you are such a good guy and it it's
maybe that is part of i don't know is that somewhat connected to your i think so don't you think that
don't you think the two are completely connected though that if i wasn't the kind of guy that genuinely wanted people to
you know be in a better place i wouldn't give a [ __ ] whether someone said my podcast was useless i'd be like well i don't care anything i'm just doing it to
make some money for me that podcast and i will openly say this i've not made a penny from
creating and operating for an entire year and we talk all the time that this is about the outcome not the income
and and i think the reason why it has been successful is that whether it's me or whether it's
damien or whether it's the guys that help us to film and edit the podcast together all of us totally believe and buy into
what we're doing like i genuinely think that it is what people need to hear
because it is empowering people and do great things who have been you know a lot of my friends messaged me
after you had johnny wilkinson yeah and they said that was [ __ ] weird it was deep wasn't it i had to listen to
that back five times and i did the interview you know what was the remark i haven't heard it what was the surprising
so the the bravery really from from someone who won a rugby world cup as a certain
person and now is a completely different person i mean i can give you like a sort of salacious headline like he told us that
winning the rugby world cup is no more important than doing the washing up and the the way that he squares that off in his
mind is he says what are you doing if you're playing rugby moving your body to achieve a goal what you're doing if you're doing the washing
up moving your body to achieve a goal and if i make winning the rugby world cup more important or to hold more value
than doing the washing up and i'm no longer a rugby player what am i less valuable because i'm no longer doing the thing that was more important
that was the that is the sort of sentence that he was sharing with us which i think is
brilliant and brave and i can relate to it and i and i can understand it um
[Music] but i think that for me the sort of the real the real
revelation that came out of the johnny wilkinson episode and what i really want people to understand if they listen to it
is that when you strip everything back he is someone who has
totally changed from where he was when he was conquering the world because when he was conquering the world as a rugby player
he thought he had to stress and struggle and sacrifice and fail and now he realizes that
stressing and struggling and sacrificing and failing leads to
more stress and struggle and sacrifice and fail and actually one of the amazing things
he said he said when i released a book after winning the rugby world cup i wouldn't be surprised if there wasn't a spike in mental health
cases from people that read that book because the book was saying you've got a struggle you've got a struggle you've got to you've got to
really struggle in life to be successful and i think that that is something that i
when we first started the high performance podcast i loved it when people spoke to me about
the battle and the struggle and the strife and the sacrifice and the late nights and the early starts
because i wanted people at home to go yeah man i'm gonna work harder i'm gonna commit more i'm gonna
sacrifice more now i think that is so so so wrong that
is the total antithesis of what i now the message i now want my podcast to give to people
it's tough isn't it because it's hard to find someone who's been really successful at the very top of
their game whether it's business or sport hasn't done that yeah so i've contended with this i've like contended mentally
with this idea as well well again when i started putting content out there especially when i was really young like 18
i was bragging about how late i was staying up i was like look at me at 4 a.m and i'm still working
and i was doing that because i was trying to portray an image that i was i don't know a superhuman or something and my content
followed that theme and then i got to the point where i probably flipped the other way because of public pressure and people's and the
the world now thinks that if you go on the high performance podcast and say hard work really really matters you will
take an l you are an [ __ ] for saying that because you're going to make people depressed and anxious and you're a hustle porn star
and then i got to another place which is if it's the truth it's the truth and i'm comfortable with
the truth and so there's so many levels of nuance it's like the most successful people you'll
encounter at the very top of their industries worked like hell to get there yeah yeah
yeah it's you know will smith you know circlive woodward or um any anyone in it
that's a very consistent theme elon musk right but it but what i've come to do over the
years is detach that from happiness first and foremost because it doesn't necessarily mean they're happier
and then also redefine what success is because success can be being a great parent yeah or is
it to you then i it has to be happiness i feel like yeah that's my answer yeah
that has to be because you can still have the hard work and you can still have the
sacrifice but you don't have the struggle that's the that is the mistake i made i thought the struggle was part of the hard work
and it was part of the early starts and the late finishes and it was part of sacrificing some things that's what i thought the high
performance podcast was about but it isn't you're totally right it's about happiness and you can still get up at five like i probably take too
much on and i probably get up early than i need to and i go to bed later than i need to
but i am so happy and that's what it has to be and it can't be happiness at the
detriment of others happiness yeah it has to be being happy content with yourself and spreading that happiness and that again
is something that johnny wilkinson spoke about which for me has been one of the biggest revelations being absolutely present
absolutely totally present so when i'm here with you my phone is down on the floor and it's
actually on silent but it should be off because i need to be totally present with you right now because what's happened is gone what's
yet to happen which is me going off to do a game at bt sport is a story i can write that in my head if i like but i'm probably going to get
it wrong because it hasn't happened yet exactly the way the day's going to go so i need to like look you in the eye right now and i can now promise you that
on this podcast i am absolutely here with you and it might be in half an hour i leave but
that's cool because when then we're done and i'm then traveling and then i'm totally present and i'm
into that that is a really important thing that has again been a mindset change for
me on the high performance podcast and maybe now i sit and talk to you maybe this whole thing is like a totally selfish
exercise for me because i must have said four or five times that this podcast has rewritten the way that i see the world
and the way that i operate and i think maybe maybe i want this podcast to be messages to my kids like i talk
already about my anxiety probably another of my anxieties is how much longer am i going to be on the earth you never know what's around the
corner i love the fact that if it all ended for me as a walk out onto shoreditch high street today and a car comes along
what can my wife say to my kids that oh i don't know my dad very well listen to these 25 episodes listen to these 30
episodes of the high performance podcast there's your dad that's him you walk out here today then
What would you regret if you were to die today
yeah touch glass um and bus comes boom yeah it's over what are the things you
you in you would regret not having done more of uh traveling with the kids probably but
they're only little they're only young it's such a hard question for me because
i think i think probably um maintaining relationships with people has always been an issue for me
because i i failed my a-levels as you know at school so all my mates went off to uni so that was kind of lost because
they went off having fun and i redid them and then i've always found that one of the issues
with trying to really be present is that you're totally present in that part of your world at that moment and so i was then totally plugged into
life on children's bbc and then i got this amazing opportunity at formula one and i was totally plugged
into my life in formula one and then i got you know a big opportunity at bt sport and i had to
make that work so then i was totally plugged into my new producers and my my new colleagues and you know i
had a conversation with someone the other day and they said you know like who you who are your real friends
it's a hard question that for me once i moved beyond my wife because i've got four or five mates who
i'm close with but they're i would probably name people that live on my street well i've
only lived there for four years i might name a couple of parents on the school run my kids have only gone to that school for four years
i'd name a couple of people i've run my production company whisper with but that's only been going less than a
decade i'd now probably class damian hughes and i do the high performance podcast with
well i've done that for less than a year but i'm in this and maybe that is
possibly the only regret i think but maybe i don't need i don't know maybe we don't need to hold
on to people for too long maybe we have to accept that people come and go from our lives and that's okay
and do you think it's because you you haven't sort of perhaps you said like you haven't prioritized investing in those relationships as much
i think it's because i'm always too invested in the thing that i'm doing at that moment
like i am so absolutely committed to whisper coral eyewear the high
performance podcast bt sport my kids my wife and my family
there isn't an awful lot left right i guess the question the better question to ask would be then but you're are you happy
because that if that is the ultimate goal then you know society will tell you to live have loads of friends and do this
and have this car and whatever but then the question the most important is be happy happiest i've ever been
i've been the happiest i've ever been yeah so you've got to be doing something right right yeah i think yeah i mean i i love what i do
like i really like work i like getting up early i like having five or six things on the
burn all the time i like having a whole page of jobs that i'm gonna do other people are not like that my wife
is the opposite she's got four or five jobs she's like oh man i feel so stressed i got i don't want all this stuff whereas
sometimes i sit there and i'm not making a list of big things on the horizon and i'm i need
to have a lot of them and again maybe i give a c to everything and i'd be better to have fewer things and give them more than an
a matthew mcconaughey tells a great story about cutting off two of his big businesses because he was giving a b
to five things and he wanted to be an a in three things the guests you've had on
Are successful people happy?
your podcast all these wonderful people you've met do you sometimes get the impression that some of them aren't
that happy yes yeah um it's one of the things i've
learned from doing this as well yeah it's really interesting and and i totally get that everyone is
everyone is in it for different reasons aren't they like we spoke to sean wayne who and i
would say you know sean wayne is not a household name he's one of the most successful rugby league managers in the uk
but if someone wanted to get into the high performance podcast and they wanted like a first podcast to listen to
don't just go for the big names i'm telling you now sean wayne gave us the most moving and
revelatory interview and he in his sort of broad northern accent
he said you don't i'm not bothered about being happy he said i'm not not happy i don't care about happy and that
was not you know happiness was not his thing he's con as soon as he achieved something within moments it's about the next thing
and we sort of broke it down that he was very badly abused by his dad as a kid you know physically punched in the face by a big man often
and that his entire life his entire energy comes from wanting to redress the
balance and he's now a rugby league coach the the england rugby league coach because he
he has this deep-seated desire to make the lives of other people better now he might personally never be happy
after the story that and the path that he's been through but he's definitely making other people
happy and he is also totally comfortable with not being happy
now that's not everyone's story that's his story um but i certainly think that
we like in the past we've thought that success and happiness are mutually exclusive what do you want to be here
and be successful you can be happy how wrong are we to think like that the
very flame of success should be happiness
that should be the absolute nub the crux of everything what's the point otherwise man what is the point i i get that a lot
with guests that i've had on they seem to some guests seem to be very neurotically obsessed with
the next thing and the next thing and the next thing in the next thing and when you ask them to pause and reflect on hey when this ends or
um or why they're doing it it always seems to flick back to their childhood eddie ham was the was the same um i know
he's been on yours he was on mine last week and he uh when i was talking to him about his aspirations for the future
with matroom he says i want to sell for five billion and we'll do this and we're gonna there and i said why do you wanna sell for five billion you're happy now he goes
he goes well you know we should be doing we could we should be selling five billion that's why i want to do it but why does that matter and he goes and
he goes back to his dad when he's younger he goes back to the fact that his dad used to criticize him and didn't give him praise and it's
and it's weird that those early moments have driven so and it's the same with me
to be honest they drove this like obsessive desire to just keep climbing a never-ending mountain
and that's the trend that i've seen in very successful guests and very successful people is often some kind of
it's a strange thing to say but something that went not to plan yeah when they're younger seems to be
the reason that we all adore them admire them it's something that had hit them in their emotions or their wiring that
sent them into an obsessive state in in never as good as you think it would be though you know when you get
when you achieve those things that you want to achieve like the the biggest thrill i've ever had was
when i spent 9 750 pounds on a green mgf it's my first ever car
i could still remember the number plate njn and i looked at that car i bought it from an elderly gentleman in
colchester and i went to his house and i said i've got a banker's draft and i was working on children's bbc
he took me out to his garage and you know those old like um fluorescent light strips they flicker
come on i remember it's still on my head as vivid as the day it happened the light flicking and just lighting the car up for a
second and then it goes and i looked at it and i was like i cannot believe now fast forward to
where i am now you know a successful tv presenter invested in coral eyewear run a podcast
um have two beautiful children um who have a production company the kids
and my personal relationships are aside from this because that is that is on a deeper level than anything else but in terms of material successes
nothing and i mean nothing man nothing has come close to spending less than 10 grand
on a green mgf so you've got to enjoy the journey you've got to enjoy the travel because a
it's not as good when you get there as you think it will be b you spend an awful lot more time getting
there than arriving like you have to answer this totally honestly
you have you've totally left social change now yeah with money in the bank yeah that you
wouldn't have had if you hadn't walked away from that business right yeah what is more thrilling to you to
look at your bank account now and see the number in the bank account or to know the journey you went on the social chain
oh yeah of course i mean the bank could be double triple quadruple
ten times it wouldn't matter now if i said to you if i came to you in manchester when you went to nab frozen pizza just to feed yourself and i
said listen dude you can either absolutely work your nuts off for the next 10 years
like build a business hang out with people develop some good relationships or i'll just bang 100 mill in your bank
account today there you go yeah and now here you are you've got 100 mil and the thrill came from
the journey there's something like i'm always conscious of my own like hindsight bias
because it seems to be the case that every broke person um goes on the journey to
get rich you know that ends up being successful they get the money they go it doesn't matter but it's a wonderful thing to say when you have you right like
part of the reason it doesn't matter is because there's so much of it now it really mattered when i was stealing those pizzas right and when i was like
going behind the sofas in this pub looking for the pound coins and i found 13 pound coins so i went back the next day and like it really really mattered in fact
it was all that mattered you know in that moment so i'm super conscious of that bias that we have because
um and you should be by the way and we we are the same on high performance when i say or you
know you need to have the bad times to appreciate the good times and um the the the traumas and the difficult
things will will equip you for the rest of your life i honestly know that there are people that would
listen and go hold on a minute middle class white guy from a lovely village in
norfolk yeah you've had a few issues with mental health and bullying and that as you know the death of my
grandma which was quite tragic and things like that you haven't really struggled yeah so then i think it's
important that we uh we've done an interview that we haven't put out yet for the podcast with ceo khaleesi
first ever black spring box captain and he tells us a story in the podcast about not being able
to sleep at night because his stomach hurts so much because he was so hungry so his grandmother gave him sugar water just to get him to
school so he could have a day at school and she died in his arms at eight years old when he sits on the podcast
and says he will go through some really dark and difficult horrendous times you know he grew up
in the most deepest poverty you could imagine in south africa when he sits there and goes
you can get through it and you can use it as a flame and a fire that is i think when you listen um
Burnout in the world of successful people
it's um i i have to say i also completely agree that uh you know the things that have mattered
most to me professionally especially as i reflect have been doing as you say doing work i love but then like doing it with people i love
um and a mission that's worthwhile and there's just always people talk about this topic of burnout a lot um
and i tend to believe and i'd like to get your opinion on this i tend to believe that your burnout is somewhat inevitable if
you're doing things that you don't intrinsically love doing especially if you're doing it with people you don't
you know really really love as well and i feel like in any facet of your life if you're doing it too much you don't enjoy it the outcome
is burn out um but is burn out a topic that's been sort of prevalent on your podcast no you know it
i suppose partly the reason why burnout hasn't come up very often is because we're talking to people who are in the midst
of their successes or who have been successful and they love what they're doing and they love what they're doing they're full of passion whereas
people who have perhaps tried to do something that wasn't quite right and have suffered burnout and it hasn't worked
we we don't know about them because the burnout ended the dream but it's so funny that's such a good point
that the fact that your pod you haven't had that come up as a topic on a podcast that speaks to people who have clearly been intrinsically
driven by their passion to the very top of their game passion is everything you know you say you spoke to eddie hearn what's his
what's his podcast no passion no point i mean he is a great advocate of finding something that you believe in
but i also get that again you had a real passion for what you do like i honestly
like i have a such a deep love and a passion for all the things that i'm involved in because if i didn't
then i wouldn't do them or i'd try and find something else but there were times in my life where i've done certain things like i don't
as a tv presenter you often get asked to do like corporates you know standing up at awards and things like that and you
you need to welcome people on stage and shake your hands have a photo and i i find them a real struggle i don't know
why i just don't get a thrill out of doing those things so that's a good thing for me because i
i've noticed that's something i don't like and that for people that are listening to this thinking you know what what's my passion like what am i one of
one of the really good ways of finding you is to look at all the things that is not you
who are the people that don't make you feel good what are the days when you feel drained and exhausted what are the the
trips or the phone calls or the conversations or the lunches where you leave thinking every time i see that person i feel like
this if you can see the see the stuff that isn't good for you and strip that stuff away you will
eventually and it might take a while be left with who you are and that's the time to really then think right
what am i about what am i as a person because i don't think you you can obviously get
tired and you can be in and you can have problems but i think with real passion i don't think you suffer burnout
because every day i seem to get this like so you've not got kids yet right but when you do you have argument you have a
beautiful feet remember when my daughter was born i love her with every piece of my heart right i had this real
fear that when my son was born where's the love going to come from yeah no you do there's a feed that is
it's a quite common thing for parents like my daughter had every single bit of love in my body so my wife
obviously would we're really super close but love for your child is so different it feels very different from the moment
that child is born and i could not have loved my daughter not one percent more so then my son is
about to be born my daughter's gone off to the grandparents and i'm watching my wife in labour thinking i've got nothing left for for sebastian
what's this about sebastian's born and within two seconds i love him equally so there's no
diminishing of the love for my daughter not one bit but all this new love has just appeared
out of nowhere and i could love my son exactly the same how is that possible and it is exactly
the same when you have a real passion or a real love for something like every day that i get up and i'm making
phone calls or i'm having conversations or i'm you know brainstorming or blue sky thinking or thinking about guests or
heading to do live television it's all filler it's filled up again i'm full i'm ready to go
you know i don't feel like i'm like the cup is draining slowly because i love the stuff that i'm doing
and that's a great point because i think people tend to believe that passion is a singular thing yeah and then they're searching for it aimlessly
like it's an easter egg hidden somewhere yeah and that you can drain you can't drain your passion yeah you can have multiple
passions yeah and you know you've met a ton of you know high-profile people on your you
How do you deal with assholes
know from your from your presenting career but also from your podcast i'm sure you've come across a bunch of [ __ ] as well
yes i'm not gonna ask you to i'm not gonna ask you to name them holly tucker on her podcast came out with her you
know what it's like she created not on the highstreet.com she said i'd rather have a hole than an [ __ ] in other words
i would rather hang out with no one than hang out with someone that i don't like which i which i thought was uh which i thought
was a good one but then matthew mcconaughey said do you want an [ __ ] or an idiot give
me the [ __ ] because at least you know where you stand really yeah so he was like at least and
i i do relate to that somewhat the people that i really struggle with in my life are the people who
one day you see them and they're like your best mate the next day it's like you've never met them before i do struggle with that i i like to know
where i stand with people i'm cool if you want if you and me want to have like a distant professional relationship
and you'll send me a text saying happy new year i hope the podcast goes well maybe hook up sometime in 2021
and we never see each other socially and you come back on high performance i come back on here and we use to and throw a bit professionally
that's absolutely that is cool what i don't want is
hey let's have a coffee do you let's meet up in london yeah great oh man it's so nice to see you so how's things how's life we chat a bit more have you got a
partner how's your dog as your life and then you hear nothing for six months and you think whatever happened to that dude
and then they reappear again i'm so sorry for not texting you back there's the truth i feel like you're
shouting um there's the there's the difficult thing for me not knowing where i stand with people i you
know i don't want to be everyone's best friend but i do want meaningful relationships with people and they can be meaningful
from a distance or super intense on that point of arseholes as well i think um what made you what made you ask
that i just i just one of the things i i could you know what it is i remembered one day
you meet a lot of people and when you do this podcasting thing and you you have an initial perception of how they're going to be
and then you meet them and sometimes you know sometimes they're souls i actually don't think i've had anyone on the podcast that was an [ __ ] but i have
had experiences i remember this one day i got in this plane i think i was flying emirates or virgin or something
um and in front of me i saw that guy from the food guy the guy that eats all the
food on tv someone give me his name oh um yeah yeah yeah yeah um everyone in the podcast
man versus food guy yeah man versus food i mean i don't know his name yeah and i don't care about saying this
um and we run this huge food channel at social change so we have you know tens of millions of followers on a food channel
so i text the food team and i'm like oh my god he's on the plane they said i'll go up go up and ask him a question which
is a question we always ask us on our food channel so i went over to ask him this question he was sat in um business i sat in
business as well and he's just he just he looks at me and goes
listen give me a second okay and i'm like whoa so i walk back to my my chair and i have
to tell the 500 people in this like company group oh so i went up to him and this person that you all
absolutely love i've he's just cussed me out um and he will never know the impact he had
on me or the 500 people that i then told and also the you know hundreds of thousand people that i'm
telling right now um if you got to the point though where you're brave enough to call that sort of stuff out because i think that is the important
thing when he's when he does it to his face yeah for me that would be like
ego because you go from you yeah it would be like do you know who the [ __ ] i am or it'd be like
why are you saying that for me the piece was like no reaction yeah because there was no win there was no win
in me calling him out i wasn't going to win so the win for me was saying okay no worries and we're going back to my chair
and also not letting it ruin my day um but but i'm sure you the reason i asked you the question is because you have tons of
guests in your presenting career but also your podcast when you encounter an [ __ ] um i guess how'd you deal with it
you just know that you're there for a stop and not stay i think and you um does it break your heart a little bit
sometimes um when it's someone that you uh admired yeah i suppose so i suppose i don't
worry too much about it because i just think you know what you can you're just not for me and also
like who am i to sort of judge whether their behavior is arseholery if it's clearly a rude and unfair and unkind absolutely
i i now feel like i'm 42 and i'm a parent and i want my kids to operate in a world
where um they can be themselves and they can't be bullied or pushed around i think we're
i'm old enough now and i definitely wasn't like this a few years ago where i can hold my chin up and say that behavior is really not
acceptable would you call someone yeah you would but i wouldn't do it in an arrogant look at me i'm a being a dick
where i just say listen i just think that behavior isn't acceptable and have you done that um yeah
to someone someone i work with you in your presenting career uh yeah name
and address and actually do you know what you find is that often i've done it twice and
both times they've gone yeah i'm really sorry that is actually unacceptable i mean we we had an interesting experience because
my wife used to work in production so heard she was a production secretary which is not very high up the ladder of
people in television and i was a presenter so she would be looking after security
taxis tickets logistics clothing call times all the stuff that makes
television happen but is not the glamorous side and the number of times i would say i met this person today
aren't they great and she'd be like really and then we would meet those people
and i'd be like oh yeah i think you know my wife harriet and they were like oh right yeah hi
because they would be you guys love to come around sometime for some food and harry's like that's not how they were really when they
thought i was just sorting out their travel and that is the definition of an article yes i think it is because you just treat
everyone the same man and they're treating you well because you can potentially benefit them in some way
i don't know it's weird isn't it like why i've got a job on the television why treat me any differently because you're all connected and you can
that is what really annoys me we see that and i saw that in my business over the years and i i came to believe that even with me
leaving the business it won't break the business but i do believe that like so i believe one person leaving a business doesn't break it and you can apply this to your
relationships your life your friendship circle but an [ __ ] staying can me leaving
the business i don't actually think will be as detrimental to a couple of [ __ ] staying in the business not that there are any but
um i know what you mean yeah don't you think though like this is like it sounds naive and
churlish and a bit childish probably from a 42 year old bloke that has a
decent career and runs a few businesses but like i honestly think that we do have the power to make the world
positive and happy despite all the issues because all you have to do is worry about your immediate circle
and that is why i get frustrated with people who spread negativity and criticism and i just i've just got no
space in my life now for negativity from people because i just think if let's say that i know seven people
and i just say you know i'm gonna really radiate a positive energy i'm gonna lift them up i'm not gonna be critical i'm gonna do
everything i can to make them feel like a million dollars the only agreement is that they have to
do the same and you say that to those people listen i'm going to do this thing i'm going to be really super positive and i'm going
to do everything i can to help you and if you ever need something i'm going to be the person that comes and helps you out all i'm asking is that you do it for the
people in your circle be the change see how quick that would radiate yeah so my seven
so if i go if each of them goes to seven you know what i mean yeah no and it just feels stupid doesn't mean that's that's what karma is yeah you
know i don't believe in wishy-washy karma isn't like oh if i help a lady then someone's going to help me in the future but i think from a logical perspective if i help
everyone i encounter maybe they'll be more helpful and that can make its way back around to
maybe my niece you know but you know so true i just i can't see any i can't see any benefit
any benefit to criticism and negativity and like driving other people down someone that get feels better for driving someone
else further down is like for me the absolute epitome they are the worst of them do you ever get jealous
Do you get jealous?
be completely honest uh yeah um i get jealous but i only ever get
jealous through comparison and that is ridiculous you know it's the nasty is it the nasty jealous where you're like
why have they gotten yeah probably yeah yeah but you've got but i think that is innate i think that is
almost there i am giving up responsibility again for someone that talks about 100 responsibility but i think that it's
innate in human nature to to compare and to contrast and look at someone else
so it's not a very long experience for me i will look at someone and i'll go but hey listen i'm so happy
and i've got all this i'm gonna and actually sometimes i look at life as a graph and you literally don't know where life
is gonna take you so let's say like the people that i now sit with in a tv
studio like um i sit with they say when i when i had robin van persie stephen jarrod and rio
ferdinand were all the pundits on bt sport there was a time where all three of those were three of the most famous
footballers in the country earning phenomenal sums of money competing on the world stage representing their country
and i was a a guy post a level failure trying to sort of find a
job and earning six thousand pounds a year and there was a time where they were there and i was there and our graphs over the time have done
whatever's happened look where i've ended up sitting next to them on a tv studio now it may well be that they go up there
again and something happens to me and i go down here or it might be that i do that and they do that but you never know where that graph is
going to go and that is what i think is that for me is one of the most exciting things about this world that we live in
like you are only one step away from a phone call where someone goes hey guess what and your graph goes so don't worry about
where other people are on that graph because it might be in five years time you're right alongside them i guess that's where that that hate a
lot of the hate comes from so if you take the jealousy feelings that even you have as you know one of the nicest people i know and you just you know times it by ten
but you know and that's the you know people feel a certain way about their lives and how their lives are going
that's because it's it's chucked in our faces all the time yeah what is instagram if it isn't a tool for comparison what is it
why are you having a great day and we i and i'm we're jealous of that i'm not jealous we're guilty of it making other
people jealous of what we do but we went out for uh we went for a couple of days away as a family to a
lovely hotel called clifton and it was lovely but the kids for some reason were just badly behaved and it
does happen sometimes and we had this meal it was breakfast actually and they were like it took ages for the food to come
and the kids were like climbing the wall and that's having to say to the waiter at least i'm really sorry but like we've been waiting for 20 minutes which is
fine for me and my wife but the kids yeah they need and it was a posh hotel where you're trying to said you get to
just stay at the table sit and sit nicely don't make too much noise and then at the end of it i was
stressful man and i said hey i'll tell you what the family will want to know where we are so i'll get my phone out and i go kids kids just
smile and we take a photo and we put it we have a family what's up group with harriet's mum and dad my mum and dad all
the cousins all the aunts and uncles right we're all smiling everything looks great just had a lovely breakfast at the hotel
i said and then then we get loads of messages back like from people like my sisters are going oh you're
your life always looks perfect and my brother going oh another great day for you and i think actually yes like i've just
given them an absolute falsification of what my sunday morning cleveland house was like that was a stressful hour and i've taken
the one thing that wasn't stressful why have i put that in the group why haven't i just gone hey guys hope you're having a good sunday call we've just had
a [ __ ] half an hour here having some breakfast but hey don't we all that's and that's what we all do all the
time why else do all the people you follow on instagram put the things they put out there i i've
you know i think the world has somewhat flipped is flipping back the other way in the sense that when we
all started instagram it was this new thing you had these filters and it was like a show the best holiday you've ever had in your
life to the world that was kind of the that's the thing you'd get the rewards for and that represents
in terms of being able to relate to that or it's like 0.00 of the viewer's life like most of
our lives the 99 of our lives as i've said in this podcast before is like eating the pot noodle in bed and now i see that the win with personal
branding and building um an instagram page is the antithesis of showing that it's like
i've just woken up with my face covered in spots in fact the last you know two podcasts ago we had christian here who's like a superstar
influencer entrepreneur and i was trying to understand why her community are so engaged with her so engaged with
her versus even like even compared to mine or other people's and it's because she wakes up in the morning she goes
my face is covered in spots oh my god i'm not gonna put the filter on today and you see the spots on her face and
stuff like that and then she'll cry on her instagram story because her you know her best friend lost her mother and
you really can resonate with that you can and also the amount of supply
on social media of that realness is low demand is super high because it
represents the 99 of our lives supply is super low and uh and people joe wicks is the same he he will
he will tell you everything i feel like [ __ ] today you know and people just and that's the thing i think you can
form a bond with a real deep bond so even as i reflect on my instagram now
i said to my team earlier this week i'm like i need to like go on my instagram story more and do a lot of the stuff that i do on
the podcast which is just like telling you the [ __ ] stuff too yeah um and so i i say this yeah if you want
to build a personal brand i'm like you know you really need to get comfortable with that make you happy though let's go back
to where we began would you make me happy yeah because i know that it would not make me happy i my
instagram isn't a lie it is real but it's real with the things
that i choose to share basically yeah do you know what i mean by the way i have no lunch can i knock yourself down it's actually yeah
this one actually worked this month so it's um what is it this one this is not had one present for you though when
i saw that you've got huels yeah it's just great i was panicking i'd undone it and i was going to flip fuel
all over your lovely rug in here doesn't matter that that would be a cool piece of promo um nutritionally complete
drink yeah yeah yeah i think it's great man so i've eaten nothing today what's the time it's vegan 20 past one so this is perfect for
me now this is my lunch and my breakfast try let me know what you think
this is my favorite flavor of all that's good and if you have this all day
um which i don't know if that's to be recommended but all of your sort of essential minerals
are in there vitamins high in protein so it's 20 grams of protein at the same time slow releasing
carbs spill a bit on your really lovely glass table it's fine don't mind low sugar gluten free yeah it's great
that's nice it's lovely yeah and i drink it because um because i skip meals
that's how i first well i'm trying to intermittently fast because i've seen um other people's six packs on social
media and they make me feel at me okay they make me feel like i just need to
you know right why do you feel the need to share more of yourself on instagram like so yeah so what's the benefit the
Connecting with our audience
benefit is if i share more of my truth all the the tough stuff which is pretty much why i started the
podcast in the first place i feel that i'm helping a lot of people and do i enjoy helping people and
getting um and helping them overcome their problems yes yeah i mean you do that already on this
podcast yeah but i don't do it on instagram and i i think that do i want to have a deeper connection with my audience on
instagram yes what am i doing on instagram predominantly just posting quotes to be honest so if i want to have a deeper connection
with my audience on instagram then i should go deeper with them yeah as i do on this podcast because the podcast audience are like a cult
you know they're super engaged because of the depth and the realness so i think it would make me happy in the
long run there must be a reason i don't do it that's a good point this i mean it's been a huge revelation for me doing a
podcast because when you're a football presenter you don't get nice messages
on instagram you don't get like an engaged core saying this resonated with me that resonated
with me partly because you're not the story you're there to facilitate former pros to be the superstars i mean i liken my
job on the football to like being a referee like if i'm not seen that's probably a good thing i make them look good i make
them feel good and people let's be totally frank tune in to watch the game more people will tune in for man united
the more tuning for norwich city more people won't tune in for me because i'm just
the facilitator whereas with the podcast the nicest thing has been this genuine
conversation connection like creation of a proper community and that's that's been
a totally new thing to me i thought i knew everything that was to know about broadcasting and you know with a million followers on
twitter and an instagram account and running a tv production company and being a tv presenter like i knew what it
was about i knew how to connect to people i've never known anything like it never seen feedback like it never had fulfillment like it
it's amazing is there something crazy about podcasting though versus all other channels and i think it's that depth
the messages you get if i post something on instagram i'll get a oh i can totally relate the podcast you
get a like essay about you know they return with their story
yeah and it's like depth begets depth yeah yeah yeah i totally see what you're saying
and i and it's um it stops it from like because when i
first started the high performance podcast i wanted it just to be me opening up amazing people to benefit
other people and i will now admit part of the thrill of that podcast is seeing the response and seeing
seeing the reaction and i'm i'm not foolish enough to think that isn't my ego at work it absolutely is my ego that
likes it but it is like it's amazing when you see hi i listened to your podcast and i
changed jobs after wanting to do it for 20 years hi i listened to your podcast and i've quit doing something that's
been bad for me for my whole life i've reached out to create relationships with people that are allowed to die
from listening to our podcast bloody hell what's the most emotional moment you've
had with a guest that you can recall on the podcast is there a particular
moment that you know yeah who there's quite a few times that i've kind
of um that i've sort of edged towards tears and i think you know someone i've
already mentioned sean wayne you know when um when someone talks to you about
that sort of the devastation of being physically abused by a parent and
they've got i suppose what was emotional for me was the was the learning during the interview with sean and i
knew very little about him before we spoke the learning that all of the good stuff
he's done you know he talks about if he's got an issue with one of his players he doesn't just have to chat with him after training he turns up at
their house in the evening he says what's the deal man how can i help how can i solve this um
and he is now a parent himself and a really loving and caring parent to have the start in life that sean had
and to for your whole life to be about helping other people that was like
that that was a that was a hugely moving conversation with him yeah i think all of all of the guests
i've had that have um moved me in the same way is almost identical it's nice isn't it i
don't know whether you're like this with podcasts but i love that we have footballers on and don't talk about football
we have rugby players and i don't really talk about rugby um we just talk about it
my podcast is a podcast about life exactly like this one is and we were talking before we started recording today about the
Tips for starting a podcast
the desire to try and avoid the typical talking points with guests and i think this is maybe just a general a general point for people that are
trying to start a podcast you know um there are so many podcasts out there yeah and
in order to what would your tips be then for someone who's considering starting a podcast from what you've learned in your
30 or you know you've you've recorded a total of 50 so far but yeah we've done that live
what tips what did you give to someone who's thinking of starting their own first of all go for it because i honestly what i honestly
was this close to not doing it the great thing about podcasts that you that i didn't have in my life was
ownership so i'd spent my career working for children's bbc working for
formula one and the bbc working for the premier league on bt sport and i sat down with someone they said
like how's your career and i said yes great i'm really happy i love doing the football i love being with the players
and everything and they said what if you've got a phone call tomorrow to say that that had ended what would you be left with
and i was like um today i have to go and find another job they said so what do you own of all
these years of graft and hard work like what's yours and the answer was nothing and then the next question they
you know they obviously knew what they were talking about i said what do you really want to do and i said well i don't really care
if liverpool beat man united or norwich city be ipswich not really but i
love like the effort and the graphs and i love sitting with the pundits i love the way that
rio ferdinand and steven gerrard watch a game of football i love how they turn up looking smart or they bring their own food in little
plastic containers still or the day that i first met lewis hamilton and he walked in the room and he like
took off his watch and he didn't just chuck his watch on the side he got it and he closed up the clasp
and he put it down and he moved it and he goes bracelet off and he went
[Music] i just looked at i thought ah that desire for perfection that elite mindset
mentality i said to them that's what i want i want to speak to elite performers and elite thinkers
because i think that everyone can benefit from that everyone can think and operate and perform better because
there's no tricks there's no secrets like you just need to have the passion and go out and do it
and they said well then that's what you should do a podcast so that was it right great i'm doing a podcast and then i mentioned it to a couple of
people and they went why you can't do a podcast i was like why because everyone does podcasts like there's literally so many
podcasts you can't you're not gonna make a splash there's thousands of podcasts and then i rang an old friend of mine
from children's bbc and she is i don't really even ever told her this but she's the reason i do the podcast
fern cotton who does happy place i said hey i think i'm doing a podcast now she is
such a nice person she is not the sort of person to go oh hold on a rival podcast yeah she'd never even
consider she would oh my god you'd be great at doing a podcast like she spoke about what it was about
and i said but my issue is i just think that like there's loads of them out there and then she was the one that said look
we worked together at children's bbc yeah television had been invented for 50 years there must have been
hundreds of channels thousands of programmes did you think i'm not going to work in telly because there's already loads of tv programs no course you
didn't you just thought well i'm gonna work in telly and make my mark she said you need to do exactly the same thing with your podcast
um so the first thing you is you have to do your podcast you have to go out and do it but the second and that's the biggest
challenge though isn't it starting it's just in every facet of life yeah entrepreneurs contact me and i'm like the biggest risk you face
of all the things that might yeah i think you can do a podcast risk-free though you know you can spend a very minimal sum of money if any money at all
on on the equipment 100 but then you can you can so cheap yeah no you could start
you could do a great podcast in terms of sound quality with less than 100 pounds yeah the risk
though is overthinking it to the point of procrastination to the point of select
paralyzing yourself i think in all facets of life business my dm's are full of people that are like
steve i want to start a business i have an idea i want to start a podcast or this project but there's just this one problem which
is preventing me starting and i always say the biggest risk of the success of your business the number one thing that's going to stop
you becoming a billionaire honestly is the probability that you'll just never start and also
that you'll think you need all of the answers to all of the questions you have before you start yeah well i don't know this i don't have the
funding i don't like when i started my business i was 18 didn't know the word entrepreneur no money went on google and typed in
like how to build a website spent three months googling it but that was me starting you know um and i think it's the same
with podcasting i'm like my first episode was dog [ __ ] i was downstairs inside
what is it when telly would say the first is the worst you know that's the way it is that's the way it has to be but the point is
you got going you started and i think you need to begin and then you need to be consistent and
you need to keep going and don't expect instant success and instant gratification but i think the other thing for it like i get a lot of
i get a lot of people sending me letters saying i want to be on the television
and i always reply in the positive because i always say well someone has to be doing my job
in 20 years time when i'm 62 i will not be presenting the premier league on bt sport i just won't be someone has to be could
be you why not make it you make the decision now that it's going to be you that's the next well-known sports tv broadcaster and
then i remind them that when i started out in 1998 99 to be on the telly to be a
broadcaster you actually needed a job that was not very easy to go and get now
you can pick up your phone and you're a broadcaster you can have a youtube channel you can have an instagram handle
you can have a twitter page you can have a podcast as long as you've got a passion because
you then funnel everything into that passion and everything feeds everything else so the instagram handle points people towards
the podcast the podcast is fantastic so people go and watch the podcast that you've recorded on
youtube and then you start to build an audience there and you make a little bit of money and it slowly starts to build
be consistent but have the passion have the thing that's different like i will get maybe 10 times a week hi jake
um i just wonder whether you would come and be on our podcast we just want to talk about you know your journey and how
you got to where you are now it'd be really great to have a chat and you roll your eyes and it's like man you've got to be better than that
everyone can go and have a conversation about your journey and the highs and the lows and the struggles
what's the niche what's the team yeah so tell me anything tell me what someone would have to say to you that has
basically no listeners or is starting out that would make you go on their podcast because like passion would be absolutely
definitely about their passion and i have done plenty of podcast interviews in the last year where there hasn't been a big audience
but i've really loved the fact that the person has come to me known a lot about me and said i really
want to explore this particular area with you i think just the broad brush stroke of can we just talk about your inspiration and
talk about your upbringing and talk about how you first got into broadcasting yeah let's like i'm a bit like this now
and everything i do like even when i'm broadcasting i'm not interested in canon united win the league i am much more interested
in um looking at one of the players marcus rashford for example and having a really proper
deep conversation with paul scholes and rio ferdinand like explain to me how hard it is for him to
concentrate on football when he's got so many people criticizing him on social media for doing the school
dinners or how difficult is it for him to run out of old trafford and really
perform at a high level when he hasn't got 80 000 people how much of a difference does it really make to have the crowd at
old trafford they're inspiring you and driving you on like that is a much much more of an interesting
conversation for me because it feels much more real yeah than just the general stuff so that would be my advice to people is
make it really specific make it really passion based and there's that big about like having
How to contact high performance people
you want them to show evidence that they've done their research on you so because listen people send emails invite you
onto a podcast or dms whatever but most of our lives um and the success of our lives
as least as i can recount it in my journey has been predicated on me knowing how to ask someone for something
that they really didn't have a huge clear incentive to give me yeah asking in the right way so we're not just
talking about inviting jake onto podcasts here we're talking about how you ask for something how you knock on a door that uh you know
maybe is a bit above you at that point i think that often you get a lot of respect there
just for asking the question and i think i think the other thing is for people to remember when they're in our position
you've been in that position as well like you have been there and don't expect them to be perfect by the way
like everything that you now find easy about sitting here and recording this podcast once you didn't find easy
yeah you found it a struggle that's the really important point and those people are often right at the beginning of their journey and they're
finding their way and why can't you give them 10 minutes even if you can't go on their podcast stephen why can't you just go do you
know what just give me your number i'll give you 10 minutes 10 minutes of your day is nothing could change your entire life
so there's a lot of people asking for 10 minutes this is the problem and if you add it up there's then we don't have much time left for anything else and i i sometimes think to myself
if i gave all of these people 10 minutes i wouldn't be the type of person that they'd be asking for you can't do stuff you don't have time
to do but you probably can do 10 minutes once in a while a couple of times a day yeah
the thing that annoys me a couple of times with the dm's the night once in a while yeah once a couple times a day yeah
anyway yeah do you know i'm doing it anyway for like i told you about my friend that called me with a problem like so i give him 20 minutes to solve
the problem with him i'm doing that all day every day and my employees all at social change now that i've left contacted me more than
i think they did it when i was there asking me how to solve problems with each other with the company what
should we be doing so yeah i still feel like i'm mentoring a lot of people don't always look for like the
instant value and stuff no i know that when someone rings you and goes um stephen i know i'm a social
chain and i know i wasn't very high up the chain at social chain but and i know you've left i [ __ ] love
what you did a couple of quick questions right yeah you might look at it and go do you know what i remember that person i just
haven't got the time i've got to get in the gym right let's say you did yeah what you've done is you've seen the value to you
in that moment of giving them 10 minutes of your time what about if that person then goes on and thinks
wow i've been so impressed by what i've done at social channel i'm going to set up my own business i'm going to do this and suddenly the snowball effect comes
and then in a couple of years time you get the phone call steve and i'd love you to be on the advisory board of this business i set up because i actually set
it up because you gave me a bit of inspiration a few years ago there's the value you never see it's invisible if you don't give them the few
minutes at that time i call it hand it out man invisible pr yeah you never see it in the moment you never
see the impact it's having but when it matters the most it will show up so for example the guy told you about from man vs food
we have a huge food channel and we're looking for hosts for this food channel that would potentially get paid a ton of money
and in that one moment he will never see he saw the value giving you 10 seconds in that moment and then with
no value yeah but but now he's clearly going to be excluded from the process of deciding who hosts the food channel yeah just because of that
10 seconds he'll never know because it's invisible pr um but what i see what does make me annoyed is i'll get messages from
someone and i'll say steve i swear to god i got this message i screenshotted and said it's my friends because it
it's synonymous of the wrong approach steve um i'd love to know uh how you did what you
did i've produced thousands of videos podcasts interviews
blogs on how i did what i did there's actually a video called like how i built a 200 million company or whatever
and for me when someone says that i think you don't actually want to know because
if you really wanted to know you would have put that into google yeah or you would have put more effort in you're being super lazy and then i said
to the guy i saw it you're not fine got the video where i explained how i didn't i did what i did and i sent it to him he goes uh you know
you should write a book i
maybe he just doesn't yet know what he doesn't know and if you showed him these these little
bits in 10 years time he'd be embarrassed and maybe if you looked at some of the early interactions you had with people
you'd be embarrassed about what you i know i would some of the emails i sent i've i so i have a really old hotmail account
that i've had literally since the beginning of time and i don't use it anymore but sometimes it's quite cathartic for me to go back into that hotmail account
zoop back to the very beginning we're talking about emails i was sitting in 2001. and i'm surprised man i get my tone
wrong and i'm a bit bulshy and i'm a bit pushy and i think this doesn't sound or
seem like me maybe i just think benefit of the doubt man always benefit of the doubt and i'm not
saying you need to bust your balls and spend two days giving this person a private seminar but definitely do i mean i think it's
great you replied and just reply go listen here's all the stuff that i've done but when he replies and says
you should write a book a he's giving you a compliment b he might be a bit nervous you know the
problem is so there's thousands and thousands of people like this on a weekly basis yeah so my
my decision as to who to help or to who to engage with is based on the message they send
and if someone says some people would message me go so um so what is social change come on like if
you just googled it yeah if you if you clicked on the word in my bio there's a description of exactly what it
is but people will still and for me that's laziness because if i like i can't think
of a point in my life where if i wanted to know whether i was 16 or 26 whether if i
wanted a piece of information i would have just my my attempt at getting it would have just been to
message the person you know the public figure whatever you say so uh how did you uh win that uh formula one
championship lewis i would have at least tried you know what i mean do you think there's an issue here with um
like with a social media now there's a complete lack of formality so like when you and i were growing up and we wanted
to run a business that someone had set up and sold for hundreds of millions you literally could not get to that person
unless it was a real graft to get there so by the time you did manage to get an email address for some ceo of some big
business it had been such a journey you weren't going to lose the opportunity or waste the opportunity
because it had taken you two or three months just to get to the point of being able to send something part of the issue now is the people who
want information from you literally this is how long it takes steven bartlett
direct message h-i-s-t-e-v hi steven um can i know about your
business right that's taken me 30 seconds that's how long it is so that's why
the quality of effort is so low because because they're just used to it that's how we now communicate with each other but then the other thing
is 20 years ago when you were trying to get hold of a ceo of a big business
there was quite a good filtration process so that by the time you got the email address of that guy or that woman at the top of that
business it was a journey you would have had 20 knockbacks 10 or 15 setbacks blah blah blah blah blah
so actually the person that got those email addresses were the grafters man and the ones that were
finding the route and finding the path and it shows though that the most important thing one of the
2020 growth hacks for your career is knowing how to ask yeah because everyone everyone has now
got the email or the dm but there's a real art in knowing what to say when you're in there
i know that people like you are getting a lot of messages every day all of the same quality but that's great
because it's easy to stand out if you want to say a good thing if you send me a voice note that jumps
up in the queue if if the voice note is um well researched as you say jumps up in the
queue further if you're asking here's the thing for me it's like if you're asking me for something and you're making some attempt to
acknowledge the fact that um that you know i don't have a lot
of time that also jumps up in the queue because i think you this person's a little bit more you know savvy and it's being more realistic um but yeah it
makes a huge difference coral yeah i want to talk about this so
What are you working on?
i eyewear brand i received these lovely um sunglasses in the post and as i said to you before
we got on out i'd usually look a little bit weird in sunglasses but this pair of sunglasses and i'm not just saying this
and i actually said this behind your back as well so this is how you know it's legit right um i actually think i look quite cool
you do look good yeah and i would never wear sunglasses like this normally because i couldn't find
the right shape yeah tell me all about coral and and what this is this is your first sort of significant investment yeah it's the first time i've ever
invested in a business really obviously whisper group is different because i was a founder and we set that up together
um but i've wanted for a long time to do what i can to help people who are perhaps in a
position where i can have some influence on their lives so about a year ago i set up a scholarship
with the uea the university of east anglia in norwich it's pretty simple when people apply for
the film and tv course they're means tested so they have to fill in a form so we can find out their
family income and if the family income is below a certain level i will pay five grand a year every year
that they're at university so 15 grand over the time of their course to make it affordable for them to go to
uni so it's literally my way of finding people who wouldn't get a chance in the tv industry it's similar to the ethos we
have at whisper like we want to lift up people that are underrepresented and i think there's amazing tv talent out
there and they literally will never get the opportunity to have a tv career purely for financial means and that
really makes me sad so i set that up and then i had this great relationship with the uea and they introduced me to a
young guy called george bailey and he's a 19 year old student he's 20 now at the uea
and he had this idea for recycled eyewear and it is literally taking fishing that's out of the sea
taking plastic out of landfill and turning them into eyewear and ice and i said you know what george
like that's a really good idea i really like it but it will be everywhere already because it's so
simple because when we sort of run through the numbers there's something like nine million pairs of eyewear sold in the uk every
year almost all of them virgin plastic covered in lacquer full of glue full of
metal bad for the environment not doing any good for the planet at all
so i sort of heard what he said and thought this would be happening already and i was actually in london for a meeting with my agent in west london i
thought the perfect place for recycled sustainable eyewear brand is west london so i went into all of the high street
eyewear places that you could possibly imagine you know david klullo and um sunglasses
hut and all of these others on oxford street and bond street i was in that area and i said the same thing every time i walked in hi
can i see your range of recycled eyewear blank faces can i see your green range
your sustainable range the same nothing response and i was straight on the phone to george i said
listen we need to make this happen we really need to make this happen and we're not the only brand in the world
making eyewear from recycled material but we're the only brand who have gone
and got our own eyewear designer so it's original designs handmade in a factory in italy we then
offset all the carbons when that gets delivered to you there's not been a single hit on the planet from the carbon and
the plastic has been taken out of the world to create those the lenses are infinitely recycled and
we have a system where you send the lenses or the whole eyewear back to us and we can recycle them so it all goes again
so the phrase i use is planet positive it's not just like not putting pollution into the planet it's actively removing
plastic and turning it into something that you would otherwise have gone and purchased um and look we're a startup we're small
it'll be a slog and it'll be a battle but i wouldn't have got involved like everything else i've been talking to you about if i
didn't passionately believe that those are the answer none of us go shopping now
without a plastic bag in our hand already or a reusable tote bag or whatever but none of us think twice before we go
and buy a pair of sunglasses and coral i wear i want to be the answer the case there that's made from plastic
oh this case or this case yeah that's recycled plastic the cloth inside recycled plastic you'd never know would
you no even one of the things that really struck me as well is how high quality it all feels like it feels super luxury like the
the case and then well that's the thing we want we also didn't want people to think yeah i want to sort of help the environment but i'll have to look a bit
rubbish we actually want people to think i can still buy a really nice high-end high-quality bit
of eyewear you got a little note there from george yeah what's he said on this says hey there thank you so much for choosing coral and our vision to make
the eyewear industry kinder to our planet smiley face george that's super nice
yeah no i i was you know i was i was nervous because when friends send me things and then he probably sometimes i don't say yeah and i'm i'm
known for being really honest with my friends um and saying oh i don't really like this about it or whatever because i just think the truth sets you
free and that's what people really value as you said earlier it's like the the critique is often um more valuable at certain stages than
just total praise one word you said earlier that i has become incredibly important in my
The importance of consistency
mindset these days is the word consistency yeah um maybe from meeting exceptional guests
maybe just from understanding the root cause of my own accomplishments but um i you know i used to think that
intensity was was the answer but if you look at all of the success that i've had whether it's getting a million followers
on instagram or social channel whatever it was it was that word and i never really appreciated the importance of
that word up until recent i think when i was writing my book what have you learned about consistency i've learned
exactly as you have that consistency is the root of all good stuff because if you find
something that works for you you have to do it consistently like i used to say consistently relentless
i regret the use of the word relentless a little bit now i i do think you have to be relentless but i now change it to you have to be
consistently happily relentless and if you can be consistently
happily relentless i don't think you will go far wrong because you'll be doing a passion project which
is what makes you happy you will be consistently doing things and consistency is absolutely key for people to understand what you're
about and let's be totally frank we can sit here and be fluffy and friendly and say oh you know let's not
push people too hard in the modern world because it might cause issues and whatever you do have to be relentless
for success but it's okay to be relentless if you're being relentless and you're happy being relentless
so try in 2021 to be consistently happily relentless and let's see where
we all are in 12 months time i have one more question for you it's probably a question people don't really
Addressing the gender imbalance
talk about in the podcasting game but um we have struggled at times to get
women to come on the podcast yep um for a variety of different reasons
men seem much more willing than women have you found the same thing yeah we have yeah it's
interesting you should say that yeah we have i don't think that we have found women
not willing to come on the podcast i think it's only when you start doing a podcast about
relentless high achievement that you realize how dominated by men
the tops of our industries are yeah that's the problem and i you know we keep on saying right who should we get on as really great
inspirational female leaders and all the suggestions people keep making to us are in the sports space i keep saying no not sports women
because we are totally i am totally plugged into the fact that i want to celebrate
brilliant successful females you know i have a daughter and i want her to listen to this podcast in years to come
when she's old enough and go that's who i want to be that's what i want to be inspired by and i think that sometimes we like to
trick ourselves into thinking oh no we live in a really equal society now what are you talking about there's loads of powerful females at the top of
businesses when you break it down we are still in a male dominated society
and it's a good reminder that we need to keep on lifting up female role models and pushing them to
the absolute top and we are on the high performance podcast we are totally aware of that um and we will
continue to do what we can because actually when we get brilliant female leaders on
there and we just recorded with joe malone um who set up the amazing joe malone brand she now runs
joe loves we've recorded with holly tucker who was fantastic dame kelly holmes who was really inspirational and moving steph horton is
going to be on the series in the not too distant future we've had brilliant female
leaders on our pod but it is still a challenge compared to the amount of
male leaders lining up going i'll definitely come on there and talk and there is something else that maybe
we need to address in the next 12 months black women at the top of business mate
where are they why what is happening that is not allowing them to shine as they should
and that's one thing and i just say one thing that really is pissing me off massively at the moment is when people talk about the
over-representation of black and mixed-race or female role models in society
and they say oh everywhere you turn now you know that's all this and i drive this home to the whole time i say listen you've got this completely wrong
the reason why we now have to promote and push and celebrate and shout about black men and black women
and women in general and underrepresented areas of society is that if you are a
little kid growing up in norwich or manchester or birmingham or
los angeles you have to see those people there to believe that you can get there as well
there's no good saying oh yeah they'll eventually make it through we have to show them now that you can no matter who you are no
matter what the color of your skin no matter what your gender no matter what your background no matter how affluent you are
you can get there and that's why we have to push them to the forefront now to inspire the next generation because
once they're there they'll stay there and it'll be a much better more equal society for everyone we've both got a big responsibility yeah
with our platforms yeah and it and we should we absolutely should listen thank you for your time no one
was incredibly busy it's always nice to sit down yeah thanks for lunch no it's always
fascinating and i i you know you're discovering um incredible stories through your own podcast high performance and
it's uh it's really powerful to kind of compare notes sometimes with with people uh
because yeah my one of the things i've learned from doing the podcast which i'm sure you have as well is that the themes that have made people
successful and giving them that high performance mindset are actually quite consistent yeah yeah yeah i think when i
started my podcast i was expecting to find 50 different ways you know to become
successful but it all seems to be distillable down to these simple themes like you know consistency and discipline and
passion and then for me anyway much of the root cause of that consistency or that obsession with
that passion has come from often in many circumstances something that might not have gone
right yeah on the playground or some insecurity they had or something their dad or mum said to them
um and that for me is fascinating but yeah thank you again for your time it's pleasure and um it just reminded me that we're all on a
journey right and i said to harriet when i was coming on here today i said oh i'm going back on diary of a ceo with steven
and she said again what are you going to talk about because you only went on there a few months ago and you know when i now sit here and
talk to you i'm a different person to the one that you spoke with before i began doing my podcast before i began doing my
stuff with coral airway even in the last year i feel like i'm sitting here as a different person
and i didn't realize that you could learn and change and develop and adapt quite so much quite so late so man look
joe biden took him until he was 77 until he nailed it as the president you know sometimes you have to wait a
long time in life for your dream job or your dream opportunity what has changed since we last spoke for you in terms of who you are just a much
deeper understanding of how other people operate i hadn't
i've spent my life hadn't like on my own journey me as a presenter me learning me setting up a business
what am i gonna do the high performance podcast was the first time i'd ever sat down and just said from the outside this is
what i think you're doing can you just explain it please what a growth period it's been for me personally
absolutely unbelievable and therapy at the same time right yeah it's therapeutic absolutely um

Transcription:

oh my god eddie hearn what a guy there's very few people no
i'm gonna change that i've never met someone as neurotically obsessed with success
and with winning and with accomplishing things and with living a life in constant forward motion
as my next guest eddie hearn and it's remarkable because when you unpack the reasons for that
obsession and that dedication to being more and achieving more there's quite a fragile vulnerable
insecure story that's something i've noticed with a lot of my guests
and it often makes me think that the most successful amongst us aren't necessarily choosing to be
something's happened to them that's left them with no choice eddie han is one of the most notorious
sports promoters in the world he's the king of boxing in this country he is known for his no context and twitter
page which i'm sure a lot of you have seen but what i wanted to do when i sat down with eddie herm was to get
underneath to get underneath the external sort of braggadocious loud
promoter side of him and to find out even in the case of someone like eddie who is loud who is
successful who is ambitious who is a promoter are the same things true for him that
are true for you the insecurities the vulnerabilities the mental health issues
and how much does he really understand himself my conversation with eddie was incredibly enlightening but it also
wasn't that surprising so without further ado i'm stephen bartlett and this is the diary of a ceo
i hope nobody is listening but if you are then please keep this to yourself
What made you so relentless
you've done a ton of interviews especially over the last couple of weeks and there's this really consistent theme
that i felt in all of the interviews i watched i watched you at cambridge the high performance podcast loads of them and um and then before we came
uh started filming today i had a chat with frank and he fully grasped on you know what he
said to me which i which was also consistent with these interviews is that you are relentless and he was
telling me he's he's had some um i probably shouldn't say this but he was telling me he's i've started having this uh is it
night owl or night night because eddie will text me in the middle of the night and he went i'll tell you one thing
about eddie he is relentless you're what 40 41. 41 years old what's made you
that relentless at 41 years old to the point where you're you're uh pestering your colleagues at 3am in
the morning i don't know really um i think when i when i did the book it was like it was quite a good um sort of
counseling session with myself because i wasn't really great at school i wasn't particularly a
hard worker at school i loved the pound note always and when i wrote the book it just i
started writing about my childhood and what it was like growing up and how i
was molded and i think a lot of it comes down to the fact that i love to win and i'm a why did you love to win i
don't know because with my dad that's what we did so when we played cricket when we played
football when we played table tennis when we sparred with each other it was like for me growing up
you weren't you know i would come back from a match say i played cricket and he would go to me and actually my mum was
the same and he would say to me how many runs you get today son and i would say ah four ah useless come on
next time knock in a fifty right it was never oh well well done son you know you took
part that's what really matters that they taught me taking part is completely and utterly
irrelevant you win and ultimately sport is how i was brought up i was brought up on the
foundations of sport the lessons of sport the winning the losing you know the highs the lows but always
taught that winning was everything so i i'm a failed athlete you know i think any kid growing up would love to
be a sportsman now i played qriket at a very good level but i was never good enough for anything so
this is the next best thing but i think if you're not trying to win in life and win winning
it means something different to everybody success means something different to everybody some people view success as being able
to get their pay packet on a weekend you know be able to you know spend time with her family
and have enough food on the you know make enough money to have food on the table and make sure everything's okay at
home and and be happy you know and have a happy life with no no stress or no drama that's success to
a lot of people but people's interpretation of success is very different and you know for me i i still don't know why
i i i do i know i know why i do this but
like you say i love it i guess that's what it comes down to a passion for what you do and i don't know what the passion is is
it the passion that i love the sport of boxing is it the passion that i want to succeed against you know and
be bigger than my dad i think that's a big part of it as well or is it just that i love to win or is it that i'm a bit sick in the head maybe
all of them the sick and the head point i want to play with that idea a little bit um i write i i write in my book actually
we have the same publisher i wrote in my book that the thing that invalidates you when you're younger becomes the thing you seek validation
from when you're older and what i meant by that is like in my childhood because we didn't have money um and i
was this black kid in a school of 1500 white kids everything that we didn't have became the things that i chased when i was
older or the thing that made me feel somewhat invalid sometimes when i was a kid like you were saying about your dad saying well you lost today became the
thing that i would seek validation from as as a as an adult and i wondered if that resonated with you at all i mean like
well i had a different background i mean my dad was poor became rich and i was born so
i've said before it's not like when you talk about generational wealth we didn't have generational wealth
um i had a dad who was from dagenham was from a council estate his dad was a
bus driver and then i grew up in this sort of nouveau world where this bloke
had made his money and he was you know i take the mickey out of him i suppose he was a bit of a chav you know he was like from dagnam and all
of a sudden he's got ferraris and big cars and we used to have a white limo and a black limo
that would drive like the snooker players around and the fighters around and i was horrible i was obnoxious imagine like
a 14 15 year old kid hanging around with eubank and naz and then you're in the limo with your mates going up to london
or to romford for a night out i mean i'll look back and just cringe but mine was different you know and and
i guess when it comes down to it and you know again from the book and speaking and speaking to people like frank lampard he
went to my school um he was in the year above me at my school i was barry hern's son and frank lampard was
frank lampard's son you know his dad played for west ham he was and it's a different kind of drive
if you can make it flow in the right way you know when you're talking about sort of mindset and and and hustle
where all of a sudden i think so many people with successful parents
end up just doing okay you know but how do you go beyond that how do you
outperform everything that he done and i will and i feel like i've done that in many ways but i will never be able to outperform
the fact that he came from nothing my friends uh my friend is in a very similar position you if i said my
friend's name you'd know the guy okay his dad is a multi-billionaire i know you know him because i've seen you with him before actually in new york
but um his dad is a multi-billionaire and he grew up with living in the shadow and his dad was the same and i had a
conversation with him and he said um it was all i was always trying to be better than my dad he is now
a billionaire himself of his own doing um but it's just it's fascinating that and
he's that dad sounds very similar to what your dad sounds where his dad was tough on him tough on him i think they're tough on
you because they don't want you to be that spoiled kid i mean you always want to
um spoil your kids you know you want to give them the great even now you know i've got two daughters i love to spoil i work hard so i can
give them a great life but i just want them to understand manners respect and discipline these are the
three most important things and he would make sure that i would understand that even by having me working
you know giving me a clout every now and again you know trying to keep because i it must have been frustrating for him
because i was probably all the things that he resented when he was growing up and the
rich kid oh with with parents who had got big house and cars and
and i would have hated me at school you know but he would have looked at me and that's why he was so disciplined with me and you know i was
in his slipstream growing up so i would sit you know we're here now that's that was my house over there
so he would get home from work if he was in the country you know he would always go out and give me a game of football cricket
and then he would go in the office all night on the phone and i would have dinner and i would just sit in the office you know i might have a ball just
throwing up in the air but i would some subconsciously listen to the arguments and you know him losing his temper and and
just listen not because i wanted to learn just because i was there and you're talking there about the
The sacrifices in-order to be successful
sacrifice of his success which is one of them as you've highlighted is less time with
your family you are relentless um everybody says that what is the the cost of being a
relentless person you have to be incredibly selfish you have to you know for me family is the most
important thing but i have to be brutally honest and say i don't let even family get in the way
of things that i have to do you know and that that can make you an [ __ ] and it can make you sound
terrible but i just don't know any way around it there is no way you can be the perfect husband
or the perfect father and run a successful business or you know be a you know
a relentless operator it's impossible because i know because i try to balance both but when you're flying
back from america from a show and you land at seven o'clock in the morning and then you go to manchester for a press conference
and you come home and you just make it to pick them up from school and then you get back and they say dad let's go over the park and
you're just absolutely on empty and your phone's going and you're trying to do another deal and
you know you're pushing the swing and you're going like this trying to send a message at the same time it's impossible you know listen i know
because sometimes my eldest daughter is old enough to say dad please get off the phone
and that's that kills me because that's uh that's bad to hear you know i'm like okay okay but then for 30 seconds later
i'm back just haven't looked down because it's a lifestyle you know and it's impossible to be great
at anything without making sacrifices you know it doesn't matter if you're a fighter if you're a sports when you speak to old
successful people you can't be everything it's impossible you know and and but what you don't want
to do is you don't want to disregard your obligations your family obligations because they are extremely important
but you also need a wife or a partner who's understanding enough to say this is what i know what he's like he
won't stop and that's why when frank talks about the 3 a.m 4 a.m that's because a lot of the time
i'm sort of making up for the hour or two that i've lost out playing with the kids so i'll put them to sleep they'll go to
sleep at nine half nine you know chill out with a wife for an hour she'll go to sleep and then
i'm up and now with the growth in america it means that at 4 p.m 5 p.m the west coast wakes up so i can't
go to bed i can't disappear when it gets to 11 a.m or on the west coast or or midday on
the west coast because they want to speak to me and we want to do business i am much earlier in my career maybe 15
years earlier in my career and um i've struggled with romantic love for the very same reason that for the
last decade i've like slept in the office multiple weekends i've been obsessed um i would
basically sacrifice everything and there became this moment in my life where i think it was maybe the day that
someone tried to buy the company and i thought about what i'd spend it on and i remember going home and i swear on
my mother's life i went on right move and auto trader at the same i had two tabs open and i'm like the lamborghini tinder no
no no no no that's that that always follows the lamborghini so i was looking at this lamborghini in this mansion the
countryside and then i thought if i buy these things i'm trading like this purpose i have this job this you know
for for this lamborghini and this mansion and it felt really really empty and then i thought
that steve you know when you were 18 and you were broke and you had no money 18 year old steve said wrote in your diary that's why it's
called the diversity that you wanted the sports car the million before you were 25. this was what we did it for
and then it threw my head into this like confusion it's like if if it's not that if that's gonna make me feel empty
they call it like um gold medal depression where michael phelps won all the medals and then got depressed um then what's it all for and and then i
thought and then also when does it all end like when does it end well it doesn't end because and actually
you you're always searching this is this is a problem and something you have to be careful of because when you are trying to succeed
and when you're trying to become great actually the great people they never feel content with achievement
and i'm very much like that frank lampard again going back to him he said that when he won the champions league she always dreamed to win in the
champions league and he stood there with a trophy and he felt nothing i mean he felt happy
but definitely not content definitely not i've cracked it that might go back to the sickness you
know that we talked about earlier and when we talk about sickness i mean not probably not medically sick but sick in
the head a little bit to a point where i get it all the time you know we say that you know we wanted to do
you know when aj turned pro we wanted him to be the world heavyweight champion you know he won that great we was in the
ring after jumping up and down as soon as we got out of the ring the ma yeah and then it's like okay we
want to do something you know we've got the klitschko fight okay you go through it 90 000 at wembley you stand there everyone that
was at the event tells you it's a great sporting occasion they've ever been to how do you know uh at the time
amazing in the ring amazing you know and then not even the day after it's i i never i
never go out really and i never drink really after a show because that's probably you know
depressed is the wrong word but you i go back you know i finish the media obligations two three o'clock in the morning go back
to the hotel and that is when i'll sit there get into bed and then obviously you can't sleep because the buzz and the
adrenaline and that's when you just feel a little bit low and empty is that okay
it's over same with what you talk about with phelps it's the highs versus the lows you can't just
experience the highs and then be happy with the lows so you want more and more and more and more and i
i'm my i'm my own biggest critic and i'm also very pessimistic which is strange to a lot of people but
i kind of use it to play tricks on myself to keep myself driven so when i do something or when i plan
something i always say to myself there's going to be problems i think it's going to go wrong i doubt this will
happen you know i don't know why i do it but it just helps me to battle away to overcome everything to get to the place
and then when i achieve something which others might think is great i say to myself that's nothing you've
got a long way to go because i'm scared of sitting back you know with the the cigar on the beach
again i've cracked it you can't touch me you know and we got to a position with uk boxing where
you know we are virtually untouchable but i just don't want to be that guy who takes the foot off the gas i want to
bang every single nail in the coffin you know and then move on to another market and another market another market
but you do get the worry with that mindset is you may look back when you're 80 or 90
and go wow you know look at everything you've done you never really enjoyed it did you i mean i love what i do
but you probably should savor it a little bit more than you do but again it goes back to that mindset of being so
driven you want the next drug success is a drug but you've got to be careful that it
doesn't turn you into an [ __ ] at the same time because how many successful people do you know absolutely
horrible rude no manners obnoxious what's it done do you ever find moments where you think
[ __ ] i was just an [ __ ] then i think that it's just time for people you know you end up being
it's not that you can turn into that if you're not one but
when you become busy it's a bit like you know when people say that oh he's changed of course he's changed his life's
changed you know his responsibilities change his business has changed you can't expect him to say the same
people and you know when you have a group of friends when you all come out of school and sort of going from there and
you're talking every day and the ones that sort of grow [Music]
the friendships are still as strong but you just don't talk to each other every week every day because you've got
your own life you've got your own vision you've got your own plans but you still go for lunch and you get on better than ever and you met but
and it's the ones that say oh he's not no he's don't talk to us anymore i ain't got time mate but this just goes back to the sacrifices
you know if i fall out with friends because of what i'm trying to achieve in
my own personal life and my business so be it i know again that that sounds
you know and it's not about being a bad friend or a bad person but you you can't you can't worry about
other people as long as you're a good person as long as you do the right thing the fact that you don't have time at the moment
but that's when you people might perceive you to be an [ __ ] yeah you talked a little bit about that
Deathbed thinking
about being 80 years old and looking back on your life i'm gonna just play a little uh a little game with you so we've got to imagine um
imagine that what day of the week was i think it's tuesday today tuesday so friday you find out that friday's
your last day on earth my question is and really put yourself there right so friday's your last donut all
the fights coming up aj fury all falls away what do you immediately regret
that's actually something that i've thought about quite a lot and the reason was is um about
four months ago my granddad passed away it was 93 great life you know and when i went to see him in his last
couple of days you know he obviously didn't look great and i looked at him i thought wow life's
crazy in it i said everything that you've done in your life
and now you're laying here about to leave so when you get experiences like that
just you have to be reminded sometimes that this is a game life is a game we're only on borrowed
time right and you can never take yourself too seriously i think that's one thing i do well is i love to have a laugh and i don't
take myself too seriously um in answer to your question
since that moment i've been thinking a lot about if i you know if i went now do you look back
and say i couldn't have done any more i had a great time and i think the answer is yes i mean we could all do we can all do
better but my dad is an inspiration that respect because he's the kind of person that couldn't have squeezed one more
drop out of his life right so i'm quite envious of that he's 73
and who knows how long he's gonna last but i do feel like it's very important that when
you get to whatever stage when god says that's enough for you that you are able to look back and
say i couldn't have done any more. and that scares me a little bit because i want to know exactly what
when you think about more you're saying i could have done more you find out that this friday is your
last day what are the things where you think do you know what because i think that the
that moment like the the death bed moment puts everything in perspective it does but i think in that moment your
emotions are very different to when you're well and fit and on the hustle and just you know so
you don't get a chance to reflect on that kind of moment until you're there yeah and the obvious reflection at that
point is i wish i would have spent more time on my family you know i wish i would have been less focused
probably on work but i'm not a believer in you know the thoughts then
are not the thoughts now and you have to act on the moment you can't live your life saying well blimey when i'm on my
deathbed you might look back in because i don't i don't think you can plan like that you have to do what's in your heart you have to do what feels
right and what feels right for me right now is this sure what what might feel right then is
do you know what should have probably missed a few trips really and just done the school run a little bit more and
and i know that you know you you have to you really have to understand where you are in life this is great for your
mental health as well and your sanity you got to be honest with yourself and and you gotta understand the situation
i know exactly where i'm at what i'm thinking what i'm doing the sacrifices i'm making
what i could do better at what you know but i'm okay with it you know you can't get the perfect
balance but as long as you understand what is going on and you're not deluded
you're not stubborn yeah i know i know i need to do more at home
i know i need to do more school runs i know i need to be less short with the wife sometimes but can you
there's a couple of points here that i think are super interesting so um that death bed moment what i think it's
doing and i've never been there you've not been there but what i think it's doing is it's telling you what actually mattered
because to some degree i think that it's it's like with that hindsight you can say [ __ ]
that person criticizing my hair or my cut or this none of that [ __ ] ever mattered all of that was trivial but the things that
mattered was you say like my niece or my you know so i think that's what that moment so that comes over time how do you now
2017. okay you're a baby yes right when i was 27 what what people thought of me really
mad you know i mean listen i've been working out for 35 years just to stay fat
you know it's going a little bit i could not give her monkeys now at your age oh wait i was
you know i might have been jack the lad i might have been turning out that but deep down you know i'd only take one of the boys
to say you know tell you what edge you're putting on a bit of timber there oh look look you're barnett's creeping back
what what do you mean what do you mean now okay yeah mate i know listen signing the times isn't it so
being comfortable with yourself is the best feeling in life you know it's the best feeling in life and i
think when i was growing up at school i wasn't subconsciously i think i had a massive chip on my shoulder and that's why i was
a bit of a bit of a knob to be to be quite honest but when you get comfortable with yourself it's a
beautiful thing in life it really is you know when you wake up in the morning and you've always got to try for me and look
good and feel good and be the best version of yourself you can be but you do get to a stage and that's actually when you become really powerful
and effective you know it's the same kind of thing you know when you're young and you're courting or you're looking for
a young lady to show you some interest you know when you try really hard and you're sort of on edge and you be
don't really like my hair or oh god you know you know the ones that walk into the bar and just go oh my
you know i know i'm not the best but you know they're the ones that everybody gravitates to anyone with a smile on
their face is always creates so much more energy and flow and the people that
don't and and that's about being comfortable in yourself so i think that it's very difficult with
everything you've achieved at your age to just know where you're going or what you're doing i'm done do you know what i mean i'm i'm married
i've got two kids i've got business i'm struggling to balance everything you know but i'm here you know i'm not
gonna roll back the the years and do this and do that and i know exactly what i'm doing i know exactly where i'm at
i know exactly what i'm focusing on and that life starts to become a lot easier then at your age you know i went to work i left
college after my levels i went to work for five years in sports management companies and event management companies
i was a sports agent on a pga tour in america i had no idea where i was going
i mean i just wanted to be successful i wanted to earn money you know but the mindset of
or the changing mindset over the years is unbelievable i always say to people now what matters to you now you will
look back on when you get to my age and go i can't believe i even used to worry about stuff like that
and that that's important because i i feel like people that are very successful you know you did it at a very young age
very impressive because i think it takes time now when i did the cambridge uh talk the other day
you know you're sitting down with all these young i mean i'm i'm i'm street smart and i can sell
right these people are like yeah i'm jealous of boffins i used to take the mickey out of boffins
i'm jealous of boffins now i find intellectual people fascinating i love talking to them and just trying to learn and absorb and
i'm sitting in this room with people and they're listening to me and i'm thinking you know firstly you must be listening
to me thinking this boat who is he what is he a car used car dealer something like that
and then but i'm i'm talking around i'm saying to you what do you want to do uh
you know what what is success to you they've not got a clue and it's not because they're oxford and
they're deluded it's because that's just it's very difficult that age to understand i don't believe anyone at faulty looks
back at what they were thinking at 20 and said yeah i had this plan i'm there now and this is what i always wanted to do
so it takes time to develop a passion for something and that that is the that's a key word passion because when
we talk about being relentless and we talk about this work ethic you can only have it if you love what
Is ambition choice?
you do and if you have a passion for what you do i don't think you can trick yourself you can but you can't be as good you
know you know you said um earlier that you you feel like you're self-aware of like the the lack
of balance in your life because you've got this real relentless streak you've got this family and you're self-aware of it
do you think as much as you're aware of it do you think deep inside you you really
have a choice or do you think you're being somewhat
dragged by your own ambition because this is what i find fascinating about people successful people is it tends to be the
case that like me i'm aware i need to see my niece more but i just sometimes don't feel like i
have i'm fully in control well i i do it because it's what i want to do
ultimately i mean i do have an obligation you know i do have responsibilities i'm talking about in the workplace sure
you know we've got a fantastic team here but ultimately when we're announcing a show when we're doing a press conference when we do they
want me sure they want their flesh so they roll me out and i'm just like i'm like a traveling salesman right eddie
announcing the show today off you go right here we go bubba back in the car here we go you know what so but i do it because i enjoy it
because i love it because i have an obligation to do it for the business
that my father created and of my responsibility now
is to take that to the next level you know he built this from the foundations from nothing i'm not going to let it just fizzle out
as he goes into his 80s i want to take it to the next level but the difference is is i don't have to
do this you know i'm not looking at this it's my way out um you know i'll just if i just make
some money i can you know i can buy the lamborghini or i could have done that at 21. but imagine the eddie that that doesn't do this
imagine what how do you feel but the same thing it was that was me at school now that was the kid telling the
teachers i don't have to do that you know that runs shivers down me give me some
Finding the work life balance for a relationship
advice on um because you've got you're married and i'm i genuinely even genuinely no it sounds crazy but
i'm like you've managed to crack it seems like because you're married um crack the balance of being relentless on
one end but then managing to find a person or to at least keep them happy to some degree but yeah
i spoke to her but i genuinely i started to think of the the last couple years i'm like how am i going to find someone that understands that i
want to send text messages at 4 am in the morning and that i sometimes don't want to talk to them and that when i'm satisfied i'll
be quiet for seven hours because i've just got an email that i'm thinking about and so i'm like is it that you have to find the right person is it something
you say to them i think they need to know you they need to know
what drives you i mean if you had a conversation with my wife and you said what what is he like
you know she just go well he's just in his own world isn't he i mean the amount of times you know that moment where you get home
and they go right i need to talk to you and you go into the kitchen and they go right now isabella you know i spoke to her teacher
today and um i'm gone right so i'm good i'm going and i'm thinking that contract's gonna
be in at 9pm you know and she goes to me what did i say and i'll go this is cool what is it and she's just
she but it's not like and she'll go listen we have blazing rounds you know you're you know you're so selfish all you care
about is work you know but you again it just gets to a point where you just have to understand
life you just nothing's perfect you know you've got two people that love each other i've known her since you know my 20s
i've i've changed we've both changed a lot over the years but we've changed together and we've grown together
and this is what i do you know and i would have had that conversation with her at some point many years ago to the point saying look
nothing's going to get in my way i i don't mean to sound horrible and i love you and you know i want to spend
the rest of my life with you but you have to understand me you have to understand that this is
extremely important to me not don't say this is the most important thing to me because that'll get you bang
in trouble but this is extremely important to me and i think because she's been around my family because she knows
how important it is to us she kind of just gets it you know and there'll be times where
she'll say did i hear you on the phone last night at five o'clock in the morning i say yeah you know who's doing the
canelo deal or you know aj do or she'll just look at me and go but over
time you know i think they might the most difficult thing is the early stages of dating because it's very difficult
for a woman that they want your attention you know people people sometimes think that women want
uh you know money and you know the nice house and of course everybody does but they don't really
they want your attention and they want your company and they want your time and there are three things that are very difficult to do
when you live that kind of lifestyle so you do have to you know we'll do i'll race back from somewhere and i'll
say right you know tonight let's go for dinner and i'll be naked i don't you know hopefully she don't listen to this i
really don't want to go for dinner tonight but you have to do it and that's what my dad has kind of always taught me
something you've got to do you've got big we're big family people my mum is from from the east end
she's old school as far as they're concerned the man goes out and puts the bread on
the table and the wife looks after the man old old old world that don't exist
anymore but every morning or every night my mum will iron my dad a shirt
and she will put it on his on the door for him in the morning if you want if your wife right say i say
we put her in this room we sat her down with god and he said listen you can decide what happens next with eddie and his career
right so you can we can bring it to an end and he'll spend more time with you what do you reckon she would do she
could make the decision on you your relentlessness and your career how do you honestly think she would make
that i think she because she knows how important is to me i think she would say
no he he he he needs to do it he has to do it but i think the i think the hope is that
there is an end place or an end goal for me yeah but for me i don't
whether in 20 years time we we play this back i don't think i want to be 70
you know maybe even 60 70 80 doing this dealing with problems and
listen maybe i won't even make it that long but for me i definitely have the mindset
of not i want to get in and get out but i do want to get that moment
where i do sit on the beach with a cigar don't even smoke you guys but you know and a whiskey don't even like whiskey
but you know i couldn't imagine the picture at least and go do you know what we've done it
we've done well but walking away is the thing that at the moment would kill me you know to be able
imagine when you wrap up shop and you know this might be i mean for us we've gone from being a family business
you know to having four employees to now all of a sudden having hundreds employees
in in multiple offices around the world we're being approached by for for investment for takeover for
ipos and now we're sort of at that stage of growth where i don't know i just see i see a i see a faster exit
strategy than my dad at least that's what i'm selling to her you know just give me a few more years
just give me a few more but i do want to go and enjoy because i can't say i'm not enjoying myself because i love what i do but i do want
that moment to just you know but it's the walking away you know how do you just one day turn around and you might sell
the business or you know you might float and you take a more of a backseat role that's difficult
because we make our own decisions we're a hands-on business that's what we love we've we've turned down investment and opportunities for years because we don't
wanna i don't wanna ball the directors we we make the decisions and we do what we wanna do because we
love what we do but when you see such growth and you see such interest and you see
the opportunity for you know a much vaster wealth being quite honest
do you want it and if you want it what's the exit strategy because at the moment the exit strategy
for our family is from the day you start working from the day you die you work your nuts off
every single day i mean it's not particularly advanced is it that strategy but that's just what we've always done
mental health big topic you know especially over the last 10 years i think if you go back well 10
years ago and you said the word mental health people think people are crazy right they think like um run away from that person but now it's
become like the opposite it's like oh someone's got you know it's become something of where you'd give someone affection and you take care
of them because the stigma's somewhat changed we know the stats around male mental health
have you ever suffered from any sort of mental health um predicaments
this is my favorite day of the week my all-time favorite flavor of huel
berry i went up to hill's office in tring last week and had another tour around their headquarters and so
pretty amazing they have this massive massive gym as you would you would you would expect but the thing that i didn't realize
about huel was that it's also a vegan product and also i didn't realize their commitments
to sustainability now there's tons of reasons why you might choose to become a hooligan like me i've been drinking here for about three
years long before they um decided to help me with the podcast and to sponsor us but i never realized that element of it
the reason i've always consumed tool is because of convenience right um some people might consume it because
it's nutritionally complete um which i guess is part of the reason i did as well and then some people might
consume it because it's affordable but for me i never because i'm not vegan i never realized it was vegan i never
realized their efforts around sustainability and i never realized it was also gluten-free because again that's not a
problem i have and so on this week's episode of the podcast that's the key message that i wanted to get across
is that if you are vegan and a lot of people don't know this a lot of my friends didn't know this hewl is vegan too um
and this is my all-time favorite flavor which is berry um for me it tastes great um
20 grams of protein i'm currently trying to get in better shape as you i hope some of you have been able to notice if you've seen
the podcast on youtube if you're listening on youtube right now um yeah and i love it and this is why it's so awesome to work with a brand that you
believe in because their impact on the environment is low they are good for you nutritionally it's
super convenient and if you have the berry one it tastes unbelievable so what a what a
win-win-win-win-win for me it was working with you because um i get to tell you guys about something that i would swear by
and i don't have to be dishonest with you um if you look at my fridge right now maybe you should take a look at it it's
pretty much all heal i'm not advocating to have a heal-only diet but
that kind of speaks to the nature of my life and how busy i am and and how many meals i was missing before
i became a heel again have you ever suffered from any sort of mental health um predicaments
Your experience with mental health
i don't think so no i mean i think again depression's one of those things a
bit like yoga and breathing and stuff we were talking about earlier if you would have said to me 10 years
ago listen maybe even five or six years ago so and so suffering from depression
if if your perception of that person is well he's young he's good looking
he's healthy he's rich he's successful how can he be struggling from depression
what a load of rubbish and actually it takes the older generation even longer i mean i think my dad's only just accepted now that it
exists with people because his mentality is what dust yourself down what's the
matter with you and it's that's you know that that's wrong because it is real you know and it does exist um i don't
you know have i had days where i've been feeling incredibly down yeah but surely that's normal you know i don't i
don't see myself suffering from that and i think i think mental health problems and depression i think it comes from
overthinking you know my um my brother-in-law is hilarious he just i've never known
anyone who just overthinks and worries about stuff you know you're gonna be
having a conversation you'll go i've just been thinking about that you know and and if that happens i was thinking you know next year you could be there and
now and then from there it's like whoa whoa whoa what are you doing just when you're struggling mentally
focus on the short term focus on day by day i think sometimes people look at and
this is the same for business when you have a project or a long-term plan there are
so many short-term obstacles and goals to overcome to get there that's why many times you spoke someone
got this idea you know i'm going to be doing this and that and that and then a month later you've not even heard about it oh well what happened was
we launched and then you know the council came in or the regulation board came in and and this other company tried to do this
and and it just it's like no because you didn't focus on the short-term goals all you were worried about
was the house and the lamborghini and you weren't prepared to to tick the boxes to get there so sometimes when i'm a little bit off
or you know it might be traveling a lot and the equilibrium has gone and it's like okay so i'm just gonna write down what i'm
gonna do today and it can be really menial stuff it could be walk the dog you know it could be
finalize a contract could be go to the gym it could be go and get some food you know from
work just to say and and i would tick everyone off really yeah and i would say at the end of the day i would look at it
and i'll go done and that's the momentum back that that's where you get the feeling of accomplishment even even
on tiny things say okay i'm moving in the right direction for me that that is a big help for me he's
short-term focus because once you start worrying about what's going to happen next week or next month or next year
no and you're going to start driving yourself crazy you've just got to say okay this is what i need to do today and
tomorrow i need to do the same thing and then before you know it you'll start making positive changes you'll start achieving because you know
what what you've set the targets you've set yourself you are achieving you're a bit of a philosopher i don't know if you realize because um
there's a great famous philosopher that says uh depression is too much of the past and anxiety is too much thinking too much about the future and
he says the cure is more now and that's pretty much what you've done yeah that's true because you can't worry about things that may or may not happen
and you can't change things that have already happened what you can do is change what is happening today and it's simple to do that again in in
the book i ran a marathon one marathon right because my dad ran loads and he took the mick out i mean i had to do it
and it's the same kind of thing you start the marathon you think 26 miles if you start thinking about
running 26 miles i mean i it did give me anxiety attacks to start with i was thinking
that's just ridiculous i've never done more than 10k and then you train you train you train and you build and then
every mile marker is an obstacle you start off you think 26 miles by me
and you go one two three four five and you're you're okay and then and then you're 12 13 you think i've done half and you get to 18 19 you think
i can't do it anymore and you think just get to 20 get to 2021 and when you see that 20 mile marker
you know and then you get to 20 and you go do you know what i've still got six miles i can't do it and you go 21
22 23 and then when it's all over you can look back but if you start worrying about the future you're going to get out
you're not going to make it do you feel that anxiety sometimes in those big moments where you've got you know some things coming up and you
just can't stop thinking about it um in my business it was actually the first you know i heard this term mental health and
i think at the start i thought nah it's not real and then a couple of years in i see a lot of people i just started
hearing you know friends of mine and stuff going through really bad things i'm like i think it's real and then i got to this point where i was always scared to admit
that it would be real because i almost felt like if i admitted it was real then i'm like welcoming the
possibility into myself of like labeling myself something and then there was one moment where i
had this really big decision to make in new york and i'm laying in the hot tub in manchester and
i just got really anxious and i was anxious for about four days up until the point of the decision
and then i thought that's probably the closest i've come to some kind of mental health predicament is that real
anxious feeling that i couldn't shake i think social media is horrendous as well like
Social media
i've made the decision in the last couple of years years specifically to start ignoring and
blocking out a lot of um you're a celebrity now yeah
but when i was coming through when i was overturning the system the support was unreal and i was really
feeding off that i mean anyone that says you know they're not affected by criticism or they're not
worried about i mean that's a load of rubbish of course you don't like people criticizing you and by the way you love
people patting you on the back and championing you of course it's natural what things get to you though
stuff that people like the personal stuff couldn't give couldn't give monkeys about it's more
about the it's it's more about people when you're putting the work in
something and you're so passionate about something and you're actually working for the good of might be the sport or whatever
it's the people that just you know presume see you completely differently so that's the frustration but over the last
couple of years i just started thinking to myself what are you i was having a conversation with man my old man's on twitter right and he
phoned me at me ago i'm having an argument with this giza on twitter right and he was going on about the snooker in the format
and i said to him i'm like whoa whoa whoa whoa i said are you serious i said who is one who is this boat i
said you imagine someone stopping you on the street and having a pop at you about the snooker format but it also it's it's the
platform that made us what we are it got us to the top you know the interaction with
the fans and the understanding of their mindset so we can't just you know but it's become a toxic place
it really has you know and i worry for i worry for my kids you know sometimes one of them be on
tick tock and she'll put a dance out and someone will come back and say say you know i don't know uh you're ugly you
look really you're stupid you know and it's like we never had that now they i mean we never even had a phone you
know if someone didn't like you they might say something in the playground but that's about it so we live in a world of criticism and i
think it's a negativity but that's what i said to my old man said you imagine like these people
they're all doing it all day i'll put a post out and it's the same ones all the time i don't think you know i mean even um to
the point where someone posted my phone number on twitter right and i've had my phone
number for 25 years same one right and someone posted it and
went give it this is eddie hearn's number give him a call and you know tell him what you think about the pay-per-view
price or whatever it is and my phone was going men's like it was like every literally all day it was just private
number private number and i thought you know what you got to change your number and i thought i can't be bothered so i started
answering a few right and to this day this was a few years ago it's that people still do it and there's
this one guy you've got the same number yeah i can't be bothered to change it right so this guy's private number private
number private number and it's all day right so i pick it up and i go
hello mate and he goes oh bloody hell eddie and i go yeah how you
doing mate and he goes uh um when you're gonna stop ripping us off on
the paper views or something like that right and i go and it and i went to him mate let's have
a serious conversation what are you doing and he goes what do you mean
what am i i said have you got a job and he's like uh yeah i mean i said you haven't have
you and he's like well not not at the moment i said what are you doing
i said how many times have you phoned me today oh i mean the answer was like 40
right i said you can't focus i said all the energy you're putting into phoning me because
you think it's banter or is some kind of accomplishment if i pick up the phone i said put it into
something worthwhile i said because you really waste in your life and he just went quiet and he's like uh
oh come on no eddie what about a few quid off the paper view and i'm like no no mate i'm serious but i want to help you
you've got to you've got to change you know and then you just hung up and i thought [ __ ] okay but it's true
isn't it what are you doing what are you doing i mean all right once might be quite funny you know i'll pick it up and you give me a bit
but all day every day you know because i'd hate to be one of those people that just wakes up every morning
with no fire in the belly with no passion with nothing and there are by the way that's 95 of
the population many people it's why it's so important to me here to create an environment a mattreum for
the for the team where you enjoy being there you know we've got we get food together we've got
a gym we've got a pool we've got we're all traveling away to events we'll have a night out do that because you can't be in a job or a life where
you just flat how am i going to get the best out of you if you don't love what you do and it's very difficult to have that same
passion when it's not your business you know so motivation is important but
I don't like being a celebrity
you know frank said to me he said he said uh you know eddie's a and he's a businessman that's that's
where you came from your dad's a businessman too and with this new age of social media and all the interviews you do on youtube and you are relentless
with the interviews as well by the way and i was when i saw you in new york uh on that rooftop with like the nice
garden stuff yeah you were back to back to back doing those interviews with all these bloggers for three hours
that's helped grow the business it's why most people know matroom especially of this generation but it's
made you a celebrity and frank said to me he said i don't think he's enjoying the celebrity thing you know and i think a
lot of people would be really really surprised to hear that because you know
people would they think that you'd love it they think you love the attention i mean promoters are in the business of attention right
but from a personal perspective apparently you don't like it you don't like the celebrity i then set out to be a celebrity and i
set out to be a businessman i set out to um continue the success that my dad built
but i do recognize that if i am well known if i am a showman if i am a
celebrity it will help me push my events it will help me push the profile
of fighters you know you get to a stage now where the industry haters might say oh well
it's ridiculous he's doing all these interviews you know he's more popular than most of his fighters
you know more popular as a wrong word well known than zombies but that's me you know i look at the success of the ufc i look at the growth
of of that business and dana white and every major fight sport um product has that lead guy
in wwe it's vince mcmahon you know in mma it's dana white and in boxing i guess it's me or you know i want it to be me
so there's a method to the madness and but you know the book
the book was something that i wanted to do because i just thought it was funny that i would ever write a book right how
do you think it's funny no but if you knew me at school and you knew i just it was more like
hodder put it to me during before lockdown and when lockdown come i panicked and i was like
oh and next you know talk about being at home with you kids now i'm at home with my kids and i've got no events
and oh so i was just like for those first two weeks i was just right we launched a fitness show with
sky that people could do at home fight and fit you know i've said to the guys here give me that book deal i'll write it now
let's do the book now and i wrote it in lockdown you know and it was just zooms more zooms more
interviews because i just i was just scared of not having that drive every single day of you know going
out there and and and i didn't enjoy it like an illness he's an illness let's be honest we're
all sick aren't we i mean like you can't do you can't wake up in the night every night
and start writing emails doing contracts texting people right and then wake up at
seven and do the school run and then drive to work and do it all over again every single day unless you're a little bit ill in the
head you can't actually be still like so when you talk tell her about that cigar moment in the future
sitting on that beach i didn't believe you for a second yeah you're probably right but i just i'd like to think that it's at least what i'm telling to miss is
that one day we'll be we'll chill out you know what i mean could you imagine laying on a beach with a cigar like this no emails no nothing
just no fights coming up nothing just meditating no but i think it all depends where you
get to you know it's like when you're building your stack at poker you know the problem with gambling is you never
know when to walk away right and we're not gambling anymore because we're very good at what we do
but life is always a gamble so when you build your stack it's that moment when you say to the
cashier can i get a rack please and you put it in your rack yeah and you
go up to the cashier's desk and you say cash out in for me and i go sue and you walk away and you go yeah
and then you get sit down you're gonna have a nice beer but that moment sucks you said the moment the that moment
doesn't suck but then after again it's the thrill isn't it yeah i like to win i like people
so the thing that would hurt me more is if i turn around tomorrow and win i couldn't have done any more in boxing
i'm out bye what would hurt me more is sitting on the beach not not you know enjoying myself going
now i'm gone all those people that i was fighting again for all those years to become number one they've got no
they're back you know they're back and that's what my dad walked away from boxing because it is the most um aggravating
business an intense business and that's what i'm saying about it all throughout the night because everyone's trying to [ __ ] you
non-stop right so you have to sleep with one eye open and i think he got to a stage where he went i don't want to do this anymore i'm
going to go and do darts where everyone's going to love me do what i mean and i'm jealous of look at that because i saw growing up
this guy that was so intense and who had a bad temper and you know and then all of a sudden once
boxing went he was just chilled out wow i can't believe what's happened to my life so
you know i i hate to let people win and if i left ultimately they would win but i guess
the only time you can walk away is when you're content and will the contentment ever come
at the moment like you say possibly not but who knows you know who knows where we can build to where we can get to
where it might be that moment and again you have to always leave the option open because as i said
your thoughts at 20 are totally different to your thoughts at 30 and 40 and 50. i may get to 50 and we
may be you know i've had another great 10 years and i might go fire's not there anymore i'm done or i
might be saying right now i want to take over music now i want to take over football now you know so it's difficult to say
Selling Matchroom
and with the family businesses they're a very special thing and in the world in the world we live in today
these big global corporations and the public markets growing it's very rare for a family business to withstand the
temptation of acquisitions or going public or whatever what
who can you don't have a son right and uh i'm wondering who continues the
family business if you were to go down that route is it no well that's a good point because that
is the the conversation you know ever since i started to
understand business more for me that that is a natural progression of a family business
to go family business you know investment or acquisition or ipo and that's what you
do because how do you i have i have aspirations for this business to grow
globally and to study staging events in every major territory in the world you know to do that does require
huge investment does it does require you know management it and we can do it but that's not our
speciality our speciality is creating great live events for our broadcasters and fans
okay so my dad has always said to me i will never ever ever
take investment for the business float the business or sell the business and i've always
over the years gone yeah but you know it's gotta we gotta get to it and actually
the the something's quite interesting you know i've been blessed with two amazing daughters of course every man with quite a lot of son didn't
work out that's what god gave me but there is it's an interesting point because
my end goal if i had a son and listen only 41 who knows but i think it would be more
you know here we go again down the line kind of thing with me i would quite like
to end the journey with my dad joe to me to say
look at what we you know not it's gone but look at where we started look at
where we finished because it's very difficult and i take the interest
from you know hedge funds and you know investment funds with unbelievable amount of compliment
to say well you know and the calls are coming in non-stop because they appreciate the model of growth where when we talk
about one sport one promoter one belt you know that mindset it's a carbon copy of the ufc now the
ufc sold 4.6 billion there is no reason why boxing
with with so much more history with so much more credibility with fans and broadcasters
can't replicate that model and actually be even more valuable than the ufc business
and i'm really the only chance it has to do it it's not going to be bob harrem
it's not going to be don king it's not going to be frank warren it's going gonna be me so all of a sudden i've been giving
interviews like that and then the calls are coming well right we want you know and it's like guys we're not we don't need it we're
not if i wanted to go and get funding if i wanted to go and float i'll do it tomorrow but it's a big
it's a big you know head-butting system with me and me and my dad and you know he's starting
to look and i'm just saying we can't just be blind to it it's a natural progression for any
business in terms of growth to look at these models and but is that why you're doing the business
because you know the happiness you've got from this business i i would guess and i run i ran a public
business until recently um much of it aggravation loads you don't necessarily want right quarterly
reported you gotta hit the numbers if you don't then you've got to do something short term that's not necessarily in the long term interest of the business
right so i i i'm almost quite jealous of the setup you have the control you
have you have it in your family and you're happy but but you're someone that almost needs forward
momentum to continue to be to be just growth isn't it you know you know that as a family business you know we we
you know you can see in our financial results we're fantastic you know we're a huge uh family business in terms of the
numbers that we're delivering year on year end yes but at the same time
you're almost capped by the growth and by the numbers within the currents within that setup
yeah you know okay so when you start you turn a break-even business into a
a 5 million ebitda company and then before you know it the aim is 10 and 15 and now we're 30 and you know but
how'd you get to 4 billion why does 4 billion matter that's just the ufc number you know so but
because why it matters is it was never on the agenda it was never
possible it could never be done and i guess it goes back to the competition with my dad where i'm saying
you know i believe you know when you talk about pe ratios and the value of a business yeah we know
what we're worth now but i do believe we have the potential to be worth those kind of numbers
and that would be your success in some respects it's a game it's a game steve it's not i
don't know it's not like i don't i don't think that deeply to i
just see it as a game but when you start thinking deeply it doesn't make you question so yeah it's good point why does
i don't know i i just i live in the moment i live in now i just feel that every day we're trying to expand we're
trying to push the boundaries of trying to do more so would i like to this business to you
know sell or have a value of for [ __ ] right why because it could it's ridiculous we're
just a couple of like he's out of dagnam i'm his son would be a great story yeah but it
it's just it's us against the world because the money would do to be honest nothing the money wouldn't change my lifestyle
at all i'm not i've got a couple of nice cars right i got a nice house i don't want a yacht i don't want to jet
i don't want i mean well i mean we'll talk about it but you know i don't i don't want for anything i'm not
i'm at the age now maybe when i was in my twenties yeah wow yeah private jet he got you
just rent it if you need it so it's just it's just the fact that what we've done i think i think legacy
is um i was talking to freddie flintoff on my podcast and i said i said about
legacy and he went yeah i think legacy's a load of bollocks i actually i disagree a little bit because
you know when you go back to that moment where you're on your deathbed and you might be today or
and when you've achieved something like that you just you put yeah you start laughing you got i can't believe we've done it i
can't believe we've done it and that would be the better kind of memories or the achievement to me you know
can you believe we've done it but you've got to enjoy it at the same time but you know i don't know it's you could you
can debate this all day long because you sit back on the death bed and you say yeah but was i really happy
of course because this is bringing us happiness this is i know that every day i come in here
and i'm smiling and i'm up for it and i'm passionate and i'm full of energy and i've got a drive and a fire in my
bed that's good enough for me my dad comes in every day has been coming here you know into this off into this business for
50 45 years and he's got the same passion the same energy that he did when he
first started the company that's got to tell you something and this is almost somewhat of a contradiction because he's
coming in here every day you're both really really happy you're coming in here with a fire on your belly but then there's this other part of you
that's like but we need the end point yeah he doesn't he doesn't he he
he doesn't want any of that you know he's going ah son we've got the most amazing business you know we're forecasted to just for
continued growth for the next five ten years we've got broadcast contracts locked in
we're untouchable and i'm like yeah but how do we go you know i want offices you
know we have offices in in england in new york in milan in madrid i want offices in sydney in
toronto in mumbai in beijing that that's what i want why because we're not supposed to have it
we were never supposed to be this business i was never supposed to be this kid so it sounds like you're proving something to
somebody maybe but probably to him and if that's what it comes down to
which comes back to your childhood probably and if you prove that to him right you have all these offices around the world
you sell for five billion will that make you happy probably not but i don't know i i i don't think that
rebellion for 5 billion and making a load of money will make me happy it will make me happy to be able to say
i can't believe we've done it you know i can't believe what we've achieved but then you'll need the next thing part possibly
or that might be the the cigar on the beach moment i wrote i wrote this one sentence in my book where i
started to understand the moment i described at the start when someone made me an offer for my business and i looked at it when i was 23 and i
thought we've got 25 million quid [ __ ] and then what i learned in that moment is
my whole life became so confused and i almost fell into like i'd call it chaos and so in my book i write that we live
our lives thinking that we're striving for stability which would be completed goals the cigar um
thinking that stability of stability and that we're trying to escape chaos but what i came to learn was
in fact um our stability is chaos it's the having unanswered goals and
it's the problems and it's the forward motion so our chaos is stability and our
stability the cigar moment would actually feel like chaos yeah it would feel like some kind of text if it wasn't time
if it wasn't time and we don't know when it'll be time yeah but what you just said there is very true because
like any athlete that moment when they're in the chaos is where they
feel most at peace with themselves you speak to any fighter and you say where would you rather be
anywhere in the world and say in the ring and that's the same for us so it's not like i want aggravation but
stick me in it put me in front of problems and and tell me i can't do something
that's where i'm in my moment am i in my moment where i'm sitting at home
you know watching tv no i'm i'm at my best when i'm doing those 100 200 interviews
or i've got problems or a fight's falling through and you know all of a sudden the shit's hit the fan that's when i'm at my
best so and that's where i do feel calm in a way you know at first when you have problems you know it might
be a panic but for me okay this is what we do we go to work now you know and that's that's the same for an
athlete or a fighter that's when they feel calm when you might be watching going
because that's not your your calm that's not your your moment it's their moment i'm fine you know when
aj fights he ain't nervous i'm [ __ ] [ __ ] myself because i can't control it it's not me it's not
what i do but that's what he does you know when when a fight's falling through or it looks like a massive
show's about to be cancelled and other people in here might be oh oh do you think you'll be all right do you think we'll do
well and i'll just lock the door and say right leave me alone and i go to work that's my that's that's no problem for
me you know but but you only become exceptional at things and used to things
when you become familiar with them and when you put yourself in the same position time and time again
it's all about frank you know we we always laugh about him giving his press conferences you know because when i did my first
ever press conference which was audrey harrison against david haye i couldn't stop shaking you wouldn't have known it the time but i put my
hands on the table like this and i and i could i could feel them you know i could i could see them going so i just when i spoke i just put them
underneath my legs like this and just leant forward and you would never have known and when i done the next one a little
bit less and the next one and then within five or six i never needed notes i just speak you
know four hours i couldn't believe it and with frank you know he done one recently and i could see him shaking you know i
was just taking the piss out of him and i just said just keep doing it keep doing it repetition repetition keep putting yourself in situations
steve davis who is my godfather i said to him once how do you you know when you
you talk about sort of sports where millimeters make a difference it's
nothing more than snooker you know i said how do you do not get nervous you know you're about to go down to pot the
blackboard and just little one little jolt and it's all over and he said i have no nerve endings
he said because i've been put in the position time and time again in the end it's just it's second
nature it's just like riding a bike and that's that's what the same with business you have to keep putting yourself in a
position time and time again and you'll keep improving listen thank you for your time today
no it's another counselling session yeah you know i'm going to leave it now and go away you know i think the best the best thing
you can talk about mindset and and mentality and
for hours and hours and hours just keep it simple don't over complicate things don't
overthink things be happy keep smiling that's difficult when you want something so bad and you're chasing it but if you start to
really overanalyze that's when you know things start creeping in just keep it simple
and um you know i said sometimes if things get tough or you know we've got problems and i'll say
tomorrow man he said don't worry he said just wake up an hour earlier tomorrow and go to bed an hour later
i'm thinking that's so that's so and he is the most simple mindset but it works for him because you and the
best thing you can do is be honest with yourself as well just try and understand take a step back and just
think about what is happening in the world and your world right now and if you can understand it you can
deal with it and you can solve it but just think simple thank you
you

Transcription:


Intro
honesty really really matters and i think much of the reason why i started this podcast was to give
the world the much needed honesty it needs but often doesn't get you hear success stories that are glamorized and that are oversimplified
but that's rarely rarely the case this week's guest will give you exactly that raw
unfiltered honesty like you've never heard it before and in some points honestly that might make you
a little bit uncomfortable it made her uncomfortable it made me uncomfortable this week i'm joined by
chrissy chella she's an unbelievable and in my opinion heavily underrated entrepreneur running
multiple multi-million pound businesses she's one of the uk's number one fitness creators
athletes whatever you want to call her she's an author her book is coming out in january
she has a remarkable story one that starts from very very humble beginnings as an immigrant that was
bullied on the playground in the uk and what you'll find out about her is inspiring it's captivating
it's real one of the most amazing conversations i've ever had on this podcast and i'm so glad that we can bring you
her story in this way told with total honesty without further ado i'm stephen bartlett
and this is the dire rover ceo i hope nobody is listening but if you are then please keep this to yourself
as i did a little bit of research on you and i got to sort of uncover your story and i got to
stalk you a little bit on social media um the more and more that i observed and sort of looked
past your instagram feed the more i saw a pretty remarkable
entrepreneur and business person and one of the thoughts that came to my mind and you know this podcast is all about
speaking the truth and being honest was this question which is do you think that you get the credit you
deserve as an entrepreneur that's the question
Justifying myself as a woman
um it's not about me i haven't built a community about me i've built a
community about helping other women and i think that
it's never fully been about me and the credit that i get is seeing other
women thrive and succeed and come together and that for me is enough credit i don't
need an award i don't need someone to say oh my god you're the best business woman in the world for me when i see or when i read another
woman's story that for me is enough i don't need anything else
so yeah i do so because i was when i i was watching some of your stories on instagram and you you run an office right
of people you run multiple businesses right and i typically think that people
are very very quick to arrive at judgement when they see a pretty young lady who's worked out on
instagram who has a big following and they t and this is just being completely honest they tend to come to judgments very quickly a conclusion a
conclusion yeah and that that conclusion and that narrative or that image that they form of that person i've come to learn is usually severely
wrong 100 it is and you know it's funny you say that because i've also been on multiple dates with people
and you know they see my instagram following and they automatically assume that oh it's because you get your ass
out that's that's that's why you make money or it's because you get your ass out that's why you've built what you've built
and the truth is if i did that and if that was the fundamental reason then i wouldn't have
a team of 30 people in one company and building another company that sells out every time we
restock it goes past being a pretty face or a pretty picture it goes past being a nice body it's
about the message that you have it's about what you want to truly truly put out in the world and i
think if people make that conclusion it says more about them than it does to me does it make you feel though
and i want you to be really honest here how does it make you feel i think okay like i'm gonna be complete honestly
i think it's one thing to be judged and it's another thing to be judged as a woman
okay so why is it that when you see a handsome man you don't come to a conclusion that he
only got what he got because he's handsome why is that as a woman i have to justify myself more
i have to explain myself more all the time it's draining i shouldn't have to
explain myself my face my body all of this stuff it's just external you know and
i think that can i swear on this question
i smell my youtube all the time some people get offended and i'm like listen this is this is who i am something else yeah no it pisses me off
it pisses me off but at the same time it's like it feeds me right you know it feeds me like piss me
off even more because that's how i thrive you you saying to me i can't do something you saying to me that i only
got there because of this and that it pushes me more to achieve more
and yeah i mean it's their problem not mine i guess there's a lot of you know let's just for
a second imagine that that judgment of you was correct and that you'd got here because you were pretty or whatever or you're
you know you have a great physique or whatever it was um what would they be missing what is
the truth why why did you get here because there are lots of very pretty people out there right
yeah um but for some reason you made it here and i've seen your businesses i've looked
into them you have pretty phenomenal businesses and you're running big teams of people in big
offices so like there's two kind of thoughts to this but i think the central question that i'm trying to answer for myself is what is it about
chrissy that differentiated you your approach your message and the way that you
connect with people from all of these other people that are trying to do what you're doing
i think in all honesty if i'm if i'm answering that question from a personal perspective
i've always been 100 honest and transparent with who i am you're not gonna find a hidden secret or
some nasty surprise like this is who i am you literally either take it
or you leave it and i'm not going to try and be anything else
to fit in for anybody else you know and for me when i started my fitness
journey when i you know moved countries to england i never felt like i had a sense of home
i never felt like anybody understood me so to be blessed with a platform where i
can build a community and bring women together globally you know this is this goes beyond
me this is about bringing women together that have been abused that have had you know
mental disorders eating disorders such bad things you couldn't even imagine what
women have gone through and have told me to bring them all together and to create this
tribe you know that for me is like i think that's what people see
yeah and i think that's what people believe i want to do because i genuinely do want to do that
and you know one of the things that sorry to interrupt there but i really wanted to one of the things you said was about you
being yourself and i asked you that question actually with a bit of a preconceived idea of what the
answer would be and when i watch you on instagram the feel that i get from you versus
pretty much everybody else other than one other person i've got to be honest and he sat in this chair and he's actually coming back is joe wicks like when i met joix
he is the guy you meet off off off air or whatever is the same guy and
he's so [ __ ] genuine and all he cares about is like genuinely helping people but the reason i said to
joe i said i think the reason you're so successful is because you are yourself and
you will share it all and when i was watching you on instagram and watching some of your videos you cater to the 99 of people's lives
which is the real [ __ ] yeah i saw your video this week you did on your story you're waking up and you're saying
listen i don't want to wake up today and most people don't admit that because you know a lack of perfection is sometimes
perceived as weakness so i wondered how that resonated with you in terms of the importance of your success originating from chrissy
being her truer self yeah you're you can only be the best version of yourself right
and i think if you start trying to be something else soon enough it will come out or you'll start to fall through the
cracks or it will slip something will slip and you can only uphold that image and
you know that presence for so long before it really just [ __ ] up so the only thing you can do is be the
best version of yourself and this is what i tell people all the time it's never been about other
people's perceptions of you it's always been what you think about yourself and if you
truly truly believe in yourself you won't want to be anybody else you
want to you won't want to be fake you wouldn't want to be trying to please everyone my job isn't
to please everyone were you always at that point no tell me about that oh my god no i mean
i remember when i was in a relationship i was 16 years old i was like i'm gonna marry this person i'm so in love like this is it uh and then he cheated
on me and i was like oh [ __ ] this is not it it's his name no he does not deserve the air time i'll
tell you that much but i was heartbroken and i was trying so hard to please this
person you know i was trying so hard even in school i know it sounds petty but i was trying so hard to fit in
all the time all the time i remember like this is so this is not
cute on my end i'ma be honest with you i remember being at school and i'm foreign okay like
i'm mediterranean we're hairy okay and i had a no i had a moustache and the
girls used to rip me for it and i was so sad i was like oh my god why am i not like
these pretty english girls like i don't understand like i used to feel so shitty about myself
constantly trying to like fit in and then when i got cheated on i was like oh my god it must be because i'm not pretty enough
it must be because i'm not sexy enough [ __ ] that that's draining what do you
mean i constantly have to be something else for someone else i'm never gonna be happy and i i wasn't
happy for such a long time so yeah i just i just fully like expose
my moustache story there so let's take us from mustache to self-confidence
um what was that journey and what changed your uh your your self-esteem and your self-confidence what helped you
get that confidence in yourself i think for me it was can we just i think that
should be the podcast title master no no seriously even sarah doesn't know that
i used to have him no guys i'm gonna be honest with you okay like i don't give a [ __ ] i had a
moustache growing up okay and all the girls used to rip me the [ __ ] up they used to be like uh
your man your boy like honestly [ __ ] [ __ ] man and i ate my school
dinner for six months in a toilet because i didn't have any friends do you think that experience is part of
the reason you are who you are today 100 like honestly it's pretty impossible to to break me
Building my confidence with the gym
and when you've broken me understand that you've really like broken me down because it takes a
lot now was that we talk about the mustaf mustache thing is if it was this trivial thing but i'm guessing what
you're saying is you were bullied in school yeah but at the same time it's not like i was constantly bullied like i think
i don't know a lot of us go through awkward stages in school trying to make friends trying to be with a cool gang trying to do this try and do that then
you almost become like mean as well because you're so hurt by everybody else that you only yeah so
i think you know like i remember walking into sixth form one time and a
lot of personal things happened in my life and no one wanted to be around me at that point
and i just hated everyone around me and i was full of anger constant anger
and hate you know and i didn't want to be that person anymore especially after being cheated on i didn't want to be that
person anymore and i remember being on the train one day because i used to work in potter's bar
at the time um in this little men's boutique like retail shop and i was coming back home
and i remember like the penny dropped and i was like i can try so hard to be sexy and cool
and all this stuff other people but i'm not doing anything for myself and that's where the quote do this for
you comes from because i signed up to the gym that day
and then i'll walk straight back out and then go back for two months i'm not gonna lie to you i was signed up and like i'm
gonna do this i'm gonna do this i know what to do signed up didn't come back for two months i was actually actually hanging
back i don't know what to do why didn't you go because i was scared i was like who i was like who do you
who do you think you are crazy trying to be like a fitness girl you don't know what you're doing you know
this was like six years ago you don't know what you're doing go back home relax right relax chill go
to work study relax at some point you must have changed your mind yeah i did i did and evidently i did and
i was like uh okay now i need to do this like what am i doing i'm so lethargic i'm tired all the time i'm
not strong i was never like um overweight or underweight i was just tired all the time and drained
especially mentally so when i got into the gym i remember looking at the leg press machine and i
was like what is this transformer i don't know what the [ __ ] to do with this machine
and everybody else around me seemed to kind of know what to do and then there was like
men there and the women were on the cardio machines and the men were at the weights i didn't care about the cardio machine i
was so intrigued by the weights i was like what why do men go there what is that about
men that go there and women go there i want to go there and i didn't know how to use weights i
didn't know what i was doing i was training i didn't have anything like no one was on instagram at the time
no one was teaching the way social media has literally opened up a book full of information
and free content and we didn't have that at the time i started you know i didn't
know what i was doing it's how did you i learned you learned i just learned i
just was like you know what i'm just going to do this and i kind of i kind of got addicted to
the feeling of how completing a workout made me feel
and i started going again and again and i started learning because what was it doing for you going
it was giving me my therapy therapy from what from life from
my reality from the fact that i was so depressed or with who i was and
so angry at the world and everything the world had done to me
and the only time i felt like i could escape was at the gym which is so crazy
because the gym is like a chore for people i've got a [ __ ] train today but i went there and i escaped
it was therapy and no one could take that feeling away from me
not an ex-boyfriend that cheated on me not a mean girl at school not a horrible boss no one
isn't it funny that so much of you know when you speak to people that have achieved great things
it all seems to have been sparked by like an earlier catalyst of being bullied or feeling insecure and or
inadequate in some way i see the same in myself the reason why i am successful without a shadow of a doubt is because
the feeling of being broke and being inadequate in the area that i lived in and having all the windows on my house
smashed for a decade and the grass being six foot high and but living in all of these around all of these white people zero black people at
my school other than my brother and my other brother that feeling of inadequacy put pressure on me for like 15 16 years
and so my obsession as i wrote in my diary 18 was i'm gonna have uh a million pounds
before i'm 25. i'm gonna have a range river is going to be my first car right couldn't even drive yeah it's so funny i did the same
right i swear and it's so funny you say it was the only black man in your school because i was the only foreign guy on
mine i was trying to contend with this whole idea of having curly hair i was like i i started relaxing it when i was 12 so
it'd be straight and it and and i look back and i think if i hadn't have gone through that in the way that i had you wouldn't be where
you were not a [ __ ] shadow of a doubt and and it's like that pressure releases at some point
in different ways i could have ended up in prison right my my friend said my best friend said to me at 18 he said
steve and i remember where i stood when he said he said you're either going to be a millionaire or you're going to be in prison and i hit me like a ton of bricks
because he was telling the truth i cared so much about escaping from that pressure and from that life that it was going to
channel itself into something so tell me about your diary what did you write your day oh god i remember so funny right
i remember i wrote down and i will never ever forget i wrote down i'm going to be someone one
day i wrote i wrote that down and then i remember you went you have blackberries yeah all right
back in the day and i used the right of my blackberry and i just believed it
and anyway when i went to the gym and kind of figured it out along the way um i fell in love with someone
at the gym like i was going he's now my ex-fiance by the way everyone we're no longer together but he
is a very important person in this story because when i met him i was at rock
bottom but i was also trying to find my feet and i was becoming more confident in
myself and that confidence confidence did grow and attract the person that i was
supposed to be with at the time right because i do believe your your vibe and energy attract the people that you have
around you right and i remember he was driving me to work one day because i was waitressing
and i looked at him and i said i don't know why i started instagram at this point had like 50 000 followers i started
instagram in all honesty i started it just to see how i looked doing exercises
and hollywood recorded me and i was like oh my god i'm gonna break my back i don't know what i'm doing i need to fix
my form but somehow people started loving it and anyway
he was driving me to work and i go jack i don't know why but i feel like we're gonna achieve something
by helping women and generally said to me he goes yeah whatever man you get to work i'll come
pick you up i was like no i feel it and i started crying
crying streams of tears he's like what's wrong with you i was like no i believe
it i don't know what it is this is feeling i can't explain never had that feeling before and
here we are today what do you think that feeling was belief where did that belief come from
me i just believed in me so much that no one not even
you know the person i was with could sway me another way and i do think a lot of that comes from
persevering in the gym and growing that discipline and growing evidence right yeah that you
could right yeah because when you're when you start doing something good for yourself training was good for
me right you start to build these disciplines and habits and consistencies
and they transfer in other aspects of your life it's like a domino effect so
i started becoming more disciplined at university i didn't need 10 cans of red bull to stay awake i was
focused um i would excel all the time and it wasn't because i put in extra
hours it was because i was so hyper focused where i was with who i was i was present
and if it wasn't for the gym i wouldn't be able to have done that so your ex fiance yeah jack
do you think you would have met him had you not built the confidence within yourself or
started to build a confidence within yourself that the gym had given you do you think you would have been ready quote-unquote to have that relationship
with him at that time if you were the old chrissy no um and if i did if i was with someone
at the time i wasn't so confident it would have been the wrong person because you attract the energy that you
have you attract what you believe in yourself if you're constantly negative about yourself if you're constantly just
trying to make yourself believe you're you're just not worthy you're always going to attract that
and don't get me wrong there was like dates in between jack obviously
when i wasn't with him by the way i mean no i mean like after the guy that cheated on me i had like went through
i went for a phase i went through dayton and it's always the wrong guy i was the wrong guy and then it was i realized it's because
i'm trying to find happiness in other people constantly trying to find happiness of people and then when i started focusing
on myself he came along
you know a lot of women when they're in the situation where they're lacking confidence or self-worth or they're
feeling like something is missing will and this isn't just women this is men as well yeah right
they'll think that the answer is a romantic solution yeah right is it no it's not um
i've been there i've done that and obviously i'm speaking from personal experience you could find someone that really helps you you know you could
genuinely find someone who inspires you motivates you pushes you
and that's so remarkable and if you do find that person don't let them go you know but unfortunately if you have
so much self-hatred you are never going to be satisfied in the relationship that you
are in because you constantly have to find that person to give you that happiness you're constantly waiting for that
person to do something for you stable right it's unstable it is a lot of dependency
and um i think that the most rel most important relationship you're ever going to have is going to be with yourself
because when you go to bed at night and you're in your own little thoughts up here right that's you and you that's you and
you so you've got to fix that up here first before you go trying to find a a person to share your life with you
know and you know so you end up you know
jack ends up proposing yeah you you build a business together which is a topic in and of itself which you're
you're still working together with him on now yeah and then at some point you both decide
in a very you know i've listened to your story so you decide in a very amicable mature way that this situation
isn't making both of you right happy yeah and there was a sentence you said where you said um
you and jack grew apart which i found quite curious and i find it curious because on this podcast we've we've been
talking a lot about monogamy for whatever reason and this idea in fact the last guest we had on dr arya
who was you know who people have been really really blown away about um he he was cheated on by his partners you
know and he found out in a really horrific way that she was pregnant with another man yeah i listened to that okay and so on
that sentence about growing apart this makes me ask you the same question about monogamy if it's
possible for you to meet someone and grow apart you know especially you know because everybody's growing in some way
um what are your thoughts on monogamy having been almost to the altar with someone what are your
Growing Apart from my ex
thoughts on monogamy and i can i be honest i mean
please you never have to ask permission again to be honest i've never said this ever and i'm a
little bit nervous to say this but i when i was with jack
i thought that that was my person and i genuinely felt it in my heart and
my soul i never questioned it once right and we grew apart and that's because
a lot of people don't know what was going on behind the scenes last year when i launched toner sculpt with jack we had a lawsuit against
us you know no one really knew about that you know 50 grand in lawsuits trying to
get our app that we we built just to be ours and then build it from the ground up that's why we had
to refurbish and relaunch the programs because everything is now built home grown in our offices with our
technology right and do you know how much pressure that adds to a relationship i can't imagine and you're going home
and you're like what do you mean you don't do this what do you mean you didn't do that hating each other resenting each other
because you think they're to blame he thinks you're to blame i think he's to blame right and it's going to take a
very very special person to fit into the shoes that jack left
you know he is such an incredible man in every aspect works hard is caring is
loving as ambitious is everything a woman would want in a man unfortunately we grew apart
and it is unfortunate because i genuinely loved him and still do love him
unconditionally i'd give him my kidney if he needed it and it would take someone very very special
and confident to fill that space up and i'm not gonna hold my breath
does that make sense i'm not gonna hold my breath i'm gonna you know let's just see where it goes
you think it's possible um i think it's possible i think anything's possible
i just think that it's gonna take someone with a hell of a lot of confidence and someone
that understands that i don't need anything else but effort
and time from them i don't need your money i don't need your gifts i don't need so you're saying
you think that jack's shoes will be difficult to fill and it's almost like you're setting his shoes
as the standard of what you're looking for in the future so it kind of begs the question well you've got two feet that fit those
shoes perfectly jacks so why isn't he filling those shoes
i think if anyone turns around and says to you that i work with my partner and we run a
company of 30 people and hundreds and thousands of subscribers and you know an
ever growing company and we're so in love i i really literally will look at them
and be like how did you make that happen working and being romantically involved
with someone is difficult because let me tell you something when
you come home from work you're coming home from work with the same person what do you think you're
going to speak about when you get home work what do you think you're going to speak about
um after you have sex work the work i'm being honest like
you you live and you breathe your company jack is an entrepreneur and himself jack is a co-founder jack built this
with me right yeah so if i'm going through all those things as an entrepreneur as a
co-founder he is as well i don't know if you're answering the question chris but i am answering the question it
doesn't work it doesn't work because you work together yes it doesn't work together it would have probably worked
isn't that a shame when i when i um when i first met jack i have never felt
that way about someone before and i never once questioned our relationship or i never once questioned
whether i didn't want to be with this person and it's funny because when we hire new people at tone and scope they obviously
know mine and jack's relationship and a lot of employees tend to get a bit nervous
they're like are the co-founders going to be better are they going to be nasty to one another and you know what they always say it's
insane how much respect and love they have for one another it's actually a bit worrying how much respect and love we have for
one another and had we not had tona sculpt we would have 100 be married by now
probably expecting a first child is jack in a relationship i don't know we don't speak about stuff
like that i don't know if he's in a relationship okay so here's another thing
jack's made it pretty clear he's been like i don't know who i'm gonna find that's
like you and you said the same to me today and i've said the same thing about him um and another thing is i've been
with him for five years right i was with him for five years i still work with him in a normal situation you break up
and you go separate ways go separate ways you don't speak you don't see unless you're stalking each other
which i would because i'm a weirdo so i'd stalk you for a bit until i got over you but what i'm saying is i see
him every day so it's like how can i ever forget about you you're always there
i speak to you every day i'm on the phone to you every day we make executive decisions together
every day i still go to you for advice every day but why is i don't look at you
and want to kiss you right do you no i don't i don't
i don't not not right now anyway but i don't
to be in a relationship you have to have that flair come on you have to have that spark that
you you make me feel some type of way and i know over time it will pass
and whatever but it sounds so weird but i see him almost like a best friend but then
everyone always tells you to marry your best friend so maybe have i got relationships all wrong
right so i don't know i don't know but all i'm saying is the
person that i'm with and next with or whatever they don't necessarily have like they're
not competing because that's horrible you don't want to compete kind of somewhat unavoidable though especially
in chrissy's brain but at the same time it's like jack
was is the most genuine person like would always take care of me always
listen always put me first would always want me to to succeed it was every check check check check check but why
are we not together i don't i me myself i still don't have a
a fundamental reason as to why you know i read the comments and people
were like of course she would leave jack now she's got like millions of followers and has got money
of course she was she's gonna go marry a rich arab man i was like what you clearly don't know me you
clearly don't know me but um i don't have a rich arab man as a
boyfriend by the way i just want to clear that up but i don't know if jack's dating i i don't know
what he's doing all i all i do know is that i want him to be so happy could
you imagine life without him oh no well that question just took my
breath away a bit no i couldn't no i turned around tomorrow said he said i'm leaving the business i'm moving
no i'd be absolutely heartbroken i'd be i'd be absolutely grieving
i couldn't imagine life without jack but then again don't they say the most
important person in your life as a business owner is your business partner you almost speak
special bond you always speak to them more than you speak to the partner you go to bed with but it's also and the
reason i asked that question is i remember asking myself that question about my business partner many years ago and i'm embarrassed and i thought to
myself what if they died and it was like well then there's no point me doing this business anymore
which is a really weird thought i had i thought well then they were such a fundamental part of the purpose and the journey
and i it made me question you know why i'm actually doing this and i think with jack i think it's probably
true that um a huge part reason why you do this business is because of him you've been
through so much together yeah i couldn't imagine doing it with someone else yeah but i also can't imagine doing it
without him and you've been through hell and back together with jack right yeah and that strengthens the relationship like
you know so much been through so much with jack um you do five years with someone shit's
gonna happen shit's gonna hit the fan is it is it a possibility to be back with him
I hate talk about my success
um like i've always said you can never say never and anything is possible however
if jack was to find someone right and say oh like chrissy you know out of
respect he would have to sit me down because we work together and be like i'm with someone now
and if i see that that girl is treating him so well and looking after him in all honesty
that's all i hope would you be a little bit jealous probably i mean i'm not gonna lie probably would
but and would you then question the decision oh no i'm not the type of
person that if if if i if i don't have you no one else can on you know me and that's just weird
i mean you'd go home that day and start thinking oh i would go home and be like oh like damn you'd set reminders off
like alarm bells will start going off i absolutely don't regret ending it i've learned more about myself in the
year and a half of parting ways with jack than i did in five years of being with him facts i don't regret ending it would i
feel some type of way if he were he was with someone else you'd be absolutely lying to yourself if you said
no come on mate like we buddy was about to get married
we own a company together of course you'd feel some type of way but would i be jealous no would i be happy if he was
happy hell yeah i would because his happiness makes me happy is
in the future a possibility of me being with him again i don't i don't know how can i how can you possibly answer
that question when the possibility of me parting ways with him five years ago was
not even a vision i can't answer that question but if he was to find someone and be
truly happy and in love and she was a good egg i'd be happy and it's possible to be happy for someone
but also for it to suck at the same time 100 but that's only because you just feel some type of way but deep down you
just want them to be happy i think he will find someone i think he's going to find someone who's really
genuine are you smiling i wasn't smiling you're smiling no i wasn't smiling i think you
are i think you were smiling i think you felt some type of way by saying that no i really do i swear i
but yeah i've been honest enough now till now to like lie but but if when he does right
when he does which he will i just want one thing from that girl if you're listening out there to jack's
future wife i just don't want her to sway he's a mind on our business
does that make sense yeah oh leave tone and sculpt you don't need it anymore
that's horrible like don't interfere don't need to get involved love all right look at you but it's true
like i'm sorry but when i'm with a guy if he starts telling me what to do with my company
or if he starts telling me or it's me or jack i'd be like yeah get a grip it's jack
if you give me an ultimatum i don't want to be with you you know what this thing so i was i was
thinking about this earlier and i've got some friends i wouldn't call them necessarily friends but people that i know personally
and they would hate because they're so insecure as men they would hate the idea of dating
someone as self-made and successful as you mm-hmm and it's a certain type of insecure man
i'm laughing because i already know already been there really yeah certain type of insecure man
that really is seeking to control that would would not like a chrissy because
you can't be controlled you can't be controlled through gifts through x and you've been there yeah i've been
there i've done that like you know i remember one time
go for it sarah was like yeah sarah was my pa she's like yeah open up
but i remember one time when i was speaking to this guy you know after jack and i was going to a
lathe this was one of the biggest photo shoots for tone and scott this was you know to refurbish the entire app and everything
like brand new look brand new everything so much money went into this i think nearly 90 grand in production that's a
lot of money [ __ ] to the money [ __ ] ton of money yeah i mean i can put down two mortgages
for that yeah so as you can see like what but when we do things we do things right i tone and sculpt and that's facts um
so i remember he sat down he was like i don't know i just feel a bit you going
i said what do you mean what do you think i'm gonna do go and go and you know
go crazy with other men in la i'm going to work oh i don't know i don't know really
insecure and i found myself thinking it was me
i was like wait a minute and then i sat back and i was like no that's you you're insecure that's a problem that's
not my problem when la had the best time ever with my team we had the most incredible time
you know met the most incredible people came back most incredible campaign and i felt good but had i let that
man sway me maybe i i may have been a bit vulnerable
at the time and let's say he did sway me what if i changed my eye and didn't go that could have happened
was he intimidated by you and your success do you think at the beginning yeah 100
let's be honest i'm 20 oh my god i'm 26. i'm 26. i was still 24. i'm
26 years old and you are killing the game i'll say it because i know you're too humble
no i no no no no no no no i said it it's fine you didn't you
say whatever you want but it's not even that it's you know when you're 26 years old and maybe you have a few things
um people start to obviously feel a bit like you know i think it was
people start to feel like they should have them i say something when you talk about your success i get
awkward don't i i'm super awkward and i'll can i just say an observation and i think this is
a society problem not you problem men aren't like that no they're not i love coming up on here
and saying how much money they're making and how much they're killing it how many x wins that they've achieved um you
don't seem to be as comfortable talking about your success and i feel like that's a reflection of the society we live in
uh honestly it's not even that it's me i'm very awkward with stuff like that like can i be honest i don't even check my
bank accounts i let my account and deal with it i i i don't i i think for me i stay so
tunnel vision and the vision so i wake up in the morning the first thing i do is check
my mentions and dms and go on my community pages in that forum that's literally the first
thing i do and if i start thinking about how am i going to make a billion how am i going
to do this i'm going to do that i don't know it becomes a bit suffocating to the vision that you have
um and i was really number driven at the beginning not financially but on instagram followers
and followers the more followers it means i'm amazing the more likes it means i'm fit enough to be here
you know and i got so obsessed i used to almost like not think i was good enough unless i got a certain amount of likes
or followers and i completely lost sight of why i'm doing what i'm doing you know now i don't even check the
likes i get i don't even check the the my statistics my team do i don't check it because i don't care
what i care about is that comment that a lady saying to me oh my god this has helped me so much
this has made me so confident that feeds my energy if i start thinking
how am i going to get 100 million how am i going to juice that will come i'm confident it will
come but it's not my fundamental you know and it's going to be focusing
on something else yeah i'm focused on something else and it's not that society has made me feel uncomfortable to talk about my success
Are you hard to date
it's that i've you can speak to any of my team like i just don't care about it can i be honest
with you like i am not thriving to
i don't know i'm not i'm not thriving to have the biggest house or the fanciest car
i mean i even said to you like i don't have a fancy car a fancy house by the way and you were like i don't care yeah you
know like i don't really care about stuff like that i never i never have been like that
and it's not that i'm trying to be humble it's like i literally don't give a [ __ ] i don't care about a fancy car never
have done on the things that you do care about you talked about these comments and these dms you get um
i imagine you know because i get a couple dms as well you get a lot not a couple you get a lot
and uh how how does it feel to have that sort of responsibility when someone messages
you something so deeply personal and that they're seeking advice or guidance or they're just
sharing a problem with you how does that feel in terms of well how does it make you feel um
when can i message sometimes because you know what to say because i'm not qualified to deal with
certain situations but at the same time the contradiction with me is like you're giving that advice
something yeah and i just want to acknowledge the person but i know i can't so and it would be almost irresponsible for me to try and solve
their problem 100 you're not there to fix someone's problems yeah but but i think the value that i can bring is
just by like listening and acknowledging but you know there's a spectrum right so you have on one end i love what you do
in the other end you have people that are suicidal or that are you know and um it's it sometimes it's a lot i
had this one video go viral 30 million views and it was about depression and i got 8 000 dm's that week from
people on that spectrum and i just didn't know what to do i was like because when you read them some people
are really really suffering and they've come to me because clearly in some cases one girl that said she'd
barricaded herself in a room in egypt and she was on the verge of suicide like
she didn't feel like she could speak to anyone else and sometimes a stranger yeah is the the most safe place to you
know how does it feel that that has kind of made me emotional no it didn't i did the funny thing to that i remembered
that instantly this girl barricaded in a room in egypt who would watch this video and had reached out to me to for me to
give her the answer she's looking for in her life which i'm not qualified to give right all i can do is
be a friend in that in that situation um but but i'm sure you get messages that are you know yeah i get um messages
every day thousands and um so there's two things that i've started
to do one of the biggest teams we have at tone and sculpt is the customer support team right
and by the way this isn't because we get influxes of emails it's because we have a person for each
social facebook community manager instagram all of this stuff and the reason being is we don't need
them it's because i want every single person to be heard and what you just said that
is exactly what i think as well you want to be a friend i call my community familia
i always use that word i always say you're my sisters you're my familia
because at the end of the day i'm not here to fix your problems but i'm here to listen to your problems i'm here to be the friend that you may
think you don't have in in your reality you can't fix someone's problems you
can't offer you know mental health advice because if you say something wrong god forbid anything happened but you can
listen you can make feel make someone feel like they're part of something and that's the best thing i can do you
know yeah and you know i was i was thinking then as well about the previous topic we had i rarely switched back
but before you came here today there was a question i actually wanted to ask you about because i only ask questions because i am
curious myself sure and i'm trying to i think the reason i ask these questions is i'm trying to find similarities in some way
between a you know a person on your journey and a personal mind the question is are you hard to date
today was one of those days in my life where i'm filming this podcast with chrissy i've got a ton of things going on i've got tons and tons of emails
i'm sprinting around and like usual in my crazy crazy world i am neglecting my nutrition something that i
i have done for probably the last decade and this is why huel sponsored this podcast and why i've
been a huge customer for about three years and why when i was looking for a partner to work with on this podcast hill was the
company that came to mind it's a company that helped me with my nutrition and for me to stay sort of
nutritionally complete as is huel itself despite the fact that i have a crazy
crazy unfi predictable unforgiving schedule and um i love it and it's it's such a
pleasure to get to have a podcast and to have a partner in huel and then julian who is the founder and ceo
where i can talk about it and the benefits it gives to me in such an authentic way if you've not tried huel and you are
someone that frequently neglects your diet whether it's through busyness whether you forget to have meals because
of whatever's going on in your life i implore you just to try it just to check it out um they and heal
comes in many different like shapes and sizes there's the powder they've got like the savory meals now and they have the bottles
and for me i've always loved the bottles um so it's yeah it's a pleasure that
you'll sponsor this podcast and support us in this mission and they're the reason that we're going to be scaling this podcast up
big time i was just chatting to um chatting to some of the production crew that worked with me and jack and dom
and i was saying that um now we have a partner on the podcast we can really take this up a level
Your parents
you've seen me taken up one level this season already we're gonna take it up even further and that's in terms of production in terms
of the guests in terms of what we can invest into this into this um piece of content so thank you to huel check it
out try the chocolate flavor let me know what you think if you are a hula gun right and um i appreciate you listening
back to the podcast the question is are you hard to date
um oh [ __ ] yeah i think so i think i am i'm not gonna lie
like okay so here's the thing right i'm super loving when i'm with you i'll do anything for
you like i'll look after you i'll make you feel special
it's gonna be like but if you like it but no no like honestly like even i
i can honestly say like even sarah and my pa will tell you like i fall hard in love yeah
i head over heels for someone i'll fall so hard for you um but i also fall so
hard out of love for you oh [ __ ] that's the issue of me and that's
facts and i hate that about myself so much it's the one thing i hate the
most about myself i'm a switch you do something to annoy me or you do something to kind of like
it's bad it's not healthy like i people think i'm superwoman i've got my
own problems this like i want my own issues i feel so in love
with someone and then if i don't see that same level of love back i'm like [ __ ] this [ __ ] self-defense
yeah i do think in relationships i'm really i'm really defensive and you know what i can't believe i'm
admitting all this but yeah i i would say i am and i think that um what are you defending yourself from
i don't know okay why are you are you hard to date yeah okay so so are you defensive
christy this is all about your diary well come to me no i want to know what you're defending yourself from
because you you literally said if i didn't get the same type of love back
okay okay so you're obviously very motivated you're very inspired you're very like
driven right thanks you're welcome i'm the same like i just want to keep going
i want to grind i want to grind so if i see someone kind of just not doing the same
infuriates me like i'm almost like how can you not have passion for something how can you not
have a try for something and then it leads me to believe that hold on a minute if i did have the same
person that had the same level of drive would we be compatible maybe i do need someone a little bit
more like low-key because then it will make me feel a bit calmer when i'm home it's all over the gap i don't know what
i want women don't know what they want stop asking women what we want we don't know what we want
we don't know what we want but what i can say is i think sometimes when we overthink
things especially me i overthink relationships all the freaking time i think sometimes
it's a good idea to just take a step back and just relax a bit because if someone is genuinely there
for you willing to listen willing to take care of you and willing to always always put effort
in stop being a [ __ ] pretty much you know i i
me personally i'm i'm difficult to stay i'm not gonna lie i'm not gonna lie i don't even feel bad
saying that i felt quite free saying that like i'm i'm difficult today so no one said you should feel bad no i
i am and i i feel bad for the guy but so i really want to dig into that because i can
really really relate and that's why i started laughing because i've gone over the same predicament in my head thinking maybe i need someone
that's super ambitious and has loads of passions and there's a flagship person and then i thought but then maybe they'd drive me crazy because you know and then
so i flip-flop and usually when i'm with one i think i want the other same and then yeah and then when with
that i'm like nope yeah that's literally me yeah i'll
like maybe we can figure this out today i honestly can't and i think you know what it is
i think it's because we are people that are constantly switched on yeah like
neurotic obsessive obsessive like with work with this with that i'm not obsessive in a relationship
like if someone tries to tell me what to do with my life i'd be like no way and i couldn't imagine ever
trying to tell someone what to do with their life like if you want to do whatever you do whatever you want to do that's your life
you live it the way you want to live it um so because i'm obsessive with my life and my career
i'm constantly switched on so if someone around me isn't i almost feel
like i don't know she doesn't think they're a bum
oh my god i think that's true
it's true yes i know it's so true and then do you find yourself
feeling a bit lazy yeah but also i i'm like steve don't tell him because you're
passing your own world view and your own values onto someone else who doesn't want it yeah and you
shouldn't be trying to change people out here you accept them oh my god that is me i'm literally like
what do you mean you don't want to be ambitious in life what do you mean you don't have a passion what do you mean and i go crazy in my
head and this is happening in my head whilst i'm looking at the meat do you know what i mean like let's say
i'm like let's say we're we're at dinner i'm having a full-on-blown conversation in my head like what do you mean i'm not
ambitious what do you mean you don't want this and he's just chilling you know you're not doing anything wrong and then i have to let you take a
breather and be like what am i doing i can't i can't push that on to someone i can only push that onto myself i need to
chill out connected to this maybe maybe not your parents hard working oh my god so hard working
um came from another country came from another country um immigrated at the back of the lorry
you know i immigrated back of banana lorry yeah and um i remember we landed in
france and my family got arrested because we were immigrants and they separated us so they put
me my my brother in one room my dad in another room he could see him through the glass and i remember crying and crying and
crying like dad dad dad i didn't know what's going on i was four years old but i still remember that i'll never
forget the the prison room was turquoise i'll never forget that and when we came
to this country my mom and dad worked hard my mom worked three jobs my dad worked
as a hb1 lorry driver every single night you know every penny they had they saved
they saved they saved um my dad had a pretty bad gambling problem
The pressure on women
i'm gonna be honest my mum was constantly trying to like fix that problem and
i've never actually mentioned that ever before ever and as much as i love my dad with
my entire heart and and i want nothing more for him to be happy it caused a lot of strain on my mum
like trying to feed her family trying to like work hard trying to save trying to take us on holiday you know
um so to save money and then to have the person you love gambling away it's like
what's the point like i don't understand why i'm with this person but in my culture you don't leave the man you're
with you're stuck with them but my mum even though he was like that my mum
loved and loves my dad so much it's pretty bizarre because that would be enough to take
anyone off but she just believed in him he doesn't do any more believed in him and nourished him and
loved him so much and together they grew better um
so for me if i have a man and he like places a bet on something
it triggers me to think he's going to be gambling and i'm like oh my god no sorry out he's put one bet down and i
think he's canvased you know what i mean it's crazy so i asked that question for a reason gone
um because we've we've established that we have very much similar traits and relationships that we
we tend to really value hard work and ambition and it tends to be the case
that the value we attribute to hard work and ambition probably comes from a childhood where um
hard work and ambition were the thing that might have got us out of some [ __ ] let me
tell you from my example all right so very much the same as yours but switch the parents so i came from
africa i was born in africa came to the uk my dad had like a pretty good job but my mom you could all call it a gambling
addiction she had this she has both gambling addiction on one hand because she played
there was probably a thousand lottery tickets if i opened any drawer in our house okay but on the other hand she she was
she was she couldn't stop starting businesses to the point that the reason why we were so poor we never
had birthdays or christmases or went on holiday at all ever period was because my mom spent all the money trying to become a millionaire
by starting these businesses they'd all fail within six months because she can't read or write and my dad was the unconditionally
loving calm supportive won't leave you even though you're an absolute [ __ ] parent right so there's one yeah so in my house i
think when i think about why i am the way i am now i think money was such a big problem
that in our house it was the cause of so much pain mm-hmm same that i grew up valuing it so much and the thing that
would get you it which would to me would be like you know my what i thought was happiness was like hard work ambition like my
parents worked so hard that they wouldn't even be that in the house when i went to bed or when i woke up and so i value hard work and ambition
because my parents taught me it because it was the cure to our problems right so and especially as immigrants
right there's a different there's like an immigrant vibe i get you yeah i get you don't we don't even have to talk about i
just get you so like this is part of the reason why i think in relationships when someone doesn't have those values when they
The bullshit of being an entrepreneur
don't value hard work and ambition i'm like what the [ __ ] is wrong with you yeah there's probably something wrong with me
i don't think there's anything wrong with you i think i i'm i'm not going to sit here and think
there's something wrong with me not wrong it's like it's the result of my traum my traumatic childhood experience maybe i
wouldn't change it for the world do you know what it is i swear to god i think it's it's the fact
that okay so a lot of people
when we moved to england i was never allowed to like go to stay over other friends houses my dad
is super strict like i couldn't even wear skirts around him absolutely not forbidden and so when i
did used to go to my other friends houses like english culture it was a completely different vibe like
their family was different like their moms and dads were different and then when i'd come to my house it
was different and i didn't understand it so my dad has always wanted me to marry an albanian
man it's like his dream he's like please marry an albanian man you two will be amazing together like
this and i'm like dad i don't care what he is so long as i'm in love
and it happens to be that the guys i've been with have been english and the cultures are completely
different and it it i don't understand like sometimes when they do things i
don't understand examples like okay so in my household mediterranean loud
proud like very like good really yeah super loud i am super loud i love it
but you know you come to my house and my mum will have dinner ready for you my mom will buy you slippers to make you
feel like home you know and she'll she'll welcome you hug you kiss you on each cheek
but then when i'd go to jack's families for example as much as they were so loving so caring it just wasn't the same
like you'd have dinner different times or and i didn't understand it because i've been brought up in a family where
everything's together like togetherness and everyone's got each other's backs and everyone's solid so
to have a different culture thrown into the mix sometimes it does clash and it does like
cultures are different but that doesn't mean one culture is better it just means it's different
so it's up to you whether you want to learn both cultures and and meet in the middle it would be
easier if i went for an albanian guy because their cult culture is the same and i've been brought up in that culture
but obviously jack's culture is completely different so i've had to kind of like
you know find the middle find that that middle ground i guess i don't know
what you call it but find that balance are you scared that you might not ever
meet the right person all the time i'm all the time scared i'm 26 years old and as women we're told
we have a time frame if you're not 30 you have kids you're too old if you if you have kids at 40
what kind of mum are you all this bloody [ __ ] around us all the time see how much pressure that adds as
a woman all the time so much pressure you got to get married you got to have kids you got
to be a mom you got to be a mum before 30. oh that's when i like
breathe out so much pressure and it petrifies me it honestly petrifies me because a lot
of people around me in my industry are married or i'll have children or have like
a fiance and i had that and i almost think to myself i had that and i let that go
and sometimes you you think do you know and this is probably i'm asking this question again for my own reasons so
you do you ever consider the fact that you might be too busy being entrepreneur no you're never too
busy for someone you love i don't think that's the case i don't think um
i'm too busy you think you're what you're doing with with your businesses and as an entrepreneur might prevent you um being
uh aware and forming a healthy relationship when the prospect arises
do you know what i think it is when you have a nine to five you clock out you come home you switch
off you don't clock out you're working constantly even if you're in this room
you're still at the back of your head thinking about your business you're thinking about something you need to do something
to check off something you need to approve something to expand on so it's it's so guilty for me to say
this i feel bad saying it but i could be in a room with you and i'm thinking about my companies constantly and someone who has a nine to
five doesn't understand that because it's like you're switched off at five
and sometimes i feel bad saying i do kind of wish i can switch off at 5 p.m
but i just can't and i think it's not necessarily i'm too busy at some constantly thinking
even if i'm in the room with you i'm constantly thinking about what i have to do you can make someone feel pretty lonely just by being even if you're sat next to
them yeah you're often you know yeah i often say i say like when i'm with somebody my aim isn't for them to ever understand
me it's just to understand that they don't understand yeah because i think i'm like too difficult to understand if i'm quiet for an hour it
doesn't mean i don't love you it means that i've just got an email so true and it's just [ __ ] me and i actually don't want to always share
things at home because you're offloading yeah you're offloading and i don't want to be back because i could offload 24
7. oh trust me so can i sarah's always like oh here we go again um but it's
true like you know your phone is buzzing off constantly you could get a dm by someone you could
you could get a message an email and it's like oh [ __ ] really and you're just sitting watching a movie
with your partner tell me about that part of being an entrepreneur i think that's why i really started the podcast in the first place was
i want to hear about the [ __ ] of running a business the unexpected unpredictable
life-shifting [ __ ] that happens yeah your life is you breathe and you
live your businesses i think this is something people don't understand you live and you breathe your companies they are
your babies no one and nothing can get in the way and no one understands that they see the
money the success the followers the this the that the blingy cars whatever the hell you want to see and
let me tell you the reality you don't have much time you suck at relationships
you don't have many friends and the friends that you have you don't really see them um when you do have time to yourself
you never switch off ever you are the biggest self-critic ever
you constantly think that you could be doing better and that pressure is insane mentally and physically it
drains you and um another thing is that i really just want to say um if you think a life of an
entrepreneur is so glamorous this is the first time i've put on jeans
in i would say i'm blessed i feel privileged i don't know how long but i don't live
in jeans i live in sweats and sliders so if it sucks so much it doesn't suck and you know what i'm trying to say yeah
i know exactly what you're saying but i'm also here to to try and help people understand multiple perspectives because people say
okay so you've criticized you know you've talked not criticized but you've talked about the downsides right why'd you still do it because you could
My battle with depression
just say do you know what i killed it hang up your your gym yeah your active wear clothes
oh your shoes i don't know what people would say and you could say that's it i'm done why don't you
oh no why not gosh the feeling i get when i
when i see someone's transformation nah that fills me up like
that fuels me when i see a transformation when i see someone who
had um a mental a mental health disorder or an eating disorder and has is now thriving
do you know that is so unexplainable that nothing else
matters i'd rather not have a relationship to be frank with you
i really am not that fast so long as i can continue to help as many women as
possible for me that's enough and that's why i don't stop is there an endpoint in all this i hope
not okay there's no like mountain top there's no no i i think that
you know you're you're told in life that you need to go to school you need to go to university you need to achieve this
right so then you achieve this and you are not satisfied so you need to
achieve this and then this and then this i don't have
goals for financial status for awards for anything like that
i had maybe two goals and i've achieved one of them which i won't share because it's
actually very top secret but you'll see it next year okay um but
if you have these um tangible goals i'm thinking now what it is i'm like you finally married an
albanian man i'm like what oh yes daddy i did no no
i didn't i didn't no i'm not married nope that's actually very depressing thank you
um but no it's like you you goals are like you you know when you
wrote in your diary i want a range rover right you got a ranger or what then just total anti-climax
yeah well i want a million dollar house cool what then you're lonely in your house
your house is so big you don't know what to do with it by the way my house is not so big i don't want to do it i need more
space but you see what i'm saying so i don't have those types of goals because they're not attainable
is there a point in when you're building the businesses you run where you had your worst ever day because i
can think about the worst days that i've had in business what was the what was the one that sprung to mind straight away
oh god um okay so when i'm i'm a woman in tech right so
with an app there's complications that you are not even prepared for there's maybe a bug maybe this maybe
that so obviously when this lawsuit was happening to get my app back um from the developers from
the old developers it was a third party company and when we transferred it to brand new
servers that are obviously you know pretty much ours um
because servers are just so huge but um i didn't know anything about tech when i
started now you speak to me tech i know tech language okay so it's actually i'm very proud
because for someone who literally didn't understand what the hell the server was i was like what's the first time you heard about it there's a bug did you
think oh lady bird i honestly don't like it's embarrassing but when the transition happened the
Somethings going to have to give in my life
whole app went right shut down and imagine when you know when instagram shuts down people
like oh my god instagram sucks like fu instagram okay but
this is my company now so when it shuts down it's like i can't i can't i can't pay
for my employees i can't pay for my office i can't do this i can't do that when it shut down my whole face shut
down with it i was like [ __ ] what do i do now this is it we lost 10
000 subscribers in one day okay you times 10 000 by 13.99
yeah it's a lot of [ __ ] money a lot of money in one day gone gone that was probably the one of the
worst days and i just sat back and i looked at jack and i just said to him
what the [ __ ] do we do now jack b and jack he was like don't worry
we'll gain them back on don't worry why are you stressing this is what happens well would you be while we're stressing
idiot what do you mean he's like chill out but um
yeah that was probably the worst day and i just remember i i lost so much weight right i lost
i would say i was 56 kilograms i went down to 49 in like 56
yeah i went down to 49. seven kilograms yeah but i went down to 49 so can you
imagine in what space of time um three weeks to four weeks i couldn't keep anything on i wasn't
eating i wasn't sleeping i lost everything then me and jack parted so
and i was still producing videos still producing content still how long was the up down for it was down
for three days three days and i was still producing content going on instagram don't worry
guys like we'll still get out there i wasn't eating wasn't sleeping wasn't doing anything i just broken up the person i was going to
marry i was in a house with my dog the house that i built with the man i was supposed
to be with i didn't know what the hell i was doing anymore at that point i thought i thought i should give up not gonna lie
but yeah i was like this is it now no no i'm giving up i've got my law degree i'm
gonna go back to doing that this is just too much stress and then i did and i just kept going
just kept going something inside me was like you just have to keep going please don't give up please don't give up chrissy
you talked about um your own battles with mental health um over the years i think i think i read
that you you said you'd suffered with depression at various stages yeah early on can you
tell me about that yeah huge like i mean
a lot of people see a very picture-perfect image on instagram which
i'm to blame just like everybody else you want to you want to showcase the best bits of you nothing wrong with that you keep doing
you if that works you keep doing you but i have been in such
dark places that i couldn't i couldn't picture wanting anyone
to feel what i felt in those places even someone i resent not that i resent anyone but i
wouldn't even want that for them these dark places suck you in so much that you honestly start to contemplate
whether you just want to stop feeling that feeling period like just be done with it
and i'll never forget i was laying in bed one day and i was so
depressed so depressed that i just thought to myself it'd be so much easier if i wasn't here
that's so much easier just quit just leave
and i cried myself to sleep and i woke up the next morning and it almost felt like in my dream i'd made it happen
if you know what i'm trying to say without saying it and i just thought
i need to stop because i cannot go on like this and i think when i try and explain to
people i've i know those dark places i've been in those dark places they don't believe me because they see me for
the person i am today they don't see the person that fought so hard to be
where i am today mentally not even about the success the business is mentally that's the most important thing up here
this is the most important thing you can have all the money in the world all the businesses in the world you can
have 300 employees multiple companies who gives a [ __ ] about that if you up
here are so not okay so yeah i've been through dark places but
i've also picked myself up multiple times and i've had to brush my shoulders off and get [ __ ] done
and that's why i keep saying to every single person out there you have to do this for you do this for
you this is the the biggest and most important thing i can say to you
and now that you have you know you've built this empire this little fitness empire which is rapidly growing do you ever find
yourself in those dark places even today yeah not as bad um
but i find myself um i find myself wondering if
i'll ever have like a somewhat normal life so like what we discussed
will i ever find someone again will i be in love will i get married will i have children like i want
children i want to be married i believe in those things i want those things but sometimes i wonder if those things
are going to happen for me and i do wonder i just maybe need to stop overcomplicating things in my
mind but i can't switch off and maybe the only way i know to switch off is just to quit
you see what i'm saying it's a vicious circle but if i quit i'll be so angry at myself for quitting it's like
ongoing it's constant it doesn't stop so um and do you think part of
that fear comes from the fact that you believe the way you are now and how you live and work now and how
obsessive you are now is probably not like conducive or um
it's probably not going to allow that other all those other things you want to yeah to come true right so like you
think well something's going to have to give at some point is that i do i'm not going to i i literally think like that i'm not gonna lie like
so when when toner scope was built um we i didn't i honestly
didn't realize it would grow the speed it did with little to absolutely no marketing expenditure
so everything's been hyper organic in the space of 12 months we now have a team of 22
people when it was just me and jack 12 months ago 22 people an office in
in in london we know what the rent is like in london it's off the chain um 120 growth
you know month by month it's rapid growth we've just launched a brand new trainer
um who is like insane and um i keep saying to myself okay when
i get to this point i can relax and i say that to sarah all the time
i keep saying i keep mentioning sarah but but because she is the one person that knows me probably better than my own
blood because she's with me everywhere i go and she is the person i speak to about a lot of things
so i always say to okay when i get to this point with tone and scope i can breathe and bless her she's like
yeah yeah she knows in her head i want more and i want more but it's not i want more it's that i
believe we can do more and i believe we can do more and strive for more so when does it end
when does it end it doesn't end that's what i'm trying to say so you have to make peace with it
you have to make peace with the fact that it's not supposed to end but you also have to make peace with the
Are you scared of death
fact that you need to make maybe some self self self-adjustments and and be a bit
critical with yourself because if you're going in a relationship and constantly thinking that that person should be on your level
that's that's my problem i need to deal with that's not their problem you know it's not fair on them how'd you
deal with that i think it i think it takes time i think you're not sure are you
no i'm not sure about your body language oh god i figured that one out it's okay
to not have it figured out right i don't have it figured out and i'm someone who doesn't like not having things figured out
right yeah yeah i get that um but i do think i need to stop being so mean
it's this balance right between trying to figure it out now because you kind of want to be able to have a plan and have
you know but then also realizing that you shouldn't overthink this thing and that you should maybe just you've
literally made me feel in this podcast like i'm the most impossible person to be with i'm not i'm just asking the questions oh
no no i can't lie i'm not going to lie just to make myself sound good no it's it's a very important part of being
a successful person that it has this crazy neurotic obsessive brain yeah i do ambitious and that's but also
has these other things they want and life is a drop at you you can't have everything at the same time so what we're talking about now is like
compromising how you reach that compromise in your life if possible i'm in the same place i have no idea how
that's gonna happen but do you do you want kids i do want kids do you want to get married um i'm not so concerned about
the concept of marriage but i want to have a long-term partner because i want to have kids and so i'm willing to commit long-term
if it's a marriage if it's signing some other piece of paper if there's no paper i like don't really care too much about the whole marriage
thing if it matters so much to the partner i'll do it but i don't i was saying on
the last podcast no i see what you mean i don't have a great case for why the law or or a religion should be involved
in love i don't think it has a great track record with love yeah so i'm like i think that's an idea which we all as a society need to just
reconsider yeah what you mean like i'm gonna my closing statement on this point is we are all so different you are
different from me only a little bit but then like you're different from your assistant and i'm different from mine and
my friends from school so logically you would think the answer to how we form our romantic connections
would also be unique and different like and i think at any time in life where the script tells you everyone has to go
through this door when you are a different shape it's like putting a triangle in a square
like of course i think that's when you have to question things so i got kicked out of school because i just stopped going dropped out of university after one
lecture and i've tried to navigate my life my way through life just rejecting the things that i meant to just accept
blindly and marriage is one of them where i'm like can i achieve all the things i want to in a relationship without that
paper yeah and i put on my linkedin last week i said um i basically said to the world i think marriage is
a concept we need to reconsider for everyone someone proved me wrong and one guy commented he said i've been
in a marriage for 45 years we love each other we've done this i said could you have done that without the marriage
yes okay then yeah so but you would do it if she or i don't know he whatever maybe
but then i need to be honest here because you know if they really wanted to get married i'd ask them why they really wanted to
get married i'm not gonna lie i am the same like for me a piece of paper doesn't define my love for you
okay let's talk about this then so why do you why do you want to get married do you know what it is like this is me
being a woman i just really want to dress we can do the wedding like that's marriage is different from a
wedding in a ceremony someone said that on my post yeah i guess yeah i mean look
my my dream wedding would genuinely be like on the beach having like burgers and beers with the
closest friends and families running in the ocean i don't want it like a big fancy party i feel like you just described
your dream day yeah literally if you could do that like this week but if i said to you because you're
so busy if i said to you what's what do you want to do right now i bet anyone and you'd say you know what i'd
love to be on the sofa and just eat my favorite food for the people i love yeah of course right of course yeah over
going out getting smashed of course that's what i'm saying but a lot of people the only thing is my brain is like go on your laptop and check your
emails see that's what i mean because you're upset because i love it you know what i mean yeah but
what i'm saying is to other people they want a big wedding a big big fuss i hate fuss
i absolutely hate fuss over me and it's so funny because like even my team surprise premier surprise birthday party
i was so awkward i was like don't ever do that again i i hate all eyes on me yes although my
business is built on all eyes on me do you see how that's so contradictory it's the same i used to my previous
assistant um who ended up being my girlfriend long [ __ ] story which we're not going to go into whoa
i don't actually know if sophie so my current assistant sophie's been with me for four years i know she knows this but sophie do you
know this do i do have i ever said to you when it's my birthday or when it's like social change
anniversary to not make a fuss about it and the reason why i say this is because i get so much attention as it is
and so much fuss for like being the founder being the ceo the eyes are always on me you just don't want it you're like no no
no no yeah the same right i'm the same and i always just feel like
oh i don't know so that's why my dream wedding day if that day will come is to just
oh my god 20 30 people max closest friends and families my my dog
there and just to have the person i love and i always say i want to be in a room
full of people and look at the person i love and just me and him understand each other you know what i mean that feeling where you look at them
and you're just like i get you i get you and that's that's what i crave
that's what i want and you're right a piece of paper doesn't define that feeling only
you define that feeling in that person so i don't need a piece of paper you're right um i guess i just want the concept
are you scared of death who me no not at all
hear me no i'm not i'm i'm not are you no i'm not no
i'm not like um i'm scared of not living yes i'm scared of like i really want to
do things i want to explore i want to do things i want to you know my my dream vacation
would be to not have my phone there i don't care about a selfie i don't care about this i just want to be
present in the moment and if i if i told you that you were going to die a week from now what would you so much
what would you regret so much tell me not living just working there you go not living like
as much as i love doing what i l what i do i'm not gonna lie i i've built what i've built telling
people to look after themselves and i forget to look after myself and
that's why when i do train and when i exercise it's the only time i do feel like i'm
doing something really special for myself and i've like i do a lot of skipping right amazing at skipping by the way
thank you i watched you the other day i was like oh my god did you like i thought i was a good skipper no and i saw you like dancing while skipping and
i was like oh she's [ __ ] of course she's doing like a double crossover and i just had to i started to feel really inadequate and
insecure as a man it was fine so i just had it it happens all the time
but you know why i skip why is that uh you have to be [ __ ] present
because if you're not present you get whipped right and when i'm skipping
i literally feel like i can't think about anything else but the rhythm and for someone who's always on switched
on someone who's always doing things you know people always tell me go go meditate do yoga can i [ __ ]
yeah can i [ __ ] i'm like i let you go to meditate and i'm thinking about my my to-do list like but when i'm
skipping i'm so engrossed in it yeah that i'm literally so present in the moment
and it makes me feel alive same thing with training i'm so engrossed in training
and that's why so many women when i say to them just train you're a mom you got to think about your children you're you're a student you've
Having friends as an entrepreneur
got to think about your studies you're trying to trying to make money because you don't know when you're going to pay
your rent just train it's the one moment that you can ignore the entire world
and do something for yourself so i really want to loot background to this
point about if you were to die next week oh you were trying to avoid it yeah i was because you know the answer
yeah but i want to hear the answer because i'm asking this i would feel the same way right maybe
feel awkward my palms are sweating it makes you feel a little bit uncomfortable right it does because i
love my job so much like i love what i do it it i thrive off it
but on the flip side i do wish i was so i'll stop being such an annoying
little [ __ ] and just take some time off for myself you know let's stop being so annoying to yourself chrissy just take
some time off it's okay it's okay to go do things you love doing like traveling obviously right now it's
pandemic but you know what i'm trying to say like travel like maybe take a week off and just
breathe um but i can't i can't i don't know what's wrong with
me i just can't are you the same i'm the same is there something
again i'm just exploring this is there something strange about that where you feel like you know you're saying you're saying i can't it's
like you don't have a choice but at the same time you're telling me that if you were to die next week you would regret not living
yeah oh my god this is such a heavy-laded question um
i feel like i feel like this is the therapy session i needed
but it's it's so true what you've just said you've literally just you've shut me up you've shut me up
because i can't you're like like [ __ ] [ __ ] shut her up but it's true like
i can't stop working because something keeps telling me i can't stop
right now not yet but on the flip side if i was to die next week
i'd regret not taking some time off for myself to do the things that i love doing i love going to museums
no one knows that a lot i literally love looking at things but you think that's a
waste of time i do right now right now yeah and time is
every entrepreneur's biggest asset time is everything how could it possibly
be a waste of time if it's the thing you would regret the the reason why i think this death question is so revealing
is they they do all of these there's a a lady called bonnie ware who was um she
worked with um i think it's called palliative patients which are people that are about to die they've gone home to die and she asked
them the question what are your biggest regrets and she wrote it down and she was doing this for years and she wrote a blog about it
and there's a certain sort of retrospective clarity you'll get in that moment when there is nothing
going forward for your life about how you should have made your decisions in that moment you can imagine
only the things that matter people what that girl said about your hair none of this [ __ ] won't [ __ ] matter
the playground [ __ ] none of it will matter you'll just be left with the things that truly mattered and so putting yourself in that mindset
i call it like deathbed thinking allows you to look at how you're living your life now and see if it's in
accordance with the things that will matter in that like final moment and so
i asked this question because i think the same about me i'm like if you told me today i had four days left to live i'd be like
why didn't i have a better relationship with my family yeah why didn't i go see my niece i don't have a relationship with my brother
well yeah you know i have a [ __ ] relationship with my with my mom in particular yeah i don't see my niece and my two nieces
enough i've probably seen them i know three or four times she's maybe three years old she's only two hours away and so i think these
things about myself and i think okay so but what are you sacrificing have you made a change
because no one's ever asked me that see the question is now you've asked yourself that i think it'll always be there but but it
won't be but no one's ever asked me that so now you've got me thinking oh [ __ ] i need to get sarah to put me holiday because
[ __ ] me i need to live my life but it's like in all honesty i'll probably leave today
and keep doing what i'm doing day in day out until at some point you'll learn this lesson the hard way
facts and you know um recently one of the most important people of my life passed away
the woman that gave me a home you know um you know you know you know my best my
best friend holly who is literally my sister her mom gave me a home when i was homeless
and you know she didn't once mentioned the months she left let me live there
the food i ate the hot water i used not once ever brought it up and i saw her on her
dying bed right and i held her hand and i just kept thinking to myself
nothing matters at this point and you know what holly said to me she goes i would have called you sooner but i was scared you were doing
something and at that point i i it hit me like
i looked down i went never say that again you call me when you need me i'm always there for you but it's the
fact that we've the people around us know how busy we are that they sometimes feel like oh maybe i just shouldn't
the most important people even my mom doesn't know she goes i don't call you babe it's okay i know how busy
you are and i say so no you call me when you want me and you need me and it's not that you've told people not
to call you right it's that they think that you're just so busy that it'll be a
disruption because you've made them feel that way yeah yeah i'm to blame 100
and you know you have to take a step back and you have to realize what matters in life
and that for me that moment there i just realized to
What are you working on?
myself and i messaged every single person i loved the most and i said i don't care how busy i am i'm
always here for you always so that's a real personal moment for your best friend and i'm
i imagine you said earlier that you don't have many friends um i have acquaintances but like
close friends you know like friends no i don't think i don't think a lot of people do that if
you really like ask i don't have many friends yeah like i have people
that are there like acquaintances and i have people that i would genuinely die for those are my friends you know and i can
count them on my hand polly is one of them other people have more friends is that a fair statement
typically yeah sure but i don't really care if you have more friends than me to be honest i'm happy with the people i
have because you have more friends with me doesn't make you more superior or makes you a better person because you have
more people around you it's just you know i'm only 26 i don't know how many friends
i'm going to have at 62. so i have friends do you see what i'm saying
probably less maybe yeah according to the days maybe but at the same time i couldn't
have asked for better friends that i have now and the friends i have now would protect me and look after me and they know i
would do anything for them that's what matters not having a hundred friends i want one
good friend not a hundred random friends so i i asked that question because i think i've definitely struggled to
make and to hold on to friendships because of the way i've been over the last decade in the same way relation like normal
relationships i found that i don't invest enough in my friendships as much as i probably
should okay i'm going to be completely honest um people come and go right
people come and go and it's so bizarre because i know it sounds crazy but i've pretty
much built a virtual community right and i feel like
that's my team even though i may have not met these women physically i feel like they
get me more than the people in my own life is that weird do you think that's weird
you think it's a bit weird don't you be honest i don't know if it's like i speak it's
unusual it's a very curious thing you've just said yeah like
you should i don't know if you've ever seen or maybe not but when i go on a live
workout and i work out with with with hundreds of thousands of women i don't see them they see me but i feel
the energy i i can't explain it to you i i sound crazy right now and people probably
think i'm an absolute crazy psycho weirdo but let them think what they want when i'm like
reading a dm right or when i'm going live for a workout or when i add a new workout on and when i repost people
because you you see i repost a lot of people right um and half the time i don't even tag tony
sculpt i just repost the woman with a sweaty selfie or whatever and
that to me i almost feel like that's enough friends like i have friends for life this is my family my unit my team
my tribe and as crazy as i may sound
i feel like that tribe understands me more than the people in my life so that's when i go on social media and you
see me understand that's me because i feel like we're friends and you get me and
it's crazy because they do get me and i get them they get my sense of humour they get me
trying to dance on camera and be stupid i don't care i sometimes forget i have 2.3 million
followers and i come friends well i sometimes forget right have you seen that i come online and i don't have makeup on
i forget i genuinely forget and i'm like oh [ __ ] my skin's a bit crusty right now
and i just posted that to 2.3 million people what's my crazy ass thinking
and i sit back and i'm like oh okay i don't care but the nature of the internet is that you would of course
you've got 2.3 million people there's a lot of people in there that are hurting themselves and that want to make you feel like [ __ ] too
can i be honest i'm very lucky really yeah i'm very lucky man i
don't get much negativity i don't and when i do
um if like someone's been horrible on a post because i have i have a big
insecurity about my boobs all right like they're they're saggy i'll say it
and cool i've always had a big insecurity about it i remember this one one girl just ripped them to shreds she
was just like ill like they look disgusting and saggy i didn't even see the comment
until i started seeing the community members reply back to her now there's a difference between
replying back to someone and being like you need to stop that was hurtful and then replying back meanly if you're replying back me that's not nice like
you you don't cure hate with hate right so if i see someone being really nasty so i don't like that like i'd rather you
not defend me i don't want that you don't know what that girl's going through just because she's being mean to
me you don't know what she's going through the pain she must be in you don't know but when i see someone
like hey says like you need to chill because that's not nice you don't know what that comment could do to someone
that's a team that's a community that's the family right there
so i'm pretty blessed i don't get as much negativity as maybe other people
i'm pretty pretty blessed touch word that doesn't change um but listen i
i don't know how to explain it to you and i'm gonna sound hella crazy right now but the the community i have man it's
something special like special it's something that
it's it's unexplainable the feeling they give me and that to me is my friends
as weird as i may sound and lonely as i sound so some of the things you're working on right yeah so you've got a book coming
out yes which is exciting tell me about this so exciting so i'm officially an author oh my god
um so my book do this for you how to be a strong woman on the inside and out
is not your average fitness book so i'm pretty sick and tired of 20 day challenges and kind of telling
women that oh my god do this 20 day challenge and you're going to lose 10 pounds oh shut up it's draining jarring stop
i'm going to teach you how to create habits discipline consistency longevity that's what it's about you know all the
programs on the toner sculpt app are some of them are year long
it kind of goes against the typical sales sales script of something with status quo like small effort from you
big results that's what sells right yeah five days you'll lose 100 pounds yeah you know but
that's very honest of you and i think that's real right yeah no you're not you're gonna lose weight of course of course you're gonna lose weight if
you're doing stupid amounts of cardio cutting out specific food groups and you're literally depriving yourself
of course you're gonna lose weight not sustainable is it sustainable no so the way i always say is funny enough
in a relationship if you're constantly just like horrible to someone all the time
is that sustainable not really you have to nourish you have to love you have to care you have to show effort consistency that's what
works same thing with training it's the constant effort you put in day in day out that will make a
difference so it's all about disciplines habits yeah and it's a book that you know what
in all honesty it's a book that i know when someone reads they're going to pass it down right
it's one of those books you read it and it gets you thinking it's a thinking book so i did the audio
book for it as well last week and when i was reading it i was like damn that's good
i was like i know someone's gonna read that yeah yeah listen to it like yeah and it's true
it's a thinking book i ask you what your why is so if i say to you what what is your why why is it that you want to train
i've been over this a lot but uh i mean like the thing that i keep trying to get my myself away from is
having a really extrinsic why that's like i want to look good for summer because when summer ends and i look good
that [ __ ] is done there we go that's a lot of people's why's yeah i want to lose weight for my wedding dress
i want to lose weight for this for an occasion occasion occasionally yeah timeline timeline yeah the occasion comes what then you fall
off a cliff yeah it's not a sustainable why so i teach you how to gain a sustainable why which is fundamentally the most important
foundation you need for fitness then i teach you habits you don't think twice about brushing your teeth why
think twice about your health why think twice about your health your health is the most fundamental and important thing you need
to live you need to get one of them as well and why are you thinking twice about it why are you viewing fitness as a chore
you're viewing your health as a chore that's a shame your body deserves more
whenever you've heard people speak about health like this in a society where women are driven by
fat loss pills and quick quick fad diets and intense workout sessions
it's time to stop it's time to tell you that you need to calm the [ __ ] down
remember your why remember how important your health is and understand that if you have a bad
day it's okay it's okay to have a bad day so that's
what do this for you is all about it sounds amazing i'm gonna read it thank you
um we'll we'll link the pre-order as well in all of the in the podcast and also on the youtube video i wanted to ask you what other things you're working
on i know you just launched a an active wear line that looks pretty awesome they are god has so many issues
with that to begin with but we got there in the end got there in the end honor active um honor active is
fundamentally i was actually building the mission and the vision for it last week um and
one of the things i said is that i don't want it to be a trendsetter why because i don't i don't want
my brand to be something that people just kind of like buy because it's trendy and that's that
i want on active to be something you go back to time and time again so all of our collections have certain
names like the first collection is called classic because you're always going to come back to it it's designed with specific
material that you always come back to it the next collection is called timeless and then our winter collection is called
effortless so it's designed to have a concept that it's your best friend always and forever that it doesn't
matter what year it is you're still going to love honor active because trendsetters they come
and they go you have your 15 minutes fame and then it goes yeah but i want something to be
sustainable if you look at nike lululemon the biggest brands in the world they don't have fancy stuff some of the
best lululemon leggings are the most simplest ones you'll ever find but they're trusted
Outro
and they're loved and that's exactly what i want honor to be i'm not here to start trends
sorry i'm not here to start trends i'm here to ensure that you pick up your leggings
and you trust this product that's my goal for honor active on to
the next business no toner sculpture toner scott was still like obviously my
number one baby in an honor active of course but what we done with toner sculpt um we launched a brand new athlete danielle
wilson i don't know i i clicked on her profile she followed me i was quite uh she loves you oh my gosh she's going to
be so excited yeah she's like oh my god she always reposted and i was like yeah he's all right
i'm joking she's like oh but now she is very special
um because i approached her and the reason why i want to talk about her briefly in this in this podcast is
because i think it's very important she's a 200 pound african-american woman
5 foot 11 not your average fitness guru right
so why would tone and sculpt want her she's not your average fitness guru why would you want
someone who women are scared to think that's what fitness looks like
let me tell you why because fitness for such a long time is not about the
way it looks it's about the way it makes you feel she trains because it makes her feel alive
she's an athlete yeah she trains athletes she is an athlete built like an athlete
that's what i wanted for my brand so when i approached a year and a half ago i
slid into her dms and i was like i am every day inspired by you
and i didn't really think i wanted trainers other trainers on the tone and sculpt out but i what i need you i need
you and on this app and she was like what are you serious like you really
think i should be on the app and i was like hell yeah you need to be on this app you inspire me i know you're gonna
inspire thousands of other women and it's funny because when the whole
black lives matter thing happened five other companies approached her in that month
five other fitness brands and i had a face time with her and i said listen babe if they're
offering you more money and you think it's a better opportunity for you i understand
business is business she goes hell no i'm married to you i'm not going anywhere i'm married to
you she goes but how funny is it that it took something happening
for them to approach me i didn't say anything and i said to her
i'm gonna let you answer that question yourself for yourself oh that that oh that week
my emails were blowing right up black lives matter week i had more speaking requests more invitations
to campaigns than i've ever had in my entire life you know what it is but i'm gonna be honest i'm gonna take the bag
do you know what i mean yeah if you're if you're approaching me because um you think you suddenly have had this
revelation that you need a black person involved fine fine i can't find uh
you know what we're gonna do say no and then like they're gonna go have to go because in this case to find someone else yeah they're not
and in this country when you think about young black successful entrepreneurs
and jamal edwards there's the guy who made sbtv who's been on this podcast it's [ __ ] no one else like that are
you gonna have to start looking at footballers if you want young black and successful and and so yeah [ __ ] and also i can use that platform
as as a way to inspire other people to change their opinions in the same way obama
inspired a lot of naive americans to think that oh my god a black person can be smart and intelligent and clean don't please i
could just so yeah i took the bags every single bag all mine and you know what i i'll keep taking them yeah
no hell yeah hell oh yeah like are you [ __ ] joking me i said i
i looked at danny i said sanya on the on the facetime it doesn't matter where you go it matters what you're going to
represent yeah yeah do you understand that you're going to change a young girl's life by being somewhere
being present being vocal being ambitious do it if the platform that's offering you more money
is bigger do it she was like no i want to be at toner school of course because you yeah but that's
just loyalty that's just her being loyal but it goes beyond bringing another trainer
onto the app it's about representation it's about i'm sick and tired of fitness having
one status quo fitness is not one status quo it's about to help people mentally and physically
if it wasn't for fitness i would not be alive today and that's facts so what's next for chrissy what's next
when you think about the future personally i don't know business
amazing yeah stuff that are coming up beyond um but from a personal
perspective i don't know i really don't know i don't know what's even happening tomorrow in my personal
life are you happy in what sense that's the question for what in one sense in your life are
you happy um i would say i'm really happy in my career and i'm really happy in my community
um from a personal perspective i think i need to just
take a breather and i would say i need to work on my happiness on a personal
perspective a little bit more yeah for sure you're gonna do that
see you're funny because you asked me the questions and you ask if i'm going to do it and then i don't know the answer to that question because i don't
know if i will do it so i don't know i think i just need to i think i just need to be a bit more
patient with myself and a little bit kinder to myself and less self-defensive
listen um i've i've taken a lot of your time and it's been a fascinating conversation i've learned a lot about myself as well
really yeah it's like you know on many of these issues they are they're issues that anybody in the
situation you know both me and you find ourselves in in life where we're running businesses and we're very busy but then
we're also trying to fulfill all of our personal needs at the same time when one of those you know
facets of our life is so all-consuming we feel the same things and we're confused by it we don't have
the answers and as much as we want to have the answers and have control over everything because we are
used to that and we strive for that in our business you know sometimes we have to relinquish control in order to be happy
maybe that's a lot of the answer but thank you so much for giving me your time today but more
importantly for giving me so much honesty um and where can where can people
find you i mean you're everywhere so don't ask questions like you know you've got your book
coming out you've got your app you've got your activewear line i'm sure people will find you and um i just want to say thank you because
there's very few people out there that are a willing to be honest it takes a certain vulnerability to be that honest but it does so much for so
many people and um on behalf of your community on behalf of entrepreneurs like me on
behalf of all of the aspiring female entrepreneurs that are following in your footsteps a
huge thank you because what you're doing it's costing you a lot but it's giving the world even more
so thank you thank you so much
oh
you

Summary:
The podcast episode begins with the host, Stephen Bartlett, expressing gratitude for the positive feedback on the previous week's podcast, emphasizing its life-changing content, which covered diverse topics like depression, anxiety, and burnout. He reflects on how being an interviewer has been an enlightening and educational experience for him, offering personal growth and insights.

In this episode, Bartlett discusses various personal anecdotes, lessons learned, and topics that are significant to him. Key points include:

1. **Means to an End Syndrome**: Bartlett shares his personal struggle with maintaining fitness beyond September each year, exploring the psychological patterns behind his repeated cycle of motivation and burnout. He realizes that his fitness goals were extrinsically motivated, tied to public opinion and summer's end. By shifting to intrinsic motivations (like feeling great, self-discipline, and positive impacts on health), he maintains his fitness routine beyond the usual cycle.
    
2. **Journey Back to Human**: Bartlett delves into how modern solutions for mental health often hark back to simpler, ancient lifestyles. He argues that over-stimulation, poor nutrition, and isolation have led to increased mental health issues. He suggests that re-embracing simple, intrinsic life aspects, like community, nature, and physical activity, can lead to improved mental and overall well-being.
    
3. **Humans Have No Idea What They Want**: Sharing a conversation with a friend, Bartlett discusses how extrinsic motivations and societal constructs often mislead our perceptions of success and happiness. He stresses the importance of intrinsic motivations and the pitfalls of chasing external validations, such as wealth or status.
    
4. **Avoiding Good Opportunities for Great Ones**: Bartlett talks about the challenge of saying no to good opportunities to keep time and energy focused on great ones. He emphasizes clarity on long-term goals, intrinsic values, and a stringent valuation of one's time as crucial factors in decision-making.
    
5. **Skepticism on Marriage and Monogamy**: Bartlett questions the traditional concept of marriage and its alignment with human nature. He shares his thoughts on the institutional aspects of marriage, like legal and religious bindings, and ponders on the naturalness of monogamy, suggesting that societal norms might have influenced our views on these concepts.
    
6. **The Curse of Fitting In**: He concludes by highlighting the joy and success stemming from being true to oneself rather than conforming to societal expectations. He argues that authenticity, rather than fitting in, leads to genuine happiness and self-fulfillment.
    

Bartlett wraps up by encouraging listeners to reflect on being more human and true to themselves as potential keys to a fulfilling life. He invites feedback and engagement from the audience, reinforcing the interactive nature of his podcast.

Transcription:

hello listen before i start i just want to pay a little bit of homage and also a tribute to the guests that i had joined
me last week on this podcast the feedback that i got from that conversation for those that had the
resilience to listen for the full two hours and if you haven't i genuine genuinely implore you too
because the value of that conversation and the diversity of the topics we touched on i genuinely believe are life-changing
i've reflected continuously throughout this week on that conversation we touched on everything from depression to
anxiety to burnout and it's really developed to me you know what one of the things they say is that
the teacher is the person in a classroom that gets the most value from a conversation and in that context
i as the interviewer who got to sit there and listen and prod and think through my own sort of selfish curiosity
i think i got the most value out of that i certainly learned a ton about myself the world and some of the problems that i've had throughout my
life so if you haven't and you do get the time i implore you to go back and check out that episode
and in fact that episode has it's inspired this episode in many ways one of the
things that you guys have said to me in my dms on your stories
in the reviews everywhere my emails you said to me one of the things you enjoy most about this podcast
is when i'm a little bit more raw and when i i'm a little bit less scripted per se
not that i'm ever really that scripted but when i'm a little bit more off the cuff when i talk about my own anecdotes my own life and my own stories and so
this episode this chapter is going to be exactly that it's predominantly centered on my
anecdotes my diary is full of things that have happened to me this week personal stories from my friends and the
lessons that they've taught me the lessons they've taught me about myself about my life and about how to build a
better future so without further ado i'm stephen bartlett and this is the divers ceo
i hope nobody's listening but if you are then please keep this to yourself
How I've FINALLY fixed / figured out why we lose motivation
so for the first point in my diary this week i've literally just written means to an end syndrome let me explain what i
mean every single year i set myself the same goal in february and the goal is simple it's to get in
good physical shape and every year thankfully i achieved that goal until september
and by october my motivation to work out to eat well and to be healthy seems to transform from this like
tangible object that i can hold on to to sand slipping through my hands by january the following year
all hell has broken loose in my diet i'm basically fat compared to how i usually am my my energy is lower my sleep isn't as
good i just don't feel my best anymore then february comes around again and march comes around
and i set myself the same goal to get in shape and the cycle repeats itself this has happened to me i'd say every
year for at least the last five years in a row and i've not been able to understand from a psychological perspective
why this is happening and with all things in life until you become conscious of what's causing you to
behave the way that you are you're merely just a puppet and the puppet master
remains this unknown force this experience you had at some point uh you know a facet of your psychology one
that usually doesn't have your best interests at heart one that usually can't be trusted a puppet master that certainly isn't
working for you he's working for your insecurities or for your for your ego or for trauma that you've experienced
the same cycle unfortunately started to repeat itself this year i mean i started the year fat january
time i was pretty fat compared to how i usually am walking can feel the little rolls on my belly shaking as i walk and i'm wearing
slightly baggier clothes by august i was in the best shape of my entire life right because of an obsessive focus
on the gym i was going seven days a week i was calorie counting one day i did 5 000 calories
and by september my motivation started as it always does to just fall away
i noticed that i wasn't charging my apple watch anymore i noticed that i'd started to miss the gym i started to eat junk food again
this lasted for about two weeks this year but this time i started to be a bit more
conscious about it i told myself what i was doing and i started examining my own psychology and saying literally saying
to myself steve you're doing it that cycle is repeating itself you're eating [ __ ] you're lacking motivation
fortunately i've just written a whole chapter on the topic of motivation for my upcoming book
so i because of the research that i had to do to write that chapter i understand the psychological principles and the forces at play that make someone
motivated or unmotivated and armed with that and my own sort of critical self-analysis which i attained from
being more conscious about what i was doing the fact that i was eating junk food and i'd i could feel my motivation waning
i finally understood why this is happening to me maybe maybe this is happening to me
isn't the best way to describe it why i'm doing this to myself or not doing things to myself that i should be
doing and touchwood i finally overcome it it's november and i'm still working out for the first
time literally in my life i'm still eating well and i'm still focused on my health goals and this is the first year ever that i
can remember in the last five really in the last decade where i've been just as committed to working out now and to being healthy in my entire
life than i was during the summer so let me tell you how i did this and let me tell you what i understood
about my own motivation because i know it's going to speak to you in your own way let me rewind every year around february
march i say the same thing to myself and i set myself the same goal let's just stop there right and take a
look at what i just said because there's a real clue in that first sentence why does this goal pop up in march
the answer quite an obvious one because summer is on the horizon and you've got to ask yourself again you've got to criticize yourself there
and say well why does summer matter well because you know summertime is a time where
we wear less clothes we're a little bit more vulnerable our bodies are on show more and then you can ask yourself okay so why is that relevant well it speaks to
the nature of my motivation my motivation wasn't to work out it wasn't to be healthy because i want
long-term health benefits or to or to feel great about myself as embarrassing as this is to admit my
motivation was so clearly clearly to look good for
summer let's just break that down a second look good for summer looking good
as a goal is measured by just one thing the public's opinion of me ladies opinion of me that's what we call
an extrinsic external goal success of that goal will be achieved when the public think i look
good the next part of that sentence right was for summer the next part of my goal was for
summer which is a measurable time frame so once summer is over
the job is done so the motivation behind that goal was both extrinsic and held within a time frame so when i
dropped that social media pic of me topless in mykonos or wherever i went this summer mykonos and costa rica looking good
during summer and when i got the compliments the likes the followers the praise and when summer passed unsurprisingly
so did my motivation job done my goal my reason my why was attached to summer
and also public opinion and both had been fulfilled so as i pulled into october and i tried to find
the motivation to go to the gym it was gone going to the gym suddenly felt so pointless to me and i had no idea why it
just did even when i managed to get to the gym my workout was quite honestly pathetic it was short it was like
25 30 minutes of me predominantly texting and i didn't know why i just thought i wasn't feeling great
like you know like a boat that had suddenly been unanchored i was now just drifting
unconsciously without intention or real motivation or without conscious realization into
the winter months into bad habits into fat steve and the minute i realized this this year i was able to completely
reset and sort of re-anchor my motivation into things that were intrinsically internally motivating and
without time frames i set myself the goal of going to the gym just because it makes me feel great
and because of the energy it gives me and the positive impact it has on my sleep and because you know i love showing
myself how self-disciplined i am i get a real weird feeling of joy by
going to the gym on a day when i feel like [ __ ] because for me that's kind of overcoming my mind
right it's like beating um the the negative or the the weaker parts of my mind that
are trying to dissuade me from doing something that's in line with my long-term values and honestly also people don't like to
say this but the positive impact it has on my sex life i didn't really know how to say this without sounding like a [ __ ] dick but
i have never been there in bed
and and just generally how good it makes me feel all year round all of these things have
no finish line they're not extrinsically or externally judged by the public they're the opposite of the extrinsic
short-term goals i set myself in march they're intrinsic they are never ending they view life not
just as a bunch of recurring seasons but as one season one season from now until the
day that i die the season of life and that that is the season that it's incredibly valuable
and important to be healthy and to look good for as james clear says you
know we tend to believe that we'll be more successful or happy or prosperous if we put more intensity into our lives
you know like the intensity that i showed in march every year in the lead-up to summer you know like crash diets and sprinting towards our goals at
the expense of everything else staying up for weeks and weeks and weeks on end to revise for that exam but the truth is we don't need intensity
if we have a little bit more consistency had i just stayed in good shape in september october november december and
january if i just gone to the gym maybe twice or three times a week throughout that period and avoided a bit of you know the junk food
which i binged on um periodically through that period i wouldn't even need the intensity for the rest of the year i wouldn't need to
starve myself obsessive in my diet and go to the gym seven days a week sometimes twice a day in fact
intensity for me is often a sign that we lacked consistency in the past and i think
and i've said this a couple of times in this podcast before but until you know right and this is not easy i'm gonna
make this sound like it's an easy thing to do but it requires the same sort of critical self-analysis and
that i've demonstrated that what you would have seen from what i just said is i interrogated my rationale so i said
you know why does it why do i always get motivated in february in march and then i said well because you know someone's around the corner and then why does summer
matter well because other you know extrinsic reasons and if you go down that rabbit hole with humility and with the attention of not defending
your ego but finding the truth then you might understand what's motivating you but until you know what's
motivating you you won't know where you're going or why you're going there or who's steering the ship what force in
your life is steering that ship and i'd predict that 99.9
of your motivations are misguided or somewhat unconscious you don't really know why you're doing
what you're doing i think most of the time you have no idea what the driving force behind your behavior is the same applies
for me but until you do until you have the self-awareness and that humility you need
to interrogate your thinking and the lack of ego to identify why you're doing what you're doing whether it's superficial driven by
insecurities from your childhood because you're seeking validation like i was or other you will never actually be
in control of your life something else is and if your goals are extrinsic
someone else's okay so the next point in my diary i've just written here journey back to human let me explain
Why people are more depressed and anxious (and a cure)
i find it so ironic but somewhat unsurprising if i'm honest that most of the new age techniques that were aimed
to sort of improve our mental health and overall well-being are largely based on
old age principles of how our life used to be tens of thousands of years ago and in the process of writing my book i
i went back over the last i'd say three decades to see how humans and neanderthals lived
their lives to understand why this is it's almost like as we developed as humans and as we
started to rely on agriculture and farming and we stopped living in our tribe it's like we took a wrong turn
and we filled our lives with over stimulation and with like alcohol and caffeine and poor nutrition and
loneliness and convenience right and i think based on the alarming growth in mental health conditions like depression
anxiety addiction and even other conditions like loneliness and i'd say purposefulness right
i think it's time to turn back and the question i guess i often i'm forced to ponder is
what is what is a human being what are we what are we meant to be if we take away
all of this social pressure take away instagram and all of the noise and all of the pressure to conform what are we who are we and how are we
meant to live and infrequently i'll find myself trawling through google
as i did as i you know when i went over to costa rica and i spent the time in the jungle i found myself trawling through google in
history trying to understand humans and it's unsurprising that the natural lifestyle of humans
back then consists of everything that therapists and nutritionists and mindset coaches and psychologists
preach about when you're feeling like [ __ ] today let's start with probably the most
obvious it should be the most obvious and it's definitely a one of the things that's causing depression in a lot of people
it's this lack of human connection back then 10 000 years ago we lived in our tribes surrounded by family and friends and
johanna hari who came on this podcast and is actually coming back on this year that's a little exclusive for you wrote a life-shifting
book called lost connections on this exact point and if there's ever a book i've read in my life and i'm not here to plug your hannah harry just for you know
because he comes on the podcast and stuff like that the reason he comes on this podcast is because his book i'd say in the last
three years has had the biggest single impact on how i see the world right
the fundamental conclusion of that book is we need each other that is non-negotiable i i've read a
bunch of studies and i've seen a bunch of ted talks on youtube where they've done a study over a century and they followed like a hundred
or a thousand people and the people that don't establish meaningful relationships in their lives
die earlier they get more sick and they have a worse quality of life i didn't used to think this stuff right
right i didn't think this was important before i mistakenly thought that if i got rich really really rich everything else would
fall into place so when i at 18 years old my whole life was centered on this north star which was getting filthy rich
at the expense of everything and i sacrificed everything for that and i i gotta be honest because this
that's what this podcast is for i felt that loneliness i didn't actually like weekends because
they were so empty for me i didn't have anything to do i'd i'm sure some of you can relate to this you
know especially you hustle porn stars out there that are running your businesses weekends were just this big [ __ ] void in my life
there was nothing to do so i just went to the office my entire life at that point when i was 18 19 20 was focused on money work business
and after developing this habit of like forced self-induced loneliness for about five
six or seven years it had really really stuck i was a
self-diagnosed recluse one that spent all of his time in the office on my laptop making more money even
though i already had more money than i you know could ever possibly need and at some point thankfully i realized
the never-ending pointless insanity of my situation what was the point in having all of this
money and if i didn't have any meaningful relationships to enjoy it with life is uh it's a multiplayer game it's
not a solo experience and i i got to see how miserable some of my quote unquote successful
friends were by just being behind the scenes in their life one of the i guess the positive things that happened to me when i became
successful quote unquote was i made a lot of successful friends and those friends in many cases were way ahead of me and
and what they did for me is they showed me what my future would look like if i carried on how i was
i got to see behind the scenes behind their lamborghinis behind their mansions and i realized that life had lied to me
you know of course progress and success and striving towards goals matter like of course right it's
it's made me fulfilled to some degree but not at the expense of all the other things not the expensive meaningful and
frequent human connection the other thing that i observe when i when i sort of reflect on on how our ancestors used to live is just
the sheer simplicity of their lives you know they lived together in in caves and these simple huts they were
hunters and gatherers they used basic tools which they had made to track
and hunt birds and wild animals they cooked their prey around a campfire they fished they collected berries and fruits and
nuts their goals were so significantly more intrinsic and survival focused than ours are today
they were focused on taking care of themselves and one another a very simple life it's a very simple purpose
without all of this [ __ ] [ __ ] that we have today without instagram without politics trump fearful news cycles without
two hour work commutes right to get between four white walls to lock ourselves in a cubicle without stress
without traffic without obsessive worrying and notifications and emails and
inbox zero pressures and social pressures and expectations of how your life is meant to be going without all of that [ __ ] a simpler life
which results in a simpler mind which is so frequently the thing that you know
psychologists and therapists prescribe to all of us when we have illnesses today to simplify our lives
but simplifying our lives seems to go against society's mandate that expects you to be
so much that expects career success from you that expects financial success material possessions that expects
psychological perfection that expects physical fitness and health social status to push yourself out of
your comfort zone to climb the ladder to have perfect relationships at the same time to demonstrate the perfect
behavior all while living living in a healthy perfect clear mentally stable mind this level of
like obsessive perfection and you know accomplishment seeking and validation hunting
isn't conducive with simplicity not in the world we live in today absolutely not it's either one or the
other in many respects so instead of living you know a simple life we kind of burn ourselves to the ground
and then we escape off on holiday which is usually based on simplicity which is you know laying down
out in nature and relaxing and doing very little it's like you know there was a quote from a guest that i had on this podcast
a couple of years ago i think it was when i had a chat with the ceo of leon the restaurant chain and he said
you should never cut down the rainforest and then donate to the bees and this is exactly what this strikes me as
you're cutting down your own rainforest in order to donate to your own bees ruining yourself so that you can raise
the funds you need to fix yourself it's like it feels like insanity and i'm super guilty of this i have to admit
so one of the things that i've tried to introduce into my life is a little bit more simplicity scenarios and context that simplify my
life and every day now i go for a walk there and back to the gym and i listen to my music something i didn't do before i just got
an uber and the other thing that's really helped simplify my life is just playing with my dog pets like kids are amazing for
simplifying your world because they live in such a simple world like my dog can spend an hour absolutely amused and
obsessed by like a lucas aid bottle or like pretending he's hunting it's like such a remarkable thing when you
contrast it to the complexity of the world we live in if you're looking to simplify your world briefly
try it if you don't have a dog get a dog but try it try going into their world my niece and
my dog are fascinatingly simple and they're unassuming and they're unpretentious and i want to
live more in that world sometimes and i think this is why some people are also so incredibly obsessed with nature
all this simplicity seems to calm the mind you know it sort of re-centers your soul and the next thing you see if you look
back at our ancestors and how they lived their lives is exactly that they spent literally all of their time in nature that's where they lived they
lived in nature during that i'm going to get this word wrong right but during the mesolithic
period i got it right 12 000 years ago they lived nomadically in camps near rivers and
near other sort of large bodies of water and today like a bunch of dumbass over
developed monkeys we live in these concrete jungles alone between four white walls the time i spent last month for pretty
much the whole month living in the costa rican jungle was the most wonderful tranquil experience of my life it was the most
human experience of my entire life making time in nature has to be a central part of my routine now
it's a really [ __ ] good decision especially for someone like me that lives in a big
busy traffic ridden noisy chaotic city and lastly the key thing i see when i look back at
our ancestors was exercise and nutrition we me you us our generation
are the most inactive sedentary group of humans of all time according to the data our lifestyles are gradually becoming
more and more still more sat down at our desks glaring into these illuminated glass
screens and office blocks we don't need to hunt and gather anymore right like our ancestors did which was a huge source of their physical activity
and exercise because we've got delivery and ubereats some guy will bring me
any food that i want to my door in 25 minutes and i'll be honest with you it's not always good food it's usually you know full of sugar and
artificial substances and things like caffeine which move our mood one way or the other
and also back then we would literally carve and scavenge for the tools that we needed to make our food today
amazon prime that [ __ ] will be here tomorrow i've included this sort of terrifying graph in my book that shows
the gradual decline of human activity i've placed it against the graph of obesity and sugar consumption
and it makes for a pretty alarming read right we're not living like humans anymore we live like lazy gluttonous gorillas he would
increasingly rather go under the knife on a surgeon's table to change our appearance than make a simple lifestyle change not
very human at all is it so no wonder we don't feel so human these days if this is how you're living certainly
how i was living then you should expect to not feel great because you're not living in accordance with your own
natural way of being it's crazy it's crazy that the new age cures for our new age problems all seek to take us
back 10 000 years meditation and digital detoxes are there to still our mind healthy nutrition to cut
out modern junk foods therapy friendships and human connection to read us of the loneliness and to
connect us back to our tribe these feelings of loneliness and anxiety and depression are often according to the science and
my own personal experience nothing more than a calling from our body to get back to our tribes
to be a little bit more human not to find ourselves but to rediscover who we were
who we are as humans and if you're struggling in any way here's some advice give it a go try and
live a little bit more human for me as a sort of mentally busy career-obsessed recluse it fundamentally changed my life
i know that for sure and i genuinely believe that it might be the thing that could have the greatest impact on yours
Humans have no idea what they want
okay so for the next point in my diary i've literally just written humans have no idea what they want which kind of ties a little bit into my first point
but it's very very different i want to tell you a story one of my very very good friends i won't name him
because that doesn't matter and i keep referencing friends on this podcast i'm slowly losing friends so my
my circle is getting a little bit smaller i'm just joking one of my good friends came to my house last week for a little bit of a catch up
and he sat on my my sofa over there and he asked me um a couple of questions about myself and i
turned to him and i said listen how have you been and somewhat instinctively as we all do he replied yeah good and you know
when you're my mate i have to be honest i [ __ ] hate that response give that response to someone in like
business or when you're in a networking event or something like that nobody has been yeah good nobody
life fortunately and to be honest unfortunately isn't that simple definitely not in the middle of a global pandemic where our lives are locked down and
stripped back and have been completely shifted nobody's yeah good so i instinctively replied to him which is a habit i've got
into recently especially with my close friends no how have you really been and almost
instantly literally almost instantly he went yeah yeah i'm pretty burnt out to be honest with you and
that's kind of surprising because you know i'm really lucky and i stopped him there and the reason i stopped him there is because i've just spent the last
month studying the topic of burnout for my book and i wanted to check i wanted to check if he like
pretty much everyone else i've ever spoke to fit into the pattern and the category that almost everybody fits into when
they experience burnout i said to him when you say you're feeling burnt out but you're surprised
because you're lucky what do you mean by lucky and he said well you know because you know i've got all the things ticked off i've got the
money i've got the car i've got the house and then i stopped him again and i said that's why you're burnt out because your own self-confessed
definition of career or life luck and success is extrinsically purely extrinsically motivated
and as i said in last week's podcast on almost every occasion where someone is doing something that they're motivated to do by largely extrinsic or
external reasons whether it's money or status or fame or likes or followers or to obtain like
material objects where the intrinsic internal rewards like joy and personal fulfillment
a sense of purpose or a sense of belonging are limited you will inevitably lose your motivation
you'll struggle to get out of bed and you'll self-diagnose yourself as everybody seems to do as being burnt out and let's just take a
look at the world we're living in right now because it adds a really important layer of context to all of that this pandemic has robbed all of us our
lives and our work of things that made work and our lives intrinsically enjoyable you know that feeling of striving
towards a shared goal the social value of being part of a team in an office that sense of belonging it gives you
the sense of forward motion and progress and purpose and accomplishment and to be honest in our personal lives
socializing and days out and family and friends and travel and this robber the pandemic covert 19
has left most of us with just the work wake up zoom to-do list sleep wake up to-do list
sleep it's left us with just the extrinsic stuff and to be completely honest
the only thing that makes doing a lot of the extrinsic stuff like work worthwhile is the promise of all the intrinsic
stuff socializing community purpose that it promises you that it gives us
but right now it's not giving us that we're largely alone not enjoying ourselves much we don't
know what the mission is we don't know when we're going to be out of this situation so our work feels heavily extrinsic therefore pointless
we're doing it to pay the bills we don't have our colleagues around us anymore that sense of purpose and mission is gone therefore we lack motivation
therefore we feel burnt out the more i've tried to understand the complexity of humans the more i've realized how simple
predictable and alike we all are and our motivations don't tend to be that dissimilar with
such fragile emotional unconscious beings that think we're strong resilient unique
and in control we're not we're all going through this [ __ ] together making the same mistakes predictably
because we all have a very very similar innate psychological wiring and the same psychological factors are
running the show our working lives have been completely knocked out of balance and the work is just that now it's work
social chain my company the company i founded and recently resigned from you know it was renowned for its culture
for its sense of community for the sense of purpose and that intrinsic pleasure it gives the people that work there for
the joy of you know the dogs in the office we had about 10 of them to be honest we had a happiness team that would make sure every day when
you're in the office you're feeling good therapists that were there for you in the office every single day we had this sense of mission and purpose
that we were building this business and forward motion and uh it was going great because the business was growing it still is but it
was growing and that gives you purpose as well but when a pandemic and a lockdown strikes all of that stuff
is taken away all that intrinsic stuff the enjoyment is taken away and something that was fundamentally
designed from the ground up to give you as much joy as a job could possibly give you becomes a bunch of people alone in their boxer
shorts on their own little islands doing their to-do list every day chatting once in a while on zoom or over
whatsapp or in shared company groups work becomes work nothing more that combined with the lack
of structure that everyone has in their day now results in long ass working hours and that has a huge impact on your sleep and
and all of these things and all the other problems sends you straight into a place of purposelessness low motivation
and when all that happens we we say it's burnout and i think everybody's experiencing a bit of burnout right now
you know every year at christmas uh come it's widely known according to the data
companies experience the highest amount of staff turnover because you know as those sort of new year's resolutions and all the introspection
occurs people decide they want to go work somewhere else they want a new challenge they want something else for their lives and we always see the same thing as
social chain and this year we saw that behavior happen a few months into the pandemic
quite a few people quit more than we've ever had in the middle of the year ever before and part of me knows that this is
because social change pretty much every company lost some of its intrinsic value that community and purpose and fun
and when it loses it and when all you have is the extrinsic like paying the bills a lot of people go looking for pay rises and if you've worked at social
channel i'm telling you you can get a pay rise it's got a good brand people want people that have worked at social chain and when people to
start to sort of enjoy their work less they arrive often at the conclusion that social change is maybe part of the issue maybe social
change is the reason i'm not enjoying my work as much so they go in search of that purpose somewhere else and people have been
leaving other companies and in their droves to be honest and wanting to come to social chain and people have left social chain wanting to go
elsewhere and this is something that's happened not in social chain alone across every business across the whole country so if you're feeling like [ __ ]
in your job if you're feeling a bit burnt out if you're lacking motivation you're feeling i know stagnant this is probably a large part of the
reason but going back to the conversation with my friend which is where this this started before i went off topic there's another important layer to
address here my friend like me had a relatively psychologically
rough start to life with family issues and issues with his peers it robbed something from his self-worth
in the same way it did for me it made him insecure in the same way it did for me and listen bro i know you're
listening to this because this guy he's one of my very good friends he never misses an episode he always gives me great feedback i know you're
listening to this right it takes one to no one everything i'm saying about you could be
said about me too i too as everyone knows grew up with insecurities that made me try and ball out on social media they
made me buy all the champagne and every night club i went to made me pull up in sports cars right in his case it's made him particularly
intent on showing the world that he is worthy and that he is successful the clue of course is in the fact that when i asked him to
define what luck or success meant to him he said a bunch of material things something some insecurity taught him as
it taught me that his success would be judged by the outside world's opinion of him and as i said in a previous episode of
this podcast the thing that invalidates you as a kid whether it's sort of lack of self-worth or a lack of affection or
a lack of a sense of belonging will be the thing you seek validation from when you're an adult and you know failure when both he and i were
young was not being worthy not feeling as worthy as our peers me for my own reasons and
him for a bunch of different reasons and because that was our definition of failure that
was the thing that failed us that's what you know that was the the worst part of our lives then our definition of success now
is the opposite think about it if failure then was not feeling externally valid or valuable or worthy
success now is feeling externally valid worthy and valuable so we we both got big cars nice houses
lots of champagne and we proceeded to tell and show the world all of it i guess subconsciously in the
hope that it would validate us and we designed our lives to focus on achieving extrinsic externally motivated goals like money success
status and the science is clear on this and my own personal experience it couldn't be it could be clearer on this particular
topic according to the science you will experience less joy more despair increase your chances of depression anxiety
and sign yourself up for a hamster wheel existence where nothing is ever enough of anti-climax and of
lack of purpose and if you design your life where your north star is all of this sort of extrinsic meaningless [ __ ]
you're designing out all of the things that actually internally matter like meaningful relationships the two are kind of
mutually exclusive the things that you enjoy for you for your own reasons for your own internal
sake meaningful hobbies and passions and subsequently the chance of being fulfilled happy and free from all the mental
health issues that will inevitably show up if you live in such an externally driven way you know at 18 years old
as a lot of you will know i wrote in my diary that my goal was to buy a range rover um
i wrote there in my diary that a range rover would be my first car that was my goal and that was a goal
that was born out of insecure naivety i guess
definitely a lot of insecurity and it was a goal written because i wanted to impress people and i wanted girls to sleep with me
right a goal born out of the fact that i wanted to be validated and fulfilled and i thought somewhere in me that a
range rover would make me feel secure in myself i got the range rover it was my first
car mission accomplished it impressed people but when you think about it it didn't make
me feel secure in myself all it did was highlighted
but i wasn't it was the consequence of insecurity so paradoxically the day i achieved my
goal wasn't the day that i bought the range rover it was the day three years later when i
sold it when i no longer felt that i needed it that was the point where i was securing
myself and that was the goal i was trying to achieve and you know going back to my friend for
a second you know he's just to give you a context of how he's working he runs his own business but he works alone
very similar to how a freelance would work doesn't have like a team of people around him just kind of working alone at home at the moment
and you know the world has done just a phenomenal job of glamorizing the idea of being your own boss and being a
freelancer but nobody seems to talk enough about how miserable this often is and let's just factor all of the things that
i've touched on on in this podcast up till this point about you know extrinsic goals and the things that make
life meaningful you know the joy of working in a team of people with a shared mission on work that you intrinsically enjoy
doing with as much intrinsic motivation as possible all of this stuff is often the absolute
antithesis of freelance work where you often work alone without a team on someone else's project for
someone else's purpose just for the extrinsic reason of money or paying the bills right
on top of that you have all of the other [ __ ] being on japan no work life balance no work life separation no clock
off time i'm gonna call this freelancer depression we're gonna try and make this a thing freelance and depression
it's something that people who evangelize about being your own boss and going alone and all of the freelance lifestyle never
seemed to mention that much and to be fair this pandemic has made us all freelancers to some degree it's
robbed us all of that intrinsic rewarding stuff i i guess i just want to i just want to tell you one more thing
now that i've left social chain and i'm technically unemployed i was i sat on the sofa it was actually
yesterday with my it's actually yesterday night before i recorded this podcast with my assistant and she turned to me and she asked me a question she said do you miss all the
travelling and the chaos of your old life and i said to her like what do you mean what do you mean and she said well you
know you used to be up at 3am every day running all over the world pitching and speaking on stage and for a second i paused and reflected
and the thought of doing any of that stuff now [ __ ] repulsed me
i couldn't think of anything worse but i mean this is a big but i absolutely
used to love it i absolutely used to love it made me so fulfilled but now you couldn't pay me to do that and the
reason for this the reason for this sort of monumental shift in my mind is because when i was at
social chain i was working with people i loved attached to a shared meaningful purpose and a mission and we were building
something amazing together when you remove that and ask me if i want to run around the world catching five flights a week and living in hotels
50 weeks a year it seems totally bizarre and repulsive and pointless it seems like such a sacrifice for nothing i would
hate to do that and it brings me back to the moment in my life where you know i think i've talked about this on the
podcast before where i was technically freelance for the first time it was after i was 21 years old i just exited my first startup wall park
and i hadn't started social chain yet i was being paid i've got to be honest with you about 70 grand a month by companies all over the world
to help them as a consultant run their businesses to advise their marketing and i was in this i was in um i turned
to my mate dom in our penthouse apartment in manchester on the 20 we own three floors up there i'm not bragging i'm just providing a
bit of context which i think is important and i told him exact quote if i go downstairs right now and i send this one
email i'll make 20k straight away and i just can't find the [ __ ]
motivation to do it and i don't know why it's 20k that's what i said to him verbatim exactly and the reason
was because at that point even at the point where i was making 5k a month consistently something as extrinsic as a little bit
more money was not motivation enough it would have no intrinsic material
impact on my life so the cost of walking down some stairs and writing an email felt greater than the reward
but when i you know when i think about the moment i went from being a freelancer to when social change started
i was working with people i loved on a shared meaningful mission to build something [ __ ] a flight of stairs i was flying to the ukraine at
2am on the off chance that someone might work with us and i did that like a dog for
seven or eight years i didn't have a motivation problem when i was a freelancer it wasn't a motivation problem right as
people often sort of self-diagnose it wasn't a lack of motivation that stopped me walking down the stairs in my
penthouse and sending that one email that would make 20 grand i had a purpose problem and the same applies to the conversation i had with
my pa you know when i think about sprinting around the world pitching speaking living in hotels and sacrificing my life now
it feels so [ __ ] pointless because i've left social chain so i'm i guess i'm detached from the
purpose and the mission that i had then and i i finally understand for the first time in my life
why people who looked at my life back then and often said to me you know how did you do it you know why did you
sacrifice everything are you crazy when do you sleep all of these questions um are you okay i used to get asked all the
time um how did you find the motivation all the time to to run the business and all of these things why you know sleeping in the
office in the weekends why did you work so hard it all makes sense now because when i look back
without the attachment to that mission that i had then to me it it looks bizarre i'm asking old stephen
why the [ __ ] did you do all of that because right now i can't feel that purpose so all i can feel is the sacrifice
but i guess that's that's how you behave i guess that's how you behave when you have a deep sense of purpose in the work you're doing so i guess my conclusion is
this the answer to loving your work and being as being the best at it which i think
that i eventually became within my company is working with people you love striving towards a shared worthwhile goal
for your own intrinsically rewarding reasons and if you can do that i think you'll also do a pretty good job
of avoiding burnout you'll do you'll do the work of your life for sure like i did at social chain
and you'll remain fulfilled the whole time that little insight helped me so i
really hope it helps you and so the next point in my diary is one that i haven't fully developed yet my
Key to success: Avoiding good opportunities so you have time to devote to great opportunities.
thinking on so i'm kind of hoping i can do this out loud with you together what i've written is one of the hardest things in life is to avoid a good
opportunity so that you have time to devote to great opportunities and since i've left social chain and i'm now
technically unemployed but i have a great reputation i have a great track record um i gotta be honest my inbox every day
is full of just amazing opportunities but the amount of time that i have every day has remained the same
i have the same 24 hours and i'm being bombarded with offers and jobs and opportunities to do
this and that and the other and i know that if i choose to accept any of those opportunities i'm doing it at the expense of something
else which i've talked a lot about in this podcast and so one of the real challenges and
one of the real sort of talents that i'm trying to foster in myself is being so clearly attached to my long-term values and goals and where
i want to go and who i want to be that i'm able to look at a really good opportunity
whether it's financial or you know other or status or whatever it might be or for my personal brand or whatever it might be
and say no now and and to do that you have to have real faith
in yourself but you also have a have to have a real attachment to who you want to become and your long-term
goals and it's something that i'm genuinely struggling with because never in my life as i said have i had more
people in my inbox asking me to become directors and ceos of their companies and offering me shares to come and help them
and so i just wanted to share a few things which i which i have written in my diary about how i make the decision
and whether to take an opportunity or to not it's fairly fairly simple the first one as i said
is by being super clear on the person that i want to become in the future and the first check i can do is is doing
this opportunity going to move me closer or further away by costing me time to becoming that person
and the next one which i consciously ask myself all the time now is if i become that person that i want
to become in the future by remaining loyal to that sort of long-term image of who i want to become and my values
will this opportunity come back around and for about 90 of the opportunities about 95 percent
it will definitely come back around in even greater abundance and value if i become the person i want to become
and the last thing i do is i attribute a financial value to an hour of my time and i've read a lot about this naval's
talked about this at length as well and philosophers and you know people that i respect in the business world have told me about this
as well what you want to do is think of a really big number for me it's about ten thousand pounds
i say to myself that one hour of my time is worth ten thousand pounds and my rationale for that is based on
what i was able to create with my time historically so you think about social change in the business and what it became and how much it's worth
when i go through and think about how much each year added to that value i can quite
comfortably say you know a year of my time is worth say 10 million or 20 million quid and when you
think from that framework and when you really attribute huge amounts of value to your time you're able to cut things
out quickly that don't meet that value it's something that i genuinely recommend everyone does i'm not saying attribute 10k an hour to
your time but even if it's a thousand dollars start there say my time one hour of my time is worth a thousand
dollars and if you think through that lens i swear to god the opportunities that
will come to you the ones that you'll accept will be of significantly more value and ultimately that means you'll spend
more of your time more of your hours on things of higher value and then that's what your life will become high value
give it a try the next point in my diary i understand is quite a controversial one um i've just written marriage monogamy
Why I don't think marriage is the right answer.
and me listen and i've spent a lot of time in this podcast talking about relationships and my views on marriage and the
relationship struggles that i've had and before i say what i'm going to say i want to appreciate the fact that this is
a completely nuanced subjective topic but here's my thinking i'm 28 years old
and i don't know i don't believe that marriage is the right answer a couple of reasons let's just start
with some fundamental principles pretty much every every way that i think is based on first principles i don't think for a star
that the law and that religion have a great track record on pretty much anything historically and i think that
marriage is a construct that's been passed down from one generation to another throughout our society without real
interrogation because we've all done that and i can literally predict um the dms that i'm gonna get which
which tell me that i'm naive and that i don't understand which like listen probably true right but that's the whole
point of like me scrolling in my diary i like this to be a two-way thing where you can just message me and say steve you're an idiot
and you do you guys do you i get the messages you don't understand the world fine that's probably true i know it's true i don't understand
everything and that's part of the reason i'm doing this but getting back to the point um for me the concept of marriage
when you look at the fundamentals of signing and assigning this commitment and going to a church and the
legal and religious ramifications of some marriages it just feels really insecure it's like
if i love someone why do i need a contract why do i need to go to church why do i need to get the law involved if i
love someone what has any of that got to do with courts and contracts if i love someone
and if i'm secure enough to believe that they love me too that they won't they won't leave me
and sometimes i think it's a bit like trapping a cat in a corner because when you're in a marriage and when you're in a situation which feels kind
of imprisoned or like you can't leave um i think issues might become somewhat magnified
right you know the worry and the anxiety of not being able to leave because of that rain or that contract or because of
the way you set up your life i actually think it might make issues bigger than they are and it's something that i've really
pondered you know i have a track record in my life of really like interrogating stuff i interrogated
school to the point that i stopped going in university to the point that i went to one lecture and decided that it was a completely broken concept and i'm
starting to do the same with marriage and people will hear different things when i say this right largely based on
their own opinions in life and their own experiences and this comes from my own experience probably largely largely from the experience of watching
a very dysfunctional toxic marriage that my parents had and i'm not saying marriages can't be brilliant some of my friends have the
best marriages some of their parents have the most amazing marriages too i'm just saying as a one-size-fits-all
concept i think it needs a little bit of questioning um i i'm all down for the commitment i
think i'm still developing my ideas there on monogamy but the commitment part isn't the thing i have issue with it's the like marriage part the law the
contract and all that nonsense i want to talk about monogamy too because oh this is going to be controversial but
um i'm also not completely convinced that we're meant to be monogamous
i'm not completely convinced that we're meant to have one partner like i'm down for it because i understand the way that the world is
wired at the moment um but this might be the most controversial thing i've ever saw in
this podcast but i think if we all i think of a huge
amount of us are honest with ourselves and this is based on the behavior we exhibit we would probably sleep with someone
else that was smoking heart we don't because we value the relationship and we don't we know that the relationship is worth
more than a one-night stand with someone else and we're mature enough to
understand the consequences of our actions but i think if you were to anonymously poll people
and say listen would you sleep with someone else that was hot if it had no material impact on your marriage
i think if we're being honest with ourselves a lot of us would but i think 99.9 of us wouldn't want our partner sleeping
with someone else and this all of this speaks to the fact that i'm not sure as humans
as men as women we are innately meant to be monogamous i think that
society has played a huge role in that i also think that over the the coming
decades i think you'll see real shifts in this probably not with me because i'm not going to get to the point where i i'm
down with someone i love sleeping with someone else if i'm completely honest but i think it's broken
i think marriage is broken i think like university it's broken you know if if i told you there was tvs for sale at
a shop on a corner but 50 of the tvs failed you wouldn't go and buy a tv and it's the same for marriage
50 of marriages fail and if you think about the concept of marriage it's till death do us part but 50 of the
time it's not till death does this part it's till that girl slides in your dms and you meet her and
you bang her and then you you know your marriage falls depart or that guy slides in your dms and you go for a coffee with him and your boyfriend
finds out and your husband finds out he dumps you the concept seems broken and i but i don't know the answer i don't know
what the alternative is i know that it's going to have to be commitment-centric but i feel that maybe when it comes to
my life i'm not going to seek marriage i might try and create some kind of new age urane arrangement with my partner where we're
committed to each other where we have the party the celebration which i think is [ __ ] awesome by the way but we don't sign all the contracts and
we remain as two separate you know independent humans that have come together in the middle through love
without religion or without the law it's just an idea some of you will
disagree let me know what you think in the comments section below or let me know what you think in my inbox or my
my twitter because this is a super controversial topic and it's one that we're going to be talking about i think next week with a very um awesome
person who is also developing his opinion on this i don't want to give the the
don't let the cat out the bag on this one but trust me next week is going to be one hell of a conversation the last point in my diary this week is
Why you should NOT "Fit in".
kind of linked to a lot of the stuff that i've said throughout this conversation this chat today about
extrinsically living your life through society's image of how you should be living i've just written that fitting in is a
curse and the more you can be you the more happy you will be the more you fit into society
the less free you actually are i think about my time in school and you know and we've all had that
experience in school where we want to wear the clothes everyone's wearing we got our hair cut the same way we listen to the music that is cool to
listen to and how like trapped that way of living is in fact what i've come to learn as i've gotten
older and as i've gone through life and i've become my own person and i've taken some of these shackles off is the closer i've gotten to being steve
who steve actually is the weirdo that i naturally am and that you naturally are the
expressing myself in a way that is true to myself in the words that i want to without worrying about who's going to cancel me or judge me
or my friends or friends might say you know fake friends whatever the more happy i've become the more successful i've become it's made
this podcast interesting right because i am myself there's this isn't acting this is what i think and how i feel every
week and i don't think about the impact of it the closer i've got into not fitting in
to being who i am the more happy i've become and i think it's just something to really reflect on because
there's so much of our lives that are sort of imprisoned by this idea of conformity and fitting in and being one
of the girls or being one of the lads or you know wearing those clothes or those shoes or being you know
being socially accepted and almost on every occasion i can't think of one reason or one instance where that is an
intrinsic intrinsically motivated thing to do and so the science says as we've talked
about in this podcast that will lead you to the despair the lack of joy the depression anxiety and and in many cases to mid-life crises
when you realize that you've been living your life on someone else's terms for someone else's reasons i'm on a mission whether it's through
this podcast which is my diary my thoughts or whether it's through everything else that i produce do or the work that i
pursue whether it's how i dress whether it's through the diary of a ceo live show that i'm doing to really [ __ ] be me to think for
myself and thinking for yourself isn't easy we think it is and this goes back to the point of us thinking we're in control
and getting to the bottom of what your motivations really are i'm really really trying my my very very
best at all times to just be steve and if there's anything that's had
a bigger impact on my success my happiness it's exactly that
isn't it weird when we think about our goals for the future we often say that we want to be x we
want to be like x person we want to be like x thing when really we shouldn't aspire to be more like our
idols we should be aspiring to be even more ourselves the unfiltered uncaring
unassuming intrinsically motivated version of ourselves maybe that's the secret maybe this whole
podcast is has led to that conclusion maybe this whole series is about that maybe that's what life is about maybe
that's the meaning of life maybe the meaning of life is exactly that you start
in the womb you pop out life tells you you are something it tells you to conform in the classroom on the
playground and maybe we're not just on the journey to being more human
but we're on the journey to being ourselves maybe that's what it's all about
being more human and being more like yourself

Transcription:

you've made a great decision and i say this as impartially as i possibly can but this
podcast is it's really the reason why i started the diver ceo it's to hear these kinds
of stories from these kinds of people and i've got to be honest with you i spent about a year asking this person to
come on this podcast and have a conversation with me today's guest is dr aria and he's been
on the podcast once before he's a a world renowned high performance coach and he works with some of the world's most accomplished
athletes actors and everyone in between as they try and reach a mindset state that is
conducive with success with happiness and with overall fulfillment but he's not here to talk about that
today he's here to talk about something very very different something
uncomfortable something unimaginable so without further ado
i'm stephen bartlett and this is the diary of a ceo i hope nobody is listening but if you
are then please keep this to yourself [Music]
The Story
sometimes in life you have these unbelievable somewhat cruel coincidences that occur
that it's hard to make sense of and last time you came on this podcast i would define it as for me anyway
a pretty cruel coincidence because we had a conversation um to do with life
generally and and success and the mindset and psychology and all the things that you're an expert on and for whatever reason that day
i decided that i wanted to spend 30 minutes talking about marriage cheating love
and asking you these um very personal questions about monogamy which i've
never done before with any guest ever and which i really had no place or reason to ask you more than anyone else
and it just feels to me for what we're going to talk about in part today that that was a bit of a
cruel coincidence and you know one of the questions i asked you was um do you believe in monogamy and then i
asked you can you love someone and cheat on them and when i listened to that podcast back
i now noticed um why you laughed because it wasn't you laughed yeah and
it wasn't a normal laugh it was like a real belly laughing right yeah like a bit of a nervous belly laugh
yeah after we came off air on that podcast you told me something and uh it
even gives me goosebumps now thinking about what you said and it gave the whole team in the room who
overheard our conversation goosebumps as well so
after our 30-minute conversation about marriage monogamy and cheating and love what did you say to me
i told you a story yeah and that was uh about two weeks earlier i'd been
traveling back from london home and i got out of the train station
and my wife picked me up and we got into the car and we had planned to go and have a
brunch at my favorite little spot they do amazing corvo's rancho sauce i was very excited and she said let's go
straight home i've made sandwiches and she doesn't make great sandwiches so i said no no i think the brunch is a
better option and she said no there's something that i need to tell you and i said is it bad and she said yes
and i said is that about the marriage and she said yes and then we began to
drive back and i had the sinking feeling in me
and we drove for about five minutes in silence and then i went to put my hand
on her lap and she said don't don't touch me because you won't want
you after i've told you what's happened and that's whenever it drops and i
remember that 10-minute drive back home then felt like an eternity i was just looking out the window and we
got home we got into the house into the kitchen and i was standing
by the kitchen table hands rested on it and i said what's happened and she said
i've been having an affair with a man from work
and i remember just tears began to stream i didn't move completely motionless tears began to
stream and then she said and that's not all and she said i'm pregnant with this child
and in that moment i felt like i lost a lot you know i'd
lost my wife i'd lost the life we created i'd lost the dog
our home her my parents-in-law her family everything that really held dear if
someone said what makes a meaningful life i would have described these things and it felt like they'd just been snatched
away just came crumbling down like a house of cards didn't fast forward two
weeks and steve said and i remember because the first thing
no no it's fascinating because the first thing you asked was you're married right and i do this
high-pitched laugh and i go yes and then and then the conversation
blow down and and it's themes i'd really thought about can you love someone and cheat on them
does monogamy exist is it natural are we set up to live a life where we're
in one relationship with one person only and so with the past
18 months it's been a process and some of these themes have been very real to
me i just as i reflect on that conversation and when i played it back um after you told me so we come off air
we stood next to the table and the microphones and you you explained to me what's happened yeah i'm first time in my life completely
speechless and the thing that blew me away even more so than what you'd said to me
was your ability to be so calm and rational and objective in the answers you gave
and even when i listen back now although there was that laugh which was a bit of an indication um
you were able to speak about someone betraying you or being deceitful with a
level of calmness and apparent um emotional uh sort of restraint that i i just
admired so much from someone that was right in the middle of the emotional hurricane and had just been victim of
that act and um you said that you know about the topic of monogamy
how did that change your opinion and and also the subsequent 18 months of processing on the topic of monogamy
[Music] so as a quick aside i like that analogy and we touch upon it briefly about the
hurricane and and it's funny actually because a friend of mine showed me a book about a week ago and it was
different personality profiles depending on the day that you'd been born on and whenever we looked mine up there's a
little meditation at the end a summary and it said the stillest part of the
hurricane is its center and that essentially has been uh a philosophy
that's guided my life where sometimes there's a storm and it's horrendous and it's raging but
if you can cultivate that sense of stillness and calmness and clarity deep
within you no matter what life throws at you you will be okay because the second part
of whenever i was told that news and and the tears were streaming and i felt that sense of loss
and overwhelming sadness it was a remarkable moment where in that
instant and i can only describe it as a whisper i heard a whisper within me
as if it was resonating from my heart that all will be well forwards all will be
well all will be well and i knew even then i knew whenever
you know this tumultuous emotion i knew everything's going to be okay i will get through this i'm going to
have to walk through the desert and i'm going to have to endure a horrific amount of an emotional level
but it's all going to be fine how did you know that i think it's something that i've
cultivated over over 10 15 years and that's why i do what i do now because i want to help other people to reach that
stage and and it began on a journey of um buddhist exploration and understanding
the nature of life and i came to this realization that life
involves suffering there's no promise that it's going to be happy-go-lucky
and really pleasant all the time really horrific things happen in life and on one level there's
no way that we can ever rationally explain it away sometimes bad things happen but it
doesn't end there it's a bit like that line that someone once said to century whenever you're suffering don't
ask god why am i suffering ask god where are you taking me
and so i've developed this ability to
begin to view my life as though it's happening to someone else as though the experience the thoughts
the emotions are are something that i can almost take it back on and have perspective
and i can see it and i can feel it but i know that my thoughts that isn't just who i
am my emotions isn't just through my and that's a temporary experience and and throughout my life no matter
what has happened even whenever it's been brutal it's often shifted being a new
trajectory and there's been a new meaningful life ahead of me and i
knew even then she's going to be okay she'll be okay it's going to be a tough road for her to but she'll be okay
and it's gonna be a tough road for me to you but i will be okay anger so many people in that situation
whether rightly or wrongly just because of the way that they are yeah would have reacted with anger and for some reason you were both
calm in telling me you're calm now and the this remarkable thing which i
i think i i struggle to understand a little bit is one of your first concerns was her
well-being versus your own why
because i loved her and i was in the practice of of placing her
emotional well-being and her happiness on the same level of mine if not sometimes
first and foremostly but at least so on an equal playing field and and i was just so in that habit and
that was the toughest thing to let go of the thing that i still struggle with today and i'm still
it's the one part that i realized the other day that i still had a fear of upsetting her
or her not being okay and so that's something which just
just really developed and and was so ingrained and it's interesting on the point of
anger if you said like your wife partner for 10 years married for five
has an affair and is pregnant with another man's child how will you react i would have said anger i would i'd be furious but it wasn't
there at least not initially it was this overwhelming sense of sadness it was just that sense of loss of knowing that
again that she's potentially done something that she might regret for a long time and i don't want anyone to go
through that experience where they feel like they've [ __ ] up hugely even if the the future
is positive in that moment my senses there will be regret or at least shame
and so it was a sadness because i was connected to the loss the sense of loss
of losing things i held dear feels like you're living outside your body a little bit i guess that's what
self-awareness is or at least emotional awareness awarenesses because you're being able to see that situation which
is utterly horrific for anyone yeah um from as you say from like a bird's eye view
as if you've like yeah looking down on it and that's allowing you not to just feel your own emotions but to feel
empathy towards theirs yeah and i think i think that's the path in my eyes that's the path to
enlightenment and i'm not saying that i am enlightened but i think we're all on that path i'm all progressing through it
and for me that's what awareness is it's being able to experience internally your thoughts and your
emotions and externally what's happened as if it's happening to someone else
you're like holding them out in front of you and analyzing them right but if you're not holding them out in front of you and it's happening within
you then you are just almost like a passenger on a roller coaster whereas holding them out in front of you kind of
makes you the the conductor or the roller coaster or at least uh able to yeah understand and if you can
understand then you can address and you can overcome totally i love it whenever you're holding it really close to you
you're fused with it anything that happens instantly will provoke a reaction whether or not it's
emotional or behavioral but when you hold it in front of you there's a bit more space now you still
experience it it was a brutal couple of months i cried every day
uh for maybe three months for hours hours i would i would walk and i'd
process what happened and if you want we can talk about that at some point um about my process of
moving through it but yes it was i'm not going to say it wasn't um emotionally painful but
i wasn't defined by that pain and that was just a part that i was experiencing let's talk about that so a lot of people
Processing the emotions
experience grief in many forms and this somewhat feels like this the central emotion you described as a loss it feels like a
form of grief yeah what was your process for moving from you know finding out
that it happened to where you are today where you're you know you've quote unquote processed
it i imagine as much as you might have been able to at this stage yeah
some yeah what was your process where i think people often um
catch themselves in a in a counter but productive cycle is whenever they try and avoid
experiencing what they're experiencing they try and shun it lock it away put it in a box disconnect from it
deny it and they just focus on the future and where i'm going and they might try and rationalize it uh this happened because
of x or because of y and then they try and forge ahead and i think it comes back to bite them at some
point the simplest truth is that we can only ever experience
one moment at a time and i remind myself of that i don't need to think about right now
the financial separation the divorce what it means about friends or family or or will i
meet someone again or how long will it be or what will my life look like or where am i going to live so many
different factors that could be overwhelming i just decided to deal with one moment at a time all i need to do
is deal with this one moment and what is this one bringing me and accepting and welcoming it sounds
strange but welcoming whatever comes up and so whatever emotion came up i didn't
try and push it away or shunt it or deny it or negate it i let it i let it sit and that's why i
cried so much because there was so much sadness did you write down the emotions you're experiencing
so i didn't write down the emotions but what i did in the next step is so the first step
was awareness and accepting whatever emotions i felt and i'm seeing that they come and then
they go you know that there'd be moments where i'd be laughing with my brother and then crying a minute later and then
talking about something else the second step was reminding myself of
reality because i was so ingrained in
in an internal model of what life looked like i have a strong
stable marriage in which my partner subconsciously uh you know implicitly i
believe is faithful we're meant to be together we're going to be together for the next 50 60 years until one of us dies
we're going to have children together that was my internal model
and i had to rip it apart i had to take it down i had to dismantle it and i had to remind myself of the
reality of the situation i had to accept it i had to accept it's over it's not going
to change there's no going back the final nail is in the coffin
and you need to take that on board and i'd also write any i'd write down
reminders of of what had happened and i also wrote down
any insights i had about the situation that i could remind myself of and i wrote down how i wanted to handle
this process um i can actually read a few out if you want please
please i've got um so i i literally would just write them down on my phone um and so afterwards i began to split
them up into different sections but this one was for the process hold yourself to the highest
standard choose actions that you can be proud of
how you get through this process is more important than how quickly you get through this process because for
me it was important that i still lived with personal integrity that i didn't
that i wasn't warped or changed or um consumed with
vengeance or acted in ways that was out of spite or out of emotion i wanted to
be able to look back on this in 12 months 18 months time and still feel good about it have a clear conscience still able to put my
head down and feel as though i handled that to the best of my ability with god you can get through this you
can become stronger wiser more caring more compassionate and more loving
and that's another thing that actually the deepest moments of suffering can actually be opportunities
for growth even if you don't want it there's something there that that you can learn and can grow from you don't need anything
from her anymore um and there and then different reminders
you have nothing to feel bad about you aren't responsible you have nothing to feel guilty about
nothing because there were moments where my mind would almost begin to in a way play a trick on me and begin to
try and create reasons um to feel bad or to try and create
shame and at those times while i would accept what came up i decided not to pursue that line of
thinking because that didn't fit whenever i was calm and clear this came to me and so i'd write
down whatever came to me whenever i was in a place of wisdom then when the emotion hit
and i'm not seeing clearly and i've got on a clouded lens this little baby became my best friend
because i'd go back to and i'd remind myself and then it would reshift my mental paradigm i have this um before
please do keep your phone open because i want to hear the rest of this all right but i have this um analogy i make in moments where i
experience a very similar thing but i'm going to say one example yeah it's it's the closest i can come to
resonating with what your experience is i was dating this girl and i broke up with her and three days
later i find out that she's had sex with someone else right and i can only the way that i described
it was i'm flying on this plane and i'm the pilot
and then suddenly when i fight when i when i look down and hear the news that she's just slept with someone
somebody else yeah it was like terror stormed the cockpit and they chucked the [ __ ] rational
pilot out and they were threatening to crash the whole [ __ ] thing and my whole objective as the pilot is
to get back into the cockpit before they crash this plane into the side of a mountain because if they crash the plane i'm [ __ ] and so yeah what i wanted to do
was lose my integrity yeah i wanted to crash the plane i wanted to get her back take revenge tell her she's
a this this and this and this and this and it was this because i've got to a place of where i'm able to hold
situations out in front of me a little bit more than i ever was you know in the past i was at war with myself
yeah it was the terrorists on one end telling me to crash the plane and the pilot saying you've been here before you know you
just need to keep the plane in the air until you yeah yeah and and i and i'm going for a run i'm like steve go to the gym
go for a run yeah clear your head i'm at the gym the terrorists that you know and i'm like i'm going to finish i'm going to finish
back in and then i'll come back yeah and the crazy conclusion to all of this was my friend called me
and said a few things to me about um why she did what she did yeah my
friend said to me remember steve you rejected her she really really really likes you and she's
done this as a way to make herself feel better for the rejection that you gave her and it sounds like such a pathetic thing
to say but what it made me realize in that moment was much of the reason why the terrorists had stormed the cockpit was
my ego was bruised and the thing that coached those terrorists out the cockpit was my friend massaging my ego again
and and letting me know that some of those stories we sometimes tell ourselves when we get rejected about
why we got rejected yeah weren't true it's not because you're not enough
it's in fact because of something you've done and that was the reason why i managed to take control of the cockpit i did nothing
i didn't punish her in any way didn't even mention it and it was and so yeah um but please two things come to
me there uh one is this uh emotion of anger so fascinatingly nine to five percent of
the emotion for me was sadness five percent was anger and the anger struck early on it was the first
night and i remember my brother had come over and was staying with me and i
woke up in the middle of the night the night of that day that she told me and
it was like my body was burning i haven't experienced anger like that
before it was it was almost like i was a flame i was uh just infused with rage
and i began and i really feel for my brother having to witness this but i was just
moving up and down shouting as loudly as i could my wife my house
my wife my house and for five minutes it was like a supernova it just was
just seething and then it burnt out
and i cried and i fell asleep and and the next day and then the anger didn't really come much it would come now and
again but what i realized was the anger was intimately attached to my
ego the anger came whenever i was attached to my ego and i'm very fortunate that i'm able to detect from my ego
the majority of the time but when i didn't that's when it hurt because it came
about my wife as if i own her as if there's ownership as if
it's a part of me i don't own her she's free my house
i didn't even own the house the mortgage company did you know but as soon as we link it to ourselves and make it about us
yeah then it it's it's a place of vulnerability because you're getting inflicted it's like
getting stabbed in the heart you feel that but it's an illusion because we are not
our ego you know we can see our ego and have a relationship to our ego but once we're fused with it we're in trouble
and the other part of it is that because i don't want to come across like a saint like
i didn't have dark thoughts or you know i wasn't angry and i just handled it with grace the entire time
but i operate from a principle that the mind has a mind of its own and i think we talked about it last time
but essentially your mind will populate your head with thoughts automatically
you're not asking for them it'll just come up with judges evaluations assessments predictions about the future
past memories imagine scenarios you know if i said okay steve don't
think about anything right now just for 10 seconds have a complete blank mind and i'm going to say a word but don't
think about anything okay so we'll just do it now don't think about a thing birthday okay right
so even though you were attempting not to think about your mind came up with it automatically and from my
perspective we are not our thoughts we have thoughts our mind comes up with thoughts but
that's not me i am the observer of the thought now why is that important because my
mind should come up with really brutal thoughts what thoughts like torturing the guy
really yeah getting in a car finding him shooting in the back of the van and doing this elaborate
elaborate of of what i would do to him absolutely because my mind was thinking about about
seeking vengeance justice justin justice and it was like a hollywood movie and
somehow no one found out i went back along the date you know
and so yes you can have those or whenever i was in deep pain
the thought of ending my life popped into my head i didn't have any intent i wasn't making any plans i didn't
want to kill myself but my mind wanted a way out of the pain
it was suffering and it wanted an end to it and what is one option killing yourself and so when i've got a
different relationship though with these thoughts when i think about torturing someone or i think or when my mind comes up with
a thought of torturing someone or my mind comes up with the thought of [Music]
taking my life there's no judgment i don't think oh
that means i must want to do it or that means that i will do it or that means i'm a bad person
or that means that i'm evil it just means my mind
i think what is my mind trying to do is it's trying to solve a solution and it's probably struggling to cope and
it's trying to find a way to make me feel better nia on this podcast who came on this podcast talked about how the mind is
actually you know people think we're in the search of pleasure but the mind is programmed to avoid discomfort yeah so we're
constantly in trying to seek you know avoid it and that's why we procrastinate because we've got a big project which is yeah we might not feel competent to
complete or you know we're a bit there's a feeling of discomfort around it so we go and wash the dishes we'll do the hoovering yeah um on the on the you mentioned
wanting to torture this man well i know right so like a moment of the mind having
what my mind did steve you want to clarify you didn't want to your mind wanted to i'm a peace loving kind of guy
but i wanted to know how do you feel about him
so it's really interesting i um
this stage the the process went awareness and acceptance uh how i wanted
to handle the process and then at some point i realized
i needed to find forgiveness
i'm quite a simple person and i don't i don't like having a lot of
items or objects or physical possessions and i don't like having a lot of emotional baggage either
i want to travel light you know i want to travel so lightly i could pass through the eye of a needle so to speak and the weight
of anger or resentment or
[Music] the feelings of betrayal
were weighing me down and i wanted to forgive her and i wanted to forgive him and honestly you could view
as ultimately selfish because it's not going to impact their life but it's going to make mine a lot easier
and during lockdown i was in california and i was lucky because in santa barbara
where i was staying the mayor didn't close the beaches because there's a lot of families there
and he said as long as you uh socially distance it's fine and i'd run along the beach and i had
this process where i would say out loud
i would imagine her and i would say i forgive you i'm sending you my love and i wish you
all the best for the future and i processed so much by that at that point because i've been able to
understand and see her situation and in my mind i have an idea of how it
was created and why it unfolded and so there was compassion there and i
was able to reach that really relatively quickly that that was easy the hard part was with him
because i didn't know him i didn't know his personality his
background who he was he could be a great friend and an excellent son or
[Music] potentially a very loving partner
but all i knew about him was that he was prepared to take certain actions
and so whenever i tried it with him and i'd say i forgive you
it was like there was a knot and a wince and i'm like and i would say and i'm sending you my
love
i don't wish you all for the future but you're still imagining pulling up in that van and jumping out and
blindfolding [Music]
and so but i would just notice that i don't know the tension there and and actually i will say this was a
year after i'd heard the news i didn't try and do this initially i think it would have been
uh premature to have attempted this whenever i wasn't in a space where i had
a lot more clarity and groundedness and and and process the emotion the emotion wasn't being clouded
at this point now what am i holding on to and for a matter of weeks five six weeks
i was running two three times a week and i would just try that try that process and then one day it was
it was remarkable i was running along and i said i forgive you
and it was nothing and then i said and i'm sending you my love and i felt
easy and i said and i wish you all the best for the future and i could tell that i meant it for them or
their baby you know for them to gather the family and i felt at peace
and it's a bit like that saying my yoke is easy my burden is light now genuinely it sounds strange but
i don't really feel anything for them it's almost as if you know if you came to me and said um
i've got a friend called mike and he's going through a
really difficult time he was involved in a really complicated emotional relationship um would you mind sending out positive
thoughts to him and sing a prayer for him i'd say sure like he hasn't ever done anything to me i don't have any
connection with him no problem it's almost that sort of relationship now where they're just other people on their
journey and i had that shared history with with my wife which i look upon
fondly particularly the first eight years we had a wonderful marriage for a long time but there's no
emotional tinge there's it's like an emotional umbilical cord i'm almost imagining it it's a letting go yeah it's
a letting go and so that was that was a part that for
me because i think there comes a time where you have to say okay i process it i've processed it
how long do i want to hold on to it for now and that's becomes my own choice do i want to carry this
and let it define me or do i want to finally let it go and see it float down the river
and i think you know even you're someone that has a remarkable ability to practice like self-awareness
and you know you have that sort of like emotional awareness as well and it's good to hear i think for everybody
listening to this that even your process to from finding it out
to you know being emotionally unattached to the matter to the point that you can forgive both of
them wasn't linear at all it was up it was down it was up it was down and it was
long and i think people sometimes um think that their experience of rejection or deceit
or you know um any of these things is uniquely bad because their process
to recovery per se isn't linear and it's long and it feels like the more
i've talked about this topic and the more people i've met and you know from hearing your experiences that in fact is the only way out and i
actually think realizing that that's the only way out will make your process out of that deceit or betrayal
feel normal and natural and okay and therefore acceptable and
and i think that's a really important point that you've made through the story you've told absolutely
and each person's journey will be unique and there will be peaks and troughs and
it'll wax and wane and i'm very aware that it's possible
that my journey happened over a relatively short period of time because of
my history my background as a psychologist as a high performance expert this is the area that i deal with
it's about developing emotional resilience it's how do you help people to cope with high stakes environments when they've
lost a sense of balance in their life when they're struggling in the relationships whenever they
experience something in life which throws them how do you get back up this is what i've been trained to do for
15 years isn't it weird that life sent you this challenge yeah when you think about
your experience isn't it it must be a part of you that because i think i would i would think to myself
life is testing me to see if i can deal with the worst and still maintain the values and
principles that i spouse like yeah it it sounds this will sound really odd
uh but i almost felt at times i thought in a way i'm so lucky because i'm so lucky that
i am where i am when this happened if this had happened 10 years ago i would have been in a vastly different
space why because i struggled 10 years to cope
with what life gave me on an emotional level and i would react out of the emotion so
i'd experience it and then i would just react and essentially that's when we
make terrible decisions oh you crashed the plane oh we crashed plane if you look at nasa
um astronauts they prepare for uh the sequence of events leading up
to launch and they run through that over a hundred times from putting on the kit traveling down
to the launch space to what could go wrong and they rehearse and they run it through
and it's a way of being able to stay calm whenever there is uncertainty or
turbulence or danger or threat because that's whenever that's the
person you really want to be whenever there's an emergency like we talked about in the podcast you want to be the person that still
has an air a pocket a space of clarity that isn't affected so that even though
you're experiencing all these emotions on a very physical level
deep down you're still grounded you can take it and so from where i was
i did feel as though i'm fortunate that life is thrown at me
something that in my mind was one of the worst things that i could experience there's lots of worse things without
shadow of a doubt but it was a big one um and find a way to move through and
incredibly it's informed even even my work because in the last
year again whether it's coincidence or not i don't know the number of clients i've
been working with on relationship issues has gone up exponentially and it's
issues centered on a loss of connection a loss of intimacy betrayal confusion how do you
how do you stay true to who you are in a relationship with someone else where you feel like there's a shift or
you wake up one day and you're in a space where you don't know how you got there where
you become like best friends living together rather than the passionate lovers you were 10 years ago you talked there a second
about the calm that astronauts are trained to develop and how crucial that is to making good
decisions i i saw this quote the other day and it said when emotions go go up intellect comes down yeah and um i was
thinking about just them as you said that i was thinking what are the factors that make somebody
not calm and then i thought and they kind of answered myself okay so it's we talked about the ego playing a big role and so i guess my
conclusion there is the people who will struggle to maintain their calm in situations like that
that are so personally associated are those with the lowest self-esteem and the most fragile ego and it feels like the work
that you've described that you've done over the last 10 years is really like building your self-esteem and really
in some respects a separation from ego yeah you've nailed it one we know
on a neural level so we know from neuroimaging studies that when we experience emotion
the prefrontal cortex they part the brain responsible for judgment decision making impulse control
planning goes offline it shuts down so we don't have access to that
creativity the wisdom that we have usually
and again absolutely i think the journey for me the journey of of life involves developing a robust
sense of self a sense of self that is unshakable
that is immovable that still experiences life and the whole gamut of emotions and and
the beauty and loveliness of life and also the darkness and the destruction of life
but isn't impacted on an essential level by it and i think that's the journey and
that's the journey that i work on with clients no matter what the outwardly symptoms
are it could be weight gain it could be relationship dysfunction it could be struggling to experience
that sense of contentment or fulfillment in life even though i have everything that life says i should have
it could be feeling like i'm i'm lacking or i'm just not doing enough or i'm not being enough but it all comes back to that stronger
sense of self and this um you know horrific experience
Adapting my opinion of marriage and monogamy
what has it done to your opinion of monogamy because i'm sure i'm guessing
from what you've said the way that you planned your life ahead you thought when you you know when you went walked
down the aisle and you said those words till death do us part you then planned the next 60 years of your life and how your life was going to
pan out and when you said those words at the end of the at the altar you were totally convinced
yeah totally convinced that this person was the other person your soul mate
um how do you feel about all of those concepts now like soulmate and monogamy and until death do his part
experience led me to a position where i began to question my deepest assumptions about monogamy about marriage about
lifelong relationships and in the same way i began to take a step back
and reflect and contemplate i became very aware that there is a
social script for relationships and it generally goes the conventional model is boy meets girl
it's not even boy meets boy your girl meets girl there's a first date a first kiss uh a period of courting at some point
um there will be sex meeting the parents hopefully not at the
same time eventually the relationship becomes
exclusive and engagement marriage children until death do us part and i realize
that that is a social construction it's a conventional model based on assumptions
that monogamy is natural that marriage is a human universal
and that any structure other than the nuclear one is
aberrant and so then i began to think okay well what are the different
what are the different elements so on the one hand we can take and we touch upon it briefly uh
a evolutionary perspective and we are apes it's not just that we've
descended from apes we are apes we're one of the five
homo sapiens or one of the five surviving species of great apes along with orangutans bonobos gorillas
and and chimpanzees and yet at some point we
separated from that psychologically and actually the fine print that distinguishes humans
from other great apes has been described by primatologists as wholly
inadequate it's it's a fabrication and at some stage we began to see
ourselves as special and unique and above nature and exempt from our
[Music] primal history because we descended from hypersexual ancestors so if
the homoline age has been around for two million years modern humans have been around for 200
000 years and about 10 000 years ago there was a shift in
going from hunter-gatherers to settled communities because of the advent of agriculture now
up until 10 000 years ago the data now suggests that we actually
lived by fiercely egalitarian principles everything was shared food shelter
water child care and even sexual partners
casual sexuality was the norm for our prehistoric ancestors for 95
of the collective experience of our lineage that is what we experienced
and it wasn't it wasn't based on meaningless random relationships they were relationships that reinforced
uh a social pattern that that we needed to survive it minimized
our risk and it reinforced social ties but then with the advent of agriculture
we began to settle we had then we had land we had
uh domesticated animals and for the first time private property
came into play and suddenly there was a change and there's even a change in the status of
women because when we look at the human female up until that point was on with an equal playing field they
were as responsible for the hunting and the cooking and making decisions about where they were
going to settle and then it changed and the female became the property of the man something that
he had to maintain and keep and actually the reason that property came into play is because we
weren't moving so it did matter what happened to our resources we were accumulating and biological paternity
for the first time became crucial
and so on on a natural evolutionary level
[Music] monogamy didn't exist we didn't live in long-term monogamous
relationships then we bring in marriage and if we fast forward about five and a
half thousand years in about 2350 bc
and in mesopotamia we're the first marriage between the union between a man
and a woman and over the next few hundred years it spread the ancient romans greeks
hebrews they began to adopt this widespread practice but marriage had a dif had a very different meaning across the
ages in the um fifth century with anglo-saxons it was about
securing trade ties it was a diplomatic tool in the 11th century marriage was about
financial economic and political advantage
and as early as the 12th religion be became involved and and roman catholicism tied it to
sacrament and it to being a sacred experience related to experiencing god
then about 500 years ago thomas cranmer came up with the modern day marital vows
that we read out today and he was architecture of english protestantism
and then up until 1858 divorce was rare
marriage was something which was lifelong and it wasn't really questioned but then it became a legal process that
you could apply to do and it was still still relatively uncommon because it was expensive and
women had to prove aggravated adultery bestiality sodomy cruelty and then
the divorce gates really opened up in 1969 with the divorce reform act and marital breakdown could be could
then be cited so whenever we begin to take a different lens and we see the journey
that it's taken and then we ask well where are we today since 1975
there's been a drop in marriages by about 30 more people are now opting to cohabit
than they are to get married divorce statistics in england and wales are at 42
you could arguably say that this system is collapsing that it is beginning to crumble
and they don't even take a cultural lens yeah and if i'm talking too much just no it's fascinating super fascinating so
culturally um the spanish word esposas means wife and handcuffs
we joke about the wife being the ball and chain
a friend got married got married got engaged last week and the talk amongst the boys was this
is the beginning of the end of your sex life yeah but women don't fare any better
you know 43 of american women report sexual dysfunction viagra sales are increasing every year
they're just record highs year upon year bonus through the [ __ ] reef
not that i would know yeah a friend told me yeah um
the porn industry takes in about 57 to 100 billion dollars worldwide
a u.s report showed that americans spend more at strip clubs than they do at broadway
off-broadway non-profit and regional theaters the ballet jazz and the opera
collectively we look at the church and there have been hundreds of roman
catholic priests admitting to thousands of sex crimes in 2008 they paid out 436 million
dollars to victims of sexual abuse a fifth were under the age of five
and these aren't that's not to mention the forgotten victims and we have to ask yourself one
how did we get here two how was that story constructed and three is marriage
giving us what we want and is it realistic and is it feasible
so number three where am i with that yeah yeah i'm still touring i'll be totally
honest with you i can say it i can imagine okay so i can
imagine that on the one hand i can imagine being in a relationship with with a woman and and being with
that one woman for the rest of my life i can also imagine being
with someone in a relationship and having more than one sexual partner
but but if if it was flipped around and someone asked me
would you want your partners to be with other men yeah i'd say hell no of course like it
just seems yeah it that is not something because i'm so strongly programmed
against that even though that's potentially the biological heritage i can't imagine being with someone who's
with us with other people i wouldn't want to be in that situation and i'm aware of the acute hypocrisy
contained within it yeah i think everyone feels the same way to some degree i think people that tell you otherwise are probably talking [ __ ]
because they're playing defense against not wanting to happen to them to some degree right but yeah um it's a and i think it's an ideal
situation for yourself but not for the person you're wit with from your perspective i read this book a long time ago called the mystery
method um by one of the world's number one pickup artist and i don't know if this is true but
what he was saying was men are programmed in a way that seeks um the woman to be faithful for
them because the risk the evolutionary risk was if i impregnate you as my wife um or no so if i if i'm committed to you
as my wife and then you are you cheat on me and get pregnant with someone else's child
i will then spend my resources my energy my time raising someone else's um child and then
my genetics won't pass on that person's will and essentially if you think about it from
an evolutionary perspective i then wouldn't have existed if i didn't have that concern
about making sure my sperm was the one that reached the egg i so you think about it from an
evolutionary perspective you wouldn't exist if your ancestors
hadn't done a brilliant job of making sure their sperm hit the egg and one of the ways of doing that was
making sure it wasn't another guy's sperm hitting the egg yeah by being territorial by being whatever and on the other side from the woman's
perspective the book talks about how you know if a woman got eight months pregnant um tens of thousands of years
ago she can no longer hunt and gather for herself so really she has to find a partner that isn't going to abscond that
isn't going to bounce especially once they've had sex and so the book kind of talks about some of the
the reasons why you know in society we typically think women are more in search of a relationship and are
trying to you know get a guy more than men are typically um is because
from an evolutionary perspective they would have died on the savannah in africa or whatever if
if the guy had sex with them impregnated them at a time when we didn't have birth control got them eight months pregnant and then
bounced yeah and and i don't know how true that is yeah it's something that i've believed because i've read this book for some
time so that's the dominant traditional understanding of
human sexuality because whenever you look at other species yes it's about essentially
an aggressive alpha male than uh being with a
female and knowing that their offspring is being continued through that lineage
there's an alternative which has come out more recently where i know there was a paper published
in science in 2015 that actually showed that what separated
humans from other great apes was our social organization yeah about 10 000 years ago we started
living up next to water and in camps exactly yeah so and then we were a tribe essentially i've read about that
and up until that point though it's very possible that we had uh
multiple sexual partners but biological paternity was less of a concern because our
structure was such that so what we found out now is we didn't used to live with our close relatives we actually
created social ties with other individuals and so we're set up in such a way that
the focus wasn't ever on individual survival it was on group survival group identity
group welfare and the reason is it's the group that keeps you alive anyway
and so it's very possible that then there was a shift which happened
actually with this advent of private property because that's whenever eternity would matter
because there's some hunter-gatherer communities that believe when multiple men have sex with a
female that it's to collectively because you have to think where does our
understanding of the sperm and embryo come from that's very recent it's a very recent biological
understanding our ancestors wouldn't have known that and there are some beliefs where collectively the men contribute to
the production of the child that actually it's almost like an amalgamation of the different man then creates that
child and that child becomes part of the group as opposed to that one person's child and this is the thing just to like
challenge that thinking say that there was one man in the group that was slightly better and making sure he was the one that
inseminated the female yeah he his genes would pass on yeah his his genetics would pass on as
being slightly better for whatever reason and inseminating a woman and uh
therefore in the next round of you know the next generation he would have a slight advantage pretend that that the kid of that man would have
a slight genetic predisposition for being good at that which would increase the probability that they would pass on
again and again and again and it seems like that that those genetics and that ability to be good at
intimidating whether it's through being territorial or being stronger or being more persuasive or being more you know more of a peacock yeah um
through generations over the space of a million years from the chimps that would create a scenario where we are programmed
to be through our psychology and our behavior and our peacocking good at you know yeah winning yeah
even through slightly more malicious methods or yeah and then there's also the social
conditioning and the ideas of of marriage of monogamy of romanticism
of what that means and and i think what i'd really come particularly
through my work with clients is seeing that where people find themselves in trouble is when there's enmeshment
whenever there's too much when there's too much closeness when actually the identity of one person
is submerged with the identity of the other and there's no space that happen to you
in your marriage where you became more like her
it's incredible that you ask that i have a little announcement to make and
if you're watching this on youtube you might have seen a little clue as to what i'm about to say when we brought this podcast back and we
decided that we were going to do it every single week on monday we also decided that we wanted to find a sponsor
and a partner to help support the growth of this podcast so that we can take it all over the world we can produce the
video format we can hire a big team and we can make sure it gets out to as many people as possible
and so here's what i did i thought of a couple of companies that i really really love and companies that
i've used for many many years and i've been an avid customer of and one of those companies
in fact the first company i contacted was this one hule and if you if you don't know what huel is then you must
have been living under a rock per se but huel has been a huge part of my life for
about four years i first started drinking huel four years ago when i first moved to new
york and i was running social chain and the reason i did was because i was frequently
missing meals i and if you if you know me personally you'll know how true this is i will wake up in the morning
and i'll rush through my day meeting meeting meeting meeting speaking on stage flying somewhere and i'll get to about 9 00 pm and i
wouldn't have eaten a single thing and there's no you know nutritional expert in the world that will tell you
that's a good thing and what then happened was i was binge eating at nine or ten o'clock and when i say binge eating i mean like two
large domino's pizzas to myself and so then i discovered this thing called heal about four years ago and for
me huel is a nutritionally complete drink which means that i don't have to spend hours preparing food which i
wouldn't do anyway hence why i was skipping meals it means that i get all the good stuff i need to perform and have a good diet
but i can have it in like 20 seconds and as someone that values time so so much
heal was a godsend i've been a customer for i think four years i've had my subscription with you for four
How I Lost an intrinsic part of who I was
years so when i was looking for someone to sponsor the podcast i contacted the ceo who's been on the
podcast before julian and has built this staggering company i sent him an email i said listen julian
i would love you to sponsor my podcast because i can actually talk about your product authentically
and he said to me because you've had a subscription with you for the last three four years and i know you're a customer
he was up for doing it so i thank you and um every week on the podcast i'm going to talk about different
things to do with huel to do with time saving to do with diet and nutrition and of course we're
going to get julian back on the podcast at some point their company is doing unbelievable things in the uk
if you've not seen and sort of kept up with the progress if you'll i highly recommend you do because it's one of the most exciting companies we've seen in
the uk in a long long time and it's an absolute honor and a privilege to to have them sponsoring
the director ceo the perfect company to be on this podcast because you know it's a company that is so in line with
some of my central values did that happen to you in your marriage where you became more like
her it's incredible that you ask that whenever we first met
she was the sensible one she was very prudent very pragmatic very level
headed she made very safe sensible choices in life in general and she was known in
that way i was a bit more of a rogue i was uh
a little bit more mysterious it was probably a sort of you know hint of mischievous
of um spontaneity yeah of playfulness and and there's an idea in
psychology that we all that we seek in the other person a part of ourselves
that we've lost and so there was almost that um that
attraction there it created that chemistry it drew us in together i think she was
looking for that excitement and and in a way that safe danger i was actually looking for stability and
groundedness and over time it connected us and brought us together but over time
a remarkable thing happened and that is just like you said i began to become
more like her i became became safer and i actually lost
an intrinsic part of who i was i lost the
the wild child that's in me i lost the part that's a bit more dangerous it's a bit more risky that it doesn't always say something
which is politically correct and i became almost like a sanitized clean version of who i was
and that's not the man that she met and that's not the man that she fell in love with
and on one level it it worked in terms of a stable love
there was reliability there was dependability there was relatability
but it crushed the desire there was a slow suffocation of that desire over the last
couple of years and so i believe that
one day she woke up and she sensed that loss of connection
which i also sense too and that loss of intimacy and she was scared and when the mind is
scared it comes up with thoughts is this it am i gonna have to live like this for
the next 10 20 years will i ever get that chemistry or that connection back
what if it never comes back and when we're afraid we're then seeking
that that part of ourselves that we've lost and so it's almost
less about the other person and more about us it's less about turning away from our
partner and more about turning away from a part of ourselves it's less about finding another person
and more about finding another part of ourselves in which we feel alive and i think the fear would have been
wildly tempting wildly exciting it would have been
all the things it would have given her a lot of the things that we had in the beginning that she missed and suddenly it was back
and even the structure of an affair is such that you can't
have the other person and the forbidden is erotic and it's set up in such a way that it
just perpetually creates desire because it has to be secretive it can't be long
lasting for long periods of time there's continual space now if
fire needs air desire needs space
and we found ourselves in a situation in which we're seeing each other every day i used to be traveling i used
to be working away a lot more we would have pockets where we'd be apart and in that pocket even if you're
away for a day or a couple of days there's a sense of loss on a very micro level
and then a sense of excitement of the person coming back and reimagining that life together
and so going back to your point i did i change and that song that's something
which i've learned from i've cha i changed and i became
like a squeaky clean version of me and
and she ironically ended up turning towards what she'd lost that's something you
regret i could feel regret in the way that i said it there
yes yeah being being honest if i could have if i could have changed on one level if
i could have changed that if i'd been aware of that and i'd and i'd seen it coming
then i would have wanted you to stay true to who i am and that's the
path i'm on now and i'd be curious to hear your thoughts but i
i want to live in line with my truth and it's like john 8 32 the truth will
set you free and i believe that when we're living in line with our truth it saves you and whenever we neglect
our truth it destroys you yeah and so if i if i'd if i'd been able to
stay truthful i think it would have been a very different trajectory i don't because the relationship worked
on multiple levels and we and and it did we had a wonderful um time together for
for eight years but it's a little bit like putting a frog in boiling water it
was in cold water and the desire is the frog it's alive you don't notice the heat there were
unknown factors that were at play and it was a dance it was both of us
there's no it we're we both contributed to that situation i think she wanted me to be that stable
dependable reliable person without realizing that on a subconscious level she actually
was attracted to the man that i was and i wanted to make her happy and didn't want her to
be the kind of person that creates tension or or or there being too much grit but
actually tension is what creates fire at the same time and so the rough edges were a part of
who i was and i didn't need to get rid of them it's so crazy it's almost quite contradictory the typical narrative you
My Ideal relationship structure
hear about relationships is especially from you know dare i say it um women movies and on instagram is
there's this conversation around can i change him um and it's and it seems typically that
people want to change that or they they hold out hope or they want to change their partner in some way
to make them more like the image they have of that person yes but in fact what you're describing
is the thing that ends up saving the relationship is a finding someone that
you love for the way that they are and you're attracted to the way that they are but then both
parties having a resilience to change um to some degree but because of that
understanding that you formed your relationship on the basis of this person being like this
and then but then you say okay so over time people change and in fact in
the last podcast we did there's a quote where you said change is the only constant so both of you are going to change
anyway and you talk about the spiritual psychological change that both parties go on
and again this kind of draws it back to the conversation around monogamy is you know you're going to change anyway like you 10 years ago
versus you now is probably a little bit more stable and a little bit more you know solid and a little bit more
rational in your thinking um and because as you said in the last podcast change is a constant
how do you form a how can you guarantee that death will do you part when change
might do your part first and this kind of brings us back to the conversation around monogamy which is
i guess it's my question to you is like if you what do you suspect now
if not marriage is going to be the way that you know when you meet
someone what do you suspect what's your hypothesis on how that relationship will be constructed for me personally yeah i've
got mine yeah yeah yeah but mine kind of i can tell you mine if
you want first yeah yeah okay so one kind of
so it was interesting what you said there about um space being
the air to a flame right yeah and for me that's so critical earlier on when you're talking about
marriage yeah one of the factors you you were talking about was how where marriage came from as a social construct
yeah and how it centers on like you know you know religion and god and all of these things and one of
the things that i think is also really important to understand is as a general first principles rule if
people are different and we all are different every single human being on this earth is different then the solution should be different
like the the glove we fit is different we have different size feet and different size hands so the solution to love
or whatever that is as binary as it sounds should therefore be bespoke to who you are and the life
you're living in for me i live a life where i'm i get my fulfillment out of the podcast and my work and that's it's
such a big part of my wiring i can't change that it's the way that i am i'm different from my brother and he's only a couple of months older than
me i'm completely different and so as it relates to love and me having a bespoke
solution to when i meet someone and i when i have kids or i want to you know want them to be my partner um the
solution should also be bespoke and so i look at the situation that would be right for me and it is one
that's really really reliant on space yeah i love being on my own i am happy
there i love having time to myself to reflect to think um to work on my projects space is such
a big thing for me so marriage and the idea of moving in with someone and then being you know on top of me
seven days a week for the next 60 years is a is something that i almost can't understand i'm not
sure if i'm like psychologically [ __ ] up and that's why i can't deal with that but i love this idea as the founder of
huell said on this podcast of treating my relationship with my romantic partner in the same way
that i treat my relationship with my best friend my best friend seems to get on perfectly well and we and i can't see a divorce
ever coming you know what i mean yeah because we have that space and we have the the middle ground that we meet upon
which is the relationship but we have a fundamental amount of space
um which we both need like in fact my best friend moved in with me in lockdown for a month and yeah uh
you start to piss me off so [ __ ] loud like clean up after
yourself how lowly do you choose we had an argument i remember we are going over something stupid like a video game or something um so i'm
going to conclude the point i know for me that space and the lack of being on top of each
other is something that would be a fundamental part of the relationship i have i'm willing to commit because i actually can't see a world
where i would allow them not to or that i'd be happy with them not even the word allow it's like permission right it's
like such a [ __ ] thing to say but i can't see a world where i would be okay with them
not committing to me so i i'm gonna have to concede there and i think i'll figure that out hopefully if we can keep the sex good
so space and commitment i hate the idea of marriage i don't think religion or the law have
any and should have any involvement on the topic of love i think they'd have a terrible track record religion with
homosexuality and and the you know the history it has on love and the law i didn't see why a court would have
anything to do with how i feel about someone so i hate the idea of marriage some kind of commitment
that offers me space with the right person where we both understand that at some point we might grow out of each
other and when we do um that's fine and i'm going to conclude with one point which you actually said in the last podcast
which was when i asked you about monogamy and about committing to someone for life you said to me
um don't view it like that just ask yourself the question every single day yeah today am i happy to spend today
this day with this person in this relationship if the answer is yes fine yeah if the answer is known then there's
something that needs to be addressed yeah thanks for sharing that
don't use it
i've actually got a photographic memory absolutely it doesn't work for it um what i know for for me
is there's definite similarities in that realistically i can't see myself being
in a non-monogamous relationship and if i was with someone that would be the person i would be with
in the past though in our last podcast when he asked me about the definition of love
that hasn't changed in that i believe that love is fostering that emotional and
spiritual growth of someone else but what has changed is what i've realized
in order to distinguish though between a partner that you're with and a partner that you have connection
and chemistry and intimacy with there has to be that physical intimacy
which which is maintained and which is and will wax and wane but which can still be
a light because whenever it dies it irrevocably shakes the foundation of the
relationship and i don't think i put enough importance on that
i almost had like a zen-like view of marriage as opposed to appreciating and
it was it was funny it was a um someone was speaking to him and they were saying from a male
perspective females want the new man during the day to be kind
sensitive loving and they want a and tie them up in the evening
and it but you know it got me thinking because what if the same ingredients that lead
to a long-lasting loving relationship or monogamous
marriage stability dependability relatability safety protection caregiving
what if these are the same ingredients that kill desire because what i think is true is that
and i should just speak for myself what i potentially find attractive in
the bedroom might be the things that i actually stand against during the day
there might be power and there might be dominance and that doesn't match up with how i see myself
during the day and so then you reach this conflict and i think what i began to do was i
began to become the new man and only the new man
and actually what i want to do more often is to tap more into
and there's this great philosopher called usher who says a lady in the streets
and a freak in the bed and it's like i and i heard that lyric maybe eight years ago and i literally say it
to my friends all the time when i'm talking about the type of partner that i want and it's matching up exactly what you
said the civility and the class with the lack of class and
the freakishness and the and it's it's hard to find and maintain the
balance yeah um i found yeah and because sex can be really
a journey of somewhere that you go and so then there has to be that trust and that safety there and at
times it might be about uh letting go of responsibility and surrendering
it might be about taking control and being dominant but it's an understanding what it means
to you and at what times they should unfold and and be allowed to live so your imagination can live because
when it doesn't and then it just becomes an act or something that you should do
or a way of having children then we begin to feel lost and that's you
know what's happened with a lot of clients i've seen and so going back to how i would want to
imagine the situation is yes it'd be a monogamous relationship with with another um with a woman and
i would want to try and stay true to who i am and still keep keep that whole version
of me and that's what i've learned keeping and i've gone back to that the wonderful thing is would i you know you ask me what do i
regret it the reason also why i don't regret it because i'm not holding on to it it's because the changes have happened
and i've trusted that it was meant to be and i was meant to unfold that way and i'm much more in tune with who i am now
so i finally got my motorbike license i bought my triumph bonnie uh
yesterday and i'm doing the things which and i realized because i'm drawn to more
of a sense of risk and danger and actually activities where i have to be consumed within that moment and be
present and i'm getting back in touch with who i am and how i want to live my life and what i want to stand for and it's on me
to maintain that with the next person i'm with another thing i learned was the space
because where we went wrong is whenever we didn't have the space and actually i realized i really enjoy
living alone i love that freedom my other relationships are very important to me with my brother and my best friends
and so i don't know yet what that will look like
but it will definitely involve more space and and also that sense of adventure and
spontaneity because that's what i enjoy i want to travel i want to see different countries and i've i can set my life up where i'm doing
that potentially with another person or still pursuing my passions
and that is a safe relationship relationship where that person knows that i love them and
i'm there for them but i won't always be but then kids comes in the same room
[ __ ] up this whole fantasy like do you know what i mean because then we'll deal with that in podcast three yeah
but that's that's the bit where i'm like okay it's all wonderful and perfect i was just thinking then my last three
relationships they've all lived in another country and it's and it's probably the reason why it works is because
i can walk around here my boxing shorts all day just like drinking my heel you know eating my partner or whatever
and um being myself and then we come together when they come there or i go there a week yeah wonderful love it
great and then i go back and have my you know my bachelor lifestyle you know um
but yeah like i i think um kids is a is a really
a topic which we would be like intellectually dishonest if we did it didn't
yeah address because there's there'll be people listening to this and i think okay well that's all well and good but when you become a father or a mother
you have to be there for your kids yes and there's not a lot of science that says it's not good to be there for your kids right so yes and in
the same way that we can start to though make sure that we clarify between what the science says
and then what the script is because absolutely we know that
uh children will have better emotional outcomes and even physical development and
situational success whenever they are brought up with a sensitive caregiver someone who is responsive to
their needs someone who hears them can hold them give them safety but also permission to
build to travel and come back and who's invested in that child
but i'm not aware of studies that say that the parents have to be living
in the same home in the one house 12 months of the year and be their lives to be set up in a certain
way and i don't know what the answer is yet and i'm not at that stage yet but i
would be curious whenever i am at that stage to begin exploring and it might not be
as radical as is envisioned at a certain point in time but there might be enough space or
enough still spontaneity or adventure or playfulness even on an internal level or in the way that
you set your life up where both partners have that space and still are able to maintain that
passion isn't it crazy how much of life's misery and failure and um unhappiness
Why unhappiness stems from conformity
stems from either trying to conform to the conventional way or the script as you say yeah or trying
to fit into or even sometimes answer an invalid question we talked a little bit about
this on the last podcast where i said you know i think so many people live their lives trying to answer invalid questions like
what number is orange is what i said last time and in the same way you know the question are you in love
presumes a yes just by asking it i'm forcing you to to say yes yeah or no i'm also presuming
that we've agreed upon the definition of in love which again is just a [ __ ] amazing because no one's ever told me what that
is no you're not born and they go okay god goes by the way if you ever feel this that's love okay and you go okay
got you right because i you know the word is so loosely i love peanut butter i love my dog i love my girlfriend i love my wife i
love my mom and it's like so what is it different it's such a [ __ ] confusing complex nuanced thing love
and we're forcing it into this yes or no yeah and people will like that they'll ruin good things because
they they they feel pressured or they're unsure if this is it yeah and
um i just i just wanted to kind of leave that point there in a sense of like that idea of like you know
i know so many people listening to this will will be unknowingly programmed by convention and
it's like the first principle thinking and the ability to question why you're
doing what you're doing and then i guess lastly to have the
fearlessness or the courage to potentially interrogate and then reject it um
that can literally save you in every facet it saved me like go to university get a job do this and i
i stopped going to school because i thought it was a lot of [ __ ] dropped out of university after one lecture started a business
and i am as i've said on this podcast before i'm the happiest person i know i've reached a level of success at
ridiculously young age i managed to like write us write a news story write a new script for how life can be lived
and um people admire me and listen to this podcast basically only because not because i'm
smarter than anyone else or anything else it's fundamentally if you go back to where it started was because i
for some reason was willing to question the script and then had the as they call it
fearlessness for me it wasn't for me the biggest fear was [ __ ] following the script clearly right but had the perceived fearlessness to
say well this doesn't make sense um yeah how does that resonate with you
two things come to mind one is that like you said before the solution in my
mind will be bespoke because we're trying to take a one-size-fits-all solution a panacea and
apply it to everyone and and we're all unique and it's important i think for the each to
begin to become aware of the emotional resistance we have to considering
possibilities outside of the conventional nuclear family unit and just begin to
think about what that might mean and and where where we might be able to
see change and the second part is to ask yourselves what do i think i have to have in order
to be happy so in relationships often people think marriage
children in business it could be x revenue y set up
zed lifestyle and then we can ask what will that give me
why will it make me happy because below will be the emotional need so it could be in relationships this
could be because i want affection physical intimacy a sense of belonging
stability for something else it could be status to be accepted by others not to be
judged but isn't just a yeah isn't the actual
truth based on that so on that point of marriage people thinking that they think marriage will make them happy
they've never experienced marriage before right so where have they got that idea from it's i think the actual the fundamental
truth is because they told me it would make me happy yeah we've been sold that story but what do people really
want what are they wanting out of the marriage if you go deeper there will be an emotional need that they're trying to
meet through the marriage that they think their marriage will provide the solution to but like you're saying it doesn't
well it can but it might not and so what people might actually want
is emotional connection or companionship you know if you said describe the
marriage the ideal marriage to me they might say well we're happy and we're there for each other and i have a confidant or a best
friend or i have a lover it's understanding those different parts when we've broken that down
and understand what we're what we're actually yearning for or searching for we can then ask can i meet those needs
in a slightly different way that doesn't necessarily prescribe to the conventional model and that's
first principle thinking in essence which is exactly back to like the fundamental yeah
yeah which is how yeah yeah and which is what i said before is what i love about your mind because you take it back to
your first principles and then that's whenever you potentially become you know i just threw things yeah
that's it's such a i i wish the school taught kids how to think in that way because when i if the first
principles just go back to the university point for me where i want to be i want to start a business and be a millionaire that's what
my stupid ass brain was thinking at that point right so this piece of paper who am i going to
show that to if i'm self-employed yes good point i don't want you to show it to myself everyone else everyone else around me is
sleeping on their desk and hung over and i'm going to have the same stamp that they all have
but that's actually probably going to work against me and i swear to god this isn't i'll tell you
if it was hindsight [ __ ] i was thinking that i've got this vivid memory of my first day at university and my last
um of looking over and this girl bits up being sat on my right and she was drunk and sleeping on the desk and i didn't get into a good
university because i got expelled from school so i didn't really take my exam seriously either again because of the same thinking um
but i remember thinking i'm gonna go i'm gonna get the same trophy as her is that how is that going to help me if
we both show everybody and i just think and then you've got it was boring as [ __ ] like i've been running businesses
since i was 14 day one they were like make a poster i swear to god the lesson my last lesson in my first year at
university was make a poster and i thought this isn't gonna in terms of the information part that's
not gonna give me the information and it was that and i walked out there i walked into the business office
and i spoke to the head of the business at the university and i said i'm going to defer for her for a little while she said cool fill out this piece of
paper and you can defer i never even filled it out and never went back turns out i actually hadn't properly registered for university either like as
i was meant to so i didn't really have to defer and that was it and you know i wanna i
wanna move on because you spent a lot long time talking about this topic i you said earlier on that you spent lockdown in california yes which is uh you know
i'm jealous you don't know and and it cuts both ways you don't know
what's going to happen in the next moment we have a projection of the way that we think our life will
unfold and often we become tied to it and bound to it and any deviation we can see as a
failure of some sorts but actually sometimes life has other plans for us
and when we don't know what's going to happen i think it keeps that freshness you keep fresh eyes and you stay
grateful for what you do have while you have it on the other hand
we don't know what's going to happen and it could all be taken away from us at any point and i've got a good friend of mine and
his father uh just had a stroke a couple of days ago and they now know the outcome is he
won't be around 10 days goes walking in in south ken and five minutes after i passed and was
coming back there was um barriers put up and
a uh refuse collector had been walking out in a bus and knocked him down and in an instant
his life was over and i just imagined that i could be completely wrong but i could i imagined gosh he might have a family
he might say goodbye to his wife and the kids in the morning and he went off to work and he had no idea and she had no idea
and and the things that were really that might have been niggling or causing arguments don't matter now like
none of that matters now and and i didn't see what was going to happen coming and and i you know i lost it on
one level i lost a lot and it makes me really appreciate what i had but then on another level that wasn't
the end to the story and then it was as if life said you're
on this path and i'm going to shunt you into a new trajectory
and that's the path you're meant to be on this is where you're meant to be going and i believe that it's a part of my path and it was meant to unfold this way the
universe is unfolding as it should and it's a lesson for me to continually trust and that's why that voice came up
in the very beginning in my heart saying all is well because i know on a deep level that all is well
it's just about trusting sometimes letting go of our ideas and living in this moment
i can think of a better ending listen i i don't even you know thank you
so much for so many reasons because what you've done today on one hand will probably be selfish
selfish as i as you move forward and realize that the release of your truth and talking
about it and processing it with people is always liberating but on the other hand it's incredibly
selfless because there are so many people that are going to going to have less pain deal with their pain
better and understand themselves and hopefully be a little bit more self-aware because you had the guts
and the um and the you know the humility and lack of ego to share what is an incredibly emotional
um touching personal um experience and so thank you so much it's helped me
you know and i have no doubt that the hundreds of thousands of people that listen to this it's going to help them in the same way
um if people want to find you and they want to talk to you about this and i'm sure
there will be a lot of them you know the podcast was big back then it's much bigger now right how do they find
you what's the best way to reach you so on instagram it says at dr.underscore aria
or my website which is drhyphenaria.com and what kind of services do you offer
people that are going through you know various predicaments so i do one-to-one coaching so
right now everything's done digitally but essentially it's identifying what aspect of your
life right now is critical for you to resolve and then helping you with the psychology
and the mindset to be able to work through that or work
with that so it could be emotional resilience it could be sustainable weight loss it could be
relationships it could be taking your business to the next level in terms of how you
view yourself as an entrepreneur um it might be fears loss of intimacy
impostor syndrome whatever issue is actually there for you i'll
check if it's something that we can approach from a mindset point of view and that's where my expertise is and then help you on your journey as you
then have a more empowered mindset so that you're developing that robust sense of self and you're able to
change and adapt and be fluid in your journey and keep on growing essentially
we have um we have such good conversations even off the podcast we met i think last week or the week before
and had just an open conversation about a bunch of things in life so i actually wanted to ask you i've never asked a guest this before but
is there anything that we've missed in terms of the topics that you think are
curious to the relationship we have or pertinent to the relationship we have or um any sort of learnings that
you've garnered from our conversations that you think we should be sharing with people because i feel
somewhat i thought those conversations were so rich that i i you know we talked about so much last time and
um even in our private conversations i just i just wonder if there's anything else any sort of key topics that you
i'm sure there will be like i don't think we've exhausted our conversation we'll be back for a third hour
listen thank you so much for your time i appreciate it i i yeah i appreciate it so so much more than i you know people they give up
so much time and they fly to come and do the podcast but um the what you've given today
i don't think you'll realize how selfless um that act was because of the value it will give to people and this is exactly why i do this
podcast um to hear these kinds of things and to to hopefully make myself better and the listeners
better for hearing it so thank you a million million times over thanks steve thank you

Transcription:

it's very rare that you get to meet entrepreneurs that are following and have followed in the steps

that you followed in in your life and like so whenever i meet people like you and ben francis who

is similar age to me who has like similar life ambitions um i see it as like this really amazing

rare opportunity to learn for myself and to ask honestly like selfish questions and i saw on your twitter i think it was

over the mental health week period you did a tweet where you talked about your experiences with

depression burnout and anxiety and from what i know about your story you experience those things in that

order so i think that's a good place to start which is let's talk about depression and the the role that

depression played in your life and where it came from and how you've overcome or are overcoming all handling depression

Depression - where did it all start?

yeah so interesting actually because um i i realized when i started to talk

about mental health stuff even more interestingly than what you've just said i kind of realized that

i'd been burying another mental health problems actually the the tweet was more depression burnout anxiety

um and insomnia but actually it's really interesting i did a podcast interview with a nutritionist

called rhiannon lambert and when i was preparing for that i was going over my the fact that i'd grown up fat and the

fact that um you know i probably did have an unusual relationship mentally with food and

um suddenly like i was unpacking what had happened in my 20s and i actually had bulimia i used to throw

up for like four to five years not intentionally though this is like quite unusual but that's

how deeply rooted this mental health problem was i would eat something and i would throw a lot of it

up um my friends would like know about this but it wasn't like labelled and i went to you know specialists in harley street to

see what was up and they were like medically you're fine so psychologically there's something there

anyway i haven't done it since i was about 26 or whatever but it suddenly occurred to me a few weeks ago really interestingly

that you know being able to label like the time i got depression the time i got anxiety the time i got

insomnia the time i was burnt out i remembered those moments this one i'd

actually buried as a story right in my head and never i'd never expressed it in my whole life to anyone

publicly at all full stop um and it was a couple of months ago i wrote a newsletter on mental health and

uh and nutrition um and i admitted for the first time then that i'd had bulimia and like what the symptoms

were and how long it had gone on and the fact that i was basically like losing lots of weight getting really skinny and all i saw was someone fat

um and it was so interesting to me like two revelations that came from that one is that um if it's

so uncomfortable right it's for me it's really embarrassing to admit to myself that i was weak enough to have a mental

health condition that bad that i would psychologically throw up when there was nothing biologically

wrong with me um that's really awkward to admit to yourself it's also far more terrifying to admit it publicly

once you've uncovered it and it kind of made me reflect on the fact that um sometimes like these things

are actually just so painfully embarrassing about your personal life that you can even bury it to yourself did you ever understand why you were

bulimic was there because it's a psychological like comorbidity so what was the cause it's really hard to

say what the cause was because i got it after i'd lost weight um so you know by the time i was sort of 21 or whatever i was in perfectly

reasonable shape um but i got it at like 23. um and actually there was a result of it um the

only time i was ever hospitalized it's a really random but hilarious story in its own way

um because i've been throwing up i've been basically like hurting the inside of my throat right and i was at a festival one time and i

had a coughing fit in in hackney and i had a coughing fit at the hospital and i coughed a hole in my

throat literally it's called a pneumomedia steinem it's a very unique

thing to happen apparently and fortunately it was close enough to the royal london hospital to go in there and show them right

and basically what happened to me was my head started to grow so i was with my friends feeling fine other than this

cough and one of my friends just looked at me and was like whoa and i was like what they're like may your head is massive

i'm like i'm not even talking mate maybe a dick no no your head is growing what is going on i was like what and then

everyone else was like oh my god anyway walks to the hospital um it's sort of like five

in the afternoon or whatever because there's a day festival um and there's like you know it's east london there's quite a lot of genuinely

like gang related things people are bleeding everywhere all this stuff and they just see me and they're like that guy's next

and put me and i went into intensive care for like the whole week um whilst they were basically trying to sew up this hole in my throat when you say

your head was your head was growing so oxygen was going uh not going like in my mouth and through my

bloodstream properly somebody was escaping around my head and my brain so it was like an emergency procedure to like like get me on

uh meds and sort me out but it's so interesting because even knowing that that had happened to me i didn't relate the cause

to actually a deeper root cause which was another mental health problem um to be honest with you like i couldn't

say to you what the trigger was beyond this like story you know the things that we grow up with the people

that we grow up with those little you know bullying and things like that i mean you know in some good respects

because i grew up fat i've got a good personality and a sense of humor so i've always been like able to really connect with people because i just never

had it all my way kind of thing do you know this this story about you know um people that are fat having

better senses of humor and being a little bit more you know quote and quite bubbly yeah why why is that i think self-deprecation

can sometimes be like a defense mechanism right and and ultimately you know with these things you're going

to hear them a lot if you grow up you're going to hear it a lot right you're going to go to a new environment someone's going to bully you for the obvious and so

you kind of find a way of coping with it in your own way um for me it's just interesting because

the other mental health um issues that i've had in my life i'm able to trace back usually to a

moment or a thing or reflect on why this one kind of just happened later and then as soon like you know i had it for

a few years but then it just also went away at what age was this so about 23

to about 27. are you old now uh 33. so it was so you had it for 23 to 27 for

about four years and you overcame yeah but like

naturally i wasn't doing anything different i mean i started to learn what foods would make me more sick than others if that makes sense as well

um but i find it super interesting again less so i mean we're cool to know

the trigger obviously but it's almost less so that and more so the fact that um it kind of ran its course as

well was interesting to me and that i buried it right in my head um and actually 27

um you know was the start of like a whole other you know experience in life for me anyway

so it is possible that um you know these things are related to stress and other things

um my entrepreneurship journey started at 24 so it's not completely unrelated but not quite not

not enough to actually label it and say it's for a thing um but then you know the

other the other experiences um that i've had with with mental health a lot clearer so i

think depression is a really complex term um and the only i think it's really

worth saying the only relation that i've got to depression that i'm comfortable talking about

um is after my father passed away and i think that's really reasonable right and so this is

the thing i like because i work so so much with people in mental health and experts i know like depression is also

not something to claim you have when you feel down or you know it's very different like and

obviously there is a spectrum of these things as well but for me my depressive episode was

right after my father passed away because he was on life support for six months and overcame

when they said he's 100 going to die actually survived made it out of the hospital into

recovery home and then someone basically had a cold around him and he died of their cold catching their cold

after the entire recovery process um the truth of the matter is that my depression was actually interestingly

sort of linked with a lack of belief in um a higher power or whatever you

want to call it justice like everything right because in fairness yeah and like my dad was like such a generous spirited guy

he was blind he had all of these things wrong with him anyway and still like was just the funniest nicest

warmest person anyone knows and um the last person on earth to kind of deserve something like that

and so for me the um the experience after he passed away so

he believed in god so when he died i was like that's my connection to god gone

therefore i straight up believe in nothing um you know i think it's really interesting to have conversations with people

intelligent people like yourself when you talk about purpose and vision and these things it's very

hard to imagine that you've got a purpose a vision for anything if suddenly you've switched

and you've switched off and you've said i believe in nothing you did totally destabilized yeah yeah i remember the the feeling of

being i was religious until i was when i was christian until i was 18. and then which i think will surprise a lot of people because i'm a very

rational sort of someone that makes a lot of decisions and things from first principles or logic and then at 18 i lost my faith per se

and it was the most like the two years following that were the two most destabilizing years of my life

as i i became a total obsessive atheist which means i read every book watched every documentary video

and then i got to the point and this is when i realized that i'd overcome my sort of wobble where i no longer cared about

engaging in these debates with people that agreed or disagreed with me and i was at peace with my own beliefs

that um i guess which is like agnosticism if that's a term and the other really destabilizing moment in my

life where i lost my sense of purpose was the day someone offered me about

20 to 30 million um hypothetically to buy my business and 18 year old steve shows up i've

talked about this a few times because he thought we were doing this for money he thought that was the goal

and so i go home that night i remember where i sat like it was yesterday i'm typing rightmove.com looking at

houses at 24 years old and then i'm looking at these houses and i'm getting this real sort of deep sense of um unfulfillment by

thinking well that was that was it that was the game and then like okay so um auto trader boom

boom lamborghini aventador i'm looking at this aventador and feeling like i'd be poorer not in a financial sense but in like a

spiritual sense if i chose to step on what's clearly a hamster wheel

and and that so from that day the day after i didn't know why i was i didn't know

why i was working hard anymore i didn't know why i was building the business and i had to then go in search of a real form of stability in my

life which was you know i love it but i thought i loved it for another reason i thought i loved it for money

but i loved it for connection and for conversations like this and those things but to go back to your point please um

Psychedelics

you're talking about how you lost your sense of sort of stability i guess yeah i lost what i believed in this world

yeah and if you don't have a sense of belief it's really hard to find your purpose and i i would say that i

i went through a few years of that um very important age sorry uh so 24 my dad

died so i mean also similar time to having the yeah i mean i didn't even realize that as

i until i was saying it just now um but so probably related obviously um but

i i went through about three years of not believing um

in anything right like really and you know not very nice about it either um so i

grew up jewish um and i've always said in fairness you know i think judaism is as bad a

religion as all the other religions you know i don't actually personally uh like any one of them

but i do love what they all mean but then you know it's very possible to be wise and not associate yourself with a

religion and what i've learned which i find so interesting is my identity my connection to

spirituality and judaism is a weird one as well because it's like a race and a religion so it's like you can actually be not

religious you can lose your religion but still be the race yeah um and that's that's like an actually it's a positive in a way because it

means you don't have to disassociate from cultural values but you can disassociate yourself from religious ideals

and what actually happened to me was you know i would be relatively difficult

and question people a lot when they would talk to me about their religious beliefs i'd want to dig into them and i'd really

want to challenge the way that they think and why they think these things and how they can defend them but not trying not to be an absolute

[ __ ] but just using my own i guess bitterness and my own experience of growing up being told

to believe in something which is very different to finding something and you know when my father passed away

and i didn't have this connection to it anymore i also felt like i didn't have a connection to spirituality or anything

and so it's very weird to have like almost the death of a religion as a human being because that's your death of your

connection to this earth and purpose and everything and it wasn't until i was 27 really um

one of my really good friends told me about um and obviously we've been talking about christian angermeier as well like our mutual friends so this is

a relevant conversation told me about ayahuasca and i'd never heard of it before i didn't even know what it was

um and i went on a retreat with him and um i mean i came back that weekend

completely i mean when i say a 180 i went from the most cynical non-believer in the

whole world negatively so to like without sounding like a complete

[ __ ] like positively enlightened and confident never never

more confident of anything in my life um of spiritual realism

and what i believe in and ultimately what i believe in when i have these like fun conversations with people now about

spirituality which is you know what do i believe in i believe in nature i believe in

looking at the beauty of the world and how cycles work which is science right and the way

that my ayahuasca experience actually opened my eyes to believing in something spiritual or greater than myself

was 90 percent of my hallucination was observing what happens in nature with cycles

right birds bees oxygen air soil all of this recycling all the time

for a sustainable system and being like you know that is in itself a scientific miracle but

something greater than us that's always happening throughout time and it was a real shift for me because

a i overcame my depression from that b i suddenly believed in something

even if that's something is nature and when people are like and i get this from christians quite often as well because they're like you know what do you mean

you believe in nature like what is that i'm like i mean it's it's more believable than a guy that walked on water

yeah and when they like get annoyed i'm like i've got nothing against jesus i'm just saying that like believing in nature as ridiculous as

that sound is a profound belief and what's important is it is a belief and having a belief has actually helped

me helped guide me to then work on things like what are my personal values you know which you talked about you know mental

models what do i say yes to a no to in life well you can only figure those things out if you spend time with mental models

first principles thinking about what things mean to you in life and then suddenly

other things start to come into flow and and so i really want to just double down on this ayahuasca experience

what exactly did you do on that experience so ayahuasca is essentially uh and it's

completely natural it's tree sap from the amazon um and it's been practiced for thousands of years and

you know i won't go into like the whole history of psychedelics but i could do because i've read a lot about it um the the reality is it's sacred

so our shamans have like a legal license to practice with it um and they it's a guided experience so

the most important thing to say to anyone thinking about ayahuasca or whatever like it's not something you do at home on

your own at all ever you could do that with mushrooms you can definitely do that with lsd

you definitely do not want to do that with ayahuasca because um in my experience the other

psychedelics are a bit like you can have sort of one foot in this world one foot in that world and ayahuasca is not even in this

plane you're just somewhere else but what's fascinating and very common from people's recollections of ayahuasca

trips is you have a spirit guide called mama ayahuasca that's what everyone calls

her um and in all of my experience of doing it and

i've done it about 12 times now so i almost go back every year by the way it's an incredibly painful experience

and it's very difficult to do and it's not something you look forward to which is why it's like rockish rocket fuel growth um which is

why i do it because you learn all the things about yourself you don't want to hear you don't want to know and you confront the

worst realities and i've learned more in those weekends that i've done this then you know you can learn with therapists

and you can learn yourself so staggering everyone says this to me and it's and you know you mentioned a guy called

christian angermeier context he runs a company called a thai which are are now developing um psychedelics as a way to

cure treatment resistant depression um it's really sort of a groundbreaking company and he sat with me in his

his penthouse just across across the street in fact from where we are now and he was telling me that you can let

you unlock the brain by taking these drugs and you discover truths about yourself which

in many experiences which is similar to what you're describing will have a permanent lasting

transformative impact on the way you see the world and it like corrects your thinking and it's it's

it's crazy crazy for a normal person that isn't in this world or doesn't understand this to think that you can take

a magic mushroom or a drug or a psychedelic or whatever you want to call it and overcome grief there's a great book

by michael pollan called um how to change your mind and in it he talks about this problem with

psychedelics it's a bit like dreams right you're having an ineffable experience so to describe it for people was generally

quite boring what i think is more interesting in a sense is to discuss the outcomes that i've i've got from it

um so the first time you know very quickly because you asked the experience was the hallucinogenic

experience like i said was watching the cycles of the earth develop and were you conscious because right so

you haven't done it yes so you drink it it takes about an hour for me you lie down the pitch blacks fluid

it's like a shot it tastes disgusting but some people like it you lie back um and and the shamans basically start

playing music and it's a completely guided facilitated experience with them if you're having problems they come over they help you if you need to be taken

out the room they look after you it's like you know it's busy night there's noises like a lot of people throw up

how's this for irony i didn't throw up for my first 10 times which everyone was like that's super weird i was like yes especially

considering my history really bizarre um but the

um the experience i saw was the one i needed and there's a really deep insightful experience you get from

psychedelics which you can often go in wanting a thing but it isn't what you need and in this experience what i

wanted was to see my dad and to connect with my dad but it isn't what i got what i got was

um a vision of understanding how everything in this earth is living

in a cycle like a beautiful miracle and so it was less about like seeing micro things and seeing macro things

being in it if it's taking me to a place i don't want to go and a door i'm not ready to open

you can negotiate you can actually say i'm not ready for that yet and sometimes it'll push you and say open it anyway but sometimes it will

actually listen to you and let you go sort of back into your body so it is a really fascinating

experience and what i'd say about it is it's the number one most important thing i've ever done in my life

um and especially because it's not pleasant um the first time i

did it was you know the single most life-changing moment in my life not only got over my depression you know

i went and spent the whole day with my mum the next day explained everything that i'd experienced um you know not a

mum's favorite chat hearing your son talk about psychedelics but certainly is in context of like helping me get over

something she was aware i was suffering from um the single greatest lesson i've learned in ayahuasca is about gratitude

so i was going through a period i think i was 30 potentially it was a few years later and

uh things were going well at the time so my attitude my mindset was i want this i

want that right what's your intention going in well i want this i want that that's like how you answer it because you're not enlightened enough

to understand the psychedelic experience right yeah yeah and you can write it down and come back to and be like that was what i was looking for in this journey

um but actually the lesson i learned so i was asking you know how can i 10x what i do

how can i be more how can i become better how can i have more impact you know me me me me all these questions um i was

instead transported to um like basically i'm not sure where in

the world but a very poor part of the world where there was this like kid like begging

in the street basically and i like became that kid and i became this person like trying to

get water for his family and having to walk miles for it and

50 of my whole entire psychedelic experience that night was literally walking like a mile in this

boy's shoes and it this lesson sort of came to me about you know it isn't always about what you

want and it isn't always about like you know asking for more it's actually about having gratitude for

what you have and when you have enough gratitude for what you already have you will unlock the path to more

and you know there's this thing that i've learned as well which is when you go into experiences it's helpful to have a totem

right so i carry a different stone in for each experience and i have these stones at home anyway i have this stone

by the side of my bed um and every single morning that i wake up the first thing i see is this stone

literally just a pile of crap stone but the point is it's imbued with this message for me and i wake up every day and i'm grateful

for having running water in my bathroom there and that is like an unbelievably poetic

and powerful way to live your life past an experience to wake up in camden town in london being you know

so fortunate like i am but with a real genuine reminder of gratitude as opposed to like waking

up groggy and being like hey i'm grateful for waking up today this is like it means something to me so these little triggers and shifts they

emotionally change something in you but i've learned a lesson the hard way through ayahuasca as well which is

just because you're learning lessons this is like all wisdom right it doesn't matter whether you get it from ayahuasca or you get it from you know your

instagram posts you can read it and it can resonate and you can be like wow that's powerful

without action it means nothing so if you don't create then the steps

to be better based on what you learned you're wasting a very powerful weekend and painful

weekend and i've been guilty of that too i've learned i've learned lessons that i haven't necessarily followed

through with and you know and and sometimes it's because they take bravery

and i feel like i'm not ready for that bravery up and so we were talking about the other day you know with the exactly with personal

branding exactly actually that's actually a good segue on to that topic as well because it's something that i know for a fact a lot of people

Posting online despite what people think

struggle with in different forms and um but in but also specifically with this topic which is

putting yourself out there on the internet um i know this because a lot of people have told me but also

because i've been there right so let's if we rewind a couple of years in my own life

a guy called ash jones says to me you should make a youtube channel i dismiss the idea obviously because i'm

like well people are going to think that i think i'm mahatma gandhi like or like people are gonna think that i think i'm a genius or

that i think i have all the answers so i'm not doing that eventually after two years he sits me down in this room and it took

about eight or nine hours for us to shoot a two-minute video because i couldn't speak i i was

self-conscious and all of these things and i was plagued by that thought that my friends back home who knew me in

school will think oh steve's a [ __ ] he's changed what's he doing who does he think he is and that almost imprisoned me it almost

stopped me from doing the thing that actually liberated me made me the most fulfilled i've ever been and by allowing me to be my like true

self and in fact what i wanted to do was be true to myself and um

it felt like i was worried that people would think i was um being something i was not trying to fake

myself and so i guess the question that i have for you is you know a lot of stuff but you've not

you know you've got a great podcast secret leaders you've got a new podcast as well which is centered around your brand heights um

you've struggled to put yourself out there on the internet and social media can you explain why yes i mean such a good question

steve um but also because we connect a lot on this right so you're like my unofficial mentor with a few voice notes where i'm

like he's got a [ __ ] point here um

so you know it's i guess i'll put it a slightly different way you know i was listening to one of your early but you sent me this actually your podcast with

with him so what was his name ash jones yeah yeah you told me to listen to an episode which i did and you know he was talking

about the early days of social chain you learned early that you you were bringing in most of the revenue like

steve was bringing in most of the revenue therefore the business decision made lots of sense to center that around you i think when you're doing b2b that makes

loads of sense the challenge i have is um my products are b2c right they're for consumers

and putting as much time and effort and thought and energy into promoting myself is is mental

energy i should be putting into the brand and you know there is i think uh probably a reasonable compromise and

also like all things this is a bit of a developing scenario however um you know it's a very

fair thing to say that i'm not the product this is the product um inside my company we could all agree

that that is like broadly true right we're selling a thing we're not selling me whereas you know going through exactly the same

experience at social chain you guys if you weren't in the room you guys would have come to the same conclusion which is steve's the greatest like part of the

funnel here so we as a company succeed when steve's succeeding so that's the kind of marketing final we should back so you

know i can see you sort of smirking at me because this is the story i tell myself okay fine because i was like this doesn't make

this is the story this is the story that i tell myself it doesn't mean that it's true um

you know then there's another question about platforms right so um you know this isn't a mental health

condition um but i do have imposter syndrome and you know we've talked about this in the

past as well but um you know the first business that i scaled

uh was grabble and which is when we first met yes um and you know that

that was me going into technology and fashion having had no experience previously i was in advertising before

and i love changing industries and i love challenging myself to completely wipe the slate clean and do something new but it comes

with imposter syndrome that's what i've learned about myself right i'm i'm full of the internal monologue of

i'm not good enough no one cares what i think and i don't deserve to be doing this it's someone else's dream

um that doesn't change right in me that that voice is still

there um however you know a really good thing if you're aware if you're consciously

aware of your limitations especially like some of your mental frailties creating steps to improve those things

are helpful so with heights the first thing i did just over 100 weeks ago we started a newsletter

because i was like i'm going to get imposter syndrome so badly in a space of neuroscience and nutrition

not neuroscientists or nutrition like it's going to be awful for me so i'm going to write a newsletter every week

and i'm going to read a science paper every week and i am going to distill that into three minutes because when you read something you learn it once and

when you share it you learn it twice so the process of literally rewriting this was creating neural pathways

and embedding the information into my brain so i was like in a hundred weeks it's actually what i told myself and it's just

been 101 now um in 100 weeks i won't be a neuroscientist or a nutritionist but i will have read over 100 science

papers and i'll know what science says is good for your brain according to journals experts etc which

would be an amazing step to create an amazing habit to build to get over my own mental frailties and

my own story of imposter syndrome so when it comes to social media i feel like i've got the same thing which is

like um when my last company failed and i didn't know what i was going to do

next i looked at like my social media platforms i was like you know where am i going to spend time rather than where am i going to waste time

ultimately right because you can get caught up in this silly game and then thinking personal branding where do i feel

comfortable that would be a good place to start and i chose linkedin and the reason i chose linkedin was because i told myself

a story which i completely believe to be true anyway which is whatever i do next i'm a serial

entrepreneur right as in i'm fine not having any money i'm fine working for other people for free doing all these things but i'm always going to

start something else myself again so if i know that to be true it means i'm always going to hire people

and what do really smart and impressive people want from their boss they want to know who they're working for they want to know what your values are

they want to know what you believe in they want to know what kind of things you share and so i was like linkedin is the only place that could credibly do that for me

right and i actually went from i mean it's not you know that impressive but i went from like 3 000 followers or something to almost

25 000 on the basis of and as you know there's no putting money behind anything in linkedin or anything

literally just by being myself by writing about how i'd failed by writing about what i was working on

next by working and and also all of the things when you know writing about what you're working on next is such a difficult thing to do because it's

probably going to fail as well and it did you know before heights um with three iterations of things that i

was publicly putting out there and getting feedback on and stuff that we had to kill because it didn't have legs um it's a horrible time for an

entrepreneur in between or it can be certainly in between people like what do you do and your identity is in flux and you

know you're like do i talk about this new thing that i've just discovered that might not be a thing in a month preaching here dan i know right exactly

exactly but it's such a complicated answer to give in the now yeah um so anyway like on the personal brand

thing like i decided linkedin was a place i felt comfortable because i can be my authentic self because i am an entrepreneur because i

am someone who is willing to go big and fail and like actually figure out

why and talk about why and i think this stuff is so important um for entrepreneurs to

connect openly and honestly because i absolutely hate and the one thing i will not miss about networking events

is like going to them and everyone talking about them killing it you know that is literally poison in our society it's

nonsense so everyone just talking about how they're killing it stops people from saying actually you know shit's really hard

right now this is the problem i'm dealing with and this is like how it's making me feel if you're able to say that to another

entrepreneur because you've created the container in the environment to be comfortable to do so that person can probably help you and if

you are stuck with the narrative that everything's going amazingly all the time and that's all you're telling people no one can help you

figure it out when you actually could do with the help you know it's the other thing going slightly off piece sorry but

you know my biggest bug bear in entrepreneurship is stealth mode i think stealth mode is like the most

stupid thing that an entrepreneur can claim to be in full stop because as you know ideas are worthless execution is

everything anyone that's ever built a business knows how stupid it is stealth mode is when people say like working on a new business in

finance in stealth mode right i'd love to see i mean not telling anybody yeah i'd love to tell you what my startup is but it's so amazing you'll

steal it so i'm not going to tell you guys all the time all the time so many people

do it and and i i i give the most direct feedback on linkedin probably very similar to you like loads

of people asking my help for loads of things all the time and if i ever see stealth mode on their thing i'm like i don't talk to anyone in stealth mode

fyi stealth mode is such a stupid thing because it's it's it's like how do i describe

like saying i'm afraid of feedback but it's yeah but it's also like saying i've got something that i can't tell you

yeah why did you tell me you had something i know you know just don't start the conversation with me i'm a curious

person what it is but you know you're attention seeking but you don't want to tell it's like it's a weird form of

like i don't know flirtation i don't know um but i want to get to this point about

why you we have this conversation yeah like a week or two ago about instagram and making videos of yourself

and putting your ideas out there what is it that's stopping you doing that you talked about imposter syndrome i guess that kind of relates to the

business side of things more what's stopping you going on instagram putting a video on your instagram and saying

this is what i think these are my ideas comment below if you agree yeah you're it's a great question um

so i guess as a starting point like it's worth saying that i think a very healthy way to approach stuff like this in your life is to to

choose a place build confidence and go on from there so i feel like that's what i did with linkedin i understood that that's the

place where i'd feel least impostery and so i'd start there now you know i picked up on on twitter i

mean twitter is like my favorite platform that's when i spend probably the most time on um but you know it's it's got a very short

half-life so it's kind of impossible to to consistently come up with gems um

instagram you know to me was this place where just beautiful people live young beautiful people live and that's all

anyone's interested in and that's not really my world right i'm interested in challenge i'm interested

in mental health i'm interested in stories um and i interestingly i wasn't finding

that on instagram so i was like what am i doing i don't really belong in this place at all um i'd say like a hundred percent

like inspired by the way that you've approached your instagram like sharing insights because insights and like distilling my thoughts into something

and writing them down that is something that i do i just don't publish them or i was on linkedin

so actually like what i've now started doing on instagram is like literally taking a leaf out of your book after our chat which is going through

some of my high performing linkedin posts that you know might have got one or two thousand likes and being like if

it was popular there i guess it'll be popular let's have a go and trying to get over it now slowly but surely but it's this

constant belief that no one wants to hear what i have to say yes of course and that's what i was getting

at and like where does what are the forces that are

at play which are making it feel like some like psychological discomfort if you are

to tell the world what you think on instagram let's say what in your mind what is it friends back

home is it this particular person sometimes i can think of a particular person and i can think that person from four

years ago is going to think i'm a dick 100 dude like the thing that i've learned which is so interesting is

90 percent of my fear of what people will think is based on my school friends yes who like you know i only speak to a

bunch of them now you know identity is such an interesting thing and you know you have it when you're um you'll be going through it right now

and i empathize right you're not steve from social chain anymore yeah right and that's you know for ages you know i was down from gravel now i'm

down from heights um you know people do that and that's fine but it's important you don't over

compensate that identity for yourself attached to your business because we're all on a path and we're going to go

through a journey and the journey the stories are going to change and when you over attach yourself to a particular

part of the journey is where you can find struggle and that's and on that point you build your life around

that identity so your friends the you me your music your interests and so you you would have collected

through your life a bunch of people who know dan as this exactly and you're gonna have to shed

some of them potentially by by stepping into your new identity 100 and that's a i guess a conflict or a

100 and it's difficult right but as you grow you edit and you know you need to really consider

who you're editing out of your life and who you're welcoming into your life and i think you know there's the the

practical reality that what was good for you five years ago is no good for you right now and frankly you know the highest

leverage decision you can make i'm still terrible at this by the way but the highest leverage decision you can make is picking what to say no to

and the hardest thing you can do is say no to opportunities that you would definitely say yes to so you know that includes friends that

includes saying i don't have time for this friend anymore or this identity this part of my

identity anymore even though i like it i like them i like all this stuff because

frankly there's you know this shedding almost that we do as human

beings um you know the you know in reptile form it's very physical right they're literally shedding a skin

but as humans you don't see this change but it doesn't mean it doesn't happen and we go in these cycles and i think a

lot of you know mental health conditioning is attached to our holding onto the past and refusing

to sort of embrace the future and that's why you know i think it's really important

to set out a clear understanding of your purpose a clear understanding of the things you will say no to and won't say

no to and acknowledging that that changes right so i do an exercise like this every year um and it takes about five or six hours

i do it with my wife it's like a whole massive like briefing document essentially on your vision your purpose your friends

like all of this stuff um spending the time thoughtfully thinking about these things which people do not do enough of

is so important because if you're not reflective and you're not spending time thinking manifesting essentially who you

want to be in the future then i think you're going to miss a massive opportunity to grow

um you know i because you know i work in the brain space now in in brain care neuroscience

you call that neuroplasticity right it's this idea that the brain will grow it's plastic and it's essentially changing in whatever

direction you choose to take it in if you are episode 53 of chapter two we

talked about this on the last episode so it's very relevant oh really okay fine yeah so neuroplasticity is that

um if you are into spirituality like i am then it's called manifestation right

it's spending the time thinking about what you're gonna do and how you're gonna get that and then to put it into like super

business terms if you're into business it's called planning and execution so there are these different ways to

articulate the same point but the point is if you just spend your days going um bit

by bit not really thinking about where you're going to go and what it means to you it'd be very hard for you to make good

decisions and frankly and this i guess actually speaking like personal branding a more popular post i

did recently was about stamina and the things i've learned about rest which is that as a founder and a ceo you learn that

you're not paid for your stamina right you pay yeah you pay mo gorda for sorry not mo

called mo farah for his stamina right he's got to run a [ __ ] 10k that's

stamina right that's what athletes are paid for i'm paid for my decision making people

invest in me and they invest in heights for my decision-making abilities and overworking

giving yourself burnout not taking space to rest not listening to what you know to be

true and spending the time planning that's bad decision-making yeah um if you can't do those things for your own

body you know it's like what i said is if you can't be the ceo of your body you do not earn the right to be the ceo

of your company you gotta you've got to look after your mental state and your physical body

first by thinking and finding the space carving out the space to think what does good decisions look like that

fit my purpose and where i'm looking to go and if you can do that and you can answer those things you actually start

to learn things start to add up and and that kind of segues back to the

Burnout

initial tweet where you talked about depression anxiety banner and insomnia so let's talk about burnout then it's a

very um a very popular topic i actually think one of the most listened to episode of this podcast was

the top was the one about burnout and us being a burnout generation and how we've kind of glamorized it we're

optimizing our lives so we can fill it with more things to do did you burn out how did you burn out and you understand

why you burnt out 100 um you know garyvee is a very clever man

um very intelligent but you know he has created a negative impact on society

that he would probably be upset about because he seems to be a lovely man that really deeply cares about stuff from what i can see i believe his authenticity but he

has created hustle culture and hustle porn and you know what i met gary vee had him on this podcast

and you're right i think in every um depiction of him there he's a genuinely

authentic person you meet him and think you are who i thought you were online um

and you're completely right in the sense that because he's being his authentic self which we can't

you know uh um we can't criticize anyone for being in fact that's what we tell everyone to be be

yourself and chat you know and be willing to share it with the world the issue i think as you're pointing out

is his lack of appreciation that

about nuance and that everyone is fundamentally different and everyone's not gary vee i had that problem too when i started

i couldn't understand why people weren't sacrificing their lives to build businesses and working until four in the

morning and sleeping under the desk i thought everyone that wasn't doing that was both an idiot and inferior and wasting their time and

wasting that time and they would never be happy because as far as steve's bartlett's brain could tell him

that was happiness yeah and because like all of the pain that you suffer is part of part of the game and yeah but that stuff

isn't this is the thing right that stuff isn't not true you do have to grow growth is painful and you will have

sleepless nights and all the other bits and pieces that is part of the parcel the thing where we confuse this is it's all mutually exclusive aka

my identity has to be that and only that because that's how gary v and like a few other geniuses in society

have got to the top of their games but here's the thing like there's two

reasons why i had burnout last time the first was because i wasn't happy on what i was working and

running a startup can feel a bit like a cage sometimes so uh unless you're really sure i say this

all entrepreneurs all the time are you sure this is the company you want to build because if it's not you're going to be doing it anyway and

then you are your own bird keeper you have locked yourself in a cage and that's what i did with

grabble i got lucky i found a niche an opportunity

it grew exponentially really quickly millions of downloads had a million monthly active users in our end we had

like a you know even acquisition that failed sadly but you know would have made us millionaires was

a real journey with that company it was fashion for tinder basically yeah exactly and it was a real it was a real

exciting journey but at no point did i enjoy it um really like

not at no point my ego enjoyed it right and we won loads of awards um you know we won the award we wanted

like we were like we just want to be written about in techcrunch and all this stuff and in 2017 we won best mobile startup in europe over depop at the

techcrunch europas we didn't even turn up to that awards to take that award

because i was having such a bad time mentally i didn't even go to the awards of a ceremony my friend picked up that

trophy and took a photo on our behalf i was sitting at home drinking whiskey feeling really terrible about myself

um why because that was living someone else's dream i

didn't care about fashion um what was the force that made you live someone else's dream yeah good question uh a bit of

serendipity in the sense of um you know listening to users going on a bit of a journey and the product sort

of developing and then it getting catching fire before you really have an opportunity to stop and say no that's not really for

me like you were getting dragged you weren't pulling a bit yeah a bit but then at the same time like you know

like everyone i'm scared of failure so i didn't want to be a failure so i wanted to make it work and you know by hook or

by crook i was willing to like push really hard to make it work and you know i look back on my time with grapple and

other than like working hard i was working against my purpose and i could feel it and when people ask me i'm

actually like as you know always to my detriment honest so

i would tell people including the wrong people including investors that you know my heart really isn't in it and like all

this stuff because you know all i had left for authenticity was to be honest in these

conversations with other people you know i've just finished writing my book um not trying to plug it although happy

sexy millionaires happy sexy millionaire available on all bookshelves no it's not pre-order um but there's a chapter in there where i

really investigate burnout and the reason there's topics like self-awareness and burnout which we haven't quite yet properly defined

everyone throws it out there on instagram oh i'm feeling burnt out but nobody's like gone down the rabbit hole to figure out the innate causes or

the psychological or social causes of it so i just wanted to like go as far down as i could go

and i tend to believe the depth that i've got to with my thinking and the research that i've done

is that you typically get um you stand a higher chance of burnout in situations where you are extrinsically motivated um

to do x activity because i view my life and i think about all the things that i do intrinsically like walking i've never

got burnt out walking my dog or playing with my dog you know i've never got burnt out um

like reading books that i love and those kinds of things but when it comes to getting paid to

do something that i don't intrinsically enjoy doing burnout is almost inevitable at some

point not just by now right but then my but then motivation and i started looking at motivation and the spectrum

it sits on of on one end being totally uh extrinsic you're literally doing it because you're forced to

and then on the other end doing it because it's an innate passion an intrinsic passion and all of the things on this end where you

you're paid and you're forced to burn out seems to show up and on the other end when it's it's

intrinsic and you love it and you're doing it for the sake of doing it i never get burned out and my motivation seems to last the course of time so i

wanted to see if that resonates with you yeah but let me tell you something else that's interesting that i'm i'm consciously aware of because i've had

burnout and by the way my experience of it was you know i just couldn't get out of bed for a month really um that was it i basically just

stayed in bed and i just like i couldn't face going to the office i couldn't face leaving my

team in the office yeah and you're lying in bed well i got my co-founder and i just like explained that i'd literally i didn't

know what it was at the time i was like i think it might be depression i didn't know what it was though this is the thing i probably didn't even say those words how did it feel um just like just no

energy whatsoever just like no no ability a bit like when i had corona virus to be honest just like zonked

um not and nothing i was doing was able to make me feel like i was getting the energy

i think the reason why as well was um again i like i'm a helpful guy i really

believe in my greatest superpower full stop is connecting people right i've got infinite numbers of ways i've connected

people eight people have got married that i've introduced you know they say three in heaven but you know i don't quite believe in heaven so

it's irrelevant but point being um you know so many co-founders introduced

i really just believe in the serendipity of creating you know moments where you know that person and that person just should have

that chat and i force it to happen so because of that because i really believe in serendipity as well

um i do try and say yes to people and help them out so what was happening to me at gravel was

we were flying we were like number one in the app store and all this stuff so the inbounds start coming like thick and fast right and so i was like

i can't do this the way i was doing it which is like all over the place i'll go to old street at 6 00 a.m

every single tuesday and wednesday um and between six and nine i'll do like sessions right

if you come meet me between that time and like your 45 minute slot i'll fit you in and then tuesday and

wednesday became tuesday to thursday and then before i knew i was doing it like almost every single day

trying to be so helpful and it was great because i i i get loads of energy from that right like

so much there's you know great quote of you know there's no such thing as altruism because you're ultimately doing it for yourself and i

believe that um however so it's like find your motivation and then turn it but i overdid it and so the result

the net result was like one day i woke up from my alarm trying to do it and i like basically couldn't move and that alarm basically you know kept

going for the next few days and i was like nope i just can't do it i can't go to work i can't get out of bed

it's really like it's really strange time but the thing that's really interesting to

me this time right so i analyzed that as partly burned out and i was trying to do too much to and

not spending enough time on myself not having any rest not being sensible about my personal space

and my life which was stupid but the kind of thing you learned the hard way quite often and then the other thing was obviously

like i was working on a business that i wasn't very happy and i was having more fun meeting these people and helping like make introductions than i was

working my own business now with heights you know very consciously aware of the opposite problem to be true so we just talked

about burnout from some of your insights right one of my fears from heights is you know

i won't see burnout coming because now i'm living my purpose now i am so passionate

i get so much motivation and pleasure from working on heights that i could do

this 24 7 um and i diarize stopping myself right i literally put in

my diary to stop like all my things rest naps peloton

like all of the things like i talked to you earlier about like my shakti meditation these things are in my diary

because if it's in my calendar i'm going to pay attention to it and i'm going to respect it and if i don't i won't respect my own boundaries because i know

that i'm intrinsically a bit of a workaholic and if i'm passionate you can't stop me so i have to stop myself

sure and knowing you know taking preventative measures towards things like burnout

if you are happy um i think has been a really like mature decision that i'm really proud of taking

this time around because it's a bit like the imposter syndrome right how am i going to overcome it i'll write a newsletter every week great i feel way

less like that now same thing burn out i don't feel like i'm going to get burned even though i've been sitting in my bedroom pitching you know

to investors like all of february and march like it's not a great existence because of lockdown and if i said you yeah listen

uh i'm the same i'm a workaholic and all these things i'm an entrepreneur i'm going to build a big business dan what is the one thing i can do to

avoid myself getting burnout what would you say that is you would say is diarizing and scheduling time

to do other things like you know i had near l on this podcast and he talked about he writes the book indestructible he

talks about how he will literally schedule time in his diary to see his to spend some time with his

partner and take his kids for a walk and and those kinds of things is that what you're saying you're saying yeah yeah

i mean i've got um i do have like a list of habits that i've created for myself and you know talking about habit

formation um terrible error everyone makes is like oh i'll listen to dan i'll do all of these you know habits no i

pick like one new one a year to be honest with you my number one mental health hack full stop

um that i say to everyone everyone always asks me my one thing mine's going for a walk um you know spending an hour or so

walking if you can do that without being distracted i mean i listen to podcasts and audio books but

i also go for some where i don't take anything with me and i just go for the walk um that's my number one health hack um

because it's not only good for your brain but good for your body and because it puts you into there's two

things one we live in london actually to be honest like gets way worse of rep about rain than you know you would think because i don't

go out with a raincoat most days um but even if it's raining you still go out and that's a great moment to just be

with the elements and accept that you know things aren't always perfect even the manifestation of rain you know it's a great moment to just go

out and be like things aren't perfect but i owe it to myself for my own rest and for my own space to

do this today and the other reason honestly is because on average i get to listen to about 50

books a year just by doing that one thing so as someone who's like a lifelong learner and happiest when i'm

learning the amount of books that i've devoured by stacking that you know habit onto my daily walk has

been the fastest way to grow yeah and so we talked about burn out there the next thing so and that's that

Anxiety

was during your time at gravel the next thing from that tweet was anxiety yeah so the anxiety and insomnia were

completely linked with each other so a really really fascinating experience

to me the most interesting of all of them really because at the time i got and so at the time i

got insomnia and this is when anxiety starts to build because anxiety does go with it insomnia

very well because uh you start to get scared of going to sleep which builds anxiety you can't really sleep when you've got anxiety so

it's like a self-fulfilling prophecy like every single night so i had insomnia for six months

and my symptoms were i'd go to sleep at midnight but i'd wake up at 2am and at 2am i was wide awake and there

was no going back to sleep whatsoever no matter what i did so this was a time when business was

going well i was pretty happy in life i was getting married um yes my dad had passed away but my mom

had just recovered from cancer so i'd had like the whole fear of her and she's already had it before and recovered once so very unlikely to

recover the second time but she had i have a roof over my head i practice gratitude you know like i am just that archetypal

[ __ ] that's just too smug for the world and i just suddenly

couldn't sleep and i was like i don't understand like i have everything that i wanted and i'm not i don't even want much

you know i've worked on that stuff so where has this come from and you know

basically chronic anxiety the feeling of chronic anxiety is lots of sweating lots of self-doubt

um lots of um almost like a bit of a personality change in me you know outwardly i'm

quite confident but you know this experience with anxiety was sort of really making me question everything about what i say

how i feel who i am and you know it was in this cycle where if i'm about

to go to sleep i'm not going to be able to go to sleep because of this you know these feelings of doubt

and stories i'm telling myself and it became this perpetual illness and by the way i tried so many things right because when

you say doubt yeah and the story self-doubt self-doubt about business self-doubt about business self-doubt

about who i am um and about why i'm feeling like this anxiety is such a complicated thing

because um you know there's a great uh i think it's by lao tzu the it's not a perfect um verbatim

quote but he said something like depression is a symptom of sadness for the past we've lived anxiety is obsession and confusion over

the future you're gonna have and that's why like mindfulness and being present is the antidote and i think i really resonate with that

because you know my own depression experience was loss of my father the past my anxiety was like the person

hey was anxiety about the night i night sleep i'm about to not have but also like you know who who am i

going to be what's going to happen how long can i live like this feels like it's self-fulfilling in a way as well exactly so the the truth is i tried all

these different things so like i went to i did therapy i did sleep therapy i used all the apps calm sleepio

i tried you know uh cutting out alcohol i tried drinking much more alcohol like i tried you know

like you name it i'd like not smoked weed for a while i was like right that's it getting a weed habit back you know like anything that you could

possibly do to just like stay zonked but i went to the doctor and he recommended me sleeping pills

but that really irked me i mean we just talked about lost connections johan hurry right um i don't appreciate medication

that will work that night as solving my problem and i'm smart enough to know that it wouldn't solve my problem it would just help me sleep that night

so i've still got those sleeping pills and i never use them and i kept on going for this journey the search for why

this was happening and it led me in the end to a dietitian which i'd never worked with before and by the way i didn't even know what a

dietitian was and heard of nutritionists because isn't that just everyone on instagram um but a dietitian

uh had no idea but it turns out a dietitian is basically a nutritionist with a scientific degree they can work

in the nhs and they work with sick people so if you have a sick problem like insomnia you go to a dietitian and they

will literally tell you medically what they can do to affect your

your experience and she just said to me um she basically asked me about what i was

eating and my habits and like all this kind of stuff and i told her and this is someone who i think i'm quite healthy generally speaking and she just said

um you're basically not getting enough brain food and i was like i don't even know what that means like i don't understand the context of that

statement and she was like well let me put it this way your brain is an organ right

it's 60 fat 90 of the fat in your brain is this one compound called dha and most

people that come to me with essentially mental health problems which is what you currently have have nutritional deficiencies and don't

realize there are three main things that i would recommend in your condition one is omega-3s the other is b vitamins

because again that's for energy so she explained that i'm having a spike at 2 am so i need that spike not to happen i

need to have like much more slow release of b vitamins in my energy supply in my body every day and then the third thing was blueberry

extract because it's an antioxidant and would help make lymphatic system whilst i slept right she's saying this stuff to me i'm like

so skeptical i can't even tell you not only not a supplement taker um but she's now recommending me three supplements and i've been given pills by

the doctor and i'm like i mean like come on how is this gonna be any better so you can imagine my complete and utter

surprise when i took those three things i mean they were very expensive they were like

medically prescribed ones so super potent from you know i think it was whole foods

or planet organic they were pricey but within two weeks i was sleeping like a baby and i wasn't i

wasn't feeling anxiety and when you have a moment like that in

your life and you know this because you're a deeply inquisitive person it makes you stop

and it makes you go hold on a second like this was so simply solved i don't

actually believe it to be true this must be placebo this must be finally my placebo that has caused this

um instead i did what i do i'm quite nerdy i started reading science papers because i kind of you know the one thing

i do hate on instagram is like everyone's a nutritionist everyone's at this everyone's at that i'm like i don't want to listen to some guy that

takes nootropics telling me about like my brain and mental performance i want to see what scientists that don't take any credit

actually have to say about this stuff and i learned that there are thousands literally of

science papers this is why i did the newsletter i knew i'd never run out of content it's like literally the deepest well of content

ever ever ever to do what i'm doing um there were thousands of science papers on all of these ingredients and

how they impact not just your mental health below the baseline so if you're suffering from insomnia if you're suffering from

anxiety even if you've got depression schizophrenia like so many medical papers scientific

journals sorry um about the impact of taking a high supplementation of xyz or obviously

much more food of that particular ingredient and the impact it's had and then when

you're at the baseline all of these examples about nutrition impacting your mental performance so this is things like decision making

focus energy like all of the things you we want in life right no one wants to really be recovering from a mental health problem they want to be

at their baseline and thriving and it just took me by so much surprise because i was like well if this isn't

like if this is so well known in science why didn't i know about it i was working in shoreditch

at a scaling startup like bearded glasses hipster [ __ ] like you know keto vegan like yes i've

heard of all of them um all my friends intermittent fast yada yada this is just like common sense brain

food why is that not a thing that people know about why is taking care of your brain not something

anyone's actually talked about clearly and actually found a really meaningful way

to communicate what that stands for and what science papers do really badly

is like you know when i synthesize them there's about two or three sentences that are saying the point but it's just

covered with jargon they're boring as [ __ ] um so i was like first step newsletter i will add some

Supplements & brand

emojis and some lols and make it millennial and fun and i will get people to read science papers without even realizing they're necessarily reading

them so every week you'll learn something from a scientific journal which i will link back to that you can click and by the

way no one clicks it and you can learn something that science says is good for your brain every week and that is essentially how the journey

with heights actually started with this like realization that something as

you know when you you know the beautiful moment in life where you can spot an opportunity so big

and actually solved by the power of communication and brand um you know a lot of people say brand

and comms that is not a market strategy that is not defensible

i think those people are idiots and the wrong market because you know my counter to that is do you

think that buddhist monks got everyone meditating or was it calm and headspace do you think that we

love to run because we watch the olympics or is it nike getting in our heads do you think that people around the

world are doing yoga because of like you know some ashram or do we actually think it's lululemon

brands create change in the world that we want to see and brands connect

with human beings and create communities and the power of social media and standing for something

is where brands take something that was always done before anyway stick a tick on a shoe it's still just a

shoe like lululemon like it's just like a little logo an omega logo on pants it doesn't matter the way that

you express what you do and why you do it is the thing that has the power to change and my opinion and my own experience of

being you know in that shoreditch hipster [ __ ] area where you just know about things

like early and trends to have never come into contact with something so important that can have such an impact as

nutrition and mental health nutrition and taking care of your brain to me felt like a calling right i've just

suffered for six months i've overcome something this is all i want to do with my life

and so you started heights and so i started heights how's it going great question we launched january the

6th in a pandemic well not in a pandemic yet i have to say you know i saw this on my facebook feed

and um i think i messaged you about investing in the company just because it was beautiful i saw the

branding on the website and the way that you'd done the website and i was like this team get branding and in the direct

to consumer world it's interesting what you were just saying there about comms and like the way that i hear it is like storytelling and

um platforms um enabling um

almost democratizing the access to like build great products now because back in like if we think about nike shelf space

or you think about the the you know the power that the unilevers have you're in fact not the war isn't always

storytelling and brand or comms it's in fact like knowing a guy or price points but in the direct to consumer social

media world brand and comms and storytelling can win and

product design exactly in product design which is a huge part of the story and that for me was beautiful so i i uh i was straight in there to try and

invest in your company and i mean you know you know for a fact that i've been taking heights ever since

january i think yeah yeah december maybe what's your experience been as a customer then i i love it and you know

this is and this is this is where i really this is why i always also really wanted to talk to you today so there is probably

several people on a spectrum of like you know devout um vitamin takers or and then there's

people that don't understand or believe in it yeah i was that yeah and so how do you confront the skepticism because with products like

this it is hard for the user to establish cause and effect and like there's other factors that

might happen in my life that may cause an effect almost in establishable so like say i take my i

take the the heights for one week straight but in that week i have just the worst mental health week because of other

factors how do i know so i guess it yeah it's a great question i think there's two parts to this right

so one is um like supplements deserve a bad rep this is the most important thing to address

first and foremost because when i went i was like why is she giving me this like prescribed stuff i kind of just go to holland and barrow or boots and just buy

the things that she says there um it turns out there's this weird marketing thing in supplements where

you can put a minimum in so there's the amount according to science that will have an impact on your body brain whatever and then there's a marketing amount

which is way lower that you're allowed to put in on that product so if you say like vitabiotics or you know a lot of products there's an

asterisk on those boxes they're legally obliged to tell you tiny small print on the back that

what you're taking is actually a fraction of the daily amount that you're meant to have according to science but marketing wise they can say promotes

healthy this promotes healthy that um you know my favorite story on this is probably uh seven seas the biggest amiga

right because we all grew up as children our parents give us seven cs and you know that's the biggest amiga three brand in the whole entire world

now every single day according to science we're meant to have a minimum like an rda if you will

250 milligrams of omega-3s right you can get it from your food or you can get it from these pills

as a safety net it's essentially what a supplement is right is if you're not getting the food supplement not instead of don't take

supplements instead of eating they're supplements so it's like a safety net now that 250

milligrams the minimum you can put in is 45 milligrams so guess how much seven seas put into

their number one best-selling product 45 on the dot and that means you have to take seven c's for six days straight

just to get one day's worth of the scientific dose you're meant to get but it's all small print and a consumer

doesn't see that and supplements for whatever reason have been able to do that so when we went into our supplement design

right this was the awesome thing me and my business partner joel came from a tech background at this point right we've done user experience

we've done all this stuff and we are very much into this idea of because we're not from this space we're going to win because we are going to

approach this completely differently a we start with community building a newsletter and an audience asking questions to that audience about

what we should do and how we should do it and can we see how they behave so here are the things that we learn most people like a lot of people are

super open-minded about taking supplements starting supplements right the problem with supplements is it can be very difficult

to feel the impact or know they're working and so like a lot of things with prevention and well-being in general it's a commitment to the person you want

to become more so than it is like a medication which cures a problem and you're like oh that got fixed that's great that's

over so you know we got really fascinated by this idea of like how can you help

people build habits with our product design how can we overcome this problem that supplements have the you know in january massive

surge loads of people start but very few people continue if you can get past the hurdle of someone trying something your job as an

entrepreneur is to figure out how to make them a real customer not just a first-time buyer um you know

you talked about that bottle that bottle was designed with our newsletter audience by going into

people's homes and asking them very weirdly and quite often the wives show us what you do with your supplements

and everyone has these supplement cupboards because we neither of us were supplement takers before like we even started this right so we didn't know what normal behavior

was which means you get to ask these great open questions which is where you get the best answers so like everyone has a supplement

covered reason they all look the same and what happens is psychologically and we got told this

the whole time people basically open their cupboards see so many that are like broken promises at the time they promised they

were going to start and didn't continue i feel attacked yeah they feel guilty they feel guilty and they're like well i

can't just take the vitamin c because i said i'd take d i said i take that and everything else and they're always separate so people just give up and you know

there's two things to that there's one there's sort of like guilt about the promises that you were like with the person you wanted to be and then the second is just again you

know it's set and setting or you know out of sight out of mind so but

also for me it's i will complete you completely right i'll commit to what this person that i want to be which is

i'm going to develop this new healthy habit which involves me taking zinc every morning or whatever i do it for three days and if you look

at that you know famously but maybe miss attributed quote from einstein doing the same thing over and over again and insanity yeah and not

getting and getting the same results i'll take zinc for three days and because i can't see a difference

it's much like going to the gym for a lot of people although you do eventually see a difference with the gym and the great thing about when you get to the gym is you get the pump

and you use a little bit of sweat so you think something's going on when i take my zinc

nothing next day nothing no so it's almost like a belief and uh and that's i think what i've

struggled with historically so here's here's the thing so like we hear this kind of stuff with heights and we

we love this because it's like opportunity right it's like challenging opportunity that's how everyone did it well that's

dumb we're gonna do it better so like our first thing was um the number one reason most people do not continue is because they forget

out of sight out of mind so we designed a bottle that passed the wife test that wives were like yes i'd put that on my bedside

table or yes i'd have that out in my living room like you've just done right you've got your bottle there but there's no other supplements there it's because it

looks nice and because it makes you feel good because you're looking after your brain and it's there it's like virtue signaling exactly it's actually signaling to

yourself completely i'm the kind of guy that looks after myself i look after my most important organ and

this is my symbol of doing that so that was like an important first step then you know the capsules themselves

are in like patented clever capsules so you've seen like there's omega-3 on the outside the nutrients on the inside that's

important because we learned that lots of people take supplements at different times of the day ritualizing when you build a habit

is really important so if we could make these that you don't have to have them with food like you do with most supplements

because of the absorption the absorption happens because the dha omega-3 on the outside is fat

when this when this dissolves in your gut the new literally the capsule dissolves the outer capsule with the inner capsule at the same time the

nutrients have been dissolved in fat that is the same effect as what you get from food so those capsules have been designed

also around habits to help people pick a time and you know a lot of people don't eat breakfast right and so they just end up

forgetting their supplements full stop so we did it so that you can start the same time so you get ritualized like

with by having the bottle out and you see it and then the most important part which is communication

so we actually have something like a brain health score essentially it's like an algorithm put together by a couple of neuroscientist phds

and you take it before you start and again we do a 15-day check-in and then before

we send you your next month because it's a subscription through the letterbox before we send you your next month we ask you to take it again

now what happens for most people in the first month let's be real right like you just said you know

scientifically typically speaking this product will last will take three

months for you to feel anything like all supplements so it's a bit of a long game right you have to believe in

that now in the first month for you to feel an impact maybe you will because where your

nutritional levels were coming from and your mental state was coming from but maybe you won't so how can we help nudge you there well we can give you

awareness so yeah so we sent people that this brain health survey right and you know self-administering but it gives you a bit of a baseline

a score at the end of like you know where you are right now and then we start sending you coaching comms like very short emails

and snappy bits of information about how to take care of your brain that you might not have thought about things that are really small little habits that you can

build in and people start to read them they have an unbelievably high open rate because

you've just taken the first step to choosing to look after your brain so from that point on why wouldn't you

read the emails of the thing that's coaching you to do those habits and what we find is in the first 25 days or something

like 90 i think it's more than that like 93 of people have improved their brain health score on a self-administered

basis from paying attention right not from the vitamins not from anything else but suddenly

they're interacting with the brand they're and they're welcoming a brand into their life whose sole focus is about how you can take care of your

brain you've got all these really interesting very very respected people just helping to coach you on your

journey um and that is such an important part of this

because you do have the disbelief in the first couple of months right and people like to be able to see and

measure improvements and that's hard to do instantly with supplements but it isn't hard to affect

how someone feels and help encourage them to make changes in their own lifestyle that will make them feel better that is the brand's

responsibility and that's our responsibilities that's what we work quite hard on so where i'm really passionate about building this brand is

as a community it started as a newsletter community is everything to me bringing people along on this journey of brain care and

understanding why it's important you know the amount of money that we spend on skin care or hair care every day but nothing on brain care the most

important organ in our body is so completely normalized in society to have skin care

and hair care rituals and budgets in households but not for our brains and so you going

How do you find the guts to keep going despite failure?

back to the business side of things um you started grabbing yeah didn't go well yeah and you were an estimation of

it you said you know you struggled with fears of failure and it failed one i was when you were talking about imposter

syndrome and when you and and when you're talking about some sort of confidence issues around putting yourself out there

all of those things seem to sit in contrast to something else you said which is

that you're the type i think this is a not a verbatim quote but you said it earlier on you said you're the type of

person that's just going to keep starting and you know you're going to fail potentially and that seems like someone that's high confidence and very very self-assured

and is not scared at all and then the other side of you seems like someone that is

the antithesis of that so i'm wondering how you you kind of like content because i i do believe that you will

save that god forbid not that i believe in god as you know now um but you believe in forbid

yeah i believe in forbid forbid um heights doesn't go to plan um reaches its lows yeah that's another

way of saying it you will start another business at some point based around something else how do you find the guts

to keep going despite failure and i'm guessing maybe it speaks

to your motivations as to why you wanted to be an entrepreneur in the first place right i'm intrinsically motivated by

growth and learning so the way that i like to think of myself is oh someone else said this to me and i

just i thought it was so poetic and i was so impressed with her for using these words which is like a lifelong intern

um you know this was a founder she'd gone to stanford had a really successful career and then she basically coming to intern at

heights for a few months and i was like you know like i talked to you about i did that in other companies as well but it was

interesting to me to find someone else that did that and i was like i mean like you know i could learn from you rodney the other way around she's like

i'm a lifelong intern everywhere i go i'm a lifelong intern and i'm like i talk about myself as a lifelong

learner but lifelong intern was like even more powerful right i was like wow that's you know it's a real mindset towards you

know um redefining what success is yeah because as long as you're learning well

not you i as long as i am learning i am fulfilled and i think we all have this like one

thing we know to be true about ourselves right um starting a business is super hard right and you know

i'm like i say not a nutritionist not neuroscientist had no experience in the space have never launched a vertically

integrated supply chain like from three different countries our ingredients come to from 10 different countries

because we literally source the highest quality so the omega-3 comes from like canada and the blueberries come from italy like

nuts but all of that stuff it's so exciting to learn and like the

the opportunity to learn all of these things are new gets me out of bed and so the whole like

failing and starting again you know that's got nothing to do with you know confidence or lack of or

anything it's got absolutely everything to do with knowing where i'm in my uh sweet spot

there's a term that i learned years ago that sums it up so perfectly which is icky guy are you familiar with japanese

guy that's me i'm living my icky guy right now what is it guy uh so icky guys japanese term

um basically looks like a venn diagram on a venn diagram right so you're at the center and then the different aspects of things

like you know what makes you happy what makes other people happy what makes you money what makes other people fulfilled

it's like ticking off all of these things and it's like if you can find that where you are in the center and you could say

am i contributing to society yes am i waking up every morning fulfilled yes am

i mentally challenged yes it's like ticking off all of these things it's like this weird flower you should definitely check out for people watching

and listening to this podcast on youtube i will put the ikigai graph on the screen now yeah it's amazing it's

amazing and and you know and i come back to it all the time you know i had my honeymoon in japan because of uh discovering ikigai really because i'm

like so you know i'm very spiritual yeah well i had a spiritual wedding in ibiza and then i

did my my honeymoon in japan and you know it was all it was like hikes and spiritual searches and stuff and

you know there's another fantastic uh japanese proverb which is uh literally translated as fall seven

rise eight but what it means is like if you fall down seven times rise up the eighth and you you we talked about success and failure

just in that moment and you said that i think you immediately defaulted to talking about

the purpose which was you love progression sort of intellectual progression growth

and learning and it almost seems to me that one of the ways to escape from the fear of failure

if you even think about what happened at grabble the faith you describe that as a failure one of the ways to escape from the from

ever failing again is by redefining what success is redefining what failure is and it sounds

like you've almost redefined success now as growth and learning and you and you won't fail at that even if the company

goes down right so this is like it's almost like you've developed a strategy somehow not to be able to fail again because failure

now isn't losing the company it's losing your per losing your way like you did with grabling becoming someone you're not and being

extrinsically motivated and it's exactly that and you know i think the opportunity

that we all have as human beings to be creative is to certainly accept that things are not

going to go on a straight path but you know when when confronted with these

like horrible moments of like things like failure and everyone else thinking that you're a failure

blow gets softened a lot when you get to reflect and think about what you learned you know really interesting experience

that uh joel and i did after failing was we went to uh business psychologists

and we had a facilitated sessions over the course of a week with the this was your fault that was my

fault i take blame for this i blame you for that letting it all out right and then we spoke about you know what

our we did personality tests and we looked at where our crossovers were and we had like for the first time a real clear view of strengths and weaknesses gaps

and could map out some of the poor mistakes and decisions that we'd made that led to failure and

interestingly like you know rehiring in in heights this time the thing that we've had for the last

year before we had any employees was a set of company values and hiring processes and all sorts of

like interview tips and hiring docs based on our values before we hired our first person we must have had them for

nine to 12 months because we were so certain of understanding who we are and what we

stand for being the company values and that those company values lead to hiring the right

people with the right mindset and that those people are the greatest leverage you could have as a founder to do less of the stuff

yourself and enable brilliant people to take it forward um i think that's probably the one of the

most important things i've done in my life with spending time on company values with a business partner by

identifying gaps weaknesses and spending time hearing

my failings from my best friend so much of what was true um that i

demonstrated a lack of focus um i'd been overly honest right so i hadn't picked my moments he's like you

know i appreciate a very like transparent person but you know but you know he's like you know you don't have to like tell an investor to their face

that you don't buy into the business that they've given you money for like you could have a filter if things like that then

this is this this is the behavior was the most hurtful thing he said i think the most the most hurtful thing

that he said was that um you know he felt that i had um not

not contributed 50 50 right and that i had like an almost

irresponsible attitude towards what i was trying to get out of the business compared to what he

needed to get out of the business and that was a really meaningful start for us to decide on the next business too

because what he meant by that was joel is like a very intelligent person so he is motivated

by challenge if something is hard to fix right then he'll find a way to fix it

that is like he'll get up in the morning for that i won't um i'm motivated by making an impact and

feeling like i'm having a difference and telling a story and impacting people and then telling me that you know that made them feel this

way that is like all emotion for me right here's pure like logic and challenge so

by me you know constantly discrediting the work that we were doing by saying things like that right by

being too open and honest about my purpose and not putting on the filter i was literally without care or remorse

making fracturing yeah fracturing what he believes in and his ability to succeed and his ability to tell his own

story about the hard work he put in and i think all of those things were true i'd say that it was

60 40 if i was being brutal to myself 70 30 like you know the success of our last company

on him and to be honest like a lot of the failure was related to me and i personally don't regret any of it and i

really don't believe he does either but being able to say this stuff to each other with a

letter to all out that then also gave me the confidence to say like joel came up with like two or three business ideas

before like heights and we were like figuring out what we want to do i was just like no mate i'm going to do the same thing again i don't care about that thing

yeah but it's really exciting i'm like it's not to me right no one is going to have their health or

mental health impacted that i feel like that's my space that's where i want to be so really really enabled us to just you

know look at my mistakes of the past and my character and say if you want to work with me you know that i'm going to have to work

Relationships

on something i feel purposeful about that otherwise this is non-negotiable for me otherwise we'll repeat history

and you've got another partner in your life which is your uh your wife um when did you get married

what age uh well two years ago i got married two and a half years ago when did you meet her

ah well uh do you know the story at all no i don't know okay fine fine so technically speaking i met her

at 18 on the khosan road for one night uh but i didn't sleep with her uh in thailand okay um in bangkok i

didn't sleep with her but i tried to chat her up and stuff and it was a straight up no right um so she's she was best friends with my business

partner joel's sure best mate a cousin sorry so anyway the point being um that's how we met her originally and

i'd like you know sent some very awkward facebook wall messages when that was a thing like you know trying to chat

over the years it was always annoying um and then at like 30 or 31 like on my birthday um

joel basically reintroduced us and i was like i'm having a party why don't you just come etc and she's older than me right she's two

years older than me so i was a bit like you're 32 i'm 30. you're a bit too old to pick right now your mates are married i literally gave her all the banter i

was like your mates are married you're running out of options i'm still available you know let's do it you're not going to do any of that yeah

she found it hilarious anyway she did she did um come join me at drinks and like the rest is history and actually

our relationship's been super interesting because we spent the first year um not monogamous

um we spent the first year openly so we spent the first year openly communicating that we'll sleep

with other people but they were all like more like one night stands whereas we were like coming back to each other which was interesting because

she's just like hilarious really good fun really funny and so i enjoy hanging out with her but it's

very clear like you're not my girlfriend and she was like great i'm not your boyfriend no problem we did that for a whole year

why were you saying that why were you not um yeah because i like loads of reasons like one is like i'd come out of

a horrible relationship the last time where i i wasn't treated particularly nicely and i just didn't didn't make me want to get

married for sure um and i told my mom and her that i wouldn't get married incidentally um so i was like i don't

believe in marriage and i don't really believe in monogamy and like those are my beliefs i told you about this book sex at dawn i highly

recommend you read it so i had been telling myself the story that this wasn't going to happen so you were rejecting her

kind of in a way and protecting myself absolutely um and you know i think that was mutual for

whatever reason for for a year and actually after a year you know we had that awkward conversation i almost

like where she actually you know said like what are we gonna do like this is getting like a bit silly now you know i'm getting on i'm like 75 now

i need to get married um and um and so i said you know i almost said no

they there and then i said let me sleep on there and i was about to say no but then all my friends were basically like you know she's literally wicked like why

on earth would you do that to yourself like what have you got to lose and from that point of saying yes and

being in a relationship with her i proposed to her the like it's six months later and we got married a year

later so it was actually a really short relationship you're on meeting to marriage you you met when you're 33 now yeah you met her

at 30. yeah so you proposed when you were 31 yep and okay so you've been together for two

years now yeah and so i always find it super fascinating when i meet an entrepreneur that's super

busy and you know in love with their business and their ideas and and is a workaholic on to some degree how they manage to keep

their relationship balanced because i haven't figured it out yet yeah and i

i take the faces that i've gone through different sort of levels of immaturity in my life so the first phase was um meeting great

people meeting a great girl and thinking to myself you need to wrap your life around me

i'm not going to change a thing about myself i'm the most important thing in the world the world revolves around me you're welcome to

join the orbit but i'm not going to change at all didn't go well

unsurprisingly and then like trying to find a little bit of um compromise

somewhere in me um but still being ruthlessly apologetic didn't go well um and now i'm at a place where i'm

currently single completely single and i need the answers i i'm less

i don't want to be one of these [ __ ] [ __ ] narcissists that i just read about one in the newspaper i won't say any names martin sorrell um

and what i've what i read about people i think it was his ex-wife that described him was very very similar to the behavior

that i'm exhibiting which is this kind of self-centeredness that excludes everybody but ultimately

will run the risk of actually being self-harm when i make myself lonely and miserable um because i don't appreciate the value

of a relationship so i want you to help me with the answer well let me tell you i told myself the

narrative that being in a relationship i don't have time to be in a relationship right

um that's my narrative um being married and all of these things

will close opportunities down to me and my life will be worse for it um and

that's fine those are stories and like everything you know we convince ourselves of all sorts of stories and i do believe in you know finding

um not just the one but ones i really don't believe that there's one person for you in the world i believe

there's many and i think having a spiritual connection with others and you know for some people like a sexual connection

with multiple partners i think that this stuff is totally acceptable a b completely

biological like biologically scientifically more normal for us

than monogamy which is essentially because of christianity in the world

and and frankly you know even though it's not what i do with my wife currently we've had conversations about

you know in five years or in ten years right if we weren't sleeping together because we weren't finding ourselves like you know

sexually attractive or whatever at that point you know would we consider having the conversation like opening up our

relationships huh can i ask you that question yeah yeah i'm not answering it almost now

which is like yes we would we would do that and would you be comfortable with her sleeping with other men that's very different question because

uh right now no future me maybe um logically right logically if i took

emotion out of it absolutely because if i didn't want to at that point sleep with my wife it would not be fair

to deprive her of sex because of how i was feeling and so i think having a maturity towards

your relationships and to all relationships is so important and a lot of

you know what really upsets me like so many people get divorced um one of the most common reasons people

get divorced is because they cheat and you can avoid that by having a conversation like i still love you

and i still think everything i already always did think about you but for whatever reason the sexual

attraction has gone and either we are going to work on that together or we should explore other options and

like everything in life steve the most uncomfortable conversations are the ones you need to have

so i think a really smart way and i would say this because you know i'm

doing it but i think a smart way to approach your relationship is like you approach your business

so you set out a vision for your relationship and you say this is what we want to be

and where we want to be in 50 years what does that look like um you know recently

i did this with my wife we were in portugal we were with some friends i told you i was working in portugal for

a month during lockdown um we were staying in like a villa with some friends and like we'd kind of been okay in lockdown but like now she's

around other people she's being a cervix snappy like kind of [ __ ] we were just getting on each other's nerves and i went for like

a long walk on the coast with her and i was just like where's this coming from like five wise right why are you doing that why are you doing that but

why are you doing that right and we got kind of got to the crux of the issue um you know these are things that i'm

annoying about and what i do that irritate her and obviously like these are things you do and it's like okay let's take a break from like

right now the things that are annoying us about each other let's flip the script in 50 years what

are the things that we're going to be saying doing and believing about why we love each other what does that look like

so like literally let's imagine in the future how we are and work back from there so objective right a long happy and

fulfilling marriage so you know you might be familiar with okrs so objectives and key results

we implement them at heights as a startup but also melissa she's the um director of operations for europe

middle east and africa for vice and she put okrs into vice so we're both fan of the system right and

the system is literally this is the objective you're trying to get to these are some measurable key results that would have to happen for us to achieve the

objective so we decided to try and apply this framework to our marriage right what is the objective a long

sustainable happy and fulfilling marriage what are the key results that get us there well we broke them down into mind

body and soul right and from there you get to cascade down these key results right so

they start to say a little bit like okay so mind for me meditation is really important for her you know she doesn't really want to do

it but like from a compromise point of view because she knows that i believe in it and stuff she'll do it with me similarly you know from a mind point of

view she wants to be heard right so how about um you know we will ask each other how our days are

but systematically as a habit right we'll build it as a habit another one was you know we'll teach you some

each other something new every day so we're always growing these kinds of things literally became

a habit tracker list that we fill in in our journal every single night did i teach melissa something new today

did i um ask her how her day was did we have sex were we intimate right were we cuddling

and you know spending time did i have personal space because really important to have space away from your partner these literally become habit trackers

that if you think about it really methodically you know did we exercise for 30 minutes a day these things

if you do them you know the compound gains of the results you get in a marriage if we're literally doing these

things together if i'm asking how her day is and i'm listening if i'm

spending time like learning something new to teach her because i want to and she'll reciprocate the same

it will literally create these moments where we're not in our work and we're not doing other things we're

doing this with each other and they don't have to take very long but they are like things that we've taken personal responsibility for

to achieve it's it's people some people a certain type of person will listen to that and they'll think to themselves

how robotic how robotic and you know i had the same conversation with near il who came on this podcast yeah

and he's the king of this stuff right yeah and he talked about how he literally schedules time to be with his wife and to you know to see the kids and to play

with the kids and a certain type of person listening will think well that takes the specialness and the magic and the

spontaneity out of just like living and being you know free to go in whatever direction and it

also when you listen to that you that you start to think about how

us as humans have over this is potentially a thought over

organized and over routine and really over thought every facet of our life and one of the things that i

have a sometimes a bit of a visceral bad reaction to is like and you would have heard about

all this stuff that you know the 10 habits of highly successful entrepreneurs you got to get out of bed drink the green tea do the yoga write in

your diary do 10 star jumps then call your mum until you love her and and it gets to the point that it's one of mine to be fair

yeah every day if you listen to all of this stuff your day would literally be completely

unconscious it would be what's the next thing in my list of how to be a good human and so how do you kind of contend that

rigidness with creating space for lack of rigidness and just [ __ ]

seeing where the wind takes you is a great question in my experience so far this particular bit of rigidness has

created more space not less space for me interesting um and the reason is because if you

think about the opposite of this right so if you don't do some of this stuff if you don't

i mean there's so many examples that are like filling my head right now so if i don't ask my wife how her day is

regularly if i don't exercise regularly if i don't you know meditate every day this is me personally right

okay what are the outcomes of that my wife is not going to feel listened to we might end up in an argument how much not how much time does the argument take

up how much mental energy after the argument's over is going to distract me from all the other things i could do that day right

the things i wish i hadn't said like all of the things right call that day a write-off maybe a couple of days

right that takes up loads of time if i don't meditate every single day i have a very loud mind i'm much slower at

making decisions in general right so it is actually taking up more time to not build that habit in for myself but don't

go for my daily walk personally a i'm not making time to read listen and learn so therefore my

personal growth as a human being is slowing down because i really believe that you know the way that i can build a

better life for myself is funneling wisdom into myself choosing what i read and choosing who i listen to and

choosing what i believe to an extent right i love reading counter views to stuff like i'm a lefty i love

i follow loads of conservatives and right-wing republicans because it's healthy for me but i'm choosing to funnel stuff

into my life so again by not doing that i could be more aimless and more free

and i wouldn't necessarily be following the path to making better decisions as a human being which also speeds things up

if i don't call my mom every day she will call me up and ask me why i don't love her which will make me feel like [ __ ]

for three days so i actually find that this stuff in in my you know again not exercising you

know you don't have to ritualize half an hour five days a week like i have in my diary right but if i don't i actually start to

feel achy i start judging myself you think about these things like actually they

create time they don't take away um in my experience and that's exactly what nier said which is that

you know he's he's planning his time so that he has more time to do the things intentionally that he wants to do i my

last question on the relationship point is about bringing your problems home and how you've kind of because this is

one of the big problems i have as well is along with the like selfishness around my business being the most important

thing sometimes is how do you

not bring your problems home but then also like not make her feel lonely when she sat

right next to you by being off with the fairies and you know i was reading um elon's book the book written about

elon musk and it talked about how he would you know come home and be you know a little bit of a recluse even though everyone's around him and he's in

his head and he's just focused on his problems his life he's working incredibly hard to the point he's sleeping on the floor how have you

managed to find the balance in the relationship um is it just the okay ours is there does she unders does

she get it yeah i think i'm lucky like a she gets her and b she enjoys her personal space

and she's super busy as well and she's super busy as well right yeah exactly and we have you know she's got scale up

she's running a big company like she only reports the ceo so she's got a lot of responsibility does sometimes it go in the opposite

direction as well where you're not getting enough out of her in terms of attention no i think we're both really

lucky like we both like our own company and we both like each other's company so you know you can kind of be happy either

way if you're lucky enough to learn what you like and how to be with yourself which takes

quite a lot of learning a lot of us are very dependent on other people um and if i was still completely dependent on my wife's attention and my

wife like in general then i might be like that but i've come to learn you know how to listen to myself how to

make time for myself how to spend time enjoying being on my own as well

and i think that's a really important skill to learn because otherwise i think the answer would be true and i think you know she's got the same

which is you know i'll listen to podcasts about performance and habits and stuff and

she'll listen to case file on repeat oh my god is she a case firefighter oh man if i hear that australian pricks

absolutely one more time oh my god i've listened to every episode there's a uk one called they walk amongst her i'm obsessed with true crime

yeah so is she so obsessed well listen it doesn't work out yeah exactly exactly yeah yeah she makes me watch

true crime stuff on netflix and it freaks me out i have this really bad habit of because i can't sleep without listening to something

yeah so i'll be it'll be 2 a.m in the morning just got in bed with my partner or whoever i'm with

and i'll say do you mind if i just put on a a murder podcast yeah about like a

serial rapist yeah and then like every single i keep asking the question but the answer is always saying

steve babe it's 2 a.m i don't want to listen to a story about a serial rapist right now

while i'm closing my eyes in the dark [ __ ] so i i get my phone or my airpod and i put it in one ear where they can't

hear it and that's how i fall asleep yeah so she's exactly the same and she like she you know we actually i mean it's

i find it so interesting you know she will make me watch these things on netflix because she's like but it's so

interesting right but actually they really they actually quite damaged my mental health because you know you see things like you know

but that husband loved that wife so much like why does he end up killing those two daughters and his wife oh you're talking about america

yeah the most recent one but like there's you know all of them you know at the end of the day like why someone goes from you know lovely

and humane and kind and wonderful and all the things i like to believe about people in the world to that terrifies me really so it has it

has and this almost what you've just said then sent my mind back to the start of this conversation about

religion and belief and purpose and and what you know before when i was holding they're usually religious even more

terrifying yeah yeah but this the reason i find it so fascinating is because it gets to the truth in human

beings which is something that i know we're both deeply interested in which is like finding the true nature of humans and in the example we've talked

about there in america murderer that by the way because i'm such a nut i'd read that story i'd watched documentaries on

it three four five years ago so seeing on netflix and their depiction of it was fascinating but there you have

just the perfect perfect example of how um unboxable and unpredictable

human nature can be when forces like infidelity and love and um a normal person the fact that a

normal person can go from being this lovely dad who was quite placid to smothering his own children and an

affair teaches you something valuable about the nature of being human and um and for me that is like awesome

that is awesome oh and and that's why i think i'm so obsessed with those things is they teach you

the lessons in a violent emotional gripping way about the true nature of

being human yeah i mean she feels the same way whereas i'm just like you know it just plays on my mind really

it plays my mind to the idea of like well that could happen to me then that's why because i'm like i'm so kind

loving you know full of you know good energy but so was that guy in that example so was that guy so so is

every review of what that guy was like from all of his friends and everything else so how can that happen to a person and this

is the fascinating thing which for sure he met someone else clearly he was he was he was in a marriage

which had lost its passion yeah a loveless marriage he decided to stay probably for the sake of the kids he

decided comfort over a decision which he probably should have uh made a tough decision which he should have made in the short term for the long

term good and it caught up with him and for me that's like isn't that life where you suppress making a short-term tough decision but

that comes back to exactly what i was saying right which is yeah that comes back to the relation no it comes back to setting

a vision for your relationship and you know having a plan and talking about in advance right you

know if you're really smart you'll talk in advance what happens if one of us cheats what happens in this scenario right what

would happen if we fell out of love and you know there's no point like you know planning the perfect life if you

don't crisis plan the things that happen to all human beings and if you've got a great relationship

with your partner i think it's so valuable to treat it like you would your business which is scenario planning spending some time

talking about what would we do in this kind of crisis and how would we behave because by doing that with my wife like

i you know we've got permission to bring up that horrible conversation right like in theory that that would never happen to me because if i

wanted to cheat on her i'd have the conversation with her and i've got permission to have that conversation because we've talked about it

i thought you meant that like i want to murder you tonight conversation no i probably wouldn't tell

her it'd be a nice surprise um but you know what i mean isn't like you know there's permission in our

relationship to address the difficult things and that's why in some respects you know i treat my marriage like i treat my

business which is you know something that i deeply care about if it's successful

and everything that i put into my life is about making these things successful

to the best of my ability and what i've learned is doing those things from a sense of

vision and clarity and communication and values as well because you're talking about transparency and you know

honesty and exactly i i am as a when i started dating you know i was

like 18 years old whatever i thought that i was looking for i had a checklist if you said steve what's your type i'd be like okay the

brown hair the this that this they want to look like this they want to talk like this and this list was almost like it was

endless right of like little specific superficial things i was looking for in a partner and after a couple of you know bad

relationships and bad experiences and maturity and self-awareness and understanding myself i got close i was like what are the

fundamentals what are the like the unnegotiable things that i can't be without and where i'm at now and i kind of want to get your take

on this and see if it resonates at all with you is i have three things that are like fundamentals that i need

to fill so the first one i've kind of defined as they need to be intellectually stimulating to me which you can say you know

being able to have a conversation being able to um yeah like release my mind or else i'll

almost i feel like i'll get a mental um disorder if i can't release my thoughts because you know we're very

similar people in terms of our cognition the next for me is sexual attraction

i used to think it was like they they're pretty they're hot but i realize that sexual attraction is much different to

be than being pretty in the mind of the world and the third thing is um i would hope that they would make me a

better person and you i'm that's intentionally broad that could be a spiritual thing it could

be helping me become a better ceo in my business better at my podcast or whatever so those are my three things

intellectually stimulating sexually attractive and they make me a better person however you want to define

that what are yours well i have to say sexual attraction is such an important

thing to me in general but what i've learned is and you learn this a lot the more you read about relationships

that is actually something that wanes for everyone doesn't mean it will go and it doesn't

mean you won't be attracted to your wife or your husband or anything like that but it wanes and you as a human being

become less sexual the older you get right that's just biology so

i've learned not to make that one of the most important things on the basis of i wouldn't say it's the most important

thing purely on the basis of um i'm more likely to fall out of love with the

person that i'm with if one like you just said they don't intellectually challenge me

second one again like you said like they have to help me grow in some respect or certainly be with me on the journey

because in a you know in a lot of relationships including my marriage like i am the one forcing a lot

of the growth but i'm like that and i can be quite irritating to be around because like i

just always want more growth more this more that that book this podcast some people just want to chill out and that's good for me as well

right as in that is growth being pushed back and being like exactly dressed stop here you know she's the one who's like you're

doing too much you've got to stop like read this book i read an amazing book called rest by alex song yam ping i think his name

is um brilliant book much better than why we sleep and all the other ones that you would read about this stuff

and really really helped me grow by realizing recharging is such a humongous part

with that third point and like think about it it was a it was one person i was with that would stop me working yeah and she

would make me realize the value of everything else but work so she'd be like let's go to this garden

which is something steve would never usually choose to do yeah but when she took me my life was better

and so i think when people think growth they think oh like clapping at the back when you're i'm like no take me out of my world and

show me something else that'll add value to my life that i wouldn't ordinarily pursue and how much more productive you are as

a person as well when you've got space and time and you've had thoughts there's a reason why thoughts come to us in the shower or on

walks right it's because you're literally scientifically speaking your default mode network your dmn in

your brain is being activated by that moment of rest so you know it is neuroscientifically

true there's loads of studies on it but it's hard in the moment when you're people like us to take the rest and so having like you

know a partner that's there that forces it on you as a culture like you know almost every single evening now i don't do any work

which is so different to me but like last night we watched the mask together right like we will watch something like you know trashy fun

whatever but it's like not work laptop down we're eating dinner we're chilling out and it's like a rule

and you know i have to have a very good reason to break that rule and it's made me a happier healthier person but

you know without that guard rail i would just carry on working and you talked about the sexual point there i want to say a very personal

story that i've never shared before about why that made my made my list and this is a dynamic list that's changing as i mature

i met a girl that was the other two so i met a girl that was the most intellectually stimulating person i've

ever met she was actually a model so she's absolutely gorgeous she's also like a just a genius and she

she challenges me with a sense of like like she doesn't care who

i am or what i've done in my life or what i've achieved um and so that made me a better person

she was an absolute genius and she was gorgeous went to have sex with her after you know two months of you know

fumbling hot air balloons and all of this stuff i'm really hoping she isn't listening but the whole point of this podcast is

to be honest so and it just wasn't there the first time ever in my life and i experienced

what i can only describe as a feeling of like horror um total disappointment not with her or

anything like that but that that was the thing yeah and it felt like such a pathetic thing to stand

in the way of someone that i thought was perfect so and i got out of bed i tried again i tried again i tried to get over a couple

of days and i realized that it wasn't there and i got out of bed and i remember a text my best friend i said i could never see her again because this

is something that i didn't realize is actually so important to to a relationship even though it sounds pathetic when you saw

they weren't good in bed but they were perfect in every other way it sounds pathetic but it was the truth

and that's what made my list my other my other thing is sense of humor yeah so you know one of our company

values is have a sense of humility a sense of humor and humility because we jam sort of too and in the same one but

i believe so strongly in that which is work can be very serious life can be

very serious um but finding moments to connect

and laugh i mean so good for your brain but just so good for your

soul um you know spending every day with my wife in lockdown right

you know just us two etc etc like thank god we make each other laugh you know like we we have we both have a

very similar very dark sense of humor um you know one of our things is actually um

my when we fought on our first date um i brought up my dead dad and how actually one of my favorite

things to do in like social situations is to bring up my dead dad to make other people feel awkward

um just like because it's like kind of funny anyway she was like oh my god i do that about my dad and it turns out that her dad had died like a year after mine

or whatever so we um as like our second date or something we decided to go out on

father's day together without our fathers and everyone else just had their dads around we went to the hoxton hotel

and they came over they're like would you like the father's day menu we're like i know our dads are dead thanks and just literally like found it the

funniest thing that only us two would find so funny right because it's just so uncomfortable for everyone else but

to ask that kind of like dark humor like ways to connect and like weirdness that other people

it's like you're connecting on your pain as well because people [Music]

yeah and like how many of like you know comedy greats are you know coming suffering yeah not just suffering but also coming

from huge places of insecurities as well and that's their platform to bring on so i think those things all really match up

but by 100 i think you know finding someone who makes you laugh and gets your quirks so so so important

because humans are weird um i think it's lovely if you can be your fullest

weirdest self in front of other people are you happy yeah i was thinking about

Are you happy?

this question um the other day someone asked me two answers to that one yes i am happy like the the blunt

answer is yes i'm happy because i'm fulfilled the good question isn't it yeah but i know that's your body body language

yeah because because because the question that i asked back to this person was i am happy but why is happiness so

important like why is that the question you want to ask me like is it does it matter that i am happy

is it binary yeah and is it binary but like why does that matter to you and why does that matter to me

because i think a much better question is am i contributing um you know am i fulfilled

and am i contributing because if i'm doing those things i'll be happy and i know that to be true whereas for

me asking that happy is a bit like you know binary it's yeah and it's like straight to the point and it's like there's nothing really behind that it's

undefined as well undefined and also like really depends on what you're asking me that day i will be like no today i'm not happy to

if you ask me if i'm contributing to society and does that make fulfill me yeah and make me feel like

i'm living my purpose it won't matter what i feel like today are you fulfilled very but i have so

much more to do i i one of the real fascinating things that i've learned um is and i again i've read about this

at length in my book is how binary questions like that are the cause of so much pain and no one

realizes it that the cause of so much like misunderstanding pain and um and anxiety so like another great

example is if i asked you now if i said are you in love and immediately you have a bunch of

problems there first you've got to define in love no one's ever told you what that is they've never shown you it no when you

were born they didn't say okay down if you ever feel like this it's in love you've got it from instagram and movies so you over immediately have to overcome

that and then you have to try and understand if what you're feeling for this person fits into that box and and i think one of it's so crazy

that especially from what i do on instagram and putting myself out there tons of people send me their problems and usually it's because they they're

trying to fit into a binary box and they don't even realize that like steve i'm not sure if this is my passion i'm like that is a super

binary thing it either because have you found your passion that that presumes a yes or no answer

whereas if you say you're like are you feeling fulfilled it's a much more it's an answer that appreciates it's a gradient and not just a gradient but a

gradient that different things impact yeah so you know i mentioned contribution like you know

there's many ways to contribute and you know being outwardly successful or building a company or

you know you know having a high-flying career you know they don't tick that many boxes in terms of contribution a lot of contribution

comes back to what you do for society for what you do for your family for what you do for people that you care about you know

that stuff is a much broader question and it's like a cup that's

never full right so it's nice because it's got different levels and you kind of know deep down if you feel like you're living

your purpose and contributing to the level that would make you proud and you also know when you're not which is great because

again it's not bad that you're not it's just like well i could actually improve some stuff by giving it some focus and i think that's why you've got to

continue to like question the question as much as you try and answer the question sometimes are you scared of dying great

question um why is it a great question great question because um i don't believe in fear of death fear

of death is literally um like illogical because fear of death is what actually makes you

fear of life so if you're scared of dying then you approach your life in a very different

way and actually the greatest fear that we should have is not living your life in a true way so no i'm not at all

scared of dying um it's also really worth saying that like ever since doing ayahuasca like i

100 convincingly believe in things like reincarnation soul

spirits other planes all of the woo-woo crap that just like sounds completely bizarre

for me to think that i would ever say those words it's not even is it from like a scientific perspective you describe

incarnation exactly that's why i believe in reincarnation because i see it everywhere around me um so the reality is i'm not in the

slightest bit scared of death um and i think that that's uh the biggest blessing that i got from doing

ayahuasca was no fear of death um because that's a potent powerful feeling not feeling

like knowledge insight right that's categorically so quick for me to answer that question and no

um it helped me deal with the you know death of my father when my mum got cancer it helped me come to terms with

what might happen to not have her around as well this is life people die so you have to approach it

right you can't pretend that isn't going to happen it's the only thing that's guaranteed so having a philosophical understanding

of what that means to you and then how that impacts your life or maybe holds you back is a terrible thing so it's usually a

fear of death that essentially limits our life in my view i i feel the exact same and the

experience i described to you where i lost my faith in christianity at 18 was also the

exact moment where i um because up until that point i believe that there's heaven and

there's a heaven and hell and that was a [ __ ] terrifying thing so for the next two years i went on this search of what the answers were got obsessed with

reading about atheist books and it was actually richard dawkins that said um you can you should really fall in

love with the beauty of of the world and like the true nature of nature he talks about being able to go into a church

and crying even as an atheist because of the beauty and the wonder but also on the point of death he's one

of the questions one of the things he said was a lot of people are scared of death because it's the unknown and they and when you're religious you think it's i'm

gonna burn or i'm gonna be in this place with all these good people that sound kind of boring but when you when i got to the point

where i was agnostic or atheist or whatever you want to call it he said like how did you feel a hundred years ago was that i didn't

didn't feel anything were you scared were you were you fearful no no because i wasn't here and he said that's how

you'll feel then and then like that when i lost the the this idea that i would burn or go to

or you know go to this other place and be judged in some way it all became about now and it was as you described it was this liberating

feeling of then okay well this is it if this is it then i i you know everything is so much more special this isn't an audition

this is the [ __ ] show and my life completely changed and i i i i i completely agree i i asked the

question which is a strange thing to ask in like what i don't know what you really want to call this a business podcast because it's so fundamental to me and

because i think the fear of death is so deeply illogical and as you say imprisoning it's like yeah so listen we've had we could talk

for hours and hours and hours um what an amazing conversation i'm so thankful for for you for coming

Are you scared of dying?

on and sharing your insights you know it's interesting because the dan that

didn't want to do personal branding was like oh well you know i have a direct to consumer product and what's my personal brand fit

in that but the most convincing sales pitch for this product was in fact when you talked about

you it's not when you you know you know what i mean yeah and i think that i mean of course like you talking about

the struggles you've had and the agenda and motivations that went into creating

your product is the most convincing thing yeah and that's again why your personal brand and you building it and even why it's having this conversation

is so i think so incredibly important um i always finish this podcast asking one question which i'm sure

Dinner party

you've had before which is about the dinner party we're at a nice table now just imagine there was two other seats at this table who would you

bring to the table and why your arms crossed again yeah sorry i'm just getting into the serious mode like

thinking about this okay um so i think um i think to be honest

i'd want like an ancient philosopher like i'd love like you know just be so cool like marcus aurelius i would say

one big fan of meditations um you know stoic philosophy i read meditations um after my first

business fail someone bought it for me um and i read it again every year it takes like an hour to read and it's just such a great reminder of

you know yes the world is tough and yes the world is [ __ ] but everything is what you make of it and

really the world you're living in is all it all exists inside your own mind and once you understand that you can

control a lot of how you feel so marcus aurelius would be one and i would say the second

you know this is pathetic and i'm sorry but you know dennis bergkamp is my all-time hero

i'm laguna um and you know the man was a magician and so classy and such a authentic and

great leader in so many ways and iconic i feel though i hear huh fearful

fearful oh yeah oh the opposite of jesus he won't fly but he does walk on water

crazy when i heard that that he refused to fly yeah yeah you're right yeah yeah yeah totally correct yeah he's got a bunch of uh interesting anxieties yes i

could ask him about that maybe get marcus and well exactly and if i had a third um if you were being generous

to be honest with you okay so yeah um oprah yeah why uh

literally just think she's phenomenal yeah it felt stupid asking why yeah i mean just in every way right as

in i just it's hard to pick a thing but let's just say then because of personal growth media brand

understanding wealth and leveraging your wealth for good and storytelling i mean i could

just go on like you know her list is just ridiculous so a hundred percent oprah

um and uh oh i don't know i feel like i i feel like uh you know once the fourth

seat it's literally sitting sitting where he would be my french bulldog because he started sprinting around attacking uh

imaginary other french bulldog yeah exactly pablo um and then um i'd actually say my

fourth would be lewis hamilton um because i think what he's achieved

even before literally breaking a record like a couple of weeks ago um is so awesome and i love i'm so proud

of the fact that he's british i'm so proud of the fact like obviously even though i'm a white guy i'm so proud of the fact of what he's doing to using

his platform to take a stance actually being political with his message when he knows he has such a big

platform which is a thing that a lot of people choose not to do and choose to back out of so he's a man that stands for morals and

values secondly um he's vegan so you know i like i think it's interesting that he's chosen he's

gotten such a high performance no fail like attitude but is like as a

plant-based person clearly environmentally conscious even if he's in f1 which is obviously debatable but um he's got these like clearly deep

rooted values about how he wants uh the world to be and he is manifesting and living them in being

basically the greatest racing driver that's ever ever lived that's what he will end up as because he just beat schumacher's record

um and he seems like quite a nice bloke just in general like i just like when i

see interviews of him i just like what a relatable guy that says you know he doesn't seem like a

knob superstar at all so i would just love to the reason for him is i just love to talk to him about

mindset and focus because when you think about it that is all you're doing in an f1 car yeah that

is the in my opinion the most focused you can be is driving formula one i don't think there is any other i don't

think i don't think anything tops that so i would love to know how you achieve that kind of level of flow and focus

like week in week out nothing would be more interesting so marcus berkamp oprah and uh sounds like a

wicked dinner yeah hamilton sounds amazing listen thank you so much for your time today it's a pleasure to consider your friend

Outro

Introduction

i tested positive for the coronavirus and that is why you didn't hear from me last week

i said i was going to do this podcast every single monday we got off to a bit of a rocky start because during last week's podcast i

actually had the virus and i didn't know and it turns out my pa had the virus my cameraman who's over

there also had the virus my whole team around me tested positive for the virus at the same time and none of us knew

and in terms of the experience that i had with the virus i had one or two tricky days there was

one day in particular last week where i had mild flu symptoms and then i started to get this really

bizarre muscular pain in my back and i remember it being three or four a.m in the morning and i'm lying in bed

thinking how do i stop this pain in my back and i ordered um ibuprofen and i think like painkillers on

delivery which were delivered to my door at 4am and that night i remember pulling my pillows off my bed and sleeping on the

floor of my bedroom to try and straighten out my back weird symptoms to get i know um but that's the virus

the symptoms are so unpredictable and crazy my assistant lost her taste and smell which is quite a popular one

jack had a bunch of cold symptoms and things like that as well but thankfully we all recovered and that

isn't always the case and a lot of people especially people that are a little bit more vulnerable and have pre-existing conditions aren't always

that lucky but it made me reflect it made me reflect on the craziness

of the world right now isn't it nuts isn't it absolutely bonkers what's happened over these last seven or eight

months all of the lockdowns all of the restrictions the travel restrictions the the redundancies the the battles the

political battles it's absolutely crazy it's been the most crazy seven months of my life without

exception and hard times as much as they suck in the moment they

teach us important lessons and there's some lessons which i've learned more starkly than others which i

wanted to talk about today the things that i've been writing about here in my diary and i'm going to start

there this week i'm going to share one of the key lessons that i've learnt with you so without further ado i'm stephen

butler and this is the diary of a ceo i hope nobody is listening but if you are then please keep this to

yourself

okay so the first thing in my diary this week is just a lesson that i've learned because of this pandemic and because of all the

The first lesson this pandemic has taught me

restrictions and the lockdowns i've just written in my diary learn how to contrast in the right

direction let me explain what i mean you know i had this moment this week where i started really thinking about

all of the things that i miss and to be honest i keep slipping back into these thoughts you know in the uk and in the us at the

moment what we're seeing is the government start to talk about further restrictions and returning to the lockdowns that we had

in march and every time i hear these stories and i go on twitter and i see the headlines i start to reminisce

over my old life you know and i miss going to the theater i miss how fun my

weekends with my friends used to be i miss you know as a big manchester united fan i miss going to old trafford and watching my team play

i miss new york city which is where i lived before all of this craziness happened and

before they shut the borders and stopped me getting back in i miss speaking on stage i used to

travel around the world speaking to thousands of people in every corner of the globe i miss being in the office

with hundreds of our team members building the business together i miss my old life but i'm sure i'm sure that

many of you listening to this have reminisced over your old life and the things that you miss in the last few weeks and months pretty

you know unavoidably and typically when we do this in a more subconscious way

without really thinking about it we arrive at a place of sadness a place of

self-pity a place of grief at least i know i did you know and i almost honestly

this is kind of embarrassing to admit you'll understand why i think this is embarrassing now that i say it i almost started feeling sorry for

myself and this for the love of god is why you have to

interrogate your own thinking and let me just interrogate exactly what

i've just said to you about all of the things i miss and let me try and reframe all of those things through another perspective

when this global pandemic happened i was a 27 year old guy who was able to go to the theater go to

old trafford and watch my favorite team play whenever i wanted to i lived in a beautiful apartment in new york city

eating at the best restaurants in the world traveling around the world in business class getting paid to speak to thousands of people on stage whilst running a

global business that was full of my friends the thing that took me from that is a

global pandemic which has killed over a million people and it's devastated people's livelihoods it

stripped them of their generational family businesses and it's plunged them into desperation

right now many people can't even pay the bills feed their kids many people can't even

bear the thought of their future meanwhile all of my family are healthy i have work

i have freedom i can feed myself right now there are more people than ever praying for the family praying for

the health praying for the opportunities and praying for the life that i have right now and that you have

right now and then and when you start to think about it like that

it changes things and if you think about it like that you'll probably arrive at the conclusion that 2020

shouldn't make you feel sorry for yourself it should make you feel so unbelievably grateful

and this is the power of contrast when you contrast your life in the wrong direction you can make yourself

miserable like i did you know i was on the verge of wallowing in self-pity because i couldn't go to

the theater anymore because i couldn't go to old trafford and watch my because i didn't get on business class

flights and get to fly to every corner of the world even [ __ ] privileged [ __ ] like me can make the mistake

right so i can't imagine how easy it is to make this mistake for everybody else when you contrast your life

up as i was doing to the life you had back in march to someone more fortunate than you to

someone that's prettier than you on instagram or to someone that looks more successful than you from the outside you'll quickly

arrive at a place of self-pity and ungratefulness which is the quickest way to unhappiness but if you contrast your life down to

the billions and billions of people that would do anything to be in your shoes that would do anything to have the health of their sick parents back

to have a warm home to have a fridge full of food to have a secure job then you'll arrive at gratitude and

honestly gratitude in my life has been one of the best ways i've ever known to be happy the world we see

and how we see it is a direct result of contrast and the contrast games that you play every day if you

stroll through the corridor of a hospital and you peer into the the wards and you peer in and look at the different patients

what you'll see is people sick and suffering and in some cases unfortunately dying and suddenly because of that contrast

you'll feel so grateful for your good health and we i do this all the time you know i had this problem a couple years ago with one of my ears where i

woke up one day and there was this faint ringing sound in my right ear and at first i thought it was nothing i thought

it would pass but after two days my ear was still ringing i go on google i google it

comes up as something called tinnitus or tinnitus right and it and i'm reading through these forums of people saying

that they've had it for their entire lives it came out of nowhere and it ruined their lives

it stopped them from sleeping it made them depressed it stopped them from focusing it fundamentally changed their lives and

after 10 days of my ear just ringing non-stop faintly i came to terms with the fact

that i was gonna have this for the rest of my life and i couldn't stop thinking about it because when your ears always ringing

it's hard to ignore right and i couldn't sleep properly and i started to worry

and in that moment after two weeks of one of my ears ringing i can't tell you how much i

longed and wished for my normal hearing back for just normal ears for that ringing to

cease and it made me feel so ungrateful that it took an element where my ear

would just ring constantly for me to suddenly feel grateful for my eyesight my ears the fact that i can

walk that i have ten fingers that i can think and that's the way that contrasts work you know the same applies for the

technology in our lives those old nokia brick phones were the best thing ever in a world

that didn't have the iphone in it and your life right now in the midst of the pandemic in what

month are we in october is such an amazing privileged life

in a world where you can't remember your old one the one you had back in march this year taught me that the grass will

always look greener on the other side until you start watering the side that you're on right now and that's really all you can

do contrasting up is just such a deadly sin that we all need to avoid especially in moments like this

we all have to be aware conscious and mindful of how we're contrasting because the world is a crazy place and there's

no guarantee that it's not going to get crazier right and if you continue to contrast up you'll contrast

yourself into depression and despair and misery and self-pity like i nearly did like i nearly did when

i started reflecting on my old life and telling myself all of all of the things that i missed not the things that i have

having control of your contrast can fundamentally change the way you see the world and if it can change the way you

see the world it can change how you feel and if it can change how you feel then

it can change your life let's move on

I have a secret to tell you

i have a secret to tell you and this is the second point in my diary this week it's a secret that i only found out

and started to deeply understand recently when i say recently i mean the last 24 months it's a secret that i

really started to understand honestly being completely honest with you when i got rich and when i got

rich friends and those rich friends pulled back a certain curtain and allowed me to see

behind it i'd always heard about this i'd always heard that there's another curtain i heard joe rogan did a

a podcast with um kevin hart and on the podcast kevin hart talks about meeting jeff bezos and

realizing that there's this other level there's this other curtain which some people have access to

and the more wealthy that i got and the more you know wealthy people that started to to surround me i started to understand

what kevin hart meant and i started to understand what that secret is here is the secret

access to information and information itself that is the real

privilege in this world that's the thing if your rich parent gives you money

that's like them giving you a fish right but if they pull you into the family business and show you how it works

they're giving you a fishing rod money is efficient life and information is a fishing rod and only one of those things

will feed you for a lifetime and when you get to the level that i'm at now and you have access to a new level of information you're

associating with a different level of person you realize how much you didn't know before and you didn't know

because you don't know what you don't know it they are unknown unknowns and so back then i was kind of naive i

just thought i knew everything and where i'm at now i started to wonder

why no one told me this stuff the stuff i know now about wealth and finance and about how these systems work

and you start to realize why the rich get richer and why the poor stay poor information and access to

information obviously there's a ton of systemic issues which are controlling things but for me

information and access to information is the single biggest one when i made my first million i started

studying wealth right and i started studying investing in finance and i started to get really obsessed with how

i could turn the money i had into a lot more money i started speaking to more millionaires

and billionaires i started spending more time with billionaires and i got to see what i refer to to my close friends as

money games the games that they play and how they double triple and quadruple their money just by having certain information and

this is information that most of us don't have we aren't given we aren't let in we aren't allowed to see behind the curtain

and these are games that i never knew when i was broke games they didn't teach you or me in school games that really rich

people have no incentive to teach you because they're too busy playing them the people that sell money and those finance courses on

instagram they aren't rich right they're selling new courses on instagram if they knew a better way to make money they wouldn't be

spending their time selling you courses on instagram but there's another level there's another level of information

which is what i think kevin hart was referring to when he spoke about being able to peer in behind the curtain and you know i'm gonna really

disappoint you here after what was probably one of the biggest build ups that i've ever done on this podcast because i don't have enough

time in the hour or so that we have on this podcast to teach you everything that i've come to learn

and to be honest even if i did i don't think that's the most valuable thing that i could give you in

this hour that we have together today just like money is a fish right me telling you today's information is also

a bit of a fish because things change quite quickly in the world and even if i could tell you everything i knew now

about money games it would at some point expire it would very quickly change i think the

most valuable important fishing rod that i could give you in this hour is in fact a change of mindset

i think if i can get you to realize that your monetary future value and how rich you'll be in

your life is perhaps somewhat equal to the value of the information you have in your brain then maybe maybe just maybe you'll start

to value information and learning and the pursuit of knowledge even more and in the world we live in we

all have access to the to the same information pretty much but most of us still don't understand

the true value of it one of the greatest privileges i think i could ever give to my future kids

is to teach them the value of learning gaining experience acquiring information and

self-education which is something we can all do now because we all have google right we all have the internet we all have social media we will have youtube

you know you're doing it right now some of you that are watching this online i think we tend to over value short-term financial

incentives and undervalue learning opportunities which will give us that long-term value advantage

and all of the young people and even some of the slightly old people that i get a chance to mentor

this is one of the key lessons i try and teach them is to be able to spot short-term value from long-term value

you know and i'm going to go off peace just a little bit here and i'm going to tell you a bit of a personal story um that happened to me actually quite

recently uh and this is the you know this podcast is the home of the truth so make sure you do keep this to yourself i

had a a young person in their early 20s asked to come and work with me and when i say work with me

i don't mean you know in the same building as me i mean with me and because of the lockdowns and the way the world is

all of my sort of real close team are literally working with me in my home or in you know in a small um co-working

space and this was a in my opinion a fairly unique opportunity right because we're gonna be

sat together pretty much every day and they were so persistent that eventually i ended up offering them

a job and i offered them a job on the same salary the same wage that they're earning right now in their current role

and i offered them a guaranteed pay rise in 60 days time and they effectively

turned the offer down because they wanted a little bit more money now and whatever i say from this point

onwards is going to sound petty and biased and bitter i have no other way of saying it i'm just gonna be

honest with you honestly from what i know about their situation and from what i know about where they

wanted to go in their career and as impartially as i could possibly be that was a [ __ ] stupid decision just

just purely based on the fact that if you sit next to me or someone that's fortunate enough to have the access to the

level of information that i have access to someone that is willing to give you that information and information that's probably going to

help you fulfill the goals that you have [ __ ] a 2k pay rise that information can

quite literally make you a millionaire too and i've seen it make people millionaires you know much of the reason

why i'm sat here as a millionaire is because i got to sit next to people who had gone on the journey that i

wanted to go on and that's what i mean we tend to overvalue the short-term financial

incentives and undervalue the learning opportunities which will give us long-term value knowing how to make spot

the difference and knowing which is which will change your life and sometimes you have to play a long game you have to delay that

gratification you have to hold off on that 2k pay rise because the situation you're in is giving you real long-term value your long-term

future will be better if you make long-term decisions or your life will be slightly better in the

short term if you make short-term decisions but then your long-term future is compromised and that's what delaying gratification is you have to learn to do

that in your careers too i'm gonna close off this point by telling you the easiest simplest change that i've made in my

life to radically radically increase the amount of information and the amount of good quality information that i'm

exposed to one small change but before i tell you we're going to play a little game just imagine for a second that you could

pick up an imaginary phone in front of you and you could just listen in to the world's smartest minds

the world's smartest minds in in fitness in business in finance spirituality and philosophy just imagine

imagine if you could be a fly on the wall as they discuss ideas as they seek to understand the

world and as they talk about what they know and as they play their money games and enrich themselves imagine how transformative

that would be imagine how much that information would change your life it would change your health your happiness and probably your wealth

and imagine if all of that that access to information was free

it is free that's twitter that's social media that's youtube you can literally watch

and listen to the smartest people in the world think discuss and ideate so that's big the question you have to be honest

why the [ __ ] do you still follow jenny from 10 years ago who you do not give a f about as she publicly complains to some

customer service rep on twitter about her t-mobile data plan being expensive and slow or

kylie jenner as she publicly advertises the results of her plastic surgery and demolishes your self-esteem in the process all that

clown on facebook that tries to convince you that 5g internet the coronavirus and bill gates were all

part of some illuminati conspiracy theory why are you choosing that information why are you allowing

junk to seep into your mental diet where is that information going to take you

information is the privilege and you have to be the gatekeeper and the unapologetic defender of the

information that you consume i've said this before and in fact it's proven to be so important in my life

that i'm gonna keep saying it until i feel like you're listening to me who you follow online especially if you're

someone that spends hours of day on the internet and social media like i do is the single biggest influence on your life for the love of

god follow better and unfollow faster my trick which i'm going to give to you

is i basically mute everyone 90 of the people on my instagram are muted probably near 95

percent i just don't see their stuff i don't see their stories i don't see their posts because usually it's actually not that helpful to me

50 of the people on my twitter are muted and i'm muting people because just like you there are real world

consequences of you know unfollowing friends and people and family and things like that so i just mute them

it's a nice middle ground where they don't know and they don't need to know right and if i start talking [ __ ] online i

give you permission to unfollow me to please subscribe to this podcast but i give you permission to unfollow me too

and this has changed my life honestly it's the simplest thing the simplest decision that has had the single biggest impact

on my life i'm definitely smarter happier and more professionally capable because of it

so if there is a small thing that you can do now to really change the most important influence on your life it's to

go through your social media timelines and every time you see someone who isn't contributing

towards the values or the information that you want to consume boom mew but and here comes a very

important caveat you have to be careful not to unfollow or mute people just because they disagree with your opinion

a few years ago if i saw someone in my timeline that overtly supported like a different political party

or had a completely opposing opinion to mine all just like strongly disagreed with issues that i really care about

i would just unfollow them boom bye felicia and i think i did that because i didn't want to feel the frustration that

i felt when i logged in and saw their posts and tweets and also i didn't want to keep biting and arguing

and debating with them online but when you think about that decision logically it's a pretty terrible

decision all i'm doing by doing that is narrowing my world view and i'm building reinforcing this echo

chamber around me which is full of people who believe everything i already believe

and the fundamental truth that we all have to have the intellectual strength to believe

is that often there really is no right or wrong everything is really just a bunch of perspectives that's what the world is

full of very very few things are a case of right or wrong we'll probably all agree that the sky is blue

but as it relates to the way the world should be run our political opinions how people should be treated there's typically quite a lot of

variants and those perspectives that perfectly agree with yours are actually

the least valuable they're not going to challenge you or broaden your perspective or teach you anything

only the perspectives that differ from yours can do that whether they differ because they're you know a little bit more developed on your

opinions or because they disagree but it's not easy and i'd be lying to you if i pretend

that it was i've genuinely and i this is a weekly battle i've genuinely struggled to keep people on my social media timelines within my

social media bubble that say things i really disagree with and that support ideas that i despise

but i also think if i'm being completely honest with myself i'm better off because of it listen i'm

not i'm not going to let ryan on facebook tell me that 5g internet caused coronavirus but i am going to fill my social bubble

and my circle online with people who honestly disagree people who can respectfully

explain why they disagree and people who view the world differently to me

you know i i hope this is the last time that i make this point on this podcast but it just keeps coming

to the front of my mind so if you've not cleansed your social media following please do it now i really really hope

this is the last time i feel like if i can convince you to do this now today this week

it will be for some of you the greatest thing i was ever able to do for you the greatest

gift i can give you for listening to this podcast also you know turn all the unifications

off all of them but we'll save that topic for another time

Changing the shape of your brain

okay so the third point in my diary is about changing the shape of your brain you can change the shape of your brain

what a load of nonsense over the over the last couple of years i've heard a lot of people people that i respect a

lot including tom bill you who came on this podcast tell me that you can quite literally change the

shape of your brain and at first i'll be honest i thought this was potentially some you know some of that self-development

fluff and nonsense that we read a lot about you know the hocus pocus nonsense [ __ ] um and i

thought to myself how could you possibly change the shape and composition of your brain without having some type of evasive

surgery but i hold my hands up it turns out i was wrong and i wasn't just a little bit wrong i was really really

really really wrong over the last few months as i've gone on the journey of writing my book which is coming out called happy sexy millionaire

the unexpected truth about fulfillment love and success which you can get right now on amazon i started to develop a bit of an

obsession with neuroscience and i'm not gonna i'm not gonna go do too deep into the science because you don't necessarily

need to know that stuff but i'm to tell you about some of the things that i learned on that journey and particularly one thing that changed

my life and here it is our brains are malleable just like play-doh and our experiences

determine their shape this process is almost best compared to physical exercise where you know 30 reps today isn't going to

make you super muscular and big right but 30 reps every day for a year will and the same is true for your brain the

science says that whatever you focus your mind upon be anger or self-doubt or fear your brain will eventually

literally change in shape and i sound like i'm talking nonsense i can hear myself saying this it sounds like

some hocus-pocus magic but i promise you this is the truth and listen i'm if you know me you know

i'm just as immune to self-development nonsense and fluff as you are so i only share things with you that i think are

fundamentally true and that's supported by some kind of evidence let me give you an example if you're a compulsive

warrior the science shows that your brain will quite literally change to become a finely tuned anxiety and

worry machine you'll get your brain will become tuned for worry and i've looked through the research i've looked at before and

after pictures of brain scans of people who've overcome worry and addiction and negative thinking about themselves and other more

serious psychological conditions and honestly blew my socks off i've always believed that we are you know we are what we think

but the science shows us that we quite literally from a neurological perspective become what we think you know i read

this great piece online by this neurological expert called brian penny and he has this lab

where they've worked on being able to predict the age of your brain just by looking at it on brain scans

and your brain age is associated with increased mortality risk cognitive decline

increased risk of dementia and overall general poorer physical functioning they can

literally see how a life change that you make a decision you make in your life will change the shape of your brain over a

number of years they can see how a person that gives up x y or zed then has a completely different brain

just a few years later just like how if you stopped going to the gym or you started going to the gym you'd have a completely different body a

few years later and they've identified a number of methods just simple everyday choices and cognitive

tools that science suggests can positively change the shape of your brain i'm just going to tell you about

one of them today and it's the one that fascinated me the most it's called observation without

engagement this is basically what they call self-observation which is a pretty big part of meditation if you've

ever meditated you'll understand this and it really helps you do exactly that it involves like mindfully observing

your thoughts and your feelings and your bodily sensations the best example i can give you is you

know if i asked you to observe right now how how tense your body feels

instantly you might you know take a step back and start focusing on your sore toe or the tightness in your chest or that

headache which you didn't notice before but you can only notice when you start to observe yourself if i ask you to observe your thoughts

and your feelings you can also do that too you might start to think about the things you're worrying about or that

particular unsolved situation in your life or about your family's health because of this virus the things that are going on

subconsciously which you didn't really notice about that big decision on your future which you're procrastinating making

the point is you can take an observer's perspective on your anxious thoughts on your feelings and on your bodily sensations

you don't have to try and live inside of the problem all the time you don't have to live inside of your feelings or your emotions

and when you do this don't try and engage you're not supposed to try and fix it just observe let me give you another metaphor

which i think explains this best it's called the clouds metaphor imagine your thoughts and feelings or bodily sensations

as just clouds that are floating through the sky and sometimes those clouds are dark sometimes they're angry sometimes it's you know raining

and sometimes they're light and sometimes they're calm and thin but you're not the clouds you're the

blue sky who just observes the clouds as they're passing without engaging in them you simply observe and you let them pass you by and

as the 20-something ceo of a big company who knows that every time i look at my emails and my whatsapp in the

morning there's gonna be a ton of unpredictable yet unfortunately inevitable [ __ ] not just small

[ __ ] severe [ __ ] i'm talking ruin your day [ __ ] [ __ ] that can rear its head from any corner or person

in a global business of 700 people as as that guy this mechanism has quite literally saved

me i really really believe that and from my conversations with dom who's my business partner who's been with me this whole time you know which i

had on this podcast in chapter 10 where he described that running the business made him an alcoholic made him anxious

and made him experience some pretty severe mental health problems i genuinely believe

that this this technique was the fundamental difference between me and him self-observation which is something that

for some reason i've always defaulted to we both had the same intense stressful experience over the last 10 years

but in his words i survived it and he nearly didn't he said right and this is a horrible

thing for me to talk about he said he considered jumping in front of a train and killing himself because things at one point were so

almost unbearable and the difference is here it's in your mind and the mechanisms you rely on to

deal with your portion of unpredictable life [ __ ] which is coming your way whether you like it or not i've said in this podcast before that i

viewed the hardest moments in my life as as really a video game i naturally and

again i don't want to take too much credit for this because it's not something that i did consciously i naturally adopted this strange

video game mindset where i would almost see the situation i was in like a game of chess like i was removed

from it when things got really really hard i told myself without thinking about it that this was all just a game yeah like

a like a game of chess and i'm not the pieces on the chessboard because they can be killed i'm the

person responsible for moving the pieces and whatever happens i'll be fine just

like you know like a game of call of duty i'm not the character in the screen running with the gun

the one at danger of standing on a land mine i'm the person holding the controller sat at home and even if i stand on a land mine or

two that's fine i can just restart and rejuvenate and you know go again

and for me this perspective which is very similar to what i've described with this self-observation

was the most liberating thing in my whole career it allowed me to develop my own calm within any form of chaos and it

allowed me to think clearly without being clouded by emotion and if you're a ceo if you're running a business

that's so incredibly important and i genuinely also think that my business partner don was inside the game

he was the pawn on the chessboard he was the soldier running through the battlefield in the call of duty he was taking

the enemy fire so he internalized that pain he internalized the stress and he became the conflict

and honestly nobody can survive that nobody not even me but fortunately for whatever reason i

was removing myself and that helped self-observation isn't just handy for

increasing your like self-awareness it genuinely provides you with a sense of detachment in the most challenging situations you'll find

yourself in instead of being controlled by the situation and the thoughts that come with the situation

and all of those feelings it gave you gives you this ability to hold out in front of you to observe it

and to let it come and to let it go without impacting you too much and the brain research they've done on

this topic completely supports this they've studied the part of your brain that becomes active

when you're drifting from thought to thought and overthinking and worrying and they've seen clearly how this can

have a detrimental impact on your personal well-being and over a number of years the shape of

your brain they've then also observed how that attachment which you can achieve from self-observation and that video game

mindset where you become the sky not the clouds can quiet that part of your brain

and there's one particular study that shows that people who meditate have reduced activity in that part of their brain versus

people that don't meditate and listen when we talk about meditation i was a bit of a skeptic on the whole topic meditation doesn't have to be sitting

with your legs crossed humming to yourself right it can literally just be taking a few minutes out to relax

and pause and for me meditation is usually in the form of a massage it's the time where

i can stop i can pause and i can detach and that for me is crucial crucial

crucial for everybody no matter what walk of life you're in you have to find your paws

and listen this isn't going to stop you getting anxious or worried or stressed but learning the habit of self-observation

and that video game mindset and becoming the sky as i'll call it will allow your problems to come go and

limit the impact they have on you without having to always engage in them and therefore making them worse than they have to be

without making a mountain out of what could have just been a molehill

for the next point in my diary i've just written less answers and more questions you know so much of the the

Less answers and more questions

self-development career progression advice that i got when i was younger told me to speak up more

you know make sure i'm heard and to get my point across whenever i can and i'm telling you the older i've got and the further i've

traveled in the business world the more i've learned that that's really shitty advice in the real world it's

impressive to know an answer of course but it's also impressive to admit that you don't it's impressive to say and to have the

sense of yourself to say i don't know to say you're probably right to say

that's not my area of expertise to say i don't know but i'm going to find out or just to remain silent the least

impressive thing you can do is speak for the sake of speaking we all know people like this and they typically do that because they are insecure

and because they think if they have nothing to say then they're not very valuable we all have this contribution reputation

let me call it a contribution score you won't know what your contribution score is but you'll probably know the score of the people around you the

people in your friendship groups and in your family you'll know that person within your friendship group or a colleague at work

that just seems to speak for the sake of speaking and most of the time when they add something to the

conversation people kind of like roll their eyes and you know and they think to themselves that was a really dumb thing to say

and it gets to the point that before they speak everyone in the room presumes it's going to be something dumb again or

weird or unhelpful or irrelevant i think you'll know that person and that is because their contribution

score is low that is what a contribution score is it really really matters because if you

constantly speak for the sake of speaking or you you know you speak when you're not informed on a topic

people will gradually stop listening to you they will receive your id ideas with a pre-conceived bias

that you're probably going to say something that doesn't matter and so your ideas suffer even if they're good because of that

preconceived bias and that preconceived opinion of what you have to say so even when you do have something valuable to add

everybody will disregard it they'll pre-devalue it before it's even come out of your mouth and that's because just like a credit

score we all have a contribution score and in that case it's because you've ruined yours by always feeling the need

to chime in even when you don't know what you're talking about even when you shouldn't if you don't know the answer to

something at least know the value of admitting that you don't or staying quiet as someone that's you

know had the pleasure and sometimes displeasure of working in boardrooms and in creative brainstorms and in intense investor meetings with

big personalities and sometimes competitive personalities for the last decade i've seen how someone you know can ruin their contribution

score by constantly feeling the need to say something or add something when they don't know the answer and when this isn't their field of

expertise and i've also seen the opposite i've seen people who will sit and listen humbly and just observe and

often learn and the people that walk out of the room with their respect and contribution score intact to always

those that are secure enough to admit that they don't know and to in many cases stay quiet and the ones that lose respect

are those that try and pretend they know something that isn't in their field of expertise or that they know something about

usually because they're insecure and this is why as a general rule for life it's always better to have more questions than you have answers and to

be able to admit when you don't have the answers your contribution score really really matters and i think you come to learn that the

further you go in your career it's the thing that for me made investors believe me you know this this notion i think they

have in their head which is when stephen speaks it's probably something informed and something worth listening to

it's the things that you know makes employees trust you as a ceo it's a thing that as a colleague earns

respect and ultimately if you have the humility to learn to listen in areas that are outside your expertise

it'll be the thing that expands your knowledge and again that that will change your life

What are some of the most important questions you can ask yourself?

and this brings me to the next point in my diary and i've written in my diary what are some of the most important questions

i ask myself regularly and i when i say this i mean in all areas of my life if it's more important to know the right

question to ask them to have the answer what are the questions that you should ask yourself every single day

and um the first one in my diary is which part of this situation can i

control you know as a ceo but just as a human being that's living life like we all are there are so many times where i

encounter a situation of conflict or stress or chaos um and i'm desperate to fix it and i

start committing energy to trying to solve the problem usually and this is something that i've come to

learn there's really only like three or four things that i can control in this situation and if i know what those things are i

can invest my energy in those levers in pulling those levers and that gives me the best chance of

getting out of the situation it also is a great tool for liberating yourself from all of the stress

of worrying about things that are completely outside of your control and that you can do nothing about and i've done this over the last two

years in particular where i will hone in and i will sometimes even write in my diary the two or three things in the

situation i'm in now that i that i can control gives me that clarity it liberates me from stress and it focuses me

on the things that will actually help me get out of the situation i'm in and the second question which i

ask myself religiously at least once a day and is actually held as a permanent point on my to-do list

is what am i avoiding right now this is something that i i dare you to try and ask yourself every

day because for me understanding what i'm avoiding helps me overcome it and as near ielts said on

this podcast we are creatures that seek to avoid discomfort so there's nearly always a reason

why i'm procrastinating or avoiding something and if i can become conscious about that thing and the

psychological discomfort that's making me avoid it it helps me to overcome it and usually the things we

avoid are actually really really important and that's part of the reason they're causing us discomfort so that's a

question that i recommend everybody asks themselves every day make a list of the things you want to ask yourself the first is what part of this

situation can i control and the second is what am i avoiding the third is what would my idols think about

this decision and this is a question which i religiously ask myself when i'm facing a big life choice because i think we all

understand the values and the principles that our idols lived by we study you know we study their lives we

read their books their podcasts whatever we understand the way that they think but when we're in a situation when we're

facing a big decision sometimes we kind of relapse back to our own innate fear-driven

decision-making mechanisms and we lose sight of how our idols the people we want to be like

would make that decision so every time i make a big life decision i almost like interrogate

it against what i know that my idols would do because my idols are my idols

because they have values that i admire and so if i can kind of sense check my own decision-making

against what i think they would do which is sometimes easier than knowing the right thing to do i tend to make a better decision

and the next question i religiously ask myself is what would future steve think of this decision and this question is super handy to ask

yourself whenever you can because future you is going to pay the price for the decisions you make today

so future you is quite a selfish person they want to be they want to have a six-pack they want to be super smart they want to be rich

and that is almost all of our north star our future self and so if you ask yourself genuinely ask

yourself the question what would future steve the happiest version the best version of me

think about this decision i'm about to make to eat this entire double pizza to myself

usually that allows you to see if this decision you're about to make is in line with your values

and the next question that i like to ask myself regularly is if i'm saying yes to this thing then

what am i saying no to i think it was steve jobs who once said that it's only by saying no to things

that you can concentrate on what's important in your life and i love this line because it really helped me to realize the potency of that

question be it in our relationships or our career or in our health or in our mental health um i think it's important and i think we

need to reflect on what we hold most dear now in this moment in order to live a life and to attain a future

that is in line with our values and we need to become aware of how a yes decision is going to prevent us from doing other things

that we also consider to be relatively important it's a question that appreciates that you can't do everything and be

everything and that life is about prioritization prioritizing the things that are most important and so before i say yes to

something i like to consider all of the things that i'm saying no to as a consequence

of that yes it helps me to make better decisions today and it's a sign a signal and a nod

to how much i respect the limited amount of time i have and the last question which i've written

in my diary that i ask myself religiously is a much more direct question which is

does this thing align with my values you know people often make decisions that don't align with their values i know that i do

it every day and there are tons of reasons people do this you know they uh they binge on alcohol

they they smoke 20 cigarettes a day they have big mac you can't have a big mac pizza

they have big mac burgers and domino's pizzas religiously even though they know that their future values of health and being

around to see their kids grow up and those kinds of things are in conflict with those short-term detrimental actions

and often we do this because we don't stop to ask ourselves this simple

question and we don't really stop to think about this simple question which is how does this short-term decision

align with my long-term values next time you're doing something and it doesn't feel quite right and it

feels a little bit naughty ask yourself how it's serving what you value most in life and that

having you know the obsession i have now with continually cross-checking

the decisions i'm about to make versus the person i want to be or the life i want to attain

has been transformative for me honestly it's really really changed my life and i'm going to throw in a bonus question i did say that was the last one

but i'm going to give you a bonus question which i've just i've just been thinking about it's a little bit cliche but i promise you it's

helped me overcome you know some of the most fearful moments of my life the question is what's the worst that

will happen if i attempt this and i remember being really really young 16 years old when someone first asked me to speak on stage

and then 17 and then 18 and then the stage is getting bigger and the audience is getting bigger i remember one day

speaking in barcelona in front of about 10 000 people and being stood backstage and starting to feel a little bit of that

anxiety which we all feel and i i for some reason just like the video game mindset which i've talked

about in this podcast i default to asking myself what is the worst thing that can happen

and i don't just ask myself that question in the cliche way that friend might turn to you and say i genuinely run through the process of

what you know what is the worst thing that can happen i could walk up on stage and as i'm walking on stage

i trip on the first step i fall i smash my face my trousers come down people see my

underwear and my you know my willy and i walk up on stage and then i deliver the worst speech in my life

and people start walking out and throwing stuff at me and i walk off stage and and to be honest it's nearly always the

case that the worst thing that can happen isn't actually as bad as you think we tend to you know before we

confront it and rationalize it that way and look at it in that way we tend to i guess think it's death i

think i think we think we're gonna die and everyone's gonna hate us and and then you ask yourself this sub question which is if the worst thing

that i think could happen happens what is the long-term impact of that on my life

and even if i fell on the step hit my you know hit my eye walked on stage with a bleeding eye and then did the worst speech of my life

it doesn't actually have any long-term impact on my life okay i wouldn't get booked to speak there again but the

the material long-term impact of my life is pretty much nil and so it doesn't make sense to be

fearful because the worst possible outcome has no long long-term impact on your life

and for me that's the question that i really hold dear and it's a question that i still turn to in moments of intense pressure and fear

um fear of failure and i think it's a question that can change your life if you're a very fearful person those

are my questions and i i am i think it's important to have questions and be armed with questions because as i

say in life it turns out that having the questions is much more important than having all the answers

The thing that invalided you when you were younger, will be the thing you seek validation from as an adult

okay so the last point in my diary this week is it's just a sentence and i'm going to read that sentence to you the thing that invalidates you when

you're younger will be the things you seek validation from when you're an adult and this is um this is something that it really took me

about 30 years the 28 years i've been alive to learn um when i was younger as a lot of you will know if you've listened to this

podcast before i came from a background in a family that didn't have a whole lot of

money right we were pretty much bankrupt for my whole um my whole childhood at least the last

part of my my my time living at home we lived in a house that was beat up um the window on the front of our house

was smashed for a good decade so you know you'd get the draught coming in from outside we live my back garden

the grass in the background is about six foot high and there are fridges and tv sets and all kinds of nonsense in

there in fact the back half of my house was actually knocked down because i think at one point my mom thought we had

the money to do a renovation but we didn't have the money so they just the builders just knocked the house down and just left it as a derelict

house so one of the the doors you know which used to go into one of the rooms was actually would just actually take

you outside and we just removed the handle so that no one could really break into our house the front of our house was the same we

had you know the grass was you know a good meter and a half high at times and it was fairly embarrassing um growing up as a

black kid in an all-white school who already felt a little bit different with my curly hair knowing that our

house also looked so marked you know remarkably different and that my life was remarkably different

from a financial perspective we didn't have um christmases and birthdays by the time i was about 10 10 11 years old because

of the financial situation we're in and i know that it created a real deep insecurity within me i remember

christmas days sat in my brother kevin's room on the floor as we joked about the things we were going to pretend we got for

christmas you know like and i have to make i have to to bring context to this right like i know now as

an adult that this was a terribly naive selfish immature way to think

i know now that i should have been looking at all the things i did have which was a loving family two parents that were together and loved

me a roof over my head food on the table i know now that those were the important things but back then

when you're a young little kid who doesn't really understand the world you feel sorry for yourself you engage in self-pity and i did and i

would go to school embarrassed and i would go to school and lie about our financial situation and it

made me insecure it invalidated me you know it was one of the the biggest worries or you know

insecurities i had as a kid and so at 14 years old i started to really really value money money for me

just felt so important the lack of money we had in our life was the reason that i had so much shame it

was the reason that my mum and dad would scream at each other so much about our house and about our finances and

about christmas and about all of these other things and money was the problem so i grew up thinking

and pretty obsessed with attaining money or if i went to university at 18 years old dropped out started a business to try and make loads of money

and then when i finally got money set 21 22 years old i had a really unhealthy relationship

with it and i went to nightclubs and i spent i think one year like 50 60 000 pounds on champagne in a nightclub

at 22 23 years old just to try and impress people and then i went out to the countryside and bought

this seven bedroom mansion with a tennis court at the bottom of the garden and two living rooms and an outhouse and

big gates and a 100 meter driveway just to try and impress people and this

is this is a force in our lives which will ruin our lives if we don't understand it and the thing

that i came to learn after literally like 25 years and after being a puppet you know the

puppet master being this thing that happened to me as a kid after being a puppet that didn't know why he was doing what he was doing but

was just buying these tables and nightclubs and buying material things and trying to show off to people

i came to learn that the thing that invalidated me when i was younger had become the thing that i sought

validation from as an adult and that will be true for you no matter what it is no matter if it's romantic affection no

matter if it's validation no matter if it's money no matter what it is the thing that invalidated you

when you were younger will be this the thing that you seek validation from as an adult and until

you understand what that thing is it risks being the number one thing that can ruin your life i've like gone

through every like corner of my childhood to try and understand the things that made me

feel invalid in order to understand some of the forces that are in play in my life right now as an adult and

honestly it has liberated me i wrote in my diary one day the reasons i'll go broke

and it was pretty much this it was because i was broke when i was a kid and because that

developed a really you know psychological issue with money where money for me became

a plaster it became the thing that would make me feel the opposite to whatever shame is

and i just think it's so important for everyone to to think about the things that happened when they were young

and to understand the forces that invalidated them because if you don't understand them and if you can't make them conscious and

hold them out in front of you and examine them they will control your life subconsciously somewhere

and honestly i've got to be honest do i think i'll ever really overcome this unhealthy relationship i

had with money i don't think i'll ever truly overcome it completely because it is so deeply hard-wired into

me at a time in my life when i was so impressionable and when every emotion

just seemed to cut more and carve into me but that's not really my aim my aim

isn't to overcome it my aim is to become conscious of it and if i can become conscious of it it

has less impact over me and fortunately where i'm at in my life now i don't make those stupid dumb decisions all of the

time sometimes i make dumb decisions like i'm not gonna pretend i'm some [ __ ] like profit that you know lives their life

perfectly and always makes decisions that are in line with their values sometimes i do things to impress people

but it's like 99 less than i used to and that's because i'm holding out

my sort of psychological relationship with money in front of me and i'm able to look at it and i'm able

to question myself and interrogate my decisions against this known flaw that i have in my psychology steve

why are you trying to buy a rolls royce you don't really like rolls royces you don't know anything about them because you think oh yeah

because you think it's going to impress somebody because you think somewhere deep inside

of you that child that had nothing will feel more fulfilled if he has that range rover or

that rolls royce or that mansion and whenever i go to make these big

decisions now it's the first thing i think of so i

don't think i've overcome it but i've definitely been able to understand it and if you can understand

it if you can understand the thing that invalidated you and your kid that's as good as overcoming it and that

will help you stop seeking validation from it as an adult

and that that will change your life


summary:
**Introduction** The speaker reflects on his recent experience with the coronavirus, revealing that he and his entire team, including his personal assistant and cameraman, tested positive without initially realizing it. Despite a rough patch with mild flu symptoms and unexpected muscular pain, the speaker recounts managing the situation by ordering painkillers and resorting to sleeping on the floor to alleviate back pain. The unpredictable and varied nature of the virus's symptoms is highlighted, with team members experiencing different issues like loss of taste and smell or cold symptoms. Thankfully, the team recovered, leading the speaker to contemplate the global upheaval caused by the pandemic, including lockdowns, travel restrictions, and economic and political turmoil. He acknowledges the lessons learned during these hard times and aims to share a key lesson in this podcast episode.

**The First Lesson This Pandemic Taught Me** The speaker discusses the importance of contrast and perspective. Reflecting on the longing for his pre-pandemic life, he realizes that dwelling on what's missing leads to sadness and self-pity. Instead, contrasting his current life with those facing more significant hardships instills a sense of gratitude. The speaker highlights that the way we contrast our situations can lead to either misery or gratefulness. He emphasizes the significance of being mindful of this contrast, especially during uncertain times, to avoid spiraling into despair.

**I Have a Secret to Tell You** The speaker reveals a secret learned from becoming wealthy and mingling with the affluent: the real privilege in the world is access to information. He discusses how, at a higher level of wealth, one gains insights into 'money games' and investment strategies that are not commonly known or taught. The speaker underscores the importance of valuing information and continuous learning, as it holds the key to long-term financial success, surpassing the value of immediate financial gains.

**Changing the Shape of Your Brain** The speaker explores the concept of neuroplasticity, emphasizing how repeated thoughts and experiences can physically reshape the brain. He shares personal practices and insights, including the technique of observation without engagement, which has helped him manage stress and maintain clarity in challenging business situations. The speaker advocates for mindfulness and self-observation as tools for mental resilience and well-being.

**Less Answers and More Questions** The speaker reflects on the importance of admitting ignorance and the power of questions.
