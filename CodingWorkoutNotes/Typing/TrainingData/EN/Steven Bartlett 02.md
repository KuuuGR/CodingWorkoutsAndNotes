Transcription:

someone grabbed my chain and then i just remember seeing knives a bbc live music event was ended early
last night the rapper crept was attacked backstage this was a millimeter deeper and it would have been a different
scenario he's a rapper and has collaborated with the likes of one and stormzy [Applause]
[Music] stepdad was killed called rana in the room trying to fight them two more
gunshots everything's silent we can have a gun retaliate or we take
this music thing seriously actually try to make it out of where we're coming from the next thing we put out
went viral skepta reached out and said yeah we want to bring you guys on tour it was such a life-changing moment for
us we started doing radio tv and we started branching out
full of natural goodness you would never put a wrapper launch in a baby skincare line in the same
sentence you should always feel uncomfortable almost like you shouldn't be here and that's the growth room and you can't be afraid of that do you know
what the company's valued at 17 and a half what do you think playing with the canal
a baby cadet whose real name was blaine johnson has died he was on the brink of doing
something great
what's on your mind we've got this complex like i'm not going to cry
like it makes you feel like less of a man or something i swear this scares me
so without further ado i'm stephen butler and this is the diary of a ceo i hope nobody's listening but
if you are then please keep this yourself [Music]
correct first of all thank you for being here i think i've got to be honest i think you're one of the smartest looking
guests i've ever had sit in the chair i'm very jealous of your outfit today thank you man it's sick um and the
designer's a friend of mine who um who i met in manchester a couple a couple of months back but where i wanted to start
with you is um back in south london back in croydon i want you to if you can give
me the context in which you were you were raised and when i say context i mean like what were those things in your
environment at an early age that ultimately shaped who you were and left
those little kind of foot those fingerprints on on your personality and character to be honest like when i was
younger when i was in school like all i knew and all my friendships knew were you know gangs and
you know that kind of lifestyle that's all that we saw like you know everybody that i'll
go to school with or you know outside of school that was that's that's
what it was and you know we got caught up in a load of nonsense growing up but
i was one of those people that always saw the bigger picture and i always
thought i don't want to end up going to jail and i don't want to end up dying
because that's what i saw like i i've lost so much friends due to you know
Early years
coming from where we're coming from and like seeing friends that i've i've grown up with pass away to violence or crimes
or you know friends i've got loads of friends that are in jail for life
and some for even things they didn't even do so i always used to be like you know when when when my friends was doing this
or doing that i'd always be like you know i'm going to try and do this and try and do that and because i do not
want to end up in jail or dying like that was you know that's what we was used to like and it's
sad because it's like it felt so normal like the first time you know i was like 13
and hearing gunshots outside my house and coming out and someone's on the floor dead and i'm a 13 year old young
boy and it was like it was normal it wasn't even like something that seemed abnormal at the
time it just felt like this is how it is when you live where you live or where you're from where you're from and that's what it was you know i mean
and i feel like i've always always had my eye on
being more than that like all the time so when you know my friends
was getting involved in certain things i was like no i'm gonna i'm gonna finish
college i wanna go to university and i'm gonna try my best to keep
myself you know on a positive path like and i always thought this all the time
and i always said yeah i'm not gonna i'm not gonna fall into this trap because i'm seeing you know my friends falling
into i'm seeing my friends going to jail i'm seeing my friends die and i'm like like when is it and it doesn't end it
doesn't stop you know new issues happen now you know you've got a problem with these people because of this or like and
it just it's a constant cycle and i feel like i didn't want to get trapped in that cycle what was your
family unit like um my my mum and dad wasn't together
um my father went to jail for a lot of my childhood
um and you know he so he wasn't around for a lot of the important
moments in my life and that age where i feel like you probably need you know a father figure there
um he wasn't um because he was in jail
and you know again that's what i was you know seeing and that was what was a
norm to me you know um growing up my mum was single and it was she was just you know doing her best to look after me
and my brother um and i feel like she's done an incredible job but
there was still i'll never forget there was a moment where
something happened and police came to my house and i never forget my mom said
i failed as a mom and i can't explain how that made me feel
and i was like there's no way on earth that
i'm gonna let those words even become a reality so
i remember from there i was like i'm going to make this woman proud
like if it's my the last thing i do and that was a really really big you know motivational
moment for me why did that matter so much to you because my mum
did everything she could you know she tried her best as a single mom she tried her best she
always you know wanted the best for me and wanting the best for my brother and
you know being a single mom knowing that his bills and knowing that she was stressed and this that and the fourth
like i know she wanted the best for me and me feeling like you know
i haven't even tried to appreciate or repair for that and her
feeling like a failure even though she done her absolute best
so that resonated with me and it really hit me when she said that and
yeah from i remember from then like the motivation i had i was like i'm going to
because i i didn't even want to stay in uni or i didn't want to like i was thinking that that's long i don't want
that and i was like no i'm going to go all the way and i'm going to graduate i'm going to make her run and shake my son's
got a degree i'm gonna do that and i'm gonna do my music and i'm gonna be successful in that and she's gonna be
proud i spoke it and knew it was gonna happen because i was so determined from from there to make it happen so
yeah often when you're from an environment where people are being tempted to
choose a nefarious life so when they're being tempted to choose a slightly you know
maybe it's a criminal lifestyle or something because they don't have the same level of opportunities in that environment so
often people look back and they can almost see how it could have gone another way for them how they could have
been tempted in that other path because there's no doubt temptation to choose another path would have been present in
that environment when you look back on on those times can you can you see how things could have gone another way 100
like there there was you know there was one
specific moment that um i remember when
it was when conan had a situation where he's his stepdad was killed
and his mother was shot can you tell me about that incident what yeah you read about that in a song yes a song called
my story um where conan was um we think it was coming back from radio
and conan um when conan got back
basically there was people waiting for him and he was walking to his door
and he had his key in his hand and he's always been a paranoid person
so he's always like ready to put his key and then because like he was always alert and he always
he's just an alert person he's always alert on point and if this was probably anybody else
they probably would have died but he was just by his door and then he
heard people running behind me and he just knew straight away he didn't look back
he just put his key in the door turn it open it closed it and then that's when you know
he realized like okay someone is definitely here to try and kill me and they've got in the house
um and they've basically when they're holding
the door upstairs um they've shot through the door
and one of the the bullets you know hit conan's mom
and then conan's stepdad at the time ended up wrestling with them and then he
ended up getting shot um and and dying and then
um the guys left but you know it was that situation that happened and as you
Could you see how things could have gone a different way?
can imagine what that what effect or you know that would have had on him
and everybody around him so i remember we were sitting in a car
and our friends was like look
we can have a go and do this and and retaliate or whatever whatever it was
and i remember there was that moment of oh we we
take this music thing seriously and you know don't throw everything away right now and actually try to make it
out of where you know we're coming from and there was that moment of like
we're gonna do the music we're gonna focus and put our all into this
and you know see what happens and that was like a moment where that could have easily
gone a completely different way like we literally had nothing we i remember we had an argument over the
last bit of chicken and chips because that's the only money we had like we had nothing
and conan was homeless like it was like probably the one of the worst periods of
our lives and definitely conan's for sure um and
i feel like from there we done
otis which was like a cover of jay-z and kanye's um song
and that song went viral and
it was like it was the perfect time for something like that to happen
because we could have done that and not done what we've you know not done anything and then we could have
just you know somehow slipped back into or whatever but it was literally from that moment
the next thing we put out bearing in mind we've been putting up music you know and we've never had a moment like that before and the next thing we
put out after this disaster has just happened the next thing we put out
went viral and everything changed from there literally
you know we put this out and then from there we ended up you know skepta reached out
and said you know we want to bring you guys on tour and you know for any musician when you go on tour and do live music it's like
for the first time it makes you feel like you're really a musician like i'm really doing this for real and
that was really like a a special moment for us that he's asked us to come on
tour during this period we was we were so new as artists skepta didn't you know
we would have just done the tour for free he didn't even he didn't even just have us on the tour
supporting he paid us like he paid us per show like and when i
mean we were so we was like we're gonna get paid to come on tour with you on a tour that is already sold out
he didn't need us there and he had us on on the tour and paid us
as well and it was just like such a life-changing moment for us like you know
i i i just feel like that that the stars are lined or something but
you know being in that moment where you're like about to throw everything away to
then you're on stage live with thousands of people
in front of like from that transition to that in in you know you couldn't make that up like
that was just it was just a crazy time and i feel like yeah man i feel like we obviously made
you know the right decision and yeah we've never looked back since man
the person that um carried out that attack um did you ever find out why they did it
and did they get caught it's it's weird because we don't actually
we'll never know who who done it because you'll never know who done it now because we
there was two people there all right um and one person got arrested for it but
at the end of the day you still don't know you know you've done it and they got sentenced
yeah they got sentence i think they got found with the weapon or something like that
but um yeah there was two so we don't actually know [Music]
who's who's done it up until today we know a lot about mental health these
days it's more of a conversation now but how does
you know you're by his side how does conan deal with that both of his parents being shot one of them dying
conan is like i it's one of those ones where i can't
even explain on his behalf because it's not even something i can
even comprehend being in that situation um what i know
we have done is you know stayed doing music and doing what we love
and actually growing in that world and actually you know becoming someone from
doing what we love and you know the success that it's brought and all of you know the great things
that have happened and you know us just growing and growing and growing i feel like that has been
a major distraction from the harsh reality of what's happened in in his life do you know what i mean and
um i feel like if we didn't you know have the success we had i don't
know what would have happened there's it's interesting because i'm not sure if success um
success heals like you use the word distraction it's actually the word that i would naturally use it kind of distracts you from the pain and then
what you tend to see when i sit here with a lot of people is they they still have to at some point address that address that pain or alternative alcohol
or other exactly yeah um and we see that a lot with musicians especially you know
so that's kind of what i'm getting to you've been through the same you've been through the same hurt and you've lost people in your life as well so you can
kind of speak to that as opposed to speaking the current situation but how especially in like
in that culture in like the black culture and especially black men they don't talk about mental health
really especially ten years ago no [ __ ] chance no no no it's like
we've got this i don't know complex or we've got this thing where we're like
oh we're all right like i can get through it like i'm not going to cry and i don't know
Mental mental health
why or how or why we've been conditioned in this way but we have and we feel like you know we
don't need to talk to anybody about feeling down like it makes you feel like less of a
man or something i'm not sure what it is but you know it's definitely something that's
important to me because like my one of my best friends committed suicide
and i have no idea why up until today
so talking about nash yeah and i don't know why like
the last time i was with him we were celebrating that we just finished the shop
like bro we did it and he was like i can't believe we've done it we've done it and he was so happy and then he was
showing me like look at the emails i'm getting from people like that showing interesting he was so excited about it
but then a few days later he jumped in front of a train
like what was what did i miss
i was with him spoke to him all the time like and it was just it was like
and we're like this and he didn't not once express or make me feel that he was
depressed or going through something mentally like i didn't know
and i'm with him every day i didn't see it so that's how i know how important it is
you know for us as men and black men to you know really
not you know hide and cover and you know in our feelings and our emotions and there's nothing wrong with
talking about it or telling someone or going to therapy like there's nothing wrong with that i feel like
i don't know why i don't know why but that situation made me realize how bad
is because i genuinely didn't see anything wrong with him
like we're speaking all the time he's updating me look what this has just happened i'm going here i'm going there
i'm doing this like oh this is just coming to the shop got this order like we're like you know and then we celebrated the fact
that we finished the shop and it was built so for context here you this is when you launched um crepes and cones
yes so before launching crepes and cones nash was the person that was going to
Nash - Krept and Konan
run it and manage the store and for anybody that doesn't know so i kind of heard the story that someone a
fan had tweeted you guys one day about how funny it would be or something that if you open the restaurant called
um you trademarked it or yeah no i basically i i can't remember i had a conversation
with someone one time on it and like i remember that the name came into my head and then
i just tweeted one time right i tweeted in 2014 i said one day
we're gonna have a restaurant called crepes and cones and i just thought it was a sick idea
sick name six player for the name but in 2014 i never had anything so it was it
was it was just what it was a really big just putting it out there by the way one day i don't know if this ever going to
happen because you know i'm not in a position to make this happen but i feel like i will be one day and i just put
out the tweet and then i saw people like oh that'll be sick that'd be sick loads of retweets i'd be sick and then it was like
okay one day like we'll revisit that conversation and then um did you trademark it i
didn't you know that's nice i didn't i just did no one did luckily we trademarked it a bit later down but we
did we didn't even i don't think i could afford to trademark yeah at the time like i don't even think i could have afforded to at
that time when i when i tweeted it but i remember um speaking to nash about it and saying
yeah one day like you know i'm this is what we we need to do this one
day and he said i'd be sick that was sick but he was working in property and he was doing really well doing what he
was doing and i remember he called me and he was like i wanna i wanna
you know it's time for change man i wanna do something else um what about the idea that you were saying
the crepes on counting and i was like yeah
let's do it and this was at a time when i i could do it and you know
and conan was like yeah this like he he already it was something that we wanted to do you know i mean so
um it was just like who are we gonna get to lead this for us because obviously we're musicians we need someone that you
know and when nash broke down you know everything that he had been researching learned and
you know people that he was going to get bored to be a part of it and this time the fourth it was just like this makes sense let's do it and there's no better
person to do it with than one of our best friends you know what i mean and so we decided yeah we're going to do
it um and yeah that was a
nightmare in itself like you know just building a shop like having builders
going missing or you know people trying to be middlemen skimming off the top and this down and forth and
taking advantage of you because you're musicians as well right so we i probably ended up spending triple what
we should have spent on building it um and it took like a year like when i
mean me and nash was probably sleeping in that shop there was days we had we did sleep in the shop because we you
know we had two deliveries and the next day and you know we need to get this done and you know we need to do that or
do this and and then we we didn't trust any builders we didn't trust anyone so we had to be
there while they was doing it to make sure they're doing it in a way that we told them they're going to do it you know because we'd leave
them they'd come back and then something's not done or and it's like what have you been doing in the last week and it was
and it was just it was a it was a probably just the worst like you know experience in terms of
our intro into this business world uh i i hated it like i was i'm not going to see her and say like yeah it was great
and it wasn't i hated it i put my back up and it was like okay i don't i don't i know stepping into this world i'm not
going to trust anyone now and that really that restaurant really changed me as a a businessman really changed me as
a as a the way i think and you know the way i approach things and in terms of like
before if somebody would come to me and say this is how much this cost to do this i would probably be like
okay sounds reasonable let's do it now i'm going to ask 10 other people i get
other people to ask another 10 other people and gauge if this makes sense and this is the right thing to do or not or i'm
getting the best value for money before i wouldn't do that and i do that with everything it's like i'm i'm
double checking everything every aspect is this the best kind of
thing to do or is there a way i can do this in a better way for the same price it and it's just made me like that and
it i feel like it's turned me into a bit of a monster not a monster but like i'm just really not the same person i was
when i was making you know crepts and cones that's what adversity does though
you build a callus and that becomes like self-defense right so more than anything you want people to know that you're
gonna ask those ten questions before they even come to you because then they won't they won't try it so you're playing self-defense which is what i do
as well it's like if you know i'm gonna ask 10 questions you're not going to give me the the bad price the first time
you come up because you know because you know every time i interrogate it even if i end up saying yes i'm going to ask you
all kinds of [ __ ] yeah i get that a lot now like from people that i use and work with and they're like ah here he goes
again tangents and asking 101 questions and i'm like double checking everything
and but that comes from experience of yes being burned or being burnt yeah and we felt like we was burnt really badly
on crepes and cones what did it teach you about business because that was your first rule like foray into business i mean you had like the apparel brand
before then yeah we done we done we sold like a lot of merch which done which done right that was what actually helped
us make the money to invest in our music so the dude selling the you know the
apparel the merch and stuff like that that's what we actually ended up getting money from to invest and do music videos
and do that independently but what's that that cause that experience setting up a restaurant i mean i used to work in a restaurant when i was done my mum's
restaurant when i was young eight nine ten eleven twelve things the chaos of customers
like that that because people someone said to me when i was like i'm doing a restaurant it was like that's like the
hardest business to get into what are you doing to make money and i was like really like i didn't and then
it it became extremely harder for us because you know nash was our guy and
you know us having nash getting the staff hiring everybody dealing with everything counts this that and the
fourth and he was our guy leading this and then the week we're
launching on the saturday that earlier on in that week he commits suicide take me back to when you found out that that
had happened it was i think it was like someone was coming to the shop to do something i
can't remember what it was but i was doing an update from nash on something to do with the shop
and um didn't hear from the whole day
and i was like this is odd because he would usually update us on everything like god this
has happened and he was so excited i ah imagine this has happened i found it i found the sickest bartender oh my god i
found the secret chef look look and it it was just like loads of that usually
and we're a week away from you know launching we couldn't hear from him the
whole day and he was like where where is nash like wow have you got through to him and arsenal what's
going on and you know we're messaging him trying to call him
um and then um
we were when we was at the restaurant um yeah i got a call and someone was like
it's nash and he's dead and i was like
and he was like he jumped in front of a train like i'm even more confused because
one of the last interactions we had we was walking across the road and i remember the bus was coming and he
grabbed me and was like get out of the road like what are you doing like he's like i remember him going bro
don't do that you scared me like that kind of thing like the bus was coming and he grabbed like it was a moment of
oh the bus was coming like straight away i was thinking about that there's no way
he did that because i remembered like why would he do that how what was wrong why didn't we see it like
there was so much questions like and i just remember breaking down outside not in here like
tears crying i was like there's no way this is real and then
Finding out about Nash
we was gonna just cancel the the launch and then someone close to him was like he
wouldn't want you to do that and we made a decision said you know what we're just gonna do it
um we ended up having to find you know all the people the stuff people that he was contacting and trying to get hold of
them to keep this thing going for launch um and i managed to kind of get majority
but not everybody or everything in line that he had prepared we're grieving
and we're launching and we don't know what we're doing all at the same time
so and the day is launch day you know we've got the mayor of croydon coming down
cutting the ribbon at the shop and the whole time i'm thinking about nash like
that should be here we're taking a picture that should be in this picture
like when we open these doors i don't even know what's going on so people
thought we was there because of pr and we're in a restaurant seven people doing this doing that no he wasn't i wasn't in
there because of pr i was in there because i had to be in there had to work in there i had to like i was
literally working in that restaurant you know cleaning toilets where you name
it i was doing everything you know and people thought it was a pr thing i was doing it for piano it genuinely
wasn't like i didn't know what i was doing and it was it was scary man like it was like
we've literally just launched this massive thing the queue is from here till the end of the road like i've never seen
anything like it the queue was so long and it's like all these people are coming to eat here oh my god and you know we're going
through this and you know it was it was it was like a bit of sweet
but mainly bitter because you know it was you know in a restaurant world you're dealing with people's emotions
you're not dealing with you're forget your emotions you've got to deal with the staff's emotions you've got to deal
with the customer's emotions if your chef is not in a good mood today
he's now going to burn this rice or he's going to do something maybe out of character or something
um and so i've got to rely on my chef's emotions every single day even if he's
going through his own issues or and it's not just one chef there's two three four
then you know if you're your main bar person it's a saturday busy night decides i'm not turning up
for work because they've had an argument with their partner or whatever it is what do what do i do so this whole
business is relying on other people's emotions and even the customers the
customers come in they're not in a good mood they're already just i'm not in a good mood i want my food
and i want it in five minutes and if i get it in seven minutes i'm kicking off but just because they're in that mood
so you you're constantly dealing with emotions and people's feelings every
single day and for you to get that right every single day and everybody's emotions be great and everyone's in a
great like well you're still dealing with your own right and we're grieving
do you know what i mean and i remember covering happened and then it was a
slack it gets even worse and our restaurant was
you know it was about coming in their vibes and experienced music drinks this that and
forth and that was what it was so it wasn't like takeaways like you know everyone's like yeah just
adapt and do takeaways yeah that's fine but our whole business was built on vibes and we did
we did like sunday events i mean like it was really an in person that's what we created but the restaurant done so well
it managed to you know survive throughout the cove stuff but
then we was not going to reopen because of the stress and what it was doing to
us mentally i didn't care about the money you know people like you're sitting on a gold mine you get this right just to get
right and you know you can and i was like i hear you sounds great i can't deal with it that is too much
stress that like i was in there every day i was losing weight i was i was drained tired
you know i remember a guy came in and stole everything because he pretended to be a friend of ours and the staff that
was working there or the cleaner believed him and was like yeah your friend came in and took all the ipads
and all the equipment and i was like what what why would you what are you talking about and
then gone in there there's nothing that like they've taken all the stock it's that it's like what is going on like
this is this is crazy i can't do this and it was just like i'm not i don't care what potential this has
i'm not doing it and then um my my friend
bouncer introduced me to some guys and said look these are some really good guys
you know they've got these successful restaurants they've run it amazingly and this down and forth and you know they're
interested in partnering up with you guys to just you know make this work because you know you you clearly got something
here and these guys came and they said look we'll we'll deal with that we'll take away what a headache let's let's
let's make it work man we you know we see and we see this being big we feel like we can franchise it we feel like we can do this down the fourth
was that cool let's do it let's give it another shot um um as long as you know i don't have
to bear that that the brutal reality of you know running a business
running a restaurant have you ever have you ever um have you ever like truly taken time to
because you used the word grief we were grieving what does that actually look like when you say we were grieving because from what from what i'm guessing
it and from my assumption of hearing the story it seems like your version of grieving has always been
to just kind of distract yourself that is literally what i do and i just feel like
and i don't know if i feel like i'm scared to stop
and take everything in so i've always keep it i'm just like oh that's happened gotta
keep going because if i stop and and i don't know if that's a recipe for disaster or not i'm still waiting to
find out i don't know when when nash passed it was like i felt like okay i've got to make this work now
i've got to make crepes and cones work because what this this like he'd done so
much and we spoke about so much and you know
this can't just die in vain i feel like through the stress that was one thing that made me just
feel like you know i'm just gonna you know i'm just gonna do it i'm gonna do it it was only being forced by covid to stop
everything where i sat down and was like just do i want to start this [ __ ] again yeah do i want to do this again
do you know what i mean but what kept me going was that and yeah how are you feeling though when
because again you know you keep yourself busy you keep yourself distracted but what's going on behind the mask like underneath
the hood everyone on the surface you know you you're keeping up appearances to keep things the ship moving but how
are you actually feeling like when you go home at night and when you do have those moments yourself in the car like how are you feeling
believe it or not i don't really have their moments like i literally will be trying to do
something until i'm tired and go to sleep wake up and continue doing it again like i don't feel like i've sat
down and taken in everything that's happened i don't think i've
and i swear it scares me because i'm like you're taking in so much you're
taking on so much and all i do is just you know keep working i keep doing this i keep doing
that but then i feel like you know i've got a lot of positive
you know even i don't call it distractions because it's my life so i'm not really being distracted
because this is my life and this is what comes of it and this is what i'm doing and this is what i love doing and i'm doing that
but at the same time i am dealing with a lot of
grief like a lot of it and i haven't sat down
and you know taken it all in and said like
wow like how am i feeling because i'm always just trying to
distract myself i guess but have you ever seen moments where that grief all that all the things you have been
dealing with have caused your behavior to change in an unpleasant way that sometimes is one of
the like the indicators that there's something there's something underneath going on kind of like what you said about yourself just you know there's
when you're dealing with things maybe the first thing that might go i mean some people start self-medicating with alcohol or whatever it might be but then
other people you just see changes in their behavior they might get a bit more angry they might be a bit more cold a bit more distant a bit
How are you feeling?
you know what i mean have you ever have you ever seen any of those symptoms in yourself because of the grief yeah i think the cold
um and i feel like
i've dealt with so much i'm not dealing with this and i feel like so when something
happens when i feel like i'm not dealing with it i'll just switch off you thinking about like relationships
friendships whatever it is like it's not you know whether it's business
whether it's making a decision that you might not have made before i felt like
you know i might have been too nice here or been too nice there and just everything's just made me feel like
you know i've been through a lot more i'm not gonna make you add to my stress or make this add to my stress
so i'm really quick to just dismiss things or you know and i feel like
i've i've become a little bit more cold to it because i'm just like i'm not gonna deal with that i'm not
gonna it's almost like i'm protecting myself from feeling any more hurt
or emotion that's one strategy isn't it just a numb life
yes just like i'm like oh negative vibes oh this is no no no i'm just like this and i feel like
you know anything that i feel is remotely negative i'm just like i'm out
that is probably a good short time strategy in some situations but over the long term again there there's probably
probably a cost especially now that you're a father right yeah and one of the things you're trying to instill into your own child is probably like
emotions and understanding your emotions and that is okay to feel and and even go the other place i you know
i think people often see is in their like romantic relationships when you're in because men and women have a different uh way
about them emotionally yeah definitely typically right and so um women are typically more in touch
with their emotions and men are typically less in touch with their emotions at least that's a broad
stereotype so sometimes can make it difficult when a man has like numbed himself to deal with stuff to then be
able to emotionally connect with some a woman in the way that i'm talking about myself as well here
that she she needs in order for you to speak the same language if you know what i mean yeah when you're when your music career
started taking off and all these crazy things start happening um in your own estimation what was the
moment where you go that was meh everything really really changed when we dropped that
um everything really really changed otis was like a partial change that was like this the first lift off that was the
first liftoff but it was like okay what's next then yeah and then the next
big moment that we had was when we released our project called young kings it was like our
independent mixtape that we done um and we got a guinness world record for
it for being the highest independent charting album 18th or something was in it yes like 18
years like top 20 and was like and that was before streaming crazy so that was just you know based on physical people
buying it and you know that was a real like whoa moment for us because just before
that like that period after otis and before young kings we was dealing with so much rejection
like in terms of not even just rejection but you know people saying ah maybe you should put a girl in your group and you
can be like ndubs and maybe that might work out for you or have you tried the ant and deck thing like just being
comedians or like it was bare of like just loads of people
you know just giving us their projections of what they think we should be and it just felt like
they wanted to just chew us and spit us out kind of thing and and that's what it felt like and
you know we started then trying to make records to please what the radio wanted or you know what
we felt would have got on tv and then we sat down i remember we sat down with
skepta big up skepter again we sat down with skepta and he was like yeah man like
the labels man they're not they're they're trying to make us do this or they want this sign of sound and i remember skepta said just skepta on
jammer this was in skepta's house and he was like forget radio forget tv
forget record labels just do you do whatever it is that you want to do
When was it when everything changed for you?
there's independent pluggers that will plug you to radio themselves you don't need a label to get do all of these
things just do it yourself put it out yourself like don't watch and then they're gonna come to you and never
forget that they said they're gonna start coming to you that was like a really important moment for us where
we released our project and the music that we made was just like what we wanted to make
and you know we made don't waste my time and when we made don't waste my time it
was like it was purposely made to be like
yeah we don't care what anyone has to say this is the music we want to make or we're going to say what we want to say on the song and you lot can't tell us
anything i'll never forget when we put it out it just went crazy like the song started going everywhere performing it
then you know the song ended up on um creed the movie and like you know out to bellows
entrance song like it was a massive moment in creed and it was like we've done all of this with a song that
we knew like we just thought this is this is what we want to do don't waste my time yeah that was don't waste my
time and we was just like yeah like and then as scepter said everyone ran into you
now everyone was like oh my god i'm gonna sign record labels left right saying oh my
god like for a checkbook so yeah we want you we want you and then it just really was like a it was like a really 360 and
and then we started doing radio and you know tv and we started you know really branching
out and people were like how did you get into that but the reason why we how is
because we always over deliver on
little opportunities so we got a radio opportunity to do to with
apple to do a show that they've been doing with everyone so not everyone but like i select a few of us everybody gets
i think like six episodes um and then they move on to the next size
we ended up on episode 36 or something but it was because
we was like we got this opportunity we know how everybody else has done these shows and what they're expecting
which is they're not expecting much from us but what if we make this a sick show what if we go out
of our way bring other guests on have games just do fun let's do fun things let's make this entertaining and
actually make the show a good show and that's what we did so our show was
nothing like what they expected we went above and beyond we had everybody coming on our show from americans to swiss
french to you know the daves to aj like everybody's come on our show and
we didn't have to do that we didn't get any extra to do it we just said we're gonna you know take this opportunity
and make the most of it and from that you know they kept offering us more shows
and more shows and more shows and then someone you know brought up the the tv
show the rap game and said like who do you think and because of our radio show and like it was like no these guys would be great for this that opportunity came
to us and someone recommended us to do the rap game and then we ended up in tv
but that was all because we just put that extra bit of effort in a small opportunity and i feel like a
lot of people you know don't even think like that like some people think
there's an opportunity here this is what's expected of me this is what i'm gonna do
and i just don't i just don't live by that and conan we don't live by that because
i feel like if you over deliver and show what you actually can do in any situation
what can come from that is going to be a lot more and it's always worked
it's so true that you can take a when someone presents you with an opportunity they're actually it's almost like they're actually what you see there
some people will see an opportunity but what you're actually if you look behind the opportunity is a set of dominoes yes
then if you flick the first domino and you succeed in the first opportunity there's this cascading set of opportunities that arise from it but if
you don't do a good job on that first domino hitting that first domino hard enough you'll never start the sort of you know the knock-on
effect when i see that in everything that i've done even becoming a dragon or you know because it's very easy when
you become a dragon just to fall in just to fall in line right just to sit there yeah but for me it was like here's an
opportunity for me to really try and express myself i notice that when i watch it i'm just
like i'm so glad yeah he's just being him and saying like what he truly feels
and not just like he's sick to siege you know what i'm saying because it's funny because i it wasn't i'm not saying i'm not saying
it was a maybe it was a little bit conscious but my thinking is look i'm gonna i i can
get kicked off the shirt any time i might as well like do it my way and have a bit of fun with it and at least like leave a mark because the dragons in the
past that i've like resonated less with are those that didn't show the full side of their personality and acted too much
like a dragon and acting like a dragon to me is it is like sitting there and just like i'm
out like i like your business that's good i'm going to invest so for me it's like well in reality my personality's a bit
more diverse than that so exactly so people watching that will see like there's more to him than this paul
dragons thing and then you know other opportunities are gonna and they have it's crazy and i i swear i live by that
i genuinely do i feel like don't see something because for what it is on on the surface and face value just
there's a lot more that can come from this if you really just put in a bit more effort money
money starts coming in for you in your life people don't teach us anything about money i mean you did go to university for accounting so i thought maybe you
had a bit of an advantage there but i don't even know if that's true i just i just saw it in your in your cv and
thought oh maybe that helped him but money coming in nobody teaches us what to do with it especially in i think i
gotta say i think in the in the like hip-hop community there's a lot of narrative around like go and get the
go and get that car go get buy this watch or go by this shiny thing and i also think that sets us back as well
that's something that's i've always in more recent times when i started to understand money and how it works and
i've met billionaires and i've met people that literally their careers are just playing money games where they understand how to get this money and
double it and they have all and they also have access so they get the deals first if airbnb is going to go into the
stock market they'll get a 50 discount it goes public the next day they sell the next day and they make double their
money so it's access but it's information and i just feel like you know we
a lot of people have been deprived of that information so when you start getting money in your life what's your
relationship i agree 100 because there's things that i just found out about that
i just didn't know existed and it's like why don't we know this you know um but like i feel like it
starts from school i feel like there should be a class in school that teaches you
on this like just things like credit there was something uh you need is like you get some 750
pound overdraft thing or whatever and then i was like i was 750 pounds yeah
yeah like great and then they're chasing what are they gonna do they're not gonna do anything i'm not going in jail
and then but like it was just not knowing that this stuff actually
affects you for years to come and it's like you don't know just even paying fines or whatever it is like yeah
there's things that you know this if you don't do this or you don't pay this or it's gonna affect you in the long run
yeah and i just never knew and i'm someone that would if i knew i heard it once that's it i'm never gonna i never knew
Your relationship with money
my first car was a range over sport and it was they wouldn't let me put it in my name so i my business partner had because he had
credit he put it in his name and then so i was driving around in this range of sport living in a seven bedroom house with the tennis court and my cr honestly
they wouldn't lend me to a jaquid because i destroyed it when i went to uni i dropped out of uni straight away
but i'd gone and i'd got these overdrafts i just blowed over set you up for it like i swear
it's like because i know so much people that's gone down that same university path of they offer you this big shiny
750 pounds like that you don't have to pay back it's just you do have to pay it back but you have to pay it back but
like the way they coat it is in like you know free money it's a trap that we fall into because we don't know the
consequence of if you don't do this then this happens and i just feel like it stems from us
i feel like this being something that we should learn at in school like you know before we start
taking credit out and start doing things that affect our credit we should be learning about it but there's nothing
that you know really teaches you that in school that and you know all my peers or my friends
and none of us knew nothing about credit and i just think why is it like so hidden or why is it not really projected
is it a parent's role to turn them about credit and you know i feel like it now it is because it's probably become a lot
more of a thing nowadays but yeah and just things like you know when you
you you end up in this world of business and you know there's things that you find out about
you know like eis seis and stuff like that and i just i just couldn't believe
this stuff existed and it was like yeah when you you know if you you know i've got someone uh
jason um who invested in crepes and cones and stuff like that and you know had no idea about eis and scis and that
he could get you know a percentage of his investment back and you know from tax that he's
very previous and this is like what why don't we know about this like why is
this you know there's so much like even research and development you know you've been able to claim money back from that
and it's like a lot of people have probably watching this have no idea what i'm talking about and it's just like why
why don't why why is this stuff not normalized or people knowing about this stuff because there's so much ways to do
things you know and there's so much different methods of supporting you know you doing startups
or investing or there's so much things to you know relieve the
intense you know amount of money you might end up spending to make that a little bit better or you're not having
to spend as much or you being able to claim this back as it's crazy and i just feel like it's
proper hidden and as you as you you know you get further and further into
a different world you you find out about a lot of things that you didn't know about before when
you first started getting money what were you spending it on um when i first first got my i think the first thing i
probably bought was a car like are you good with money yeah back then back then i wasn't bad with money
like i wasn't bad with money i i always thought i want to you know there's there's nice things that i
really really want to get like i wanted a nice car and this time and forth but i i wasn't really
like over crazy going crazy with money i haven't been like that um i feel like i've
always been you know good at managing money putting money aside budgeting money
i feel like i'm really really good at that what advice would you give to people then that are young especially young people that are
you know about to embark on their own career and that might if they're lucky come into money what advice would you
give them um you know try not to upgrade your actual lifestyle
as much as you feel like you should straight away because the thing about money is this it's not
even the short term of it it's the long term of living costs and
that lifestyle that maintaining that is expensive because you know you might think yeah i've got x amount of money
i'll go buy this i've still got that it's nice because over time you got to keep spending that money these bills are
going to keep rolling in you've got to keep paying for this car you got to keep paying for this house you got to keep paying for all these bills you got to
keep you want to go out and have fun on holiday you want to keep this is you know so my thing is if you do get more
money try to keep the same lifestyle as much as close as to what you was already living
you know because it's the silent direct debits and the silent non-stop bills and the silent favors here and
there and the silent holiday it's that is the silent killer of what happens to
people the lifestyle do you think that like hip-hop culture is guilty of of
encouraging people though to upgrade it is you know i mean because it is i think most of my when i think about
where i was buying bottles of don peron in nightclubs the minute i got money it's definitely because of music videos
you know what i mean no there there is um but then anchors i was insecure so it's
a combination of the both it was like yeah because you're insecure because you were broke and you were only black in an all-white school and you always wanted
to be have validation look at 50 cent over here with these bottles he looks like he's validated so yeah
no i feel like it is [Music] and the clubs know what they're doing as well like
like i don't know if you ever notice but in the club they always make it look like people's ordering more bottles than
yeah they don't get big bottles and they put them back in the back yeah but to a person that's just in there they're
like oh it looks like he's just done i need to it needs to work yeah and it's just like it's just this
culture of them just taking your money the thing is you know that they put gambling shops do best in areas where
people don't have money because people are in those areas that's why if you go into a more sort of deprived area you'll see
multiple gambling shops because they they know that people in those areas to
their money means so much more and it's a real get out so they're much more susceptible i believe to gambling
addictions and to being reckless with their money because if i can bet 50 quid and get 500 that changes my life
whereas if you you're not going to see gambling shops in rich areas because they're not they they unders might have the information to understand
the actual odds but b um they don't a big bet isn't going to change their
life in the same fundamental way they don't have the same money in securities and i think this is part of the problem within within the like the like hip-hop
culture which is a lot of people are starting out without it so they have those insecurities about
money and money is probably the reason for a lot of pain in their home is probably the reason they saw their mum and dad arguing they saw a lot of pain
around money in their home um and so they always they always felt that it could fill that void and then when they
get a little bit of it they're so much more intent and compelled to signal to
The Hiphop culture making people want to spend money
everybody else they got it yeah by making reckless money decisions and that's this kind of perpetual cycle
because then people are looking up at them and going okay when i get it i'm gonna buy the bottles of don perrion and i'm gonna yeah and and and it's like
it's one of those ones where it's like you can't even really help because
you know we can make you know all of these decisions and that show them like look you can do these and you know
invest your money and do this do that and fourth but to someone who is coming from nothing
that has just got this big fat check from a record label you're going to tell me not to go and
buy a watch or not to buy a chain and match everybody else that's looking you know that you know everybody all the
girls love and this that or whatever it is that the reason their reason for feeling they need these things or these
items like how do you tell them no don't do that do this well i think it's i think
part of it is people like you who've been through that who they can who they trust because if someone else says that they ain't going
to listen if their mum or dad says it ain't been through that process who ain't made the mistakes i can't tell you the amount of times
i've spoken to like young artists and said don't go and just splash your money or
don't you don't need to go and buy these things or buy that or you don't need to do it and they're like yeah but
i i need the chain at least like even maybe if it's just a chain or i need something to look like a rapper that's
what i'm saying so it's like self-fulfilling it's a cycle yes they're going well if i don't get the chain then i'm not that rapper who i want to be
someday so if that rapper that they wanted to be someday was talking about investing and starting companies and and
all that stuff they might be saying i need to invest this money in the stock market or i need to buy a property
because skeptics just bought you know what i'm saying but the issue is is you know
they they they need to understand that that is a longer game
and it's more about the future but as a rapper that might blow up now
they're going to get these bookings and be on these television programs and be in these clubs and being these parties
with the artists that are shining that have the good watch on that has this they are going to be around
that so that's immediate you know so telling someone you know forget their media
think about the long term but they're in the media every single day and witnessing the immediate now how do you
tell them to ignore that it's hard so even when i you know i sit down and have you don't get me wrong like there's
there are a lot of people that do listen and you know do you want to do other things and you know that have
come and asked me for advice and asked me to intro to introduce them to this person or that person and i i'll always do that
but there's definitely been a lot that's like nah but i definitely need the chain i need i need to at least have you know
a bus down rolex i need it like i need a bus down like everybody's been saying you know you watch all the
you know big artists in the world they've all got crazy chains on like you know you look at hov jay-z he's one of
our biggest you know the people that we look up to as a musician and a businessman
he's got on a sick watch every time i see a new picture of him or he's got you know i'm saying he's got a big chain
like he's still there's still that element i feel like for artists the compromise is both like
go and do that stuff but you still need to do that stuff don't just do everything and buy you know
spend your money and splash your money on cars and jewelry and this don't do that maybe you know if you want to do get your little starter pack and you
know be on your way cool but don't you know go and spend all of your money or a big chunk of your money on that like you
know if you want to do that do it in you know other stages or do it in you know you don't have to do all at
once i guess i understand that the point as well that like this is branding at the end of the day it is like it is like
but behind jay-z you do have one hell of a portfolio same with diddy like you have an unbelievable property portfolio
art collection he's made crazy bets but you're right he especially in the early days before yeah
yeah he did like it's brand new in it and you know it's hard because i feel like for for a
lot of new young artists knowing everything they've ever wanted was to be like that rapper
they're watching and become to then turn around and be like no don't do that i completely agree i just i feel
like they have to go through it what they wanted though was to be validated and they wanted to fit in and they wanted to be accepted
because when you go through it yeah you're right it's like oh you're you're yeah but is there not that's what i'm
saying like this is so systemic that it's not as easy as i'm it sounds like i'm making out like it's a really deep
systemic system yeah like just held in place back and i realized that when i've tried to have conversations and try to
be like you know this is what you need to do and if you want to introduce this you should put your money into this and they're just like
yeah yeah okay all right and then they go and buy the next
you know i'm saying chain that or pendant or whatever it is what you're doing now is the best the best possible thing
and that exactly and like it's a lot deeper than just you
know a brand it's more the fact that what kind of brand
what you are and showing them that okay i can actually do
anything then or you know the sky's the limit and them actually
seeing that this is just as big if not bigger than music because it's an
example that they're following they're following the example of the one the rapper that they admire that came before
them so words are [ __ ] great right whatever like they're not as powerful as an example
exactly that's what role models are so so it's just actually going and and doing the things yeah them seeing it and
they'll be seeing all this stuff you've been doing not everyone will be seeing it and they'll be thinking hmm okay yeah
and it will spark a lot of people to think you know what let me do that idea that i
had in my head a year ago yeah like why not because you know
at me being a rapper to launch you'd never put a rapper launching a baby skincare line in the
same sentence like it's just it doesn't make sense even though it makes so much sense for my life because
i have a child in the door and and it makes sense but just the fact that i've turned that into
something and then them actually seeing that okay what it is is actually
a good thing like it's not you know there's i feel like there's one thing putting your name to a brand or saying this is
my brand go and buy it and then actually another thing actually bringing something out
that in that market there's a crazy demand for and they're actually loving it for anyone that
doesn't have the context um you've launched nylah's baby which is a um a child care as child skin care yeah skin
and hair care um range named after your daughter yes and this is actually how we first
met because i was filming dragons then in manchester we were both in this restaurant called tattoo it's my friends one of my friend's restaurants great restaurant go check it out one of my
favorite restaurants actually yeah yeah it's just basically um and you came over and said you know you introduce yourself because i think
we've been we have big dm on yeah yeah but we obviously never met face to face and that's one of the first
things you told me about you said i'm launching this brand in in a week or two or whatever it was and you after that
you sent me the deck of it and uh i couldn't believe it i was sat there with peter jones and deborah meade meaning all the dragons i was like man
this guy's [ __ ] launching this sick brand and it's going into 400 boot stores because i've just been in the dental day listening to entrepreneurs
trying to figure out how to get into like i don't know they're like having one of them's having a meeting with boots and they're just
getting like blackballed or they're getting like sidelined or whatever and for you to come up to me but oh we're wearing 400 boot stores i'm like that's
the investment i was looking for all day you know what i mean i've been looking at hand sanitizer
and you got all the [ __ ] set up before you even dropped it you had seven figures of investment you had this cap table these investors that are
celebrities and that are you know big names and that legit people and you said yeah i'm about to drop this brand in in
a week or two um and 400 boot stores i couldn't quite believe it i was like that's mad and why doesn't why isn't
people why you know why isn't everybody talking about this and then a week or so later everyone was talking about it yeah because i hadn't announced it then right
they were still i was basically like a week or two away from actually announcing it right and
um yeah so it was like it was one of those ones but it was like even explaining to you i was like he's probably thinking how comes i've never
heard of it or why but because we we hadn't announced it at that point but
the amount of preparation that went into even just the announcing to the launch
how long did that whole project two years two years like two years before before nala was born
um basically how it how it started was sasha who's nala's mum um was pregnant
Nala's baby
with nyla and she became really like
i want everything natural we're having a baby i want the best for her as as mother's dude you know i mean and
that she got introduced to an app it's like a product rating ingredient app um called think
dirty so it rates products from 0 to 10 so 10 being the absolute worst and 0
being the cleanest so we're getting you know baby shower gifts and loads of people are giving us
kiss and loads of them are products and you know skincare haircare products so
we're putting all of these products in the app and
all of these products you know they're claiming this that's that and the fourth and a lot of the products are coming up as
eights and fives and like looking for the zero like is there any
zero zeros here like because it literally rates each individual ingredient so zero is a good score zero
is the best score so that means it has zero bad ingredients in there and like
it highlights each ingredient of what number it gives each each ingredient and how harmful and you can click in here it gives you the details it's really
detailed and you know farah so i was like there's no zero rated like baby range in
any of these any of the brands that we're getting because all the brands like they're available in all the high street retailers and stuff so i'm
just like nah this just can't be right and she was like i don't want to use anything
on her and she's born because why is there no and then we did see like a few random zeros
here and there but you know they're either really expensive you know talking like 20 pound a bowl 25
pound a bottle or whatever it is or they're from another country they're
not even sold here um so
you know when she kind of brought this to my attention it was like me having my business hat and was like
you just like why don't we why don't we make make it why don't we make that and then
we thought is there a reason why there isn't maybe maybe there's a reason maybe it's not feasible or what's the reason
why isn't there why doesn't this exist and then um it was like all right cool
where do we even start and then i reached out to
someone um i don't i'm not sure if she wants me to say her name on that because she's
really like private but she's a g and i i brought the idea to her
and she was like this is a sick idea and um funny enough
i met an amazing manufacturer like a week ago so i will present this to them and see
if it's something that they want would want to do um but let's let's mock up the branding and let's get the branding right so that
you know when we bring it to them they can kind of vision it so you know we're working back and forth in with the branding and we're like yes
this is it this this looks exactly how we want it to look and
um she took it to the manufacturers and the manufacturers was like let's do it like
this sounds like an amazing you know idea um you've clearly done research and
you clearly have a usp and you know know exactly what you want for this product
so this sounds like a journey that we would love to embark on so you know getting the tick from the manufacturer
was important for us you know because there's loads of and you know she was one of the people as well getting her
stabbed saying yeah i think like this would be great and um so
we've started developing the formula and you know they was like okay so what
do you want i was like look i want a brand a skincare range not just
a you know one sku but like the whole range it needs to for one be a zero rating on
this app all the ingredients need to be a zero okay we'll get to that i said i want it to be 100 percent
natural as the most natural you can get it and then they came back and and was like you know 100 isn't what we would
advise for kids because you know microbes and fungus growing on products you need shelf life so you know you need
to have a preservative in it and and there's different types of pros there's natural alternatives
um and it was like okay cool we just want it to be the most natural you can
possibly get that we want it to be as naturally derived as possible and we wasn't going to settle
and there was that and then there was the checklist of the parent checklist of you know vegan
cruelty free you know tear free so if it goes in their eyes it doesn't burn alcohol-free
all of these sensitive skin eczema and then you know because we took so
long formulating it nala was born and she had eczema so that was like you know it needs to be suitable for eczema it
needs to not irritate eczema it needs to you know be suitable for sensitive skin at least we need all of
these checklists and then there was like okay that's great and then we was like but we want it to be about five pounds
550. and that's where it was like okay this is gonna be really kind of
difficult to do because it's like if you want such a great product it's gonna cost a lot and then it made me realize
why there's this doesn't exist maybe maybe i still don't know but why doesn't
this exist and it was like we've got to really take a hit on the margins but
if we believe that we can make a great product and sell loads of units then you know it's about the mass amount of sales
rather than the niche market that can afford an expensive product and and do you you started this business
with your ex partner yes at the time when you started this business were you still together yes we was so you
actually you separated in the time of formulating the business yeah we did a lot of people
i mean obviously for a lot of people that would have been it yeah and you got broken up but you know i feel like one
thing we've definitely prioritized is putting our daughter first and you know we feel like this is
something that if we get it right it can be something we can pass down to our daughter or or
you know her to be proud of you know because we you know when she's older we might not even be in a company
store i don't know what could anything can happen we might not even be here well do you know what the company's valued at
r1 yeah at the moment 17 and a half 17.5 million yeah
based on the orders that obviously the amount stores are in the orders
and that wasn't even including like d2c it was just based on you know our orders from
boots and ray of sale that was expected to hit
which we've absolutely smashed since launching but um yeah um and the investment as well so i
mean i've been seeing online it's been selling out like crazy and well it's
like my team has put in order like hundreds of thousands of bottles yeah
hundreds of thousands of bottles maybe in me like guys this is a lot of bottles like
this is a lot of bottles like are we sure we need to buy this many bottles and what martina look trust me
we know what we're doing and then we're about a week and a half in and i
ran out of box and we've already put in the order for the
the next um cycle of production already and that was meant to last us three months and
we've done all of our bottles in a week and a half out today we're not nearly two weeks people are literally
can't find it going to the stores that sold out so i saw people selling it on ebay it was cr it was crazy like people
literally people are still trying to get hold of it they're going into i get messages every day people talking i can't it's
not available it's not available it's not available and we've just literally had to you know sold out on our website
our stock gone like everything was just selling that everywhere it was like it became like gold dust people was like oh
my god i finally i managed to get one bottle it was only a conditioner but you know when you restock it
it's crazy and we just did not see this we knew it was gonna it was like we i
knew it was gonna do like well in terms of like i thought people would resonate this because it's
actually a really amazing product but it's actually exceeded everyone's
expectations and you know now boots is like yo we need a lot more stock and it's like
how have we got to place another order already of making more stock to be available and
it's just like at this rate like this rate of sale like what we valued our thing was before it's
like we definitely undervalued ourselves here based on what's what what's happening
here and you know now we've got to think oh my god we've actually got to think about the next phase of investment now because
you know we're going to be looking to to expand we're going to be looking to expand i'm going to make you an offer
i'm going to offer the money
we're literally just in or of like everything that's happened and you know everybody coming in and
trying to make it work and you know boots cooperating and you know really being like really like you know
supportive of everything that's going on and what have you learned what i've learned is as it relates to like you know people
listening to this that might have their own ideas or they might be thinking about setting up their own business what what have you what have you learned from
this you know this process over the last two years of building this brand that you that you didn't know before
what i've learned i feel like this is the first time that i've been able to fully prepare for
something in terms of you don't need to rush the process
because initially when you know we was doing this brand i was so excited
about the brand and when it's wanted it out and it was like i could have you know done this brand a lot quicker cut
corners could have i could have you know when they sent us the first batch of samples been like yeah
not gone back and said no i don't like this i want to change this what's the percentage i want i want more i want it more natural i want it more just someone
and now now we need to you know do this test and that test and this and it was like
i didn't have to do all of that i could have literally just you know
got the brand after the first batch of samples which is in the first couple months or whatever and been like yeah let's just get it online i didn't need
to you know take my time we took our time like any time there was
a uh obstacle and it would cause us to push back and it was like do you want to push back or
do you want to just go ahead now just push it back let's just keep pushing it back because we need everything perfect
we need we don't want to rush this process you know if something needs to be changed and it was like i think we've
got it got something back and it was at like 95 or something and natural and was like
no if it's going to take us another month two months to get it to the 99 i'm just gonna wait what have you
learned about um the importance of one of the first lessons i learned in business was because i'd also made the mistake
previously and then when i got it right i realized how important it was is the like what have you learned about the importance of
the people around you especially you're going into an area that you've not been in before retail even like the baby
market it's a brand new area so you've got to have surely you've got to have people that no
What have you learnt from Nala’s baby
know that world yeah like these are unknown unknowns to you like you going into that it's the same with me and most
new areas that i've been in in terms of industries i don't even know what i don't know of course and you know what one thing
i've i've i've done with this is i let that experts be experts in
in certain aspects and the issue is that how do you know they're experts because you don't even know if they're good you
don't but all you can do is based on you know prior work your relationship with them and them
knowing what they're talking about um and you know you can only gauge it to as
much as your brain can gauge something to and you've got to kind of put trust in it whether you might have to replace this or place that person or this or get
someone else to do that it happens in business all the time but you know i feel like i've been a good judge of
character so far because everybody that's been in my team from the start is still here now isn't it funny how good people hire good people 100 and bad
people high bad people 100 it's probably the single biggest thing i think i could impress upon anyone from
this conversation as well because i know you had you said you've had that experience with craps and cones it's just like there'll be young people
thinking about starting a business and those first decisions about who they do it with will be the single biggest
predictor of their successful failure as far as from my experience like those first few people
if you pick a if you pick if you take your time and really be ambitious with the talent you align yourself with you
say you know why can't i work with the best person in the world than this not not just dave who ain't got a job and
he's got time on his hands who i've who i know went to school with like why can't i find the best person in the
world and inspire them to come with me on this and to form my blind spot people don't do that 100 and also the other reason we don't do
that and why i didn't do that when i started my business is because i don't think i can manage the best person in the world someone
even double my age i don't i don't know what [ __ ] i'm talking about so how am i going to tell them what to you know i mean and that's an insecurity that means
we just go for dave 100 i can't remember who said it they were saying something like
that they if you if you're in a room or around people where you know you feel like you shouldn't be
there i can't remember where i was where i was watching someone say that and it was like you should always feel like you
shouldn't be here like you're the dumbest person in the room yeah like yeah you know if you feel like you're
smarter you shouldn't be yeah then you shouldn't you shouldn't be in and you should always feel uncomfortable like as
in like almost like you shouldn't be here yeah yeah like and those are the rooms that you should be in or those are
the people that you need to be trying to you know bring on the journey with you and that's the growth room yeah and that's the
growth room and you can't be afraid of that you've got to be able to go in there and say like look this is who i am
this is what i know and this is what i'm doing and do you want to embark on this journey with me and not feel a way to do that
because i feel like a lot of people might be shy to go and approach this person or you know say like even even me
coming to you you've seen 100 million people talking about business to show you the business
i'm doing yeah and you know being able to just feel confident and enough to do that some
people would have thought you know because you're the first person that will pick apart something you know what i'm saying
okay so this doesn't make sense so i was just like you know but i i've learned to just
be that person and not be afraid to you know go and approach someone who might be ten
times more experts in this field than me and i don't feel scared to do that because that's the only way i'm gonna
grow quick one we have a brand new sponsor on this podcast which i'm very excited to tell you about they're a brand called
blue jeans by verizon and they are a video conferencing and collaboration tool that has changed the game for our
team so i'm so glad to be working with them because as you know one of the most important things for me is when we have a sponsor it is part of my world it is
part of my life it is part of my companies as someone who's on calls pretty much 80 of the day building my
businesses and speaking to my teams all over the world it's the guaranteed security that differentiates blue jeans
from all of the other options that are out there in terms of video conferencing their enterprise grade security means
you can protect your organization from malicious attacks and establish real trust with everyone that joins your
meeting and that is something there are so many things that make sense and make
blue jeans um a better option than the sort of competitors out there and i'll be talking about all of those aspects
those features and the reasons why i use blue jeans in the coming episodes if you want to check it out you can head to
www.bluejeans.com to learn more for many years people have been asking

iced coffee caramel flavor has been a real smash here so check it out let me know what you think on social media i
see all of your tags and instagram posts and tweets about you back to the podcast i want to talk to you about
music as well before we finish um one of the things that i
i almost couldn't believe because it just feels like the most unfortunate timing ever is that you're attacked backstage
yeah i was yeah i was backstage and then like loads of people just come backstage and
then they they they was asking about someone who had no idea what he was talking about i was it was just a mad
confusing hole and then someone grabbed my chain my cadet
my cousin and then i just remember seeing knives like like literally like my jacket was
like it was crazy like i just all i remember is seeing i had to fight my way through it to get through the door to close the
door but yeah and then i looked down and my jacket was just full of rips and then i
looked at my leg and i was soaking my hand was bleeding like it's like it was crazy
and um i remember the ambulance was like if this was a millimeter deeper you would have got your artery on your leg
and it would have been a different scenario and it was a bunch of guys i don't even know who they are
never met them never had issue with them black don't it was crazy in in
birmingham because they just rushed backstage but yeah it's crazy and
that um yeah no that wasn't really in like it wasn't right yeah it was just a
completely different um thing but it was like nash and cadet passing within the same
year that was the real like they were on the same year but within a
year so nash passed in the summer of 2018 then cadet passed
um four days after my birthday five days after my birthday right cadet passed in
february so who's for people that don't know who is i mean cadet in and of itself is
is very well known very well love but who is cadet to you cadet is my cousin my first cousin um
Being attacked backstage
my dad and his dad are brothers and he was a musician as well and
he passed just you know he was just having his break record and his record was was growing and like
he was really in he's you know that moment where you're about to just and he was there and he passed away in a
car accident on the way to a show um which
which was just like it was crazy because
um just like a few weeks prior
my uncle cadet's father just told us he'd been diagnosed with a brain tumor
and that he i remember him just saying and i don't know what i'm gonna do
and that was the last you know so we began mentally preparing for my uncle
and then they saying the doctors are saying that you know i've got a couple months at max
and we was trying to get through that um and then two weeks later
cadet passes in a car accident on the way to a show
um and he was in a full car and he was the only one that passed away which
was like it was crazy and it just makes me feel like you know if something's destined
for you then it's destined for you because there were so many variables that that could have changed that situation
in terms of you know he was coming around a corner a blind corner
and the guy that was driving was drunk driving a van and he they crashed on the
corner on a country road so if cadet was 10 seconds later or 10 seconds
Cadet’s death
earlier that wouldn't have happened and there was like variables of he missed the cab before
so there was many getting an earlier cap we missed that then they had to call another one and then again in that in that cab and
then the other variable was they wasn't even going to get a cab there there was many actually just drive to the show but
the person that was meant to drive them couldn't end up making it so then they've had to go there and then you
know get a cab and there was so much different vape and it just was like 10
seconds five seconds even so it was a drunk driver that he dropped the driver oh yeah he was drunk and he and he drove
head on into the taxi and the car was full and he was behind
the taxi driver and it the impact on his head is what
killed him he was he was more than just a cousin to you there wasn't a yeah like he was
my whole life like we grew together like as in
like my mum was at his birth his mum was at my birth like
from they dot we've been like this you know land
like we grew together we done everything together shared so much
first memories together and then we had like a little moment of
or period where our relationship became rocky because i started
being successful in music and he wanted to do music as well and
because it was the same argument of him it was like you need to you need to go a bit more harder with this music you need to do this you need to do that
and so we invited him to wireless um we was performing at wireless
festival and was like just come like get inspired we've got we've got we're about to
perform he's going to be sick and he came and i remember he was like i'm so
charged i'm so charged and then he you know he got in the studio he was like sending me loads of
mute he was like it was a whole different energy and then you know you could feel that energy you know being resonated with you know
fans and audience and then he started really building this you know following and he's you
know he was really great at storytelling like he was an amazing storyteller and
people loved that about him and he you know it just started all happening for him
and then before he died i remember he done a um he put like a clip of him doing a song
with another artist called dino like they put a clip up and then i remember
kona was saying to him like turn this into a song make this a song this is make this an
actual record that song now has gone you know to be platinum selling and it was independent
and you know we was having those conversations about money he was like we because we was like look
this song's picking up you're about to see really good money and he was like yeah but it's not here now and i'm saying yeah because it takes a while to
get processing for you to receive it but and he's like shall i sign the record shall i sign it to a label because the label will offer me you know 100 grand
150 grand right now for i'm saying no this song is already doing what it's doing without any label just do it
independently and just [Music] let it build it and you'll make so much more than what they're offering and he
was like all right cool that's what i'm going to do and then songs kept getting bigger and bigger no it's silver
two hundred thousand copies three hundred thousand copies it was just growing and then you know he was finally having that
moment where he was about to you know break through and then he had the
accident and then it was just like everything just came crashing down
and that was like within the same like within a year of
nash passing away and that was like my best friend
and then blaine passing away cadet's name's playing passing away you know
within months after that and i've just lost these two pillars in my life
within a year whilst being told my uncle's gonna die do you remember where you were when you
found out yeah i was in dubai
um my partner at the time sasha um took me to dubai for my birthday
and um we was i was packing and walking in the lobby to go to the
airport back to come back so i was on the way back to london
and then my friend cj was calling me by the time that it was
it was at like it was like 2 a.m or 1 2 a.m in london
and i think it was like 6 00 6 a.m where i was i was like four hours
difference or something but i just remember looking at the phone yeah i'm thinking
because cj doesn't call me but he's really close with cadet but so he doesn't call me like as in
like he wouldn't he was not one to call me at that time of night for anything so i'm looking at my phone
and i don't know how my brain processed that there was an issue in such a short time
he called me i was like the time in the uk is 2am cj never calls me
why is he calling me something's gone wrong he's him and blaine are like this something's gone wrong with blaine
and i answered the phone i just done all of that like straight away i was just like this doesn't make sense
and i've answered the phone and he's literally crying on the phone and i knew
straight away like i knew i didn't know what how
like sorry i didn't know how or i just knew that something was wrong and it was to do with blame because he's calling me
and he's just crying on the phone crying on the phone and i'm just like what what
what what and then he said he's gone and he didn't need to say
blaine cadet he didn't need to say that because i knew exactly who he was talking about and then he said
and he but he wasn't talking properly he was like car crash like he's gone he's gone he's gone
like and then i just remember like i ran out of breath i was
i had to lean on something like i my breath was going like i felt like i was literally gonna drop
down and faint in the middle of the hotel and i was just like i didn't even know
what to feel like i'm about to get on a plane i've just found out my cousins passed away
and i'm you know stuck in an airplane like this whole time i'm just going through
customs and doing this i'm doing this but i've just found out my cousin's dying and i'm just like get to me back
now like it was one of the worst if not the worst feeling
not ever like losing him was uh like ah it was horrible like it was
horrible and you know he was such an important person in my life like
i would speak to him about everything like every idea every song i play it to him like
every just everything like he was like everything to me you know i mean and to
lose him it was just it was hard it's horrible and just
something we're still dealing with still dealing with it until today still
i still i haven't even taken my thought off the gas since to sit down and actually take in that
he's not here up until today i haven't do you remember the last thing that you
that blaine said to you yes the last thing he said to me was
um just know that i love you for real for real and i've got your gucci socks for your birthday
that was the last thing he said to me and i was congratulating him on getting his
first apartment because he just got his apartment and he was like yo i'm really feeling like
starting to feel like a ref now like i'm starting to feel like um and yeah and he was like i've got
these gucci socks here for you and you when you're back for a number meaning i was in dubai
and that was the last time we spoke
i can see you're still processing it wow
what's in your mind
i just feel like you should be here man and
witnessing everything and
like i just felt like it was too soon like he was on the brink of doing something great
and it was just like it just got taken away from him and
yeah it just felt too soon like you know when someone has so much to to offer
like he has so much to offer the world he was like he's
presence was so infectious like he's that person that will come somewhere and you just you'll remember
him because like he's such a troll comedian makes you laugh
so positive hasn't got a bad bone in his body like he's he's the person he was the person that
will tell you all the friends i love you bro and everyone's like oh rob stop saying like he would yeah i love you and he
would say look you dead in your house and say yeah i love you and he didn't feel a way
to say that and he you know he was always so expressive and he made us feel comfortable to be like i love you man i
love you too i love you too like my brother i love you like and you know he was that guy and you know
he had the most infectious laugh like he was so honest with you know when
you're trying to make a decision he'll give you the most honest opinion if you think something's not good or nothing something's terrible idea
like he was that person man and [Music] he was a big part of me
so that's why i feel like i haven't and don't want to sit down and process it
and it's not easy you know we buried up not buried but
my uncle got cremated but his funeral was yesterday so
he passed away a few weeks ago he gave him a few months he lived
an extra few years so it was a fire
but i've lost both of them and
like they're both important role models in my life like
my uncle was he was the guy you know i mean like
he was the responsible the guy like my dad is more than you know i can go and do something with
my dad that we shouldn't be doing like he's that guy and you know i'm saying me and my dad are really close
now do you know what i mean but my uncle was always that if i need advice or
this is what i'm going through or what should i do here and you know
even talking to him about knowledge and them saying like you know you should do this right get
investment well in those moments when you realize that life can be unfair and precious and equal measure
people often speak about things words that went unsaid things they wish they could say in hindsight something that i
think a lot about with my parents as well i try and reflect on the fact that they're not going to be here forever and that there's certain things i wish i
should probably be saying to them now that at some point when i realized which we life teaches us in the most unfortunate
ways that life is finite it's not guaranteed and it is precious that um we realize when it's too late and people as they say get
the roses um after they can smell them definitely is there anything that you when you reflect
on words you you you wish you could have said to him or you wish you could say now that that
um that comes to mind is there anything where you go do you know i wish in hindsight now i know how precious life
is i wish that this had been different or um no but
he did teach me a very valuable lesson because
otherwise i would have had that regret and that would have been eating me up until today was
us sorting out our little issues that we had and
becoming close again and not letting that drag out because if we didn't
yeah i would have lived in regret for the rest of my life the fact that i didn't
you know put them in a hug hug hug hug through it and turn our page and and get on with what
we are as cousins blood and family and you know we've been in each other's lives forever we trust love each other
like if i didn't rectify that situation we didn't rectify that situation how would i felt so
it's definitely taught me from there when i have issues with people
that are close to me or arguments with family members let's forget that sort it out now we've
gotta sort out now let's argue let's scream at each other now but let's do it now
and let's hug afterwards that's what it's taught me i don't want
to you know live and regret and think ah like the last conversation we had was he
was arguing wasn't even talking our words were harsh or you know because that can happen
and also other little moments of spending time you know
i feel like especially even after yesterday and just seeing my family
that was at blaine's funeral at my uncle's funeral and thinking that if this was me
these are the same people that are going to be there for me this is who i need to be focusing my
time and energy on because these are the people that care
the most not saying no one don't care but as in these are the people that are going to be here if this happens to me
who's these are the people that are lifting my uncle's casket that is going to go and lift my casket
this is where i need to to really focus and spend my time because everything else
is great it's it's lovely but you know
anything can happen to me and that means nothing and then it means everything to my family do you think you need to um
confront some of those things that you've kept yourself distracted from confronting the grief the loss i do and
how how do you think you'd go about doing that because i've heard you speak about and encourage other people to go
to therapy before and have those conversations but from what i was able to ascertain that's not something you've done you have to i haven't done therapy
i'm not i i just i just felt like you know if
someone feels like they want to go therapy don't feel weird by going to therapy i don't know why that was even
even seems as weird at a stage or not even weird sorry it used to be stigmatized yeah
like whatever it was but it's not it's just it's normal but i haven't done it
because i feel like i'm on this treadmill yes and that's why i haven't done it and i
feel like therapy is gonna be the thing to make me actually take everything in and i thought maybe i'm scared to go for a
fee maybe but i feel like i should
we have a closing tradition on this podcast where the last guest asks the next guest a question they don't know who they're writing it for and i don't
get to read the question until i open this book so yeah um
interesting these are always quite difficult because they're always quite profound but um when was the last time
you changed your mind about something life-changing
i think the last time i changed my mind was
nila's baby the fact of you know we just broke up
and we had that yeah no we're not gonna do this because this might make sense
and then having that you know what nah i've gotta put our daughter first
changed changed my mind let's do it let's do it let's do it let's do it let's do it and it was like okay cool let's do it
and you know i feel like what we're about to achieve
with that god willing you know was a life-changing decision
it's interesting because when i reflect on the story you've shared with me today there was another moment where you had to make a big decision sat in that car
after conan was conan's family was attacked yes and it's funny in hindsight how you can see
how a decision just in the opposite direction that could have happened through emotion in the moment a decision
not to choose maturity or to put something more important first could have sent your life in a completely
different direction just for temporary feelings you know a decision you can make can make a
permanent outcome and it's just like yeah think about it crap
thank you for your time it's been i mean it's been incredibly inspiring to to meet you to get to know you to see what
you've done and i don't know i feel like life might have you know made us cross paths for a reason because i was thinking a lot
about a lot of things to do with like money and investing and how you know how to be a better role model for the next
generation of people and young people from slightly challenging backgrounds and then i'd met you that day
The last guests question
you were doing this incredible thing with nyla's baby and um it was like the universe had conspired
to inspire me at that exact moment um to make sure that your story and what
you're doing becomes the role model becomes the the thing that young people are aspiring to do because not only did
you have huge success in this one area of hip-hop music and rap and and those things but for you then to go into a
completely unexpected a slightly bizarre to be honest
the babywear industry it's the most perfect example of like resisting your labels your labels told
you to be a rapper to wrap but in resisting your labels you went into a completely different area where you're
absolutely not allowed to be according to yes society and for you to make a huge success there i think is the
best evidence we can all take on for our own lives that we are not our labels we can do anything and um
and and also um you've given such clarity on like the steps that we take to get there the
importance of team the importance of hard work and and much of it is just the importance of self-relief because
when your partner was was having those concerns about other babyweb baby products on the market a lot of people
would have just accepted it they would have just taken the product that had the eight rating but there's a
certain type of person that goes maybe we can change this and that's what you did so thank you for the inspiration thank you for the
generosity of your time and thanks for sharing your story

Transcription:

i wasn't experienced enough i was too young you're just branded thick nick jones the founder and ceo of soho
house with an empire of private clubs around the world it's the most see and be seen type of place not everyone gets
it your upbringing is particularly compelling to me because you were somewhat counted out i'm hugely dyslexic
people didn't understand that you were just branded thick wow there was not much choice for me
you've created a business which brings a lot of people joy that first soho house on greek street why did it work
i wanted to prove that hospitality could be done differently i can't think of a time when i was thinking about making an
aspirational brand i've always been obsessed about the member and that was always my number one thing they've
created that if you don't make mistakes you're not pushing yourself you're not taking
yourself out of your comfort zone maybe i was trying to prove to my family that i i could do this and i think that's an
invaluable lesson at what point does that desire to prove something need to be contained because
it might come at the expense of like life balance um a very good question and i think
so without further ado i'm stephen bartlett and this is the diary of a ceo i hope nobody's listening but if you are
then please keep this to yourself [Music]
Early years
nick thank you for being here um i have to say i'm a big fan of the the business you've created and the i know you don't
like the word but the brand you've built um for many many reasons that i'm excited to get into maybe because i'm a
marketeer but maybe also just because i'm a customer someone and someone that loves the the soho house um brand but
where i wanted to start with you is where i always start and your your um your sort of origin story your
upbringing is particularly compelling to me because um by many accounts
even your own you were somewhat counted out is that true well my childhood was
i don't think i'd say i was counted out i was you know in a nice middle class family where i
had two older brothers and a sister younger sister mum and dad
but my two older brothers um were you know they were the sort of stars they were
they were great at school they were good at sport and i was a bit not so good at sport and not so good at school and
it was a sort of different sort of um sort of childhood that i suppose that they had and um
yeah i think it probably put me in good stead but at the time it was probably quite tricky when you say not so good at
school what do you mean specifically we're just really bad at exams yeah i'm i'm hugely dyslexic and um so i find
spelling really difficult i find pronunciation difficult i find um
you know all sorts of things difficult at school i mean i've since learned that dyslexia is the greatest thing to have
and but at school it isn't but i was lucky enough
that my mum was all over it and it was discovered that i was dyslexic at the
age of 12 which is very young for a lot of people are still discovering you know contemporaries of mine are
still discovering a dyslexic right now in the age i am which is 58. so
i i was i was lucky and i got support and i
sort of got through school by weird things like they they'd give you extra hours on your exam
but i didn't need that i i i only needed half the amount of time anyway to fill
up the paper because i didn't have enough information so so to get another hour was just another
hour just fiddling around with your pencil so um yeah the perception towards dyslexia
today is is it's quite a common thing and people understand it a bit better but back then i'm assuming people didn't really
understand what it was or there was a stick was there more of a stigma yeah i think so you're just branded thick
and you know because if you couldn't read or you couldn't um write proper i
mean my handwriting is still very not i try and avoid handwriting of every possibility so it's
still um really bad and i've i think yes people because people didn't understand
it there but people understand it now and people talk about it and they should talk about it and it's
to me it's you know if you have dyslexia you look at things very differently because you have to look at things
differently you have to simplify things and by simplifying things i think that gives
you a different perspective on things when i say counter that i mean more in the sense of um you didn't believe that you
would be a success when you were older because of the because especially when you're at that young age you assume that those that are
getting the the best grades and spell the best and do math the best are going to be rich and successful and then there's us as everyone else
so at that young age you didn't see you didn't envisage you would be a quote-unquote success
i it didn't i didn't think either way i was just sort of thinking of just getting through school and and and i
wasn't really planning that if i was going to be a success or not a success and i i think that's a interesting
um how you define success um and i don't think success is just been successful
you know running a business or creating a business i think it's it touches all sorts of things
was there um when i was reading about your parents dinner parties that seemed to be the first
The first inspiration for soho house
inspiration for what you would later do in hospitality and restaurants and creating experiences for others was that
the first sort of spark of inspiration for you yeah um i i i was
while my brothers were on the sports field i weirdly like doing the supermarket shop
i with my mum you know i found supermarkets fascinating i found food fascinating i then found the whole
preparation of how to give people a good time you know fascinating and you know i loved watching
how you how you could create an environment where people had a laugh and fun
and was that what your parents were doing well yeah they i'm not all the time i mean occasionally they did it but
um but when they did do it it was you know i'd love to be part of them trying to create a fun
evening and i think that's probably where i suddenly realized that you know hospitality was the route for me um
because i you know we're going back a long long time um you know this was you know i'm 58 now and i was sort of 13 at
the time and and i was i used to you know go to the local sports club and
work behind the bar you know as i would clean the glasses and weirdly i enjoyed that i enjoyed the interaction with
people i enjoyed seeing people just have a have a nice time and and back then
people were not going into hospitality i mean it was really at the bottom of a ladder of of industries that people went
into so i thought that was an opportunity it's funny because i've sat here with
them jimmy carr and lots of comedians and when i hear about their sort of ins and inspiration for becoming a comedian it tends to root back to them being
younger and it being the thing that they would see create the most joy in their home so
in the case of jimmy carr and russell and russell howard and a few of the other comedians i've sat with they tell
me the story about like the thing that would make my parents the happiest was when i would tell jokes so that was this
sort of psychological reinforcement that led me to be a joke teller for the rest of my life and when i was reading about those those dinner parties that your
parents had i was i was and also confounded by the fact that you you know you said in your own words um you didn't
feel like there was a lot of conventional opera um avenues available to you because of your dyslexia
that that was the the combination of factors that caused you to well and and i really had to i mean when
i was at school i because i wasn't good at getting exams i had to rule university out i had to
there was there was not much choice for me you know there was a person with very few o levels as as they were called then
and i think i got an e in a level and i scraped through on economics i think and
you know with that there there was there was really not a lot of choice and you know my
careers master at school sort of said i think it's catering nick you know so
when my when my chris master said that i've i i sort of thought and also the fact that i thought there was real
opportunity in this and my my dad owned a small um insurance
broking company and my brothers went into work there and
i think my dad was keen for me to go and work there but i i didn't find insurance very exciting
i still don't and i didn't find that world of working in the city and
insurance and being an insurance broker interesting at all so i i did have that as an opportunity but
i really felt i wanted to try hospitality and catering as you as you started your
What did you have that others didn’t?
journey into hospitality and catering did you start to at any point figure out that you were you had some kind of area
of brilliance there was something you were good at compared to others no i remember clearly the first no i did the
answer to that was is definitely no um i my my my first day i i worked for trust
house forte i was a management trainee and it was a five-year course and i i
applied to the savoy management um training course to start with and they
i i remember it to this day the interview i had um and i just froze i couldn't speak i was so nervous i i
absolutely froze and because i was a pretty shy kid and
you know i i was shy at 17 when i was going through these interviews and i just was it i just got stage fright i
just couldn't my mouth no words came out of my mouth and i didn't get into the savoy
management course but then i applied for trust house forte and luckily when i went for the interview i was able to
talk and i got onto a a five-year course and my
first part of the course was a year in the kitchens and it was at st george's hotel in langham place which is just
here in london off oxford street and i arrived and the chef looked me up and
down and he he he he he called me a nickname which i'm not gonna say
it began with a c and and um he threw a sack of potatoes at me which landed in
my belly and he said peel them and so i went off to the viera where you peeled
the potatoes and i hadn't really ever used a knife before and the first one the first potato i cut my my my my
finger and i thought oh god how do i hide the high disk and the water i was putting the potatoes in was getting
redder and redder and redder and i and i thought oh no this is my first day and
the nickname stuck and i i was really sort of learning on the job
which i think is a really great way to learn anything and i kept making mistakes but i ca i was determined to to
sort of fit in to the kitchen because it was an environment you know because i came from this sort of cotton wool
um middle class background and then going into the kitchen into the early 80s where where you know if
they it was long hours and and and they they you know someone who comes in with
a slightly posh accent and you know they very very very very it was it but it was
a it was a good moment it was a good moment for me was it um what was it about that
sounds pretty horrific sound and i've having worked in the kitchen my mum had a restaurant at a very young age i started working there at seven super
high stressful people always complaining it's hot in there um that and i mean people weren't
throwing things at me and calling me the c word but it wasn't it was really unpleasant so i'm wondering what in that
context like despite of all of that tickled your fancy do you know what it was it was
i was coming out my shyness i was learning how to get on with people and
you know i was i went to a private school i was surrounded by people who went to private school which is seven percent of the population and
by going into the the the the um kitchen you you really learnt to really get on
with everyone and and i think that's an invaluable lesson and i
really became friendly with a lot of the chefs and would go out with them at night and i just enjoyed it and even though it was
hard i just enjoyed the environment i enjoyed creating food i enjoyed the buzz
i enjoyed i didn't mind the heat i didn't mind the fact that it was it was
it was long hours i just enjoyed it if i had spoken to maybe your colleague or someone that was maybe above you in a
line manager at that time and said what isn't it good at what would they have said to me i i'd like to think
um not peeling potatoes or making porridge but you know getting on with people and
being part of a team and and getting stuck in
Why dyslexia is a great gift
you said earlier that dyslexia was um is actually a great gift can you explain why um why you've now
come to believe that that is a real sort of superpower for you well i i i wouldn't say it's a superpower but
i i i talk a lot about dyslexic because i really want people to feel that if they have if they get the tests and
they're dyslexic i don't want them to ever feel bad i want them to feel good and go well this is a huge opportunity
because i think when you look at things differently and the reason one thing being dyslexic i have to simplify
everything all the time i have to i have to i want something on one sheet of paper i don't want it on four sheets of
paper i want i i want everything to be scaled down and simplified and i think
we live in a world where everyone's over complicating things always and and you know and it doesn't matter what area of
the business i work in now whether it's the designers or the chefs or tech people you know
it's all over complicated and i spend a lot of my time just editing down and and and simplifying it and i think dyslexic
being dyslexic has made me do that you know because it's the easy route because complication panics me and confuses me
so i spend a lot of time simplifying and i think when you do simplify things people understand it they get it
they like it yeah so true someone once said to me that phrase i always forget which is um
if someone's ability to simplify something also correlates their ability to truly understand it and typically when you
meet these like salesmen that are um trying to blag you in some way they purposefully overcomplicate
something and sometimes they don't actually understand what they're saying but distilling it to simplicity gets it closer to truth and it's it's also a
sign that the person communicating it really truly understands the essence of the idea or the concept
Starting your own restaurant chain at 22
you by 22 you started your own restaurant chain well correct i went around lots of
departments within trust house 48 from front desk to bar to
to to housekeeping i was a housekeeper at the you know clean the rooms at the
westbury hotel in conduit street i i was a barman at brown's hotel in
albemarle street um and yeah i remember clearly um you know
serving being the barman and i remember making cocktails for george bess that was that was a highlight of he was such
a nice guy and and and i suppose at that time i always thought the determination was to open
something to to open my own restaurant this is you know i want to learn this
and then i ended up doing marketing at trust house forte and then i was marketing manager at grover the house in
in part lane and it wasn't because i was brilliant at it it was you know i was cheap you know
i just was i was i didn't just cost a lot of money and they could that's what they were looking for at that precise
moment and but i always when i was working there i was always working on a plan to to
you know not work for trust house forte which was a big big hotel company and i was thinking you
know i want to get out of this at some stage i don't want to keep going on the ladder when you know you keep getting
put you hopefully i would have kept being promoted into other jobs but and then it would have been too difficult to
leave so i want to go when i'm still relatively at the bottom and then i i went and tried working in fast food
restaurants or sort of casual restaurants so i went to work to maxwell's and covent garden as a night
manager i then i then went to work at pasta mania as a sort of
junior manager and then during that time i was building my plan to open my first restaurant which was called over the top
and that opened in 1988 and it was you know
it was i was too young i wasn't experienced enough um
it was it was terrible the design which is something i'm
obsessed with now and i love design you know and i that was my first design outing and it really was
terrible um the food was you know really bad you know my friends had to come
you know and that that showed i really knew who my friends were because they would come and support me
in the restaurant but it was uh it was it was it was it was a a good experience of getting something really wrong
it's not cheap to open a restaurant how did you how did you fund that well i i my my dad put a bit of money in family
friends put a bit of money in and i got the bank to put some money in um so i was lucky you know i was given that
chance to be able to open my first restaurant um and it's something you know you know we
we do a lot now i i love people doing that when anyone comes to me and
wants to be an entrepreneur and start something up i really make time to steven and help them and you know i was
lucky i was given an opportunity um and yeah i learned a lot
that i guess would increase the pressure if you've got family betting on you
yeah i i think i never they never made me feel like that um you know my dad
you know um i think he was proud that i was trying to do something i was trying to do something on my own because he had his
own small business um but he never made me feel like that and the other shareholders you know i
think in their head they when they first came and tried the restaurant they sort of probably knew
that it wasn't gonna lead anywhere but actually you know the the company is still the same
company as it is today it's a it never went it never it never went bust we we
we we we hang on in there and um you know eventually open cafe om in 92
um with which was really all the experience of getting over top so wrong
and let me explain what over top was it was it was it you either chose a burger a piece of
chicken a bit lamb or a steak and over the top of it you could choose one of 10 sauces
the sources were terrible and and and it was just it was just
bad and um you know uh it it it just sort of taught
me you know how to manage a business with little cash and with no cash
how to pay the staff every week how to use initiatives to try and get more
customers in and i think it taught me at a very early age you know marketing
restaurants is not the way to solve a restaurant you just have to make the restaurant
good because the customer is so clever they know what good is and they know what bad is and it taught me that very
early on there was no way that you could you don't you can't fool a customer they they they they know and you could walk
into over top and you could sort of feel you know you could sense that it wasn't wasn't wasn't wasn't good enough but
what i learned at that time was it it's sort of
it i didn't feel it was a failure i just thought it was i was on a a journey of
learning and i really even now encourage all our people that making a mistake is not a problem you
know if you don't make mistakes you're not pushing yourself you're not trying you're not you're not you're not taking yourself out of your comfort zone and
so you know i really encourage people to think that you know failure is not what it sounds like you
know it's okay it's just part of the journey what did what did that process teach you about feedback i asked that because in
my first business i was i had this was a tech business and i was very romantic about this hypothesis about the way that
i thought my customers would behave and about the solution that i thought that they would care about and i spent too
long not listening to their feedback and ultimately that was pretty fatal and i just wish earlier
i'd been less romantic and stubborn almost about what i thought the customer would want and and listen but
i'm wondering what that first failure taught you about the importance of what feedback you listen to and how you listen to it well i think feedback's key
um and people being honest it's funny being been a brit people are
funny about complaining aren't they they're in restaurants they they think it will offend you they they
think well i'm not gonna i can't complain to nick about i had a bad meal last night because he he might be your
man might upset him but to me you know you can only get better by getting really honest feedback and
i'm lucky now because i have members who all have my email address and and and you know
they if they're not happy they they email me so i think listening to feedback is super super important did
you listen to it and over the top well i could just see it because there wasn't many people to give feedback to
[Laughter] i wish there was more customers in there giving me feedback um but you you know
people did give feedback and and but i didn't have the tools to be able to get it better i didn't know you know you saw
i started going down a sort of yeah because we kept running out of money so you know
you kept cutting cutting the you know the team down so it just wasn't you know
at the end it was just me in the kitchen serving and
we even set up a delivery service to try and try and try and um uh
boost our sales but that didn't work i was so um really inspired by you
The best marketing tactic
saying that the customer is smart and also you alluded to the fact that the best marketing is word of mouth
yeah absolutely that that really is at the heart of what you even do today is is i believe in the
customers yeah i i'm very lucky that we have fantastic members who
are loyal and and you know they they you know i i if
anyone says that we've done okay or i've done okay it's for thanks to our members
and um you know our members of the people who pushed me from
doing so house you know the originals our house on greek street where yeah it
worked there were hairy moments you know when i thought it really wasn't going to work um and you know it would go quiet
or it would go you know i remember the first year we opened in in may suddenly
conquered we'd opened in january i thought oh god that i thought it would last a bit longer than this and you know
member turned around to me and said well we're all down at the cam film festival you know that's where your members are
so i suddenly thought well next year i'm going to go down and create a pop-up down there and this was
pre-pop-ups you know this was in 96 and so we rented a boat um
in the harbour and i remember in fact i remember clearly because there
was there was a lady who still works for us to this day veronique and her and i had to fill up this lorry full
of stuff in london to drive down to i didn't drive the lorry because i couldn't drive a lawyer but to go down to the south of france can and we opened
this boat and it was like a temporary club for the ten days of the cam film festival and members
you know if they weren't in london they could come to the club in in the the boat in the harbour and that
we did that for lots of years and it was i think our members really enjoyed that and that
sort of taught me again where wherever the member was going go so you know because if i hadn't you know
i was i didn't understand the film business or the media business i was in catering hospitality so i i was i was
sort of new to this and you know when i first first created the first ever committee at sarah house you
know i was really knocking on doors and and phoning people cold calling then saying do you mind and and you had to
sort of explain what you were trying to do to get them to come on the committee and that was where our first 500 members
came from and and i think there i've always just listened to the member you know they
they kept saying wouldn't it it's great this one why didn't you do one in the country and i go oh let's do one in the
country then so off i go i phone saviles up and i say any any hotels for sale i
didn't have any money but i thought well i'm going to go on that route and see how i could i could um
get get get somewhere in the country and i remember stumbling across babington
house and and i remember it was it was on the market for um
you know a million million and a half pounds um this was back in yeah a long time ago and
and um i remember driving up the drive and as soon as you have drive out the drive at
babington you sort of fall in love of a place and i fell in love with a place and i thought oh my god how how how am i
gonna get planning permission to turn this into a hotel and how am i going to have enough money to buy it
i had just a small amount of money just to put the deposit down and
luckily the people who were selling it um they
they um they said well we want to stay here for the summer we you know we want to we want to exchange and then we will
complete in nine months time i thought yes you know and then it gave me nine months
um um to um to find the money and get the planning permission and raise the money with our
members to to pay for the completion and also to pay for the refurbishment
and i i sort of just remember even before we exchanged
the agent phoned me up and said you know um a higher off has gone in so i was sort of being gazumped and i thought
well i don't have the money anyway so i can put another couple hundred grand on
it because and so i i increased my offer i i got babington house and
um you know i was able to raise the money we and we raised the money through our members you know
lots of members put sort of five grand in um and that's how i was able to get the
money to open babington house so it was a it was a led by our members sort of
verb the members helped invest in it you know they luckily have all got their
money back plus plus and um you know then that was the second
thing we opened that first sega house on greek street why did it work
Why did the first SoHo House work?
you know i was running the restaurant downstairs cafe bowen that was my survival cafe bowen
was you know it was the same company as over the top it was it was it was me
doing everything totally different to what over the top was so the food was
edible and nice the service was good the atmosphere you know and if i was in there last night
and it was you know it made me very happy because it was packed and it was fun and
when the building came up available above cafe berm which is on greek street in london
i the landlord pulled me up um and they said well do you fancy taking
the space above and i go well what on earth for you know there was no plan to do a private
members club my plan was just to survive and make cafe bowen work
after four years of attempting over the top and i still do this today i always look
at everything i when people phone me and say there's an idea i was gonna have a look and so i said okay well go and have
a look so i wandered around the offices and it was a small door you know um
on on greek street forty creek street and and i thought hmm
and i hadn't been to a private members club you know i wasn't i wasn't part of a groucho club i wasn't i wasn't i
wasn't part of that that that was only the groucho club all there were all those clubs down in palm
oil i wasn't part of that maybe that's a good thing yes and i and i i looked random oh god this is like a home away
from home and and and you know god this is this could work how
could i you know this this this is an idea but i didn't have any money so um again and um
i went to see um my landlord which is paul raymond um and
i went to see him and he said well you do want to take it i said well yeah i'd love to take it but what would you invest because
the family investment and from over the top they had had totally enough explain they
they were out you know the banks were trying to pull out of you know trying to get their loan back it was
that bit of it was you know just it was it was it was that bit of the
family help was done finished and so i thought
well how am i going to raise the money for this because it's going to be separate i'm going to have to do this separately to what cafe bow m is
and so i went to see paul raymond he said i'm not investing i didn't invest in other people's businesses and then it
was when i was leaving he said well what happens if i put the money in but just added it to
your rent so you ended up with a higher rent you know a percentage of the money he put in
was added to my rent and i thought well to do the fit out to do fit
um i thought okay well that sounds like it can work so i set up sewer house it
was it was simple to come up with a name it was a house in soho the logo was pretty simple it was just actually it
was it was so simple it was free buildings three floors um and
and i and but i owned a hundred percent of it because
the cafe bowman a lot you know my my family didn't want anything to do with it and and the other investors and i
thought well you know when so house works i'm going to transfer everything back to the you know the same
percentages as it was as when it was over the top so i merged the
two companies so i didn't want um i didn't want to be a success on one
hand in on on soho and and they were suffering on cafe bowm and over top so
we merged it all together and and we found the members and and and
you know a lot of the people who opened sewer house in 95
still are part of sower house to work um you know a guy
pierre who was a server in in in um the blue dining room the the blue room
in the in the restaurant now runs north america for us and um
marcus anderson who it runs our membership part of our membership team who was a server in one
of the dining rooms so the guy marcus barwell was a barman in the circle bar now he's managing
director of south house design so it's lovely seeing you know people who
are right there at the beginning still be part of a company now and
it it but it was it was a journey as well it was we were moving into this new area of membership
understanding membership understanding looking after people and and just listening to your members because i'm
sort of going back to your original sort of feedback question so the feedback and which comes from our members has sort of
really helped us where we are today was cafe bowen successful when you embarked
on the house journey upstairs yes but it was having to be on top of the
disaster of sower house so it was a quite a lot of there was a lot of sort of um it was the same company and and so
yes it worked cafe berm worked it gave me the confidence to do something else it
it worked because um it it you know it was 30 years ago so and
there weren't many places i don't think there were many places which were open to eight in the morning and
closed at three in the morning and you could go in there and eat whatever you wanted or just have a coffee or just
have a drink the kitchen was always open you could you know drink chunks of beer or you
could have a steak freak or and we had jazz in the afternoons it was
really creating it it sort of really created a real regular following within soho and
it was the turning point really of the disaster of overdue i had a few words to say about one of my
sponsors on this podcast for many years people have been asking for a coffee flavoured huel and quite recently
he'll release the iced coffee caramel flavor of their um ready to drink heels and i've just become hooked on it over
the last couple of weeks i've been on a really interesting journey with huel which i've described and talked about a little bit on this podcast i started
with the berry ready to drinks then i moved over to the protein salted caramel because it's 100 calories and it gives
you all of your essential vitamins and minerals but also gives you the 20 odd grams of protein you need and now i'm
balanced between them both i drink mostly the banana flavor ready to drink i've got really into the iced coffee
caramel um flavor of heels ready to drink and now i'm drinking that as well as the protein make sure you try the new
ready to drink flavors that the caramel flavor is amazing the new banana flavor as well is amazing and obviously as i
said the iced coffee caramel flavor has been a real smash here so check it out let me know what you think on social
media i see all of your tags and instagram posts and tweets about huel back to the podcast so when you look
the factors that made SoHo house what it is today
back then on that so house a lot of people i'm sure started very similar style businesses around the time i'm
trying to figure out why sir house went on to become what it is today what were the the factors that
in your view you talked about customer feedback shaping everything but well i would i would give that accolade to our
members i would i would say it was the members who pushed me
and and yeah when they when we opened in new york you know
because we i think we'd open the electorate house with we're about three then and and someone said well you
should open in new york i'd love this i'll have a oh yes maybe so
off i go to new york and and and determined to open a sewer house in new york first of all look in the re
district of soho and couldn't find something going came close
it was difficult learning permitting it was it was just difficult and
i remember we found the warehouse it was an old electrical warehouse and meat packing
and meat packing was a very different place to what it is now um it was run down it was you know it was
it was full of sort of it was full of really interesting life and and
i remember we found this this this this warehouse and i thought okay i'm gonna get get the warehouse and again we
had to raise money to do it so it was a question of trying to um how do you get raise money
in new york because we we you know it was it was a bad time in the uk it was so i think it might have been a
recession going on so the banks were you're not gonna we're not lending you money in new york so i thought okay well
i gotta start raising money again from our members and from people in new york to put money into the seller house in
new york and um i i it was everything was nerve-wracking you
know the week i was flying out there to try and get the permit to
be able to allow to open a club in the in a warehouse was 9 11. so i arrived on
i think it was a monday evening and i was nervous because i it was this
big big meeting on the thursday where in in front of a local community board to see
whether we'd get permission to be able to open up a club and have a license in
this premises and i was having breakfast um
on the tuesday morning then the 9 11. um and i was having a bold egg i remember
it and as i was hitting my boiled egg i heard this big bang and i thought what is that so i ran out
on the street and i looked up and i could see one of the twin towers with
smoke coming out of it and i asked um
there's a guy sweeping the street and i said what happened he said well a plane went into the side of it and i said well
was it just a what did it look was it he said it was an airliner it was so it wasn't like a
private plane and i thought oh my god so the first thing i did was phone kirsty my wife um
because she was in new zealand she was a news presenter on itn and i said i think maybe you
should get into work there's something going on here and and then and then
i was still out on the street and i saw the second plane going you saw it coming yeah
it was coming in from the river so you didn't actually see it coming in but you saw the impact of it coming in
and and then you know that day was it it made me really fall
in love with new york it's sort of the release resistance of the people uh
how how they cope with it how they it was it was it was amazing the people
of new york that day um and that that week and and
anyway weirdly the community board still happened on the thursday and i went up and did my presentation i
said i i don't know why i'm doing this it seems irrelevant it seems not
not something we should be doing but you know you're running a meeting there was a lot
of other points on the agenda so i was just one of them and we got our permission um
and that's how new york started but it was a big big
sort of race to find the finance and i was calling everyone i was i was calling
everyone i did more show rounds of that that that that warehouse building you
know running up and down the stairs showing people around trying to be enthusiastic and then you know i was sort of getting
to know people in new york and i put together this hard hat dinner um
where i i don't know how it happened and i don't know um
why it happened but you know the really well-known people turned up to
this dinner and we had just had a six burner on the sixth floor and we cooked some chicken and we laid out the table
in the building site on with a white tablecloth so it was real grit and glamour it was it was and and these people just
turned up and i remember david bowie been there and i'm going
and i remember i was so nervous i was i i i
and i i started talking to him and he said this is a great idea can i buy it
and i said well there's nothing to buy at the moment but can you invest in it yes and and so
he was one he was one of the investors of of of sewer house new york which was fantastic and and and then
momentum came and we rose raised the money everyone sort of before that was saying a private
members club wouldn't work in new york you know
people wouldn't pay a membership fee people treat restaurants like private members
clubs and the velvet rope was the big thing in new york um
and i wobbled so often about should we charge for membership and every uh i was
so nervous opening so i had new york and i remember the opening party um and
it was raining and they hadn't finished putting the roof on and and
people were staying in the hotel and there was no water so we had to borrow the showers at the local gym people had
to go down to a local gym for hot water we had water but there was no hot water
and it was just this roller coaster of an experience opening in new york where
we didn't quite have enough money and you know the team
you know my we were carrying sheep sheetrock or it's plasterboard over here and sheet rock over there
up to the floors to try and finish them putting the ceilings in and and it was a it was a it was a it was a
journey but then eventually we opened and it worked it so people sort of took to
it why bother you know like you had a great business here in london you know things
are going well why why put yourself through all that pain um
a very good question and i think i could have just carried on doing things
in london but i there was an ambition in me there was you know there was this
this thing about being a brit and going to new york and trying to take the thing which i loved in london and see if it
worked in new york and it was and it and at points it nearly took the whole thing down
and but i really felt at the time that if it did bring the whole thing down at
least i tried at least i gave it a go and i wasn't going to be sitting in a rocking chair thinking i
didn't give it a go so i think there was a sort of inner something in me which wanted to see and maybe it was sort of
going back to my childhood when my brothers were so good on the sports field or or good at school i was trying
to prove a point because because i sensed that a lot even when you had this you know successful cafe for you then to take the risk of
taking upstairs with an unknown idea just because someone said it's available and it's that
you know some people are more like the i don't know they stay within the zone of comfort and they just harvest but you have this hunting
sort of predisposition as well even when things are going well so well
i there's something inside me um maybe i was trying to prove to
my brothers my family that i i could do this and and yeah i
and i do always look at things in a positive light i do look at things like you know if i look at a glass of water
i'd say that's half full um not half empty and and and
hospitality i wanted to prove that hospitality could be done differently and i think with
cafe bowen where we opened it all day and it was chameleon it just kept changing to the
time of day it was and putting jazz on in the afternoon and just sort of
making it much more customer focused where you would go out
40 years ago and kitchens would close at 2pm and you couldn't eat in the afternoon and
i think that was something i felt i was onto something to be able to make it better for the customer and that sort of
took me back to when i liked helping my mum and dad when they had people around for supper and i
loved seeing rooms full of people having a good time in cafe bowen and i loved
laughter i loved people connecting with each other i loved people enjoying themselves and i think i just thought
why didn't i just carry on doing this at what point does that desire to prove something need to be
The line between ambition & family
contained because it might come at the expense of like life balance you know this question i've asked myself
a lot it's like when you are successful in one thing you have more opportunities to go and do more things and then you might end up
being pulled so much by your ambition and your desire to prove a point or your insecurities that you then end up
compromising all of these other things like friendships and the other things that make life fulfilling yeah and i it's a
it's a balance i've never quite got right and i'm super lucky i have an incredibly
supportive wife kirsty and she she sort of
really went on the journey with me and i know without her you know i wouldn't be you
wouldn't be asking me on to this podcast and um you know so she's been a great support
and my kids you know were sort of part of well you know they they had to
come to work they you know when i was doing the rounds on a saturday morning or during weekends
i'd have push chairs and toddlers and you know they were just part of what was
going on and it had to sort of merge into one thing and what i've
successfully done is try and de-merge it and have you know a when i'm at work i'm
at work and when i'm a family i'm with family and that but that's taken a long time so the the
the balance is is something i think all entrepreneurs
suffer you say it's a balance you've not got right what was the indicator that
you didn't get it right how did you know you didn't get it right what was the symbol i was always knackered i was always sort of pretending not to
be i was always sort of yeah um
yeah it was i was internally coping with all the pressure where i could but i wasn't
doing that very well um so i think it was
sort of a combination of of of just realizing that
yeah this was all consuming it was it was it was really dragging and and i was very lucky i had
you know great friends who are still my friends from when i was a kid
and i didn't see them enough and you sort of in our business hospitality it
is weekends it's nights it's days it's it's it's all the time and when you take
it to a different country then you have to think well the day's just got longer and then and and it's got five years you
know go to new york got five hours longer and so yes it does take its toll what is
that toll you said about coping with pressure well i i i think you know i
i sit here today and i think i'm lucky because i think i got a great you know i i have great relationship
with my kids i you know it's my favorite thing it's been with with the family and
been being been with them all together um so um
but i think at times when you're trying to prove yourself i'm trying to prove that i could work in new york and
america i was trying to prove that we could open sewer houses and other
parts of the world i i think it it it it it was hard but
you know you suddenly then do realize that you have to sort of balance it
was it was there a point in your journey that was particular so the pressure becomes so much and you almost feel
within your being whether it's your health gives out or your your mental health or you get anxious where you think this is not
this is not sustainable i i i never thought it wasn't sustainable because i'm always such a
positive person but i think you know kirsty was great you know she kept saying you know we don't need any
more this is we don't need another house the world doesn't need another house nick you know
the you know you don't need to be on a plane all the time what who are you what are
you trying to prove and and there was a stage where i was buzzing around everywhere flying here
flying there and and thinking it it was all making a big difference but really and i think the pandemic taught
me that was the fact that there's better ways of using your time and what are those better ways of using
you well you know instead of buzzing around on a plane all the time and spending 12 hours in a city
and then going to another city or doing one night and one you sort of where
you know the teams are clever enough to put on a bit of a show for that that period of time so you're not
actually seeing really what's going on and it was just smarter ways of doing it and
and and also having a lot more trust in the senior leadership team and uh
letting him get on with it and thinking i didn't have to be everywhere for it to work and actually often it worked much
better when i wasn't around and and i mean i i i you know because they were able to
just get on with it not worry about what i was thinking all the time that sounds like great advice for a younger version of nick at the start of
What do you wish you had known?
the house journey what else would you say um now in hindsight you wish someone had maybe they said it but you'd wish
you had known about how to achieve get to where you are now or further um
but in a more effective whether that relates to health or finance way what what would be that advice you'd give to
that nick starting out on the server house journey well i've always been obsessed about the customer the member
and that was always my number one thing and the people who work for us so they they were my two obsessions and
i the advice i think i'd give to a young young young nick would be
you know let them take more don't think you have to you
know your team you know put it more onto your team to get on with it and don't try and do everything yourself and
also you know there's a there's a point when you have can prove yourself that you can
these things can work globally and you know there's a time when
you know you have to really properly delegate and let other people get on with it
what are the you know because one of the things that server house is known for is this quote-unquote brand and i know you don't like that word but this very um
i think i would say it was an aspirational brand people want to be a solo house person how much in intentionality i don't even
know if that's a word has gone into making that brand aspirational
i i i can't think of a time where we had a time where i was thinking about
making an aspirational brand i think it that's and if that's people's perception great
i'm really i'm i'm i'm that sounds good and
i i all i concentrated on what our members wanted and
they've created that they have created the the [Music]
the fact that you know there's a desirability to be part of a house and yes we and we and we
got a brilliant team brilliant membership teams globally we got we got people who really care people who
have been on the journey for a very long time and i think
with their help and with every house we have a determination to make it better
than the last house you know we always start with a fresh piece of paper we don't think well you know let's just
keep repeat repeat repeat we go new new new how can we make it better what are we going to change to make this
better what are we going to change to make it more efficient what are we going to change to make it better for the member
and i think our members really appreciate that and they see that and they talk about that
and that's probably what's created what you have just described what is in hospitality taught you about
Whats hospitality taught you about life?
life everything i sort of think
you know um it should be the national service your people should go into a year in hospitality because
i think it teaches you so much i mean i spoke earlier about me going into that kitchen and
really learning how to get on with people and from different backgrounds different countries different different
everything and i think it really teaches you you know to be part of a team and there's a
customer there's all your you know people you work with in the kitchen or the person cleaning the
dishes or a person you know cleaning the rooms it you all have to work together to make it happen
and i think so it really takes the shyness out of you and it gives you an ability to get on with
people which i think is a really useful tool i think it's better than a a maths degree i think getting on with
people i think um you learn you know just useful practical things
like making a bed or keeping a place tidy or clearing a table of plates and
and and when you when you've got a family gathering or something you can suddenly clear the plates and
stack them up or you can you can you can make a cocktail you know which is really nice you know you know
that doesn't you don't even if you're not in hospitality anymore you can still make a cocktail you can still make a bed you can still hopefully get on with
people you can still you know clear a table you you you have to become quite organized in your mind and i think
hospitality is a very rewarding industry for that hospitality is quite a quite a broad
term but at the crux of it what do you think it is that you're actually selling to people what are they buying from you well i
think what we want our member to do is flourish you know we want them to flourish
socially and we want them to flourish you know at work and i think creating
memberships and you know that word community of people who
are so like-minded and and they all have a creative soul and you
put them in in one house you know that is like
you know they bump into each other they talk to each other i've seen businesses created i've seen relationships created
friendships created ideas created and and i think when you put people together
in a space and and and it that is that is pretty special and
to see that happen in different countries and different cities to see members sort of really
using the fact that you go into the house you can just go into the house on your own just wander down there and you know you'll bump into someone you'll
start having a drink with someone or a cup of coffee with someone or you and you're sort of you you're in the house
you're part part of that membership and i and i you know people do it you know a
lot now and you know you can do it digitally and they use algebra ribbons and they use all sorts of things and i
think you know being part of cell hats and you know those 500 members i talked to you about
earlier you know they're still part of us they still pay their membership if they're still here they're still part of
it they don't give it up and and so you on one hand they the original
founder members of 27 28 years ago and then on the other hand you got you know
huge under-27 membership going into our houses huge you know it accounts for
to 23 of our overall membership you know under 27s and
it's it's seeing in a room you know the most successful script
writer in one corner and on in another corner there might be a struggling scriptwriter who's still
trying to write you know their first script or you know vr a really well-known artist or an artist who
hasn't sold a new painter who hasn't sold their first bit of work and
you know and taking that and and trying to think well how can the person who's done it help the person who wants to do
it and yeah that's why i'm so passionate about our mentoring scheme you're where
you know there is so much creativity in the world and there's so much creativity
you know and and creativity is not owned by the middle class it's everywhere and
to to be able to offer mentoring to people who are less fortunate who
Are you shy?
might not be able to afford a membership or might not know what door to knock to get that
opportunity is sort of one of the favorite things that we're doing my favorite things i'm doing
at the moment is seeing it happen so going back to what you were saying about creating
people in a room who all help each other they all feel like they're looking out for each other they all want to help
the person who who's down on their luck or who is is
is is is starting out or they want to help the the the
you know they want to create an idea with another bunch of members and i think that that that is special and it
goes back to seeing people in a room having a great time and and if our members can flourish
in in their lives if so our house can just make their lives just a little bit better then i think that's a good thing
are you naturally shy person i think so because it's funny because when i i meet
entrepreneurs there's various different types of entrepreneurs um once in a while i meet an entrepreneur
and a founder that's created a really great business but it's quite i think the word is unassuming as in they're not very self-promoting you know you ask
them certain questions about what their brilliance is for example and they they don't necessarily point at themselves they tend to defer it to
others so it just made me it's it's it's curious because it's kind of unconventional to me an entrepreneur
that's so that feels so unassuming in a sense in terms of
not having a huge ego i guess um because the question i was going to ask you and my head is going he's
probably not going to get a he might defer this to something else's you've created such an amazing business
and it's such a wonderful brand and it's it's admired by people that are customers and that aren't customers just
for for the business but i can't seem to get you to tell me
um why you out of everyone else that was trying
to do this was successful because i got the ambition piece i've got that persistence and that that
persistence that comes from that childhood sort of maybe chip on your shoulder but but
but i know there's more well i'm i can only tell you what i'm i i
think and i what i i do think is you know
i i i love what i do i'm lucky i get up every morning i have a skip in my steps
you know i'm skipping around i'm i'm looking forward to getting to work i i i have a fantastic team around and
um you know i care deeply and if that all adds up to
it working that's the reason why because it was never for me a money play it was
more a a thing that i wanted to try and make hospitality
you know and that is a i used to say catering but i've upgraded it to hospitality and and to make
hospitality a sort of area of where you can change it you can you know when we
open babington house you know it was a first country house hotel where you could get breakfast when you wanted when
there was no rules it was it was it was you know your your bedroom at badminton house probably nicer than your bedroom
at home so people would come down and go well nick you know um
you know where do you get that tv where do you sky that's new well i'm gonna put sky in my houses or i'm gonna where'd
you get those sheets and and so i'm not trying to avoid your question here
but i'm just trying to again answer how i feel and why i do it i did get
something more from that which is just your care yeah how much you care and your passion and your care seem to have
a relationship together but and that's that's so important because a lot of people would be launching it for money
and then therefore they'd care about something else whereas you really seem to care essentially about the customer experience more than anything else well
i i think i always say to our team as sort of if if our people are happy and that's the
members are happy then sort of everything else will look after itself because your places will be busy and if
you if you're smart and you're cost controlled it it it everything else should be fine do you
think you're a success i i i think i said earlier but success you
can judge success in lots of ways um you know i'd much rather be judged as a
father than as someone who runs a business and
you know i suppose you'd have to ask my kids that professionally do you think you're a success i
people tell me a lot and i i suppose i have to listen to them in in in in in
in their eyes i'm i i i've i've done all right you know i'm i'm still there i'm
still you know we're still growing it's you know sales go up you know it's it's it's a
good business in your eyes i think so i think if i was to be honest i couldn't sit here and look at you and
your eyes and say no i don't see what i've done as something which isn't successful because because it works and
when things work i presume that's a success and so what's next then for for you i
Whats next?
mean tremendous business all around the world and it's becoming so much more than just
houses what is the big next mental challenge ambition excitement
well we're recently public um and you know we went public during the
pandemic i'm enjoying that challenge really yes i'm enjoying it i'm enjoying
dealing with you know and i view all the analysts as smart and
and i think it's making us a better business and i think um you know so there's a journey on that
you know it's we're only 12 months into it and people understanding that it's a
subscription recurring income that you know a third of our revenues come
from membership and our our hotels our bedrooms are always
nicely full and we don't have to use what other hotels have to use to fill
their hotels like booking engines etc um i i so i i think
that is a a an interesting future on how to be properly successful on the on as a
public company um and there's so many more places we can open houses you know
we we haven't even touched africa we've only dipped our toe into asia we
we we got we're going to latin america later this year um to open in mexico so
there's a there's a there's a lot of exciting new houses opening um and
being a public company and just trying to get better every day we have a closing tradition on this
The last guests question
podcast where the previous guest uh leaves a question for the next guest and um the previous guest has left you a
question they have written they don't obviously don't know who they're writing it for but here we go um
if you could go back in time and change one specific moment in your life what would that be and why
oh um i would definitely have come up i
definitely would still would have done over the top i i would have done that um
one specific thing um i i think i would have
i would have tried to get my life at my balance between life and and and family
a bit better why
because you know running at 100 miles an hour overtime doesn't always
sort of you know achieve everything so i think i think and i've i've talked on the behalf of
many entrepreneurs and many ceos and who just get a bit obsessed and and about
their their world their business and i think you know you you slightly better of it if you're not so
if you have a more balanced view yeah i was actually talking to one of my friends about this last night that you'll know um that runs one of the big
big companies in this country that's a billion pound company and he was we were having the same conversation about just
trying to remember amongst all of this ambition that the like the actual most important question is like are you happy
yeah and and that's one that um i've definitely lost sight of for many many years of my life in the pursuit of
building more and more and more yeah and then eventually loneliness or some other kind of consequence will show up and remind me that
i've misprioritized but it's a it's a great subject now isn't it and i think
people come out with pandemic and they think there is you know we want our lives to be slightly more balanced and i think
i think you know that wasn't the case 25 years ago or 15
years ago or when you started your business it was it was you know it was that mission and i think
balance is good well thank you nick thank you so much for your time the generosity with your time and uh thank you for creating a
business that i love and that i that i'm probably at every week at current rate um and now thank you for being a member
yeah and you know i think most most of our team as well i bought memberships for
them as well and um you've created a business which brings a lot of people joy but but the thing that i actually love the most about your business which
is i think is a bit of a dying um human maslowa need is community and everything
whether it's the industry i worked in social media or whether it's other things or even remote working now seems to be taking community away from us
which seems to be so integral to like the huma being a human and so house and the brand is bringing that back and i
think that's why i would personally bet on that because i think um regardless of how the world change and technology and
all of that we're still going to always um love and have a desire for community so yeah i agree i agree
the human connection and people getting together and laughter and ideas and not doing it digitally doing it in a
physical space is is great to see thank you
quick one as you might know crafted one of the sponsors of this podcast and they make really meaningful pieces of
jewellery this lion piece they've made i wear all the time along with the little timepiece the sand timer that i wear
often and the lion piece you might have seen conor mcgregor has a similar piece which was custom made for him for me it
represents courage and if you walk through my house the house that i'm in right now if you walk six feet in that
direction you'll see a huge lion portrait if you go upstairs you'll see a lion portrait if you look behind me on
the shelf near the top there you'll see a line as well the reason my house and my life is surrounded by lions is
because they represent courage calmness and that tenacity that i've applied to my business success to my
professional life into everything in between for me the lion has always been an animal that can be almost a bit of a contradiction they are so loving and so
caring of their own and can be powerful and courageous when necessary in order
to achieve what they want to achieve so if you like me are a big fan of courage bravery ambition while also being
calm and composed check out this line piece and let me know if you get it

Transcription:

sorry now I'm getting emotional um
Malcolm Gladwell business Guru a rock star journalist I
just want to explain things to people it's not in your best interests to work at home if you're just sitting in your
pajamas in your bedroom is that the work life you want to live we want you to have a feeling of belonging and to feel
necessary and if you're not here it's really hard to do that what if you reduced your life to
the language of happiness has to go alongside the this question of what contribution you're making to the world
you live in if you could make an amazing contribution to society as you have at
the cost of your unhappiness would you choose that no wow
we're social animals casting someone out is the great sin it is not conflict that
drives people away it is neglect that's when you do harm sorry now I'm getting emotional um
it's varied I don't know sorry [Music]
if we don't feel like we're part of something important what's the point [Music]
so without further Ado I'm Stephen Bartlett and this is the Diary of a CEO I hope nobody's listening but if you are
then please keep this yourself [Music]
Early years
um first of all I want to say thank you I feel obliged to you because your books outliers blink have been very formative
for me as over the last 10 years since I was running my businesses and trying to understand certain dynamics that I
didn't understand those books seem to arrive in my life at the right time so it's a real honor to to get to speak to
you today oh thank you um going back then what are the what you know you've become a
tremendously well known and highly acclaimed writer and thinker and
podcaster but when I think back to your your early years says before 10 years old what were the factors that you look
back now in hindsight and connect and say Ah that's the reason I ended up becoming the person I am today
oh wow you you mean you say before the age of 10 yeah like sub 10. well I by at
the age of 10 I had been I had already lived in three countries wow Jamaica
maybe even four well Jamaica England and Canada
and it's possible a brief stint in the United States so I was well traveled
um although you know you're dimly aware of these things at that age um and I had a uh you know I have an
English father and a had an English father and a Jamaican mother so I was
conscious of myself as an outsider a little bit which I think is very
useful um and I was living in that point in
kind of Southwestern Ontario the kind of one of the
sleepiest but also most amazing places in
the West I mean a a place of kind of uh almost absurdly
happy people and no crime or dysfunction and you know 10 churches in every
village and uh a kind of I realize now in retrospect
a kind of magical place to have to I grew up without any kind of broader anxieties
so there was I was never scared of anything there was nothing to be scared of when I was when I was growing up um
which I realized now was probably an enormous blessing on that first point of realizing that you're a bit of an outsider why'd you
cite that as being a a good thing for a lot of people that leads to bullying and feeling you know feelings
of sort of social inadequacy but why'd you say that's a good thing well I think of it as liberating
you know I'll give you a small example when I first came to Canada I was six years old and in in rural Canada when
you're six all the boys have been playing ice hockey since they were in
skating since they were four so I remember very distinctly being aware of the fact that everyone
played hockey and I didn't and also being aware of the fact that wrongly but I felt that it was too late for me to
learn so I was permanently outside of hockey culture I was the only boy who didn't play which is incredibly
liberating which meant that I could choose none of them got to choose what they wanted to do right I did you know it so
it was like I didn't have to participate in these kind of uh compulsory rituals of
the Canadian upbringing um and having choices being an outsider it does allow you
a kind of range of Freedom that is denied people who are embedded in a culture
and what did you choose well eventually running
um but I think I chose just to you know the amount of time seven-year-olds spend playing hockey in
Canada is enormous I mean it's just so I think I just had more time to read and kind of it said full-time job for for an
eight-year-old or a seven-year-old um you know I just I I had a quite a
solitary childhood which again I think was a blessing um you know I think a lot of I didn't I
didn't I had time to kind of indulge my curiosity and read lots of books and
um I wasn't kind of I see a lot of children today pushed into unwanted
social interaction I don't understand what is it really necessary if you're if
you're seven you'd rather spend an evening by yourself isn't that fine I think it should be fine one of the things that I you know I
read about in uh the story of success was about the impact that parental
involvement at that young age and this is kind of maybe maybe somewhat linked to what we're talking about parental involvement can have on someone's
outcomes and I my parents were I was the youngest child of four so my parents had
resigned to the fact that they had to parent me so I had this huge freedom and I think I always cite that as being the
reason I went on to become an entrepreneur because I had this huge void of Independence but um so I wanted to get your take on
on that because I that led me to believe that less parental involvement would lead to
Greater Independence which would lead to better outcomes yeah but except that yes
I actually completely agree with you but I wonder whether um you know the kind of so if you're
describing a kind of benign neglect which is which youngest children I'm
also a youngest often encounter but benign neglect is not the same as a lack of Parental involvement because it's
it's benign neglect it's also it's considered neglect it's that your parents have simply they haven't removed
a safe structure around you the structure remains in place what they've removed they just stopped hovering over
you they realize it's no longer necessary or productive or they no longer have the time for it but they've
not abandoned you so you know I think it's you know sometimes I think we those of us who are
youngest um do our parents a little bit of a disservice when we when we when we describe their absence from our
childhood They're Not absent they're um they're just simply wiser in a way
that they that they uh that they they choose to parent yeah I thought my parents were absent but you're right
the house was still hot we had a reef over our head I was still attending
school yeah I got expelled ultimately for like 30 attendance but I was still kind of going you know I did the same
thing yeah I read about that I thought yeah we were similar but my mother was complicit in my my mother would was
quite happy if I chose to die oh really well I think she realized my mother is
quite subversive in a very very quiet West Indian kind of way and I think she understood that
if she chose to I didn't have any great desire to go to go to school on a regular basis I think
she realized that if she opposed that desire should make it worse so she decided instead to endorse it and
so it kind of she sort of diffused whatever rebellious intent I had
just by saying she would sign fake notes for me to give to the principal I mean she was wow
wow what about your father what was he like he said you were very very competitive
he thought I think he was competitive I don't know whether I think I was quite competitive but in a kind of at games
and at running um my father was a a very very
Englishman he was from Kent he was uh he liked dogs and
gardening and long walks in the rain uh he was
uh exceedingly intelligent but it combined with a kind of humility that
was and I realized that as I get older it's the humility that was the more important
um aspect of his uh personality so he would never he was
probably smarter than most people he met but he would never ever Make That explicit and he was if he
thought that you even had a slight edge of knowledge in some domain over him he would defer to you
which made him an incredibly curious he was curious about everything and would ask
he had friendships with people who had dropped out of school at the age of 10. I mean he was and he was a man with a
PhD in you know in mathematics um so he was a wonderful he was he was a
really wonderful role model for a uh for a little boy
How did you learn humility
how did you and why and how did you learn the value of that humility and the
impact and the importance of it when you're dealing with other people well I think it's because
you can't be a good journalist unless you have a kind of uh Baseline respect for what
others can teach you if you're going to interview be a good interviewer you must enter into every interview
with the expectation that you know less that the person you're interviewing has someone something to tell you
right and that's actually much more difficult than it sounds because nor in normal conversation we have an urge to
assert ourselves and we think we have a kind of um intellectual Advantage informational
advantage that's why we you watch people talk interruptions are all about often about
the other person asserting their superiority on that point someone says oh it'll take me forever to get
here the other person says no it won't right you can't be a journalist if you have to
turn that off if you want to Be an Effective interviewer you have to trust that this person ultimately can teach me
something that I can't learn on my own even if in the moment I'm not getting anywhere you just have to quiet that
voice and let them keep going and keep you know asking the right kind of
questions that requires an assertion of humility um it took me years to Kind of Perfect
that as a journalist um and I would watch it when I worked at the Washington Post I would watch the great journalists and
they all had that just that ability to kind of to to make it plain to whoever they were
talking to I know less than you that's why I'm having this that's why we're having this conversation right
it's a beautiful thing when it's done right when it's done well it's gonna be reflecting on various
people one of the people that made me reflect on the interesting he was Joe Rogan how he's he feels like such a bridge to
his audience listeners because he does come across as being tremendously humble regardless of who's who he's speaking to he always seems to understand his
intelligence as well who always calls himself a monkey yes that's a kind of yeah yeah well he yes
he well he has this wonderful thing um where he can put himself
he's squarely in the position of his listeners which is a really you know for
a for a host of of any kind of show like that is if you
can do that you can win you're going to win right he there's there's he's he's having the conversation that his
listeners wish they could be having with with these subjects in his in his uh on his show
When did you know you'd be a journalist?
on that point of Journalism at what point in your your early years did you was there any inclination that you might
become a journalist you might go into that profession if any never in the I mean I had thought about
I liked writing I didn't imagine that it was a profession it didn't occur to me that
you could actually make a living doing it so I always was thinking of other things I wanted to do and then I kind of
fell into it by accident after my after I I graduated from uh University so I I
never really I just I thought something you did on the side you know I I didn't it seemed unimaginable that somebody
would pay you to do this kind of work lack of Role Models lack of
I mean I think it's a it's a little bit of a if I grown up in you know New York or
Toronto or London I would have been much more aware of people who who
you know were in the creative professions but I grew up in a town of 4 000 people there were no one there was
no one in my town who made a living in the creative professions right you you wouldn't live in a small town like that
and do that so I didn't know I have friends who grew up in you know Manhattan and they they knew they knew
film my film filmmakers and actors and you know fiction writers and is as part
of their parents Circle when they're growing up I knew none of that what advice would you give to to people around that age say that you know early
The impact location has on your career
20s just maybe just graduated and thinking about going off into the world because I hear a lot of these these
stories about certain small factors can have such a tremendous impact on your outcomes like the city you live in would
you encourage you younger people to go and get into those big cities if they're if they're trying to
have careers in things like journalism or Media or whatever or business and how
much of a how much of a swing does that have because I always think you know I'm on Dragonstone and I see these entrepreneurs coming in and pitching tech companies and I always think
sometimes I think you're at like a 90 disadvantage versus just being over there on the west coast of America in
San Francisco um I I think sometimes I think it's more than a 90 disadvantage but situational
and environmental factors on outcomes it's always been this puzzle in many countries but particularly
United States about why do immigrants do so well and uh you know the one of the explanations
was immigrants to the United States have always been very aggressive about seeking educational opportunities or
maybe they brought with them education that so that was one argument for the longest time but now we realize actually
it's less that and more that they unlike many people many Native Americans are
willing to move where opportunities are so the the immigrants are mobile
in a way they don't have any Roots they don't have family that's keeping them in one place another they simply make a
beeline for the places where they can you know further
their own economic and personal interests the quickest and the most efficiently native
people don't do that too many encumbrances my advice to people young people is
always where do you want to move first question you should ask yourself
your your default should be you're going to move somewhere right don't fall in the Trap of doing
when you're 23 of doing the comfortable thing and staying near family and friends that's there'll be plenty of
time for that later only question on your mind should be where should I move and once you decide where you move I think a lot of other
things fall into place so if you are someone who imagines it you would like to start a
company in the tech world and then yeah move to move to Northern California or
Austin Texas or Tel Aviv or whatever you know go where the I think you're absolutely right you need to go where
the opportunity is it's not going to come to you magically and you are at a huge disadvantage if you're not there
it's it's just no question about that people have confused the efficiency of
digital communication the kind of um the logistical efficiency of digital
communication with emotional efficiency and kind of psychological efficiency it is it is only logistically efficient it
does not resolve the quiz and help someone trust you more or take a chance on you or get to know you in all of your
complexity yes I wish yeah it's one of the things my parents said to me at very young age was
Are people that work too much happy?
we lived in Devon which is you know Devon right down in the corner on the farm um and they they were very clear at
young age they said you've got to leave here so just just so you're all well aware for the four of us you have all
got to go out of this city so when we were all very clear on that and all of my friends are still there every single
one of them all of my best friends are still in Plymouth even if they went to University in another city they came
back um it's not to say that they're not happier than me and this is maybe my next question which is um because like because I hear that
immigrant tell all the time that immigrants tend to have better outcomes relatively whatever it might be but my
question becomes um are they happier and I say this actually because of a conversation I was having last night with my friend who has built his family
have built a billion dollar company in this country um the dad was the first generation immigrant here the dad is just
completely overwhelmed with work like he is obsessed to the point now the sun said to me last night I don't actually
think he could he knows what makes him happier little but because he was in survival mode when he came here they've got a billion dollars actually I think
it was worth five billion now but is he happy and I I sometimes ponder that the first
sort of generation immigrant is on survival mode the second generation has the chance of being in a maybe a
thriving self-actualization situation but I don't know if you had any light to shed on first generation
happiness I'm always I'm dubious of this so I I all this happiness stuff and I
say this and I'm I'm fully open to the possibility that I'm wrong but
um my understanding of happiness is because of the research on happiness is that it's a fairly stable
trait in other words there are people who are happy regardless of where they are and people
who are not or people who don't appear happy or people for whom happiness represents itself differently so I would
say of your friend's father you know maybe he is happy he just expresses it differently he built a
massive business he's made his family stable he's created a secure beachhead
in a whole new country you don't think that makes him happy when he puts his head on the pillow at night I think it
probably does it's just not just it's not the kind of lie on the beach read a good book happy but it sounds to me like
a pretty amazing set of accomplishments that would make him will he die happy
having done that yes he will I think I don't know I never met the man but I'm
just I'm wondering generally what's that people say they've never met a happy billionaire I just don't I don't believe that I
think they derive I think people who've who've um accomplished something like that they drive a different kind of
satisfaction from it but it doesn't it's not a lesser kind of satisfaction
um you know do I work more than most people if I look at the cohort of people I went
to college with University with do I work more than most of them yeah probably
uh do I spend less time you know uh watching movies and reading
books and going on holiday yes absolutely does that mean I'm less happy no I think I'm pretty happy
I you know it's like and I I just I yeah that's I'm a little bit skeptical of
this narrow definition of happiness so so I think I think it's based on this
idea that to be happy or whatever you have to have this kind of recipe of ingredients and they have to be equally
balanced you have to have you know strong interpersonal relationships or meaningful connections you have to have
you know exercise you know these kinds of things so when you see an individual who's so out of balance because they
they just work 20 you know every waking out of every day and they don't make time for friends families or walking the dog people and they're you know consumed
by it people from the outside go well that's that's not a happy person and you would I would think the science would support the fact that people tend to be
happier when they have stronger more meaningful relationships and they have more of more balance in their lives
generally yeah no I think so you understand I'm making so let's go back
to your friend's father so your friend's father is uh not someone about whom we can generalize yeah uh he's clearly a
you know he's an outlier of some um sword he's probably he's in I imagine there's a whole series of traits that
he's in the 99th percentile on probably incredibly intelligent incredibly driven you know list them all so that kind of
person is never going to have a balanced life I mean you could put him
in you know the the the the the cornfields of Iowa and say you're going to be a
you're going to be a farmer that's all you can do and he's gonna he's gonna live he's gonna be someone who's like
working you know 80 hours a week and right that's just his temperament so the question is what I'm saying is happiness
for him is probably going to look differently than happiness for lots of other people but he's highly unusual
for the average person yes balance is is appropriate but you didn't ask me about an average person you asked me about
someone who's who built built an enormous business from scratch yeah I worry I think I worry sometimes
part of the reason I think ask the questions for myself that I'm being dragged by my own like insecurity so I
sit here with a lot of you know successful maybe billionaire CEOs that have built these great companies and you find out that the reason they built them
is because their mother um in the case of one of my previous guests which was on two weeks ago who and he said this on the podcast he's got
a billion dollar beer company you find out because his mother when he was a young kid basically always convinced him he was never enough he should come into
his room smash his toys and say things to him to convince him that he was just never good enough so he's had this
almost neurotic obsessive drive to prove to the world that he is good enough and you wonder how voluntary that that that
drive is and what it's come at the cost of and is he really you know is this individual really
happy and fulfilled or are they just being pulled by their insecurities but you know there are maybe another way of
saying this is that um so to use that person as an example so he took uh uh a kind of trauma and
made something productive out of it yeah he had a great deal of certain personal
costs but he took something that might have defeated others and ended up contributing substantially to society I
wouldn't he may not be happy but I would describe his life as a Triumph right and the other thing I would say is
that the language of happiness has to go alongside the this question of what contribution you're making to the world
you live in that there are many people who are not personally happy but who make enormous contributions and that's
that's a parallel and in many cases far more important
um function you know was Florence Nightingale happy probably
probably not Jews she's supposed to tell from what I know about her life she had all kinds of psychological issues or
whatever but she made an enormous contribution that continues to this day right she started a Hulk you know so
there are like I said I would like to have a kind of I would like to the to evaluate people's
lives along a whole series of dimensions and understand that not everyone can satisfy each of those dimensions in any
moment one of those you know being happy feels like
something that I would like for me making a great contribution to society feels like something that others would
like from me and I I wonder you know which if you could make a huge this is
If you could make an amazing contribution to society at the cost of your happiness would you?
just a tangent here but if you could make it amazing you know contribution to
society as you have at the cost of your unhappiness would you choose that
depends on what the contribution was the contribution you've made in your life you've helped millions and millions oh I see uh
would I have done what I did if I thought it was coming at a significant cost to my own happiness yeah uh
probably not but then I think the world you know but if I was doing if I was a
you know uh a a biologist who had working on a breakthrough for some
disease I might the calculation might be different I mean I'm not saving lives
I'm entertaining people or enlightening them but it didn't read me they would be enlightened somewhere else I'm not
crucial to the functioning of society but if I was I might feel very differently I think
you know it's funny where the I'm I'm over here because I have this
um book now in paperback the bomber Mafia and it's a story of these
uh group of men pilots in the 1930s in America who have a dream about
a better way to fight Wars and they're all down in Alabama and they have these ideas about how the bomber
high altitude Precision bombing can revolutionize Warfare and save countless civilian lives their dream turns out to
be uh they can't pull it off in a second world war they they start out the war with
high hopes and by the end many of them have had their careers destroyed because they pursued an idea which didn't work
it didn't work at the time now it does work they really pioneered a kind of warfare that is
um essential to the way we think about war today and as as today you know saves countless lives didn't work in their
time frame so in a sense they sacrificed their career and large part of their happiness for uh uh for a future cause
they were long dead before it paid off am I glad they did that absolutely
would they be glad if you resurrected some of these guys from the dead and you
said look I know in 1936 you had a vision about how to make war better and it was finally realized during the
Kosovo campaign of the 90s 60 years later are you happy you did what you did
uh you do feel now that it was worth sacrificing your entire career over this lost cause because it turned out not to
be a lost cause and they would I'm sure from the grave they would say I am so grateful that I did what I did right
even though one of these guys one of them one of the heroes of the book is a man named Haywood Hansel
brilliant passionate romantic figure in the second world war
who has this extraordinary set of ideas about how to revolutionize the era war
in the second world war which he tries and fails to implement in the war against Japan and by his by the age of
40 he's this is a man who devoted his life to the Air Force he's a career his
father and grandfather they're all like career Military Officers he this is his
whole world he's basically through by the
by his late 30s he's just pushed out to pasture and spends the next 30 years of his life basically
as the guy who failed in the second world war right he would say it was worth it I think if
you think so yeah I think he did I think he would and I'm we should all be enormously grateful to him for making
that sacrifice um I I am grateful for them for making that
sacrifice but I tend to believe that people are more motivated by their own
ego than they typically often allow their own sense of like wanting to accomplish something so they can be
someone that accomplished something and I tend to actually think this probably from doing this podcast so much where I
often get to the root cause of a successful person's achievements and find out it was just time and time again it was just an insecurity from their
childhood it was they had it you know they were bullied they were beaten up and it's this almost involuntary pursuit to prove
the bully my mum uh being outcasted and being nearly black in an all-white
school to to fit in or to prove someone wrong and if and then you look at it from the outside and you clap and go oh
they were courageous or they were Brave no they were insecure so why wait why
why does it bother you that insecurity manifests itself as courage and absolutely doesn't I did a a tour of
this country where I opened the show and say you call me Brave I was actually just insecure yeah so it doesn't bother me I just think it's reality we didn't
talk and I think obviously in hindsight bias we we say oh this person will say courageous they were so intentional they had most of the time they were just
insecure like they didn't get Christmas presents and they were bad but that makes I like that though because it to
me to my mind it makes courage far more accessible when we realize that courage can have many many fathers I love it
yeah I think it's beautiful it's a beautiful notion and the idea people can take what can be harmful damaging
traumatic things like I was saying before and spin them into gold is this
is the this is the at the heart of what is so kind of Joyful about you the human
Spirit right it's it's incredible like that was actually the the headline of
the Guardian newspaper two weeks ago was my face with the title that said uh insecurity was my greatest motivator and
it was and it was because I never understood this idea that I was because I expelled from school dropped out of University after one lecture I never
understood this idea that other people thought I was Brave when and really I was like a coward running away from
things I didn't like fueled by insecurities like oh it was actually cowardice and insecurity if you're really being honest yeah and so go match
your point about these um you know these these people from the 1950s yeah 1950s 30s I wonder what there
driving underlying force was because well they were it's funny so there's a
little group of men and they call themselves the Brahma Mafia and they are
they're all in their 20s they're young men in the 1930s and
they're in the army and there's no such thing as the Air Force in the 1930s anywhere and Air Force is a division of the uh of the
Army in most countries and the people running armies in the 1930s think planes
are a joke they're a toy right and here are these young guys and they actually think planes are what the future of
warfare is and they feel they feel overlooked and ignored and they're you
know in the 1930s if you were in the Army you had to spend time you know learning how to ride a horse because the
Cavalry was still a thing and they would you know you'd have to groom your horses and you know Trot
around the and these guys think this is a joke right they're just this is the most absurd thing they've ever seen why
are we riding horses when we've invented this thing called an airplane which can fly hundreds of miles and drop bombs and
revolutionize Warfare and no one's listening to them and they they're they are
um they feel like they're outcasts who are in an institution that they don't belong in and they're they're
really at a loss and their solution is they're all up in Virginia right around the where military headquarters is in
America they decide to as a group move to the most remote
uh Air Force Base uh In America which when they say remote meaning as far as
possible kind of psychologically from Washington DC so they moved to this
little tiny corner of of Central Alabama um Montgomery Alabama which even today
Montgomery Alabama is the middle of nowhere and they want to be they want to be off by themselves and left a kind of
dream and they have a massive chip on their shoulder but about that who they
believe to be the the morons running the army so again you have a and they they
spark this kind of technological Revolution they dream big and reimagine
what work can be but it's all born of frustration uh isolation alienation
um rejection rejection I mean it's it's exactly what you're talking about here their motives they come across as these
heroic idealists and these brilliant kind of technological uh
thinkers that's not that's not how it begins psychologically they're disgruntled it begins as these
kind of lonely upset disgruntled they're like I'm sorry we're out of here we're
going to Alabama and they were they would they would get us only about 10 of them and they're on this I've been to
this Air Force Base even today it's like it is literally in the middle of nowhere and they're just like don't call you know basically they're like we're hiding
down here don't call us we're like on the you know as it happens it's such a
marvelous Story the second world war then breaks out when they're in the middle of all of this dreaming and
there's no one else who's been thinking about air War policy and so all of these
disgruntled guys get whisked out of Alabama and they occupy all the top positions in the U.S Air Force at the
beginning of the second world war so by magic by sheerus chance this group of
Misfits gets plunked into the center of the American Military machine when
America enters the war in 1942 um so it's like they get a lucky break I mean if if the second world war never
happened they might still be there like you know fussing and groaning and grumbling and which is this other thing
that you know uh thing that I've observed in I'm sure you've seen the
same thing in doing this in doing this podcast is the amount of times that sheer Serendipity unleashes this allows
the innovator to turn their um disgruntlement and Neurosis into gold
right it's just something random happens and boom that they they see a window and
they think that's it right that's a shaft of light that's my light
um but if the window been closed they could still be disgruntled and running around history will never know the history will
never remember that yeah we never look back and see that that outcome so even
in that case it sounded like that one of their initial driving motivators was more like I told you so so going back to
your point about would they be happy today because they never got that particular I Told You So moment before
they before they died no they yes they would have had to live to uh you know a
hundred and hundred years old to get out to get there I told you so a moment the question I would have liked to ask them
is did they did they still have faith at the time of their death that their
vision would be realized at some point so there's a whole class of
of uh innovators who pursue an idea and then
they're just early right and it comes to fruition afterwards it's a famous case
of a I've forgotten his name but there was an American um biochemist who had this idea for how
to fight cancer tumors um by starving the
cancer tumors grow you know blood feeds them they have all these blood vessels that they connect that's how they and
his idea was let's choke the supply of blood to tumors and we can kill them that way and it's called angiogenesis
and physical nitrogenesis someone will correct me anyway he had this idea in the 60s and he it takes him sort of 30
years to figure out that it works and I I've often wondered and then he dies but
he gets eat just before he dies he has this kind of finally boom he demonstrates that his
life's ambition actually works I've always wondered had he died like just before
the moment of would he have died happy did he die believing it would someday come his his
notion which is in which is kind of if you think about it it's it's intuitively it makes sense if I can
starve the tumor of of blood of its blood supply I should be able to choke the tumor that's it's a as
an idea if I just explain that to you none of us knew anything I'm guessing about medicine it makes sense right so
he has this idea in 1960 whatever it is and I think his faith was strong enough that
had he died before proof of concept he would still have died happy I think I
don't know though I would love to have asked him that to have asked about a hypothetical question
I mean another thing I've learned from this podcast is generally that the destination is just a thing that goal
ultimate goal is just a thing that gives us orientation but we're always on a journey and I imagine if he had
accomplished that one he would have set off on another one another Journey so um one would assert that because he was
striving towards a meaningful goal I always say you know when people ask me what I want for my life now I say if I'm striving towards the meaning for goals
surrounded by people I love and I feel I feel somewhat challenged I am happy yeah and the minute I'm no longer striving so
the goal is complete or I'm not around people I love and it's not challenging me it's not outside sort of the outer limit of my comfort zone Then I then
The key to Innovation is delusion and lucky timing
you're not satisfied so he sounds like someone that was striving towards a goal a meaningful goal and that was
challenging him so I imagine accepted lots of other people began to
believe that he was wasting his time so he has that he has he is surrounded by a small
Court of people who believe in him and presumably a long-suffering wife but
uh the general World in which he's operating is rolling their eyes by the end and that's his that's his challenge
that's his challenge so I mean that by the way as you know incredibly typical of I mean this this goes into one of my
I'm I'm actually obsessed with this and this is one of the reasons I wanted to write about our Mafia because it is a perfect example of
this idea that it's incredibly simple but is so often overlooked when we look at Innovation everyone
including the innovator radically underestimates how much time it takes to bring an idea to fruition so
the reason most innovators do what they do is not that they have a
clear picture but rather they are they are massively deluded about their own their
own idea they think it's so obvious and they should be able to pull it off in you know five years if they realized it
would take 30 they would never do it right so they're they're their their success is based on this illusion
they're by definition delusional um and every but everyone everyone involved always thinks that just because
I can describe it clearly and I can make a case or what I'm doing I should be
able to will it into being overnight right and I I there's not a single
can you come up with a single significant Innovation that took less time than the innovator imagined
no just never happens yeah for so many reasons yeah I mean legislations that
weren't often the big one yeah that goes in the way of anything there's a hundred reasons why everything is takes longer
yeah um like the the Battle of Lafayette honestly believed in an idea they hatched about
completely revising the way war is fought they thought that you could fight a war entirely from the air
you would no longer need armies tanks Navy anything all you would need is bombers they thought you could fight the
entire second world war with a fleet of bombers okay they had this idea in 19 let's say 35. they thought they could
pull it off when the war starts in 1942 they thought they could pull it off seven years later
we can't even pull it off today we're getting close but like it's been they underestimated
how long it would take to bring this idea to fruition by like basically half a century right that's the that's what
they're doing but everyone has this delusion do you know how long my favorite example is the the automated teller machine the
cash machine is invented if I'm not mistaken in the early 1970s now if the guy who
invented it there's a guy forgot his name we had him right here right now and we said when you came up with this idea
and whatever it was in 1973 how long do you think it would take to spread this idea throughout the
entire world he would have told you it'll be all done by 1980. it's a no-brainer couldn't be easier I'm making
everyone's life easier Banks like consumers like it it's cash out of a machine all you got to do is punch in a
code this is the this is not like computers or I'm not changing anyone's
life everyone wins you know how long it actually took it took 25 years to make an ATM machine to make it popular ATM
machines take they're not so they're invented in the early 70s and they're not really everywhere until the mid 90s
in the West why they don't you tell me take a long time
consumer Behavior has got to change and they've got to make space for them and it turns out it turns out it's complicated consumers took a long time
to my mother is still not taking any money out of anything you know so you know she's still I mean
she's 90. she may eventually but you know it turns out people are the
thing that that guy and all of us didn't understand is so when it comes to how we handle how we deal psychologically with
money we are extremely conservative so I can give you the I can sit you down
and say never have to line up in a bank again 24-hour access to money and you will
still it'll take a generation for you to warm up to it a generation yeah that's it isn't it because the generation is
going to pass because that's too stubborn to change yeah interesting you write a lot about this idea of timing
The importance of timing
you've written about it in outlines I believe about the importance of timing now everything you've said there makes
me feel maybe a little bit scared as an as an innovator an entrepreneur because I might be 50 years out and listen I'm
trying to quench these insecurities now so I I can't wait 50 years what have you learned about how we can
um improve our timing or understand if our timing is good is that even possible is it possible to
know if our timing is good when it comes to inventing things creating things launching a podcast are we too late
people say that to me a lot is this too late to be starting a podcast you know yeah
okay cat is timing something we can control or does it just live in hindsight I well I do think a lot of
people claim to understand timing and really what they're doing is they're they were just
lucky and they're after the fact assigning themselves you know a pat on
the back for what um that is not to say though that there aren't people who
have a kind of um at least in flashes have their finger
on the pulse of some kind of marketplace Steve Jobs comes to mind with
yeah think about Steve Jobs of course is that he's not he's not a Pioneer in anything
so he's always late he's late to every Market that he eventually wins so his
genius was an understanding that being first is massively overrated he's 10 he's 10 years late on the smartphone
he's you know every all of the ideas that go into the first uh the Macintosh computer
are all taken from Xerox Park he didn't demand any of that stuff he's
so his genius was in understanding that if you are the first person and you're probably too early interesting but also and he understands
as well that um that in that world of consumer electronics
um you're better off being the person who tweaks the idea than the person who
truly innovates in other words what consumers are interested in is a kind of mature
experience with their Electronics the average consumer doesn't really want to be the one who's pioneering how to
work a kind of you know stage one laptop or home
computer or they don't want the remember I don't know if you remember the Palm Pilot Palm Pilot was an early a way too
early smartphone that was big in the kind of 90s and it it was for it was used by a very small number of very
technical technologically focused people jobs would have looked at that and said
you're never going to win selling a Palm Pilot it's just not you need to kind of tweak it two steps
and make it something that an average person would want to use he was very commercial in the way that he
um approached uh uh product Innovation that was his genius so he's in some
sense I think he is exactly what you're talking about someone who um who had an uncanny sense of how to
bring something to a mass Market and when the time was right to do so
yeah although he yes when I when the time and when the time was right yeah he did a very good job of never being too
early the weird concept of being too early but not one that people are that familiar of
The power of writing
between the ages of um 24 and 34 you spend 10 years working at The Washington Post yeah what was what did you you know
that was your 10 000 hours per se what did that give you that in hindsight you realize has been so sort of foundational
and important and significant to what you went on to do those those are 10 years
well it taught me when I was talking earlier about that thing about reporting
requiring a kind of fundamental humility it that was
uh uh was hammered home in those years
um I also learned to write without anxiety so you can't be a newspaper reporter
if you have any Neurosis whatsoever about the act of writing you just have
to you know you have a limited amount of time the discipline of being forced to write something every day in a limited
amount of time for 10 years um cured me of
a writer's block ing anxiety you know hey you can't be that way you're right it's just like
it's like a it's like a boot camp for writers it just is it um that was
enormously um useful in [Music] um in kind of freeing me up to spend my
mental energies on other parts of the writing process right what about writing generally and the
value that and role that writing has played on your self-awareness your personal development
because you know we're living in a generation I think where writing is becoming less popular and maybe even
less necessary maybe that's true maybe it's not um but I because I do this podcast
because I have other obligations to write because I have a Instagram following of millions of people that expect me to write things every day
I started having to write like it was the discipline I had to do it at 7 pm I had to post something and it only in
hindsight I've reflected on how much that changed my life it helped me understand the world I was living in because every day I have to say
something that's true and in hindsight I go [ __ ] I wish someone had told me how how much I think
I could Advance my wisdom understand myself just by having having some kind of commitment to
publish every day more from like a personal perspective you know I'm wondering if that's if it's if you found a similar
thing I tend to think writers people that have a something making them right every day and publish are infinitely
just so much more wise and Incredibly more self-aware similar thing with podcasters to be
there so I think of curiosity as a habit not a trait um and I think that too often we think
of it as a trait not a habit by that distinction I mean it's not people are not naturally
curious or not not naturally curious they there are people who have cultivated the habit of curiosity and
those who have led at life life fallow what you're describing is an institutionalized a way of
institutionalizing the habit of curiosity if you are required to write something every day
then you are you've put yourself in a position where you're forced to think
about and look for things to write about every day that's institutionalizing the habit of curiosity right I think all
successfully curious people do that in one form or another put themselves in situations where they have to come up
with some new idea or have to are forced to look for interesting new things or you
know why you know um anyone who has ambition does this for
many people the idea you know ambition is very often rooted in a sense of dissatisfaction
with your current state of knowledge um or practice what does what does
dissatisfaction do it is another institutionalization of the habit of curiosity it forces your your
unhappiness and dissatisfaction with what you know forces you to go out and
look for a solution to that feeling right find things that to keep going and
you know instead of stopping get up and look again and so these are all versions
of the same um of the same thing so I I sort of agree with you that there's
writers who have obligations writing obligations do it's a tremendous
advantage in terms of of um of uh pushing pushing them to kind of
think freely about things The Tipping Point in you wrote that book in 2000 yeah
did that change your life well it uh it was it it allowed me to
think you could make a living writing books and it validated my feeling that the way in which I wanted to write books
had an audience so I was on I didn't know I had a particular way that I wanted to write
books but I didn't know whether anyone else liked it shared my Approach so that book
made me think oh okay there's a there's a universe of people out there who
um who are into this kind of thing and that was that was again freeing you know at each stage in my career I've been
lucky enough to go through experiences that allow me to shed various anxieties The Washington Post sheds anxiety about
writing Tipping Point sheds anxiety about whether the kind of writing I want to do
as an audience those are two enormously freeing things what was the way that you
wanted to write that you were unsure if the public would receive I wanted to jump around and go on lots
of digressions I wanted to use uh I wanted to make ideas as
make adventure stories around ideas not about necessarily around people or narratives
I wanted to kind of ransack the academic world for really interesting insights
and apply them to kind of everyday stories I wanted to kind of like
it's an idea of like um making a book that is a jumble of
different genres right so in the course of reading a chapter you should
entertain a new idea meet an interesting person be have something that you believe
challenged it should be fine to have all those components in one chapter of a book and the next chapter it should be fine
to move on to something completely different that was what I wanted to do I wanted to jump around all the success you've had as a writer
Public speaking tactics
has resulted in you now being doing a lot of public speaking one of the things when I was reading about your your sort of philosophy
towards public speaking that surprised me was that um you say you don't try and start a
public talk with a wow with it with a wow moment I think the
quote was that never starts his talks with a wow moment or anything to hook them in but it says tries to draw them in slowly
and this surprised me because I I've always thought that the opposite approach was better as in like when you
walk on stage people are typically on their phones whatever and you don't have their attention so trying to get them to
pay attention within the first 10 seconds by saying something that is somewhat I don't know
provocative was a better approach I was Keen to hear why you take that stance
the question is what do you want your audience and in this sense it's no different from
writing what is the experience you want your audience to
go through you have them for whatever 45 minutes an hour and I want them to feel that they have
progressed I don't necessarily want them to agree with everything I said or think I'm
wonderful that's not important I want to be in a different place than they were at the beginning so to have thought
about something that they hadn't thought about to have moved their position on something a little bit to be emotionally
in a different place so if they started out one way I want them to be something somewhere else they started out
distracted I love them to end up being focused I just want movement right so My
worry is when you start with a bang is you compromise the movement so
if for example I'm I want them to be amused their journeyed to be a journey
towards Amusement if the first thing I do is tell them an incredibly funny joke the Journey's over
right it's about time so the central problem of these speeches is
that they've committed like I say 45 minutes to an hour that's a long time and everything has to be
about that you have to think about that time frame you're telling a story Within
a 60-minute window right and they're going to judge you by how they feel in the 60th minute not how they feel in the
a minute one um movies you know the movie that fails you sit in a two-hour movie and you're
enthralled for the first 90 minutes and then it falls apart in the end you leave unhappy you have never I you have never
given a movie recommendation where you said the following you should totally go and see that movie the first hour is
amazing now I will warn you the second hour is terrible yeah you never do that right yeah you would actually but you
would say oh you should totally see it it'll be it'll start a little slow and you'll wonder why you're there but wow
the last hour that you would say I've described to you this you know from a
logical perspective the same experience 50 good 50 bad but all I've done is if
by by putting the bad first and the good second I've made it something you recommend and by reversing it I've made
it something that you would never tell a friend to do right I actually talk a lot about to my team about how um people
remember this the peak and the end of an experience and all the like psychology tests they do and big tech companies use
this as a way to um create a more memorable recollection of any of the sort of customer
experiences and also of the studies they've done on whether if someone misses the flight at the start of their holiday versus if they miss at the end
of the holiday the recollection of the holidays drastically different exactly they missed it at the end this [ __ ] awful holiday there yeah so that makes
sense but my I think my thing is I wouldn't even have their attention at the peak of the experience or the story if I haven't held them at the start with
some kind of promise and we actually see this with like Mr Beast who's the biggest YouTuber in the world
much of the reason he says he's successful and now you 100 million subscribers fastest growing YouTuber
over the last five years is because he will at the start of the video and this is a little bit to do with algorithms he
will tell you the promise he's making you that you're going to get at the end so he'll do something in the end like
uh he'll basically create the plot in the first 10 seconds and go in this video I buy a million iPhones and then I
text them all at the same time and you're now waiting till the end to
see the plot realized I guess well he's he's promising to tell you a story yeah right so with most stories if you go and
see a um if you if you pick up a mystery book mystery story
um it's the same thing by virtue of being described as a mystery it's making a promise the promise is I'm going to
you know create some I'm going to lead you to a dark place where you don't know where the solution
is and I'm going to give you the solution so like that yeah he's he's when you when you when you make the
contract with your audience and the contract says I'm telling you a story
you can hold them without you don't have to why you're not wowing them but you are you are binding them to you if you
can if you're promising a story then you deliver on that now he's probably promised successfully come through so many times
now that people believe him when he says I'm going to tell you a story they believed and they're quite willing to
sit and wait for the for the the you know the the the the story to be
completed he actually just say that he says the second thing is you actually have to deliver the the punchline of that story
I am so excited to announce our new sponsor for this podcast and that is Blue Jeans by Verizon for any of you
that aren't already familiar with blue jeans they are a video conferencing and collaboration tool who offer an immersive communication experience that
drives pretty unparalleled employee and customer engagement experiences me and all of my teams across all of my
portfolio companies switched over to Blue Jeans a couple of months ago and we have not looked back the best thing for
us has been the totally frictionless experience no glitching no sound issues
no delays or any of those things that usually make virtual meetings really really frustrating we use blue jeans
anywhere on any device at any time and it's perfect for my small businesses that just have 10 or 20 people to some
of my bigger businesses that have hundreds of people I'm a big fan as you can probably tell so I've been quite excited for for some time to announce
this partnership and in the coming weeks I'll explain the features and really why it's perfect for you if you haven't
considered using or switch over to Blue Jeans yeah but if you can't wait head over to bluejeans.com to learn more
honestly it's been one of the real sort of game changers in my business my girlfriend came upstairs yesterday when
I was having a shower and she said to me that she tried the heel protein shake which lives on my fridge over there and she said it's amazing low calories you
get your 20 odd grams of protein you get your 26 vitamins and minerals and it's nutritionally complete in the protein
space there's lots of things but it's hard to find something that is nice especially when consumed just with water
and that is nutritionally complete and that has about 100 calories in total
while also giving you your 20 grams of protein if you haven't tried the heel
protein product do give it a try The Salted Caramel one if you put some ice cubes in it and you put it in a blender
and you try it is as good as pretty much any milkshake on the market just mixed
with water it's been a game changer for me because I'm trying to drop my calorie intake and I'm trying to be a little bit more healthy with my diet so this is
where he all fits in my life thank you heal for making a product that I actually like The Salted Caramel is my favorite I've got the banana one here
which is the one my girlfriend likes but for me salted caramel is the one
Are you an emotional person?
are you um are you an emotional person do you consider yourself to be an emotional person yeah
does that does that impact your your writing and your storytelling and your your
um authorship if that's even a word in my podcast very much so less so in my books
um because audio is so much more emotional um so a lot of my religious history
episodes um many of them are quite emotional
um and uh they're the ones that I value the most the ones particularly the ones that
kind of um this in this season for example there's two episodes
which one will almost certainly make the majority of those who listen cry
um and that's something you can do in audio and that I think is great accomplishment
real tears not kind of um
uh not you know there are some people who kind of cheat their way to tears manipulate the way the audience but
well-earned tears um on that I love that kind of Storytelling where you can move someone
so deeply that they will respond emotionally to what you're saying I saw a quote actually from you that
said um I cry but I don't get mad I cried but I don't get angry that was it yeah I don't really get angry much
[Music] I I don't come from my I don't come from a family that does anger I don't sort of
see the point it never gets you what you want it doesn't make sense rationally
it feels terrible emotionally it just makes everything everyone is
worse off and unhappier after the angry episode than before so it's like if you
remind me why this is some I mean I if I have I try to kind of squelch it whenever I
have an Impulse to do and then I just find it goes away the impulse when was the last time you cried
oh I don't know two days ago really yeah
I tend to cry most often when I'm by myself I think about something that causes me to
get emotional is it typically in your writing or is it is it you think no I'd be walking down
the street and I would um I will I will be pursuing a line of thought that will
bring tears to my eyes really
is that what happened two days ago oh you're walking down the street and oh
are you able to share what that line of thought was I was thinking about my father right uh
I was with my daughter taking her she's 10 months she's in the little baby carrier
and I uh uh my father never met you know died before she was born and uh
I would dearly have love for him to meet her and they have a lot in common I think
although it's hard to tell at 10 months but um it seems to my mind they have a lot in common and I was just reflecting on how
lovely would have been for them to meet
you're a person of Faith right so you believe you're Christian
Christianity or yeah that's the tradition of Griffin yeah yeah same I grew up in Christianity my we were
always in charge growing up until I was about 18 years old how has that impacted the way that you see the world and your
your work and your writing and even that particular moment because um being of the Christian faith I
imagine that oh I'm guessing here so excuse me if the guess is wrong but I imagine that your belief is that he is
here and he has meta
uh yeah yes I do think that uh
sorry now I'm getting emotional um
yeah I do believe that why is that um why does that make you so
emotional um [Music]
it's varied I don't know sorry
it's very difficult for me to talk with my father without
uh his loss was that
just the saddest thing that ever happened to me
that's right I I would be fine I'm you know it's it's in many respects a
very beautiful thing what you're saying in in the sense of his um
the love you clearly have for the man
I I um I always feel particularly moved when people talk about their fathers and I've talked about someone's podcast a lot because I I'm living with this kind
of ongoing regret ongoing forecast of regret that I'm gonna regret
my father is not at a young age and and we're not so close and we don't have a
close relationship and I can't seem to figure out why I don't do something about it so one of these
stories like that I think it's this could really Stark reminder to me that like parents don't live forever and I'm
living with that illusion that my parents are going to live forever and I'm also forecasting the regret based on speaking to people like you if that
makes sense I'm like it's when people say what do you regret I think I say I think I'm going to regret
not um not having a close relationship with my parents when they're gone
yeah well one of the ways you realize that you're
uh grief is one of the ways you keep them alive
[Music] you know the the thing I feared the most
when my father died was that uh was it I would forget him
and my grief reminds me that I am not and so
it's very it's very valuable it's um if I was if I was not
uh moved by the by thinking about him that would be a a great tragedy in my mind
but is there a cost to that grief
I think so I mean I think it's a kind of uh
I said it keeps him alive um and it reminds me
somebody a friend of mine once wrote uh uh in a book about his own father
that my father he wrote the following line my father died 25 years ago
I know him better now than I ever did back then um
which I think is one of the most beautiful lines true lines that I've ever
read and I I as time passes
I see that more and more true of my own father that I I feel I know
him better now than I did when he was alive um
and it's hard to explain why that's true but I uh
but um and I feel like if I were to ask my father
about how sad he was about dying the knowledge that
I know him better now than he did and I did when he was alive would make his he would find out that
fact would make his passing easier in his own mind if that makes sense it's getting awfully convoluted but I feel
like it's one of the things that makes death of a loved one less tragic is that you have an opportunity to get
them to know them better um I realize that's hard to it's a very
hard concept to explain it's very difficult for me to explain when I read that it just seemed it seemed so
enormously resonant and true [Music] um that something about
the opportunity to kind of reflect on them over an extended period of time
and to see them reflected in you know I mentioned my daughter to see my father's reflection in her
clarifies my father in my in my mind you know that specific traits that are
um that are popping up in her everything from the the size and my father had an enormous head my daughter
has a truly enormous head and I look at her head and I think
that's him that's you know like but uh
we have wandered off into all manner of
complex territory yeah it tends to happen on this in this conversations but it's really interesting that that
expression because I was thinking about how I recently had um someone I knew I knew passed away and the process that
happens in in the wake of their passing is you first as you would perfectly saying they were very well in person in
this country they Trend number one and you you see this outpouring of the impact they had on others and you go oh
my God it wasn't just me that felt that way about this person but then their parents came here and sat on the sofa
and we just compared notes about this individual and you can start to see as you kind of describe it there the
patterns and oh yeah no and and it's almost like the investigation starts once they're gone and yeah yeah
and so that's why that was that quote particular quote was so resonant Timmy um
Why some relationships last and other don’t
on the topic of relationships one of the things that I am in your book blink in the first chapter you talk about John
just John gottman oh yeah I read about John gottman completely separately I read about his when I was trying to read
about relationships and what ruins relationships I read about this idea of contempt ing them yeah I actually when I talked
about my show that went up and down this country in the show I talk about professor John gottman I talk about contempt and how that's this Insidious
little hard to see force in relationships but you actually got to meet him what did that teach you about
relationships and um and the ones that are going to last in
those that are gonna yeah
kind of obvious but crucially important point which is a reminder of how we're social animals and
casting someone out is the Great um
is the great sin the great injury not being angry with someone or or anger is
wrong word but government is clear that anger is not a predictor of
the expression of anger is not a predictor of the failure of a relationship the expression of contempt is
um and he makes that crucial distinction that if I confront you over something
that I'm unhappy about I am the implicit understanding is I'm doing this because your our relationship
is of such importance to me that an injury needs to be addressed right
contempt is where you have given up on the relationship like ah what's the point right it doesn't matter
and that idea that it doesn't matter whatever is worse than I can't believe
you did that super interesting and it made me kind of think a lot about
um would it you know if you're thinking about building
organization structures relationships family anything that's that that
is keeps people engaged and happy over the long term understanding that distinction is
crucial it is not conflict that drives people away it is neglect
right and not every encounter has to be positive to be useful
and you know when I when I thinking about the team I work with on my podcast revisions history for example
we know many of them are much younger than me and uh there are things I can teach them and I have a choice do I
bring this up look guys we screwed up on this this isn't good or I let it slide my
personality is such that I often would let things slide otherwise no no that's wrong and that's I am I am impairing our
relationship by letting I think I'm in the moment helping things just by letting my irritation not get the better
of me no I'm impairing a relationship when I say to them this isn't good work
and here's how it can be better I am affirming to them that they are part of my team
and when I just shrug and say whatever then they become Superfluous right I
have truly injured them in that moment this idea that that's a lot of what effective management is is
um is implicitly ensuring subordinates that they belong
that you're you're part of the team even if that's manifested as in
in terms of approbation or conflict or what have you um
uh and that neglect is the is that neglect is the enemy and in this
shoe in families as well right neglect is the enemy the thing that you can't we were talking earlier about about benign
neglect benign's the key word right considered neglect is fine but when you turn your back on a child
that's when that's when you do harm um and you know none of us were talking
about our parents turning their backs on us they were watching from far and not doing anything totally different yeah
totally different it's actually completely changed my perspective on my own childhood because you're right I
always thought of them like it being a form of like bad parenting but it but in fact I they loved me very much and they
were there at a house and I was safe and I had a foundation to to flourish in
without that if I wasn't out on the street you know yeah
lovelessly which I actually think would have been even worse than being hungry just being Loveless uh completely Loveless and love again even in my child
we weren't maybe an affectionate family I still don't call my parents by mum and dad I still call them by their first names not really but I knew yeah it's
weird it's very strange it just I think it started as a joke my mum saying she felt old if we called her mum and she
wanted to be our friends and it was just a joke that I was born into and never knew otherwise so I call them by their
first names but I was still well that they loved me because it was this it was it was actions it was like trying to you
know being there whenever I was at danger those kind of things like um as opposed to smothering
Feedback & meaningful work
that's really interesting though that idea and it kind of does it's a bit of a narrative violation that by giving
feedback and by being honest and constructive in your feedback you're actually
showing people that you in even in a professional sense that you that you care and that you are together on this
yeah you're not you're yeah that they are necessary to the process right it's that feeling of of of of that
they've if they feel they are necessary then you have you know we've noticed this I've started this little company on
this Audio company with my friend Jacob Weisberg called Pushkin produces all of our podcasts and others um and you know
we've noticed that the people like every small company we have people who come and go
and the people who go are the ones who this is an obvious
observation but it's an interesting one the people who have tended to leave are the ones who are the most socially
disconnected from their organization so who came into the office the least or who were not were
based in another city and we hired them largely to do remote work or they have they don't feel it's very hard to feel
necessary when you're physically disconnected and um you know as as we Face the battle
that all organizations are facing now and getting people back into the office that this people it's really hard to
explain this core psychological truth which is we want you to have a feeling of belonging and to feel necessary we and
we wanted you to join our team and if you're not here it's really hard to do that it's not in
your best interest to work at home I know it's a hassle to come to the office but like you know if you work if you're
just sitting in your pajamas in your bedroom is that the work life you want to live right don't you want to feel
part of something I mean it just I I I I'm really getting
very frustrated with the inability of people in positions of leadership to
explain this effectively to their employees that
um if we don't feel like we're part of something important what's the point
it's not you're not just doing this to get a if it's just a paycheck then it's like then you what if you reduced
your life to right it has to be I don't know I I this really is getting
me kind of I was in I was in Los Angeles a few weeks ago and um
I was pitching some idea to a studio I went to two Studios
I won't name them both have these beautiful gorgeous fancy offices other
sorts you only see in LA right fantastic you know sun is shining you go into the parking lot and there are no cars there
and you go into these places where they normally would have 500 people and there are four now they say it's because of
covet it's not covered it's just they they just did everyone's just decided they want to work at home like this is a
business that is in they are in the business of forging an emotional connection through storytelling to an
audience and they cannot even form an emotional connection to their own employees right what is going on here
this is nuts you're totally preaching to the choir by the way because I've had
this I've had this conversation with with all of my companies in all of my teams and even the people in this room now know I've spoken to them about it
I've wrote a letter and I said listen we believe in um interperson in all connection the value of it this is why
we've never done this podcast on Zoom even in the pandemic yeah because I because part of the reason I do it is
because of this and what I'm not doing it to publish an episode I'm doing it
because I like to meet someone and connect with them if you take that away from it I don't want to do the podcast and it's the same with my work like we
ran a company who was that when we had 700 employees we were no tourists for company culture for having this where
the office was like a community center you know everything happened there and our employee base again as the BBC wrote
were on average about 21 22 years old the minute the pandemic comes around for the first time ever we see people
quitting on mass because Suddenly It's them doing a to-do list in the boxer
shorts at home and the only upside we're bringing them in their life the only sort of remuneration we're giving them
other than you know the work is interesting whatever is pay it literally then becomes the pay we're giving versus
the company down the road that are paying you to set in your box of shorts and do your to-do list so it became pay versus pay and to be honest there were
other people that were willing to pay more so we we saw tons of people leave and I realized that Central to the value
that we bring to these people's lives is community and togetherness and connection so I fully fully believe in
it and I also think that and this is a controversial thing to say people don't
typically know what's right for them and and I'm not saying it's just the context of work I'm saying like look at other
areas of our life where we've sacrificed Community for productivity or efficiency where maybe we now sit at home and tap a
glass screen to get our food and then swipe on a glass screen to get a date and then click double tap uh photos like
that's probably what you would have chosen through convenience but then the cost on happiness which you don't get to
see when you make that transaction so I I think I said to all my companies and even some of my foreign companies
like the most important thing for me is to give you Clarity on who we are then you can decide where you work yeah and
the problem we've seen over the last couple of years is spineless virtue signaling scared CEO specifically that
are in San Francisco like the Facebooks and the twitters who all had to follow the same kind of leftist do whatever you
want without realizing that company culture should be reverse engineered from your company's mission
and if and when you think about your company's Mission the thing that will help you achieve your company's mission is connectiveness is employee retention
is the sense of community is all the other things other than just pay these are all so
um when you think about it from that perspective thing in fact bringing people together giving them freedom I mean don't like they can still have as
much Freedom as they like to decide the days and what you know they've got to have freedom because that's also connected to them fulfilling the mission
but saying that we are a group of people that get together because we believe in that we believe in the value of it yeah
and every time I say this you know there's a big cohort that yeah amazing and then
I mean I was at an office this morning and it's exactly what you've described they said there's usually 500 people in there my team were there with me empty
empty completely empty I went to another office a big ticketing company they
built they'd started building the construction of this building in central London during covert they spent what I believe hundreds of Millions on this
office completely empty and I go what's going on again well we're trying to get people
back in we do pizzas on Tuesday downstairs people still don't come in why don't you give them Clarity why
don't you say this is who we are because they're scared you're scared they're scared to be clear just do whatever you
want decide whatever you want that's not how teams work name a team that runs on that basis in sports
do whatever you want yeah so I think I believe I have a hypothesis that we're gonna return uh
not not to where we were before because I think that was somewhat broken as well but I think we're going to return to a nice Middle Ground
well freedom and Clarity sadly if an economic recession will you have that
effect yeah um I mean if when people start to get worried about their job
um I think that might be easier to get them uh it's sad that it's going to take a lot of pain
um but um yeah I suspect that will bring that will change the culture somewhat the kind of climate I think it will be
and it Jack is a good example here Jack was freelance so in the company I
described with the great office culture whatever Jack used to come in as a freelancer so he wasn't part of it so he
was one of the people sat at home in his boxer shorts I'm guessing and he was he would part of the reason why and this I
don't want to speak for Jack but from what I understand do correct me if I'm wrong jack is Jack wanted to move from there to from being this freelancer to
being full-time in our team was because he saw that he was missing something Jack please correct me is that accurate
yes what were you miss what did you well I'd come to your offices and I'll see what it was like being part of a team which I haven't seen before and yeah I
just realized that's what I've been missing from my work the whole time and so he was in the freelance sitting
at home and then saw this group of young people that were all friends and played football and went out on Fridays and and thought you know what that's actually
as important as just getting a check you know so yeah that's my hypothesis I'm actually going to start using our office
coach as a way to employ people which kind of bucks the trend that it's gonna sort of disincentivize people to work
here so yeah oh I mean if it it could have it could have a really lovely thing
where if you preferentially select people based on their desire to work in an
office that's a really wonderful way to kind of build a nice office culture right yeah just for the moment you can
just sort of cream skim all the people who exactly what a party that would be
those are the people I want to be with anyways I mean so yeah another thing that I found um very
Why too much information is bad
curious was this idea that too much information when making decisions sometimes can sometimes distort reality
and be unhelpful because I mean in most of the Pursuits in most
of the businesses I run the phrases like the more information the better and even when we're trying to
figure things out we're using looking at the analytics we're trying to get as much data as we possibly can to make our decisions now now in blink you kind of
contest that idea yeah that's sometimes less information is much well particularly you know and if these
are unsupported decisions so um if you're going to be using decision making tools analytic you know Advanced
analytics and you are confident in whatever algorithms you're using to kind of then find but for the
for for sort of much more human decision making you know we have all kinds of problems a classic one would be
you know you you want to buy a car and there are six things you're concerned about and
you you fall into the default mode of of weighing all six equally when in fact
you know price is probably five times more important than color of the car you
know but you have you to make the mistake of thinking oh I don't want to buy that one because it's the wrong shade of green when it's you know Far
and Away that I and that parallels was something that I I didn't really
understand until I started this company with I've observed a kind of startup in
operation with this company Pushkin which is um it's really really hard for decision
makers to focus on more than a handful of things you the the idea that focused is
a limiting variable in a lot of crucial decisions it's something that I didn't I
understood it abstractly but now I understand you simply the reason as a
company you want to pick you know two lines of business not five it's not that
two lines make more rational business sense than five but because you can't focus on
five she can't see him being you only have a limited amount of your limit of space in your head right and like so
that idea that we have a limited amount of space in our head Obama President Obama used to every morning he would uh
he would have someone lay out his clothes for him so he didn't have to think about what clothes he was going to wear I know on the theory that if you
spend if you devote space to what you're going to wear that morning you have less space for other stuff he's absolutely
right it's totally true so we clutter this idea that cluttering our
decision-making process with extraneous information in the hopes
that makes us better off in the end is a Fool's game don't clutter like I said if
we're talking about unsupported decision making um if you are you know
IBM sorting through some complex fine or but I mean for every day kind of stuff
that yeah clear away prioritize very be very clear about your
priorities focus on what is crucial that's the way to be a more efficient
um decision maker in in in the kind of in the in these immediate unsupported
domains I really need to do that with my wardrobe upstairs because I've just I've
got [ __ ] hundreds of I wear two of the black t-shirts and there's a hundred in that like in that cupboard but I
could just take the others out and I could I could really I just thinking about my life generally How I Live it's kind of a cluttered clutter experience
which I think my rule is every time I buy an item of clothing I remove an item
of clothing from my closet so I have homeostasis
Is alcohol bad?
slightly obscure um topic alcohol do you drink yes because I I read about your
I've seen various sort of opinions you have on alcohol and I assume that would mean you you didn't
why were you laughing yeah these are things I would but which I love to kind of opine
it's half tongue and cheek wait what so yes what's your what's your question the really interesting thing that I was I
was actually reading about just before you came was about how alcohol is such a situational thing and how in for many
people it's a depressant if they are sad alone you can make them more anxious if they're anxious and then at a football
stadium it can make them jubilant and feel connected and happy
what's your opinion on alcohol do you think it's a a bad thing for society do you think it
should be banned no I mean I mean like I said I do drink not to excess but um uh I think of it as
we're stuck with it in a good way I mean uh we I do think we have we're
relatively Cavalier I mean this is a big theme in my book talking to strangers yeah a whole chapter on alcohol and how
a lot of what we talk about is that you know when we talk about a section the culture of the problem of sexual assault
particularly among young people it's really an alcohol problem that's driving it right it's very very few cases of of
you know accepting violent rape if you talk about what we think of as sexual assault um
where one party thinks it's conceptual and the other party does not that kind of which are the problematic cases in
many of with young people someone's always one or both parties are always drunk in those situations it's
very rare for that not to be the case and understanding that oh if we want to tackle really really
serious things like sexual assault we have to get our hands around drinking problems first and to
understand that something weird is happening and drinking has happened in drinking culture in the last generation
in the west um which is that the
the fringes have gotten more Extreme More young people abstain from alcohol
than ever before but at the other end of the Continuum what it means to be a heavy drinker today is very different
from what it meant to be a heavy drinker 50 years ago heavy there is more binge
consumption and um over consumption of alcohol at The Fringe today than it was in the past
among young people and that's really problematic um and trying to understand how to in
reintroduce a culture of um not necessarily sobriety but of of um
uh of balance in of um moderation in alcohol consumption is
one of the kind of I think one of the sensitive Central tasks facing society today why is that the case why is there
more binge binge drinking on one end we don't really have a good understanding of why part of it is I think that
um Norms around uh female drink I talked about in in talking to strangers Norms
around uh female alcoholic consumption have changed very dramatically so
50 years ago if a man and a woman go out on a date there is zero expectation in
fact they would be a it would be considered problematic if the woman drank as much as the man
now there is in many situations particularly in colleges universities there is a an expectation that the woman
will match a man drink for drink and that is so incredibly problematic for a whole
series of physiological reasons not just that women not just by the way that women are tend to be have a lot way a
lot less than men it's not just about weight it is that women process alcohol in a fundamentally different way than
men so two a man and a woman who weigh exactly the same amount can have exactly the same amount to drink and the woman
will be a lot more inebriated at the end of that process that is a physiological fact about men and women so if you have
as a norm that women should match Men drink for drink you are asking for trouble
right and our failure to talk frankly about alcohol abuse among young people I
just think is Criminal it's just like it's just I feel the same thing about
um in some sense about about cannabis where I don't have a problem with people
smoking dope but the idea that we can have THC levels uh in cannabis that are
north of 25 or 30 percent is insane are you kidding me it was a one percent a
generation ago and people are smoking the same amount and it's 25 times as as I mean it's just like nuts like why do
we suspend the laws of biology when it comes to uh to mind altering substances
it's just it drives me nuts yes money is the reason but anyway another time
Last guest question
another time um so we have a closing tradition on this podcast where the last guest leaves a question for the next
guest um not knowing who they're leaving it for yeah and so it means that all of our guests are kind of speaking to each
other I guess this guest has asked the question
what is one thing you regret not saying to somebody and why didn't you say it
oh wow what is one thing I mean the the obvious
answer everyone's going to give is I didn't say I love you to some loved one so I'll skip the obvious answer and try
and do something less obvious um I think it would be I'm this is not a cop-out
there's a there is a a genre of politeness
that I have neglected and that is people doing everyday things at a lower
the person who being kind Kinder and more appreciative of the person of the
janitor who sweeps the floor in the office you work in or the the woman who cleans your hotel room or
the you know I could make a long list of the nurse who picks up after you know
you in the hospital or that those kinds of people doing thankless
things I have been I believe I would be I regret that I have not over the course
of my life life been more obviously thankful to them
why why that why did that I mean I agree but
what's made you realize that now uh
well my mom was in the hospital she's out now a few weeks ago and uh
I just realized wow like I don't know it's just something about that it's obvious but it's not obvious it's
just like here are people doing you know very Elemental things
caring for people who are you know in that moment helpless not
getting paid an awful lot of money working really really long shifts just went through an experience
where they were risking their lives by going to the hospital for a couple years I mean it's like what
we asked these but we put these people through and the idea that we would take them for
granted seems that I have taken and for granted seems to me
outrageous so maybe that's why welcome thank you so much for being so
generous with your time and thank you for the conversation um you're a very special person very very important thinker for very many
reasons I love the way there's so many observations I've had for instance speaking to one of them is that you really listen which is strange because
often I sit here with podcast guests and it's the whole like listening to speak thing but for some reason when I speak you listen and it sounds like a strange
thing to say but that is really really surprising because you're very very smart and maybe that's your dad maybe
that's the because that's what I saw and it's like that's what you described of your dad was that humility almost
um so that's incredibly surprising but then the way that you think and how considered nuance and your admittance that you could probably be wrong which
you said many many times I think is also incredibly refreshing but uh but it's also why your books are so great and it's why your podcast is so great it's
why I would recommend everybody to go and check out the bowl of Mafia because there's a certain curiosity and wonder
and Beauty to the way that you write and the reason why you're writing that is very rare and I hope to one day emulate
in my own writing so thank you for all of the inspiration and thank you for doing this um your podcast you're in season seven
now season seven of revisionist History yeah and uh that's coming to a close you've got is it two episodes
yeah season yeah and people can get that everywhere so Spotify Apple everywhere yeah
amazing thank you so much Malcolm for your time thank you generous thank you

Link: [# Coinbase Founder: The Crazy Journey Of Building A $100 Billion Company: Brian Armstrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0yceuXmrI)
Transcription:

everybody i talked to actually thought it's a bad idea like any reasonable person would have quit i was filled with self-doubt and then coinbase was valued
at a billion dollars crazy brian armstrong ceo co-founder of coinbase largest u.s cryptocurrency exchange i
saw technology as a way to try to have a big impact on the world if the thing that got you started in the first place
was like fear like fear of never being important or fear of never feeling fulfilled you're just gonna give up
cryptocurrency is the biggest transformation of money since the invention of paper coinbase was being
deemed the most trustworthy brand in crypto it tipped at a certain point from like oh this growth is really good to
okay things are getting a little crazy here if you kind of more than double a company in a year you're really going to start to see a lot of stuff break
this morning coinbase just telling employees in an email that it plans to lay off 18 of its workforce we had never
done a layoff before i had never done one i remember i went up in for the company and my voice
cracked i mean it was awful oh man i actually think coinbase is in deep
trouble here and let me tell you why the pressure and the scrutiny and the headlines how
are you dealing with your emotions this is getting very personal
it's a real superpower to like care less what other people think so without further ado i'm stephen
bartlett and this is the diary of a ceo i hope nobody's listening but if you are
then please keep this to yourself [Music]
What made you the person you are today
brian i when i read through people's people's stories they're sometimes really obvious um causal factors that led them to
become the people they are today but with you i'm i'm more compelled by the less obvious factors if we go back
to your early years when you're a young man on the west coast yeah of the united states what are the the less obvious reasons as
to why you've ended up where you are today and achieved what you've achieved in your life
great question um one of the less obvious reasons probably is that
i was an introvert i just wasn't really very good with people i didn't really have that many friends you know as a young person
i was quite shy um i really found a love of computers and i liked
just being by myself and playing with computers learning about how they worked programming and
you know in our technological age i suppose um some of the people who got excited about
computers early on and just have found a love of building things have now become you know ceos of companies which is kind
of a strange thing for a long time i didn't think i could be a ceo because i envisioned ceos of companies as being
like these military generals who barked orders at people and they were these like strong charismatic leaders and
i always felt like well that's not me i'm kind of like an engineer i'm kind of a nerd you know and what i've learned
over time is now reading enough books and things historically you know introverts can make actually
really good ceos um of course by the way there's lots of different types of ceos there's not just one mold there's people
who love marketing people have operations people who love sales people and then there are engineer ceos
um so that's one reason that i think it's maybe a little bit less known why i'm here
another another reason is that i just became very passionate about this idea of trying to have an impact on the
world and i think it again may have come from that that introversion as a kid and i felt like hey i have good ideas but
it's hard for me to get them out there and for people to listen to them and i didn't feel confident like you know speaking in some public setting or
whatever i have lots of practice doing it now so i can i'm a well-trained introvert but um
you know i saw technology as a way to try to have a big impact on the world and it could get my ideas out there in a
scalable way even if i felt like maybe i couldn't and so i don't know maybe that's another un unlikely reason in hindsight then
going back to those early years as well what was your luck or privilege what were the factors that were out of your control that
happened to be the case that also aided to that um trajectory yeah i mean there was a lot of things that went right so i
was in a home with loving parents that were very supportive of education and my passions and interests including you
know my mother worked at ibm and so we had like an early computer in our home um she was kind of an early programmer
there you know we had early access to internet things like that i also had you
know i graduated studied i studied computer science and economics and i had um enough
this was a very important thing i was not afraid to go try starting companies because i knew that if i failed i could
actually go back and still get a job and it wasn't people always think of you know entrepreneurs oh they're such risk
takers and all the stuff you know honestly it's not it's not that risky like if you're a young person and
you get a little bit of money to go start a company like in in silicon valley people write you angel checks for these things
and you can pay yourself a salary go try it for a couple years and it doesn't work you go back to a company and you it's often viewed as a badge of honor um
that you've tried to start up you have this entrepreneurial dna you're somehow more valuable inside a company now if it
doesn't work and you go back in many places in the world that's not the case you know failure of a company
is considered a badge a mark of shame not a badge of honor and then i think many people don't have the
luxury of being able to kind of raise these seed rounds and things like that which many places in the world you can't do that crypto is trying to help that by
the way but in silicon valley you can get angel checks for things and so
i tried starting many different things over the years as kind of as side projects but with coinbase specifically i didn't really i didn't even quit my
job to try it full time until i had gotten sort of an angel investment so i was able to pay myself something it wasn't a lot but i was able to pay
myself something and de-risk it um yeah if i'd asked you then at say 10 years old what you what you wanted to be when
you grew up what would you have told me at 10 years old i mean i really
i really had no idea i think the first glimmer of it that i had was in high school and i i had started building some
websites and i remember as a senior in high school i went on this retreat and uh i had i do remember having this
thought like the thing that has excited me the most in my life so far was i had built this
kind of simple website or app and it felt like it was this really incredible feeling i went to sleep and i
woke up in the morning and i checked the stats and like you know 200 people or something had visited the website while
i was sleeping and i was like wow that was so cool i don't know who these people are they're all over the world it felt like a superpower like if i could
build something that could be working and helping people while i was sleeping you know if not if not 200 people why
not 2 000 2 million whatever and so i do remember having sort of a it's stuck in my memory like that of all
the things i've tried in my life you know sports and reading and science and in school and whatever as a high
schooler that was the thing that really got me excited in a way that nothing else had at that point so i was probably
in the very early stages of discovering my passion at that point just just listening to you speak there
my my brain was telling me that because i was trying to make this link between why being an introvert led you to technology and then also having this
sort of desire to have impact but it sounds like there technology allowed you to be be an introvert and have impact
because it was the the bridge between the the outside world yeah so when that website goes live you don't have to see
these people or persuade them yeah but you can have your impact by by a piece of technology that's enabling something
in their lives exactly you go off and study economics in university and yeah college yeah so i
had been taking some programming classes um on the side in high school
i couldn't help it i i i like in my free time i would just play with computers until like two in the morning three in the
morning i was like dead tired at school every day because i was like wide awake at night like playing with computers
learning about linux and like all these things and um school was a little bit boring in some
ways so yeah i basically decided okay if i'm in this interested in computers my parents
were supportive of this of course there was like community college classes and i went to go try to take some of those classes to learn programming there was i
got some books from the library about like how to program java and things like that and i couldn't i couldn't understand any of it
but i was trying to work my way through it so then when it came time to go to college i was basically like okay computer science
that seems like the closest thing to what i'm interested in i was also interested in business and they didn't offer a business degree so i studied
economics instead that was like the closest thing to a business degree they offered and that was literally my my thinking now of
course i had no idea later i'd started crypto company which was literally the intersection of computer science and economics but yeah at the time i just
thought i want to i want to write software and i want to learn how to start a business and at some point during college you
Lessons learnt from my first business
start your first i guess real company yeah which is a tutoring business yeah
was that did you have grand plans of turning that into a a mega was that or did you stumble into that
more like stumbled into it yeah i mean so as a college student my roommates and i were always trying to think about how to
make extra money and i went around and i was looking at these on-campus jobs so you could work at the library there was
like a coffee shop and you know they paid like 10 15 an hour or something like that
and one of the upper classmen i remember he told me you know i'm tutoring this high school kid and
they're paying me 60 an hour i was like wow 60 an hour is it just it was like three
or four x what you could make at these other on-campus jobs so i decided to try doing it myself
i got in touch with some people i started tutoring high school kids just in like math and science and things like that and it paid really well and so my
roommate and i at the time we were starting to just brainstorm like why don't we start a little tutoring company and help high school kids and their
parents match with you know the you know tutors at the basically university students at the university where i was
going to school and so we got that going we got maybe 10 20 of our of our fellow students kind of
connected in and then we said all right let's make a website for this to connect even more people maybe try to expand it to other
schools you know eventually over a period of a couple years this this idea just kept evolving and we
started to think about it as we didn't really know this at the time but it was we were kind of making an online marketplace like airbnb for but but for
tutoring and um yeah i got to practice like building web applications um there was
payroll and incorporation and sales and marketing and taxes and um
it i could never really get it to grow enormous and to make it become like a really big business which we can talk
about if you want but that was the seed of it that later became a little bit more of a company
why then why couldn't you make it become a big business what was the in hindsight the lesson yeah the barrier
okay so we learned this sort of the hard way about creating a marketplace which was that in this particular industry in
tutoring a lot of times uh you would introduce a student and a tutor
and they would sort of we our business we were trying to take like a 10 fee by matching these people and we were
basically trying to do all the payments through our website like billing and you know with a 10 fee and what would happen
often is they would meet the tutor if and they'd do initially the first payment but then afterwards they'd start paying them under the table and so um
we were i realized at a certain point we were basically just getting in the way they they wanted us to just match them but they didn't want us to be the whole
billing apparatus it was a much more like a local repeat business in-person business and
so for years and years i struggled with that there was a counterintuitive moment which allowed me to kind of pivot away
from that so i eventually realized this thing isn't working i need to go get a quote-unquote real job
and as i was going to start my the real job this was at um
basically airbnb where i became an early employee i was i was about to shut down the tutoring site and i was like feeling a
lot of pain about that because like well i don't know there are still like five ten thousand people every month who are
kind of looking at this thing and using it it feels like such a pain to shut it down or such a bad thing so i was like what
if what if i were just to put everything on autopilot you know we're not gonna be involved in any of the payments there's
no customer support this is literally just going to be a directory like a tutoring directory and you can contact
these tutors you can pay them however you want um and i'm just going to try to make it like a free thing maybe i'll put up some
ads and so i basically had like a week before i was starting my my new job i got rid of all the payments i messaged
all the people using it i was like you can pay now people directly and um i was gonna put up some ads and i
did one more thing at the last hour which is i said if you want to have like a featured profile as a tutor
with like a little badge on a featured badge and come up first in search results then you can just pay 10 a month
and that was it and i basically stopped looking at the website and i went to go focus on my new job
and every year thereafter the site doubled after i made that change
um and so basically i guess the lesson was you know stop trying to extract value and start
trying to create more value and at that point i think that was only the the only tutoring directory online that had free
profiles and you could just contact the tutors and so it actually started to grow later later uh um somebody ended up
acquiring it for maybe like two million dollars or something so to me that was like it was like a seven or eight year
base hit the outcome yeah where for years you know five six years i was struggling to get anything to work but
the the truth is okay they paid two million dollars for it yeah but the lessons you learn
uh many of those translate into the business that you went on to build in coinbase what is there anything else
because i look at my first startup that i made out of you know dropping out of university then started yeah and there's
so many lessons one of them is what you said is i was i was so romantic about my hypothesis about what this business
should be that i got in the way of what customers wanted to do yeah so hearing you say that really relates but is there anything else that you learned from that
seven-year first you know kind of messy startup that of key philosophies for you today in
coinbase i mean i think one of the big realizations i had in starting that tutoring company which again you can you
can always look back and see how the the pieces connect but at the time you're just wandering in the desert you're lost
like i felt i felt like i was a failure i felt like i had no idea what i even wanted to do i didn't even know if i
wanted to be an entrepreneur it basically wasn't working but looking back with hindsight
one thing i realized was how broken the global financial system was because
it was incredibly difficult to collect money from all these students and pay these tutors
not only in the us but in various places around the world and i remember um going through this pro like incredibly onerous
process to like set up credit card processing and then payments that i was sending out and i
remember the bank called me one day and they were like you know are you an aggregator of funds
and i was like i don't even know what that is and they were basically like treating me like almost like i was a criminal and what are your licenses to
do all this stuff and i was like this is crazy it was the hardest one of the hardest things about that business was just to get the payments like collecting
payments and distributing payments to the tutors as a marketplace and so that gave me sort of a real
insight later when i saw the bitcoin white paper years later i was like that system is broken um and this could
be an opportunity to fix it so that was one thing what about airbnb so you went and worked as a in the product team at airbnb yeah yeah i was a technical
product manager which basically meant i wrote some code and i tried to be a product manager yeah um
yeah so i think i was the 40th employee at airbnb and i basically moved back to silicon valley from i was
living in buenos aires argentina for a year or so trying to figure out what i wanted to do with my life okay i'm gonna
How traveling shaped me
have to talk about that sure yeah what did that give you that experience of travel and
going to argentina and living there for how many years a little less than a year yeah what did
that give you well it gave me a few things i mean one was that i got to see what a
hyperinflation economy looked like you know a lot of people have only grown up grown up in a developed country they've never
experienced hyperinflation and they've never felt firsthand what that can really do for a population and
people so i would it really deeply affects the culture of places like argentina there's just there's kind of this
deep distrust of um the government and there's a pessimism about about the future there's
kind of you know in countries that i think are the most forward thinking there's a sense of optimism about the future hey we can build a better future
and there's you know in places like argentina might you know people may disagree my impression was that people
felt like the best days are behind us and live every day like it's your last because hey it could all disappear
tomorrow meaning your wealth and everything which has happened many times in their history also just little things like you'd go to
the restaurant the next week and the prices are higher and they put a sticker on top of the menu because the prices keep changing so so frequently it really
it really harms like the poorest people in in society too because they they're the ones holding their wealth in cash as
opposed to wealthy people can hold real estate things that adjust for inflation now they can hold bitcoin um so anyway it gave me a front row seat
into that it probably gave me a little bit of a sense of confidence too because i had never
studied abroad or really um lived in a foreign country by myself
where i didn't really speak the language very well so there was things like that i think i was just trying to learn how to become more independent and grow up
and stuff like that you were running the tutoring business at this point yeah i mean i was doing a lot of things so i was running the tutoring business i was
um doing some contract software development just kind of while traveling i was trying to build some real estate
investments in the in the us i i was basically trying to figure what i want to do with
my life and there was a whole process i went through to try to figure that out if you're curious too
the digital nomad piece which is becoming much more common these days because we've had this pandemic and we've kind of built systems which allow
us to work more remotely and but just generally people were were choosing that lifestyle when i did that when i was 21
in the gap between my startup failing and then me pivoting into a new business i found it quite lonely
and there was i remember being actually on a plane flying from one country to another brazil to thailand or something
and seeing this um i think it was textiles or something like this san francisco incubator or new
york-based incubate where they were building companies and i was i was living the dream in many people's eyes in these hot countries with my laptop
but something inside me was like missing yeah um community a sense of shared
mission whatever it is i wonder i wonder if you you can relate to that in any way or totally i i found it actually quite
lonely as well so in in some ways that was the point which was to step outside my comfort zone feel like i had to make
new friends in new city but yeah i mean there was a good you know maybe five six months there in buenos aires
where i felt like i didn't really know that many people um i was feeling kind of homesick yeah
eventually i tried to you know go meet some local people like expats like various hostels and like you know event by the
time i left i felt like i had a budding friend group and i liked it more but it was lonely there for a while
you said you used that time to figure out what you wanted to do with your life as if there's some kind of system there
yeah i don't know if there's a perfect system but i mean i read this book by seth godin called the dip
yeah i don't know if you've read it but and it's funny i went back to read it like many years later and it's actually a
relatively simple book but in that moment in that time that's what i needed to hear and it's kind of a very fairly
simple idea um which is that you know what's the thing that you would still want to be doing 10 years from now even
if you hadn't seen a lot of success because most things in life you know you start off you're a beginner you have a
fast pace of learning it's kind of fun but then after you after you're a beginner there's this dip in the middle where you're not an expert you're not
one of the best people in the world you're probably not making money from it but you're not a beginner anymore and there's like this long slog to go
through the middle you know put in your 10 000 hours there's lots of various people have talked about this so
i was doing a variety of things at that time i was i was as i mentioned running that tutoring company doing some real estate investing i was like learning
martial arts and like all the various things traveling in argentina and i and i basically sat down one day i
was like what's this what is the thing that i 10 years from now i'm still going to want to do this and be passionate about it
and even if i'm not successful at it you know because i just love doing it and like the only thing i could like
really write on my list was tech entrepreneurship and so par part of the point of that
book is if if you're not willing to go through the dip then then quit now because it's
you know and so i was like do i really want to be like doing you know great real estate investments
10 years from i was like i don't actually love real estate investing so maybe i should have stopped doing that maybe i should stop doing this and
maybe so it was this very clarifying moment okay if i want to be a tech entrepreneur because i had been doing
that in some way shape or form for you know five ten years i was pretty sure i'd be wanting to do it ten years from now
i was like why do i live in buenos aires i should go to where the the center of tech entrepreneurship of silicon valley you know that's happening
all over the world now silicon valley is kind of decentralized but at that time especially so i kind of stopped doing everything
else moved to silicon valley and went all in on that and then
i think within maybe seven years of making that decision um coinbase was
Working for AirB&B and what made it successful
valued at a billion dollars crazy so it did really help clarify my
ambitions and i just put it all into one thing that is atypical pointless yeah there's going to be
entrepreneurs in bruenesaras listening to this that are bringing flights to san francisco but it could it could be any
like if you really want to be an actor you should probably go to hollywood or something or if you really want to be in finance maybe go to london new york or
anyway i think it's not so i don't want to say like there's one geography for everything but um
there is a clarifying thing what happens if you just say this is what is the most important thing to me and i'm just gonna
try to make luck my own luck around that it's so true it's something that i don't
think especially young people think about when they're deciding making career choices they where to live is sometimes not um as
prioritized as much as like which university has the best partying or who's offering me a job right now as
opposed to that long-term horizon of like how do i surround myself with the most talent and opportunity and funding in the case of business um and
inspiration and enablers um for this long-term vision i have and i spent some time in san francisco myself about three
years and when i come back to the uk and when i go to other cities in the uk i i've never said this before but i see
how much of a disadvantage we have in philosophy in ambition in funding in talent
and um it's no surprise that most of the great unicorns that are emerging out of one
city and in the world that then leads you to airbnb somehow through i think you take a job first
then eventually take a job at airbnb yes exactly yeah i joined a y commenter startup that was really cool but it
didn't really work out there was a brief interlude there but basically i i decided okay my tutoring
company is not really working i need to and that's that's when i pivoted to that thing which had a base hit but what i
decided all right i want to go to i want you to go to silicon valley i kind of want to apply to y combinator it's a startup incubator
um but i wasn't able to get in and so i was like let me go work at a y combinator company to sort of learn
and i need it by the way i also just needed to recharge a little bit because the tutoring company i've been living abroad the shooting company wasn't
working i was barely paying myself anything so i was kind of broke i was i was also just exhausted um
from the the tutoring company just not working after so many years of trying to get it to work um and you know it hadn't seen it double
every year after that that happened on the side um and so i was like great let me take a job at a high growth company
that seems to be well run actually make some money for a little bit here save some money and that's how i got to airbnb it just
it had a really magnetic culture even at 40 people they had they were clearly onto something it had they had found product market fit it
was growing quickly um and i learned a lot there they had a really unique culture um they they were hiring differently
they were really like trying to raise the bar with every hire you know if it's not a hell yes it's a no they were um
the way that they just did product reviews was really interesting they had an important design component to it
if you think about now why airbnb won in their market from what you got to
see inside their walls what would you say so you've talked about their hiring philosophy which is very very clear yeah but what else would
you say well the main thing and i think that by the way this is true of not just airbnb a lot of startups was determination
um they went through a period everybody always looks back to these startups and they think oh it was a unicorn like it
just they found the thing and it worked airbnb is actually somewhat typical in this regard which was there was i think
at least um i think like a three-year period where they were just wandering in the desert any reasonable person would have stopped
working on this idea it was it was a crazy idea like it was like couchsurfing you're gonna let strangers stay on my
couch like that's not a business it's like just ripe for lawsuits and you know
um and they were in like tons of credit card debt because they had like been trying to sell fund it you know they had
launched several times and nobody was using it um yeah they should have quit like any
reasonable person would have quit um but they didn't they kept going and they were just because getting
marketplaces off the ground is very hard you have to check an egg problem supply and demand and so i actually think
that's a common element um in a lot of like successful companies you go back there there was a period where a normal
person just would have quit and they they went from setback to setback to setback with enthusiasm you know somehow
The mistake a lot of entrepreneurs make
powering through it so i learned that too i hear a lot of um entrepreneurs who have your same
enthusiasm to be an entrepreneur the enthusiasm you've expressed there when you leave um argentina and you come
back you just want to be an entrepreneur you don't necessarily know what or industry what problem you want to solve
and what what always makes me feel a little bit concerned is when an entrepreneur is so keen to be an entrepreneur that they'll just try and
think of an idea you took a time to go and get inspired i guess and to let the inspiration come to
you what's your view on that there'll be people listening to this now that want to be an entrepreneur but they don't
have an idea yeah okay well i mean i i was probably guilty of that too where there was definitely a
period in my life where i was like um i just want to be an entrepreneur and i don't know honestly it was probably
partly ego driven it was partly um my own like introvert way of saying
like i just want to be able to have an impact i wanted to feel like i had done something valuable because i didn't feel like valuable as a human myself like you
get into all the psychology of it right it's kind of a crazy thing actually to go say like i have to be an entrepreneur
because you know from an if you just want to make money or something like it's from an expected value outcome it's probably
better just to like go to some early stage companies invest some equity and like or join goldman sachs or something
right like so to be truly want to be an entrepreneur i guess you have to be
well sometimes it's ego driven but i think it's your your chances of success go up dramatically if you're doing
something because you're actually super passionate about it and so for me reading the bitcoin white paper was kind
of a lucky moment because i found it tapped into something that i was really passionate about which was
basically freedom you know um economic freedom and just like how do we empower people all over the world to you know
have access to sound money and um like a decentralized open permit system
where anybody can get access to the global financial system that really just like resonated with me and so
i think that really helped coinbase be successful because there were many times in our history as a company where you
know like 20 2015 2016 like the whole industry was down for three years everybody was
pivoting to do blockchain not bitcoin if you remember that every like a lot of the competitors in space pivoted to make software for banks
and stuff and everybody looks back at that and like wow you know brian you never lost faith and everything
for me it was more it was simple than that i was just like well i don't really want to make software for banks so like
if that's what this is all about now i'd pretty much just gonna shut it down and give the money back uh to investors um
so i was just too stubborn i was like i i got into this because i feel like this is the way to create more freedom in the
world so that's what i'm going to keep doing whether it works or not so i think there is a really important element there you
have to be super into it for some reason that's bigger than just ego or trying to make money or whatever because
every company is just filled with setback after setback or setback and you think you can power through it
but believe me when you're like three years in and like your co-founder quit and you
you got sued and you're broke and like um the first three times you launch the
product nobody wants to use it and like everything sucks and you're feeling like a failure and you're you know
you're just gonna give up because you're not actually doing it for like some bigger purpose you're doing it because
you wanted to feel important or something so it actually is important to pick the thing that you're passionate about yeah you're doing it because you
want to feel important or something we're talking about um how part of this sort of introverts dilemma
is you can feel significant personal significance by creating something that has significance in the world
zooming right to the end of the story has has that impact you've had on the world made you feel more personally significant
yeah totally okay so i think this is a really important topic because a lot of founder it's stressful to run a company
right so a lot of founders if they do get to some level of success they will often burn out right
um it shows up in weird ways by the way some people gain a ton of weight some people lose a lot of weight some people
deal with stress in all kinds of ways i've there's like founders i've met that get like addicted to prescription drugs or
like you know all kinds of unhealthy things you can imagine right so
um i mean you have to find a way to shift from like if the thing that got you started in the first
place was like fear like fear of never being important or fear of never feeling fulfilled you have to at some point
transition it once that hole is filled in your heart i guess you have to transition to being
motivated out of like joy or love or something more positive not like running away from fear and anger or you're like
you're really angry at this you know your father or like the person who um you know broke
like the co-founder who you almost was going to found with who decided they didn't want to and you're pissed at them so you're trying to show them up or
whatever those aren't relevant to me but i've heard other examples anyway long way of saying you have to
transition away from fear and anger as your motivator to like joy and love and just find the thing you actually love doing in life so for me you know that
was like figuring out what is the kind of ceo role that i really want to have um
what's the thing that brings me joy for me it's like i love building things with with technology i love learning new
things um there are some parts of the ceo job the typical ceo job which
you know lower my energy they don't give me as much energy right there's like you know frankly like people i'm not the
best people manager in the world right like um i used to have like 12 direct reports um at the company and i was like
so stressed and then now you know now i have like four right and it's like it's actually much easier for me to run the company with that so
um there was a lot of things ideas that i had in my head i was like well the ceo has to do that obviously the ceo has to
do that and i sort of let go of some of those things over time and i said you know what i'm actually going to focus on
the things that i'm better at because they bring me joy and i'm going to delegate a lot of the stuff which i thought i had to do
and that's actually made the company run a lot better and it's kept me engaged in the job like i'm been doing it 10 years
and i hope i can do it another 10 it's and it's still fun because i've been able to delegate
why do you have to make that transition away from fear and maybe insecurity being the motivator towards it being
about joy and love what what's the cost if you don't well i think if you don't then once you
hit some kind of level of success whatever however people count that then you're not going to feel motivated
anymore and so you're just you're going to be done and uh you know you're going to go
do whatever else you're going to do next like i guess become an investor or sit on the board which is nothing wrong with that either but i just i d part of me
does wish that more founders were able to continue being founders and build the next thing and the next thing
um i mean we just met each other barely know each other but i'm guessing that you're
finding a lot of fulfillment out of like running this podcast and you sort of you've you've found some
new level of joy in doing that so this is like your next founding moment but
yeah i i think if you don't do it then you're just going to burn out it and a lot of people i think who had some level of success as
a founder they look back on it and they like well man i finally got that thing to some level of success and i sold the company
or whatever but i never want to do that again like because that it damn near killed me and i was so stressed all the time and so
i've tried to make it i need to get it to a place where it's fun to run the company so that i can keep building companies for many many decades
How to build a sustainable company
hopefully that's my goal you're describing me when you say that so yeah the company for seven years but it felt
like i was doing it um involved it wasn't it wasn't voluntary meaningful struggle it was i can't let this thing
go down yeah it's not i'm not enjoying it anymore but i can't stop and then at the point where i realized i could stop
i did immediately in hindsight the way around that would be to do a bunch of things involving the you
know how the company's structured and who owns it who has control and all those things but really trying to build a sustainable as you describe it like a
sustainable life for me as a founder and for my team members yeah and that often in silicon valley when especially
when you're in high growth companies sustainability in terms of culture is the last thing how have you done that then how have you
tried to make it sustainable you've talked about yourself but how have you how do you create a sustainable company one that's built for 50 years or 100
well okay so there's a lot of different elements to that i mean one of them is just the burnout factor with people let's talk about that first
um and then i'll come to like repeatable innovation um so from a burnout point of view i mean a
few things that i do for instance um because obviously there's days where you have to like go hard and sprint and then
um but for instance like every quarter i take a week off right i just have that prescheduled for the year because if you
just kind of wait there's never a good time to do it um we actually tried an experiment this year where we're having we call them
recharge weeks everybody in the company is like taking a week off every quarter and they're doing it at the same time because
sometimes if you're off you're the only one who's taking a week off and then people are pinging you the whole time and whatever i don't know if we'll keep
doing it or not it's an experiment but by taking a week off every quarter it allows me to kind of
make sure that i recharge i have time to go um learn new things and it often like sometimes you know i'm thinking about
the business in some way shape or form but it's like yeah that's helped make it sustainable other things i've done i've had um a lot
of executive coaches different executive coaches i have one now you know it's there's different kinds of executive coaches some of them are very tactical
with their advice like they're former ceos others are basically therapists and like you know both are good and
important versions to have um when i first heard that i was like oh i don't want the therapist i want like the tactical ceo coach but you know i've
found the therapist part's almost even more valuable um let's see what else i mean
like i have um i have this kind of like morning routine where like i've noticed that my days go i'm a lot more stressed
if i just like wake up i look at my phone you know i haven't really like had any breakfast or exercise or
anything and like you know i'm like low blood sugar i just everything's pissing me off i'm like irritable
um and so that's just a bad way to wake up since now when i wake up i basically don't look at my phone you know i try to
like do the morning routine you know exercise like eat some breakfast meditate whatever and
then okay now i'll start my day and like try to that all these kind of things help and i think this is important for the
whole company to some degree because a lot of new employees especially like new grads or younger folks like
they they actually don't know about burnout they'll they'll actually you can have unlimited vacation policy and tell
people at the all hands meetings whatever like don't wait until it's too late you know take time off but they won't do it like
sometimes i've seen especially high achieving people they push himself like too hard and they'll actually quit and i'm like
why are you quitting and like i'm burned out and i was like why didn't you take any vacation the last two years and they're like
i don't know and they they didn't feel like they had permission because everything was so important and so
we're almost like trying to force people to take a little bit of time off here and there but we still have a pretty intense work
environment at coinbase i'm trying to like you know amp it up like we we should we should be going hard but then take
periods of rest and renewal and take rest like renewal very seriously it's actually an important skill to learn
so okay so that's kind of how to like you know go hard for the long term but don't burn out
um then i think companies also need to have repeatable innovation so what that to me
what that means is you can't just be have like one product that finally works and then you scale it
and it kind of the s-curve tapers off and then what do you do i think companies need to continually have like
a next act you know and a port ideally like a portfolio of products or different revenue lines um so that while
something is going down another thing is going up and we we do this thing in coinbase called 70 2010 resource allocation so like 70
of our resources go to the core business today that's making most of the money and it's at scale 20 of our resources go
towards these adjacent bets that are like an extension of the core and 10 go
to these venture bets which are basically like kind of crazy ideas that have a higher chance of failure but it's so even in up markets down markets we're
putting 10 percent of our resources towards crazy you know potentially big things that
could work they don't and some of them don't and that's allowed us to build this portfolio of products and i think that's important for the long-term
sustainability of companies because it always maintains this um this startup culture this founder
mindset of like it you know it's it's always day one you know never let us become complacent try to
disrupt ourselves before somebody else does and just keep building the next thing the next thing the next thing like that's that's what keeps a company
exciting that's how you extend the founding moment right like like zuckerberg is trying to do that now with
with the metaverse instead of just being a social media company and so if a company doesn't have like those
continually stretch and try to build the next thing i think it just becomes a little more complacent
and like good people eventually leave and stuff like that every company wants that at least they say they do yeah but
How to incentive your team to take risks
then they they set up incentive structures and policies that actually act as a deterrent for innovation they
disincentivize people to innovate yeah so a question i get asked a lot when i'm on stage is you know you've ran an
innovative company in an in an industry like social media which is changing all the time and the tricks and tips and algorithms are adjusting how do you get
your teams to and how do you align incentives and how do you really make that philosophy and culture real where
people are actually incentivized to take risks and to do those those 10
bets that might end up being the the next aws or the next you know
kindle or whatever in the case of amazon yeah you're right so i think that it's a the natural tendency of most orgs is to
not allow that and so you have to actually fight against it as a founder or ceo if you have somebody within the
org who is kind of entrepreneurial and they try something new and it doesn't work
you know you have to make sure that that's not like a black mark on their their career
advancement right there's a difference between they had good execution towards the wrong idea or they had the right idea
but bad execution right if um like i think uh you know amazon amazon example right is
like they tried to launch their own phone at amazon right near the fire phone and it
was this big failure but my understanding internally was like they basically pushed
it was the wrong idea but they had good execution and so they didn't they didn't like fire that team because the amazon
phone failed they said okay the execution was good you shipped a phone in a pretty small amount of time
it was toward the wrong idea let's what next and that i think my understanding is that team actually became the kindle team which then was a
very successful product so um it's a tolerance for failure recognize
good execution even toward the wrong idea um you know i think some of this has to
come from the founder i don't know i don't know if there's any other way like the problem is um
if you look at public companies that have that are founder-led they actually like outperform the the rest of the s p
500 and one theory for why that is is that this like the scarcest thing inside big
companies is actually risk tolerance um and so founders can kind of provide
that now you can you if you can go too far with this right you we know of founders who have
too much risk tolerance and have kind of blown the place up right we work yeah exactly
and then we also know of companies that had you know like not enough risk tolerance they had a professional ceo
come in you know i don't want to criticize anybody but like like steve ballmer or someone would be a classic example i'm sure he's a smart
guy right but something happened there where they didn't have the risk tolerance so i kind of view my job as like a founder
ceo at this point is to ensure we have um enough risk tolerance to try new ideas and then i and then i also want to
pair myself with great operators like like emily choi our ceo and president right and we have a
really amazing executive team so it's the combination of like great operator but also great founder energy
which i think is a nice combination that creates good outcomes if you do if you're too heavy on one or the other sometimes it
doesn't work as well there's something a lot of you don't know about me last year i co-founded a company called third web and most of my
available time right now is spent building third web so what is third web third web makes it
really really easy to build web through applications and today's guest is one of the most famous ceos and founders in
web3 and we actually have a really strong relationship with his company coinbase so it felt somewhat fitting to
introduce third web to you in this episode just for a couple of seconds since we launched third web the growth
has been insane the world's biggest brands sports teams creators gaming studios and hundreds of funded web3
startups have all used third web to power everything that they want to do in web 3. nft drops packs dowels you name
it third web powers it in the last two months alone the number of active projects using third web tools has
doubled despite the bear market so if you're an entrepreneur if you're a brand owner if you're a web 3 developer or
just someone that's interested in web 3 which is in my opinion the next major technological shift that will impact all
of our lives kind of like social media and web 2 did then you can start building that future today using third
web check out thirdweb.com for more the link is in the description below let's get back to the episode
you read this um the white paper satoshi's famous bitcoin white paper pivotal moment for you sparks interest
and intrigue while you're at um airbnb you do something which a lot of people ask me about as well which is when
My journey starting Coinbase
you're in a job and you have a spark of inspiration how do you do both you've got to pay the bills on one end but then
you want to pursue this idea how did you do both because you stayed at airbnb while you started developing yeah what
became coinbase yeah so basically i did it on nights and weekends people didn't like that answer
yeah it sounds toxic it required a lot of energy i mean i basically so
so first of all you need to make sure that if you are currently employed like don't build it you know on company hours
and don't build it on the company laptop there's a lot of um ip litigation that has ended you know
for some people has ended badly because the company actually owns it typically at least in the us i don't know what the
rules are in other countries um if you build it on employ on company time on the company hardware the company
probably owns the ip so you need to make sure you're doing it on your own computer not during hours so anyway i i would often work till like 7
p.m or something like that i'd come home eat dinner or something like that and then i would work from like 8 p.m to
midnight um i would do that maybe three or four days a week on weekdays and then on the
weekend i'd work maybe like sunday afternoon for like seven or eight hours so i was i was
probably doing like 20 hours a week or something like that on what would eventually become coinbase in
my personal time and it was hard it sucked i mean i was like tired after a full day of work it's like 7 p.m but
this is where that some of that determination comes in right and i was like okay well my co-workers like going out
drinking or whatever and nothing wrong with that i did a lot plenty of that but like in my time at
that moment in that time i was i was you know my late 20s i was like i really want to try to build something important in the world like i'm going to have to
take like my own determination and turn that into this fuel to go try to build this thing so
i probably did that for like a year year and a half to try to build the prototype of what would become coinbase
um and then i applied to y combinator they they eventually accepted me and wrote me the initial seed check that's
what gave me the confidence to quit my job and go full time on it how did you maintain friendships and those kind of
meaningful personal relationships at that in that time when you're working full-time during the day and then coming home and writing
code where's the you know where's the time for friends and girlfriends and yeah
i was pretty intense about it i i would say i sacrificed uh friendships for it i mean it's not like
i wasn't like you know um just like never responding to people but people would ping me like hey can you
come out and this thing and i was like actually i remember it's a funny memory one time this guy who i really like um
from work he was he's like come out to this thing we're going to this club or something and i think i literally wrote back to
him i'm changing the world one line of code at a time
can't hang out he's like rock on i love it um so you know i was joking or whatever
with my mom yeah so you know i think i've seen this happen
to various people like they they get to a certain point in their life and like god damn it i'm gonna [ __ ] can i swear on this program of course you can okay
so anyway there's a there comes a time i've seen this happen to various people in their life it's something triggers it sometimes it's like
it's an age thing they're like turning a certain age where they always thought they would have more done by then or they
you know a certain maybe someone in their family passes away and they're like oh my god like time is finite it's precious
and something happens where they're like i'm not gonna [ __ ] around anymore like i'm gonna get this done
no matter the cost and they just start really buckling down they find this source of energy and so
you know find whatever that is for for you like the listener out there and um
and then go hard at it you know finish your book like launch your launcher thing whatever it is the app
the startup just just start doing stuff like and even if you don't even know what to do just do anything because you
know action will produce information um i i actually so that you just reminded
me there was a precursor to the coinbase which was um this app that i built with my friend uh which we were trying to
figure out how bitcoin worked and we built that and the minute we shipped it i was like it's built wrong and i knew the architecture was wrong
and then i knew what to do next and so oftentimes you don't even know what to do just do anything and you'll find it'll help you get to the right thing
action leads to information yeah action produces information never heard that before i i i stole that
from uh paul graham i think who started white commentators yeah it's so true and i will steal that from you so again can
you hear that in the future without credit then you know where it's come from at that time what were you trying
to build you'd read that white paper you launched that first step then after that first app you launched what were you
trying to build what was the vision yeah so this was 2000 um i guess it was
like 2010 time frame and you howled i guess i was like 29 yeah something like
that um so what i was trying to do i had read the bitcoin white paper and i was like
okay this is a decentralized protocol for money or something and my
thought in my head at that time was well there's been other decentralized protocols like email is a decentralized protocol
you know git is a tool that developers used for version control and so for email people didn't really run their own
email servers they'd use a hosted email service like gmail or forget they'd use a hosted service like github right so my
thought was okay here's a new decentralized protocol people are going to need like a github or a gmail type thing that does all the security in the
backups for you and it works on mobile and the web and i was like someone's going to build a company doing that
would be kind of a hard company to run because you're going to be storing all this bitcoin people are going to want to hack it and like that's not like a
weekend project that's like a really serious responsibility and i was
had that idea in the back of my head and somehow i couldn't get it out of my head and so i just sort of like started
tinkering with i i wasn't even really just saying i was going to build a company yet i was more like um
i don't know let me just try building a prototype of this to see what if again action produces information and so
that was the original idea it was it was like a hosted bitcoin wallet instead of like running your own one on your on your own computer with a node and
everything was just complicated at the time and when you told people this idea what was their reaction because you would have had to tell a lot of people
that you were building this thing with this thing called bitcoin on a other thing which they wouldn't have
understood either yeah so people didn't get it at all i talked to some of my smartest friends
about it and they were like i don't really get this bitcoin thing it sounds like a scam honestly right so that they didn't that
was not reassuring um and then i went to a couple bitcoin meetups people who were really into bitcoin and i was like yeah i'm building
like a hosted bitcoin well like gmail for email but and i remember one of these people was like that's a terrible idea because
um you know all the people try to do that they get hacked and they lose they lose all the customer funds and so like
that's you should never do that right so i didn't get a lot of positive feedback everybody i talked to actually thought
that audio was a bad idea um even when i was i had gone through y
combinator i was trying to raise money um you know i would say like for every
10 meetings i did with investors i got nine no's and one kind of
i guess like small yes so and that's always tough like fundraising
is always tough but you know if you go to these people who you believe are like really smart people and 90 of them are telling you no
that's like that's like the best case scenario in my experience um you know the the worst case scenario is
100 of them tell you no so but either way it's like 90 90 of people telling you you have to be really
kind of willing to um not get discouraged by that you had a co-founder for a couple of
weeks during that y combinator process right yeah i heard that you um
in in applying for y combinator you wanted to have a co-founder you met someone quickly and then it didn't last more than like four weeks or something
yeah exactly um yeah so i was looking for a co-founder at that time and um ben reeves had created this really good
app called blockchain.info at the time now it's blockchain.com but um so i reached out to him we didn't really
know each other that well we ended up applying to white combinator and uh sort of did this like shotgun wedding
thing but it didn't it didn't work out and it was like we were about to start the program and
um we basically decided to part ways so it's funny in an alternate universe
um blockchain.com and coinbase would have been the same company but anyway
it all obviously worked out well for both of us did you have self-doubt at that point
for sure oh man i was filled with self-doubt yeah i i thought
that first of all i thought maybe i was crazy because all my friends who i talked about this idea thought it was a bad idea
um the thing that gave me a glimmer of hope was that y combinator decided to give me this 150k seed check and i
really respected y combinator um so that gave me a big shot of confidence but
you know before that it was like it was very touch and go i mean i i was like well my co-founder thing didn't
work out um i don't know like i'm just going to try my best here but like this i was like
this has like a pretty high chance of failure what did your parents think um okay so my parents have always have
people who worked at like big companies like their whole life and um i don't know if they ever really got the
whole entrepreneurship thing that i was so into the when i called to tell them that i was quitting airbnb to go start this company
there was kind of like okay well we we support you we love you like
are you gonna have any health insurance that's what my mom asked i think um and so i think there was
they were kind of afraid that i was doing something really stupid and reckless is my guess
but they ultimately trusted me and supported it probably probably with a lot of doubts
is my guess on that point of co-founders yeah um i read that you eventually sort of interviewed 50 odd co-founders to try
and find the right one for what would become coinbase what were you looking for and what was in hindsight what advice
would you give me because that's another question i get asked a lot is how did you find a co-founder and yeah
so yeah i was looking for a co-founder at that time desperately and i was i'd go on these like co-founders dates you know we'd meet somebody see how it goes
they'd pitch you your their startup idea i'd tell them about mine and maybe go on a second date or third date so
none of these seem to like really click and i guess i was looking for someone to get really excited about my idea
um but also somebody who i felt was really complementary to me in terms of like um it pushed me to think bigger and
stuff like that i hadn't thought about before and you know i wanted to leave feeling energized and that i'd learned
something and they were good compliment and so i got kind of disillusioned because a
number of these went on and on and on and i could i couldn't find anybody like that i really liked to join this thing
so eventually i just got fed up and i was like all right you know what i'm just gonna do this thing on my own and like
and get it off the ground and lo and behold once i started to show some signs of progress you know like
getting through y combinator raising a seed check getting the product i put the prototype out there on like reddit and
the right person reached out to me and so anyway i tell people that story because i think it's an important lesson
which is basically if you don't have the right co-founder just keep making progress and signs of
success may cause the right person to find you it needs to be public signs of success it's almost like putting out the
bat signal like um if you have like half of an idea you can't just like
be talking to your friends about it you got to put it out on a blog post or like a prototype or get something out there
in the world on twitter or whatever because then the other person might be out there and they won't know to find you and reach out unless you put out the
bat signal so that's also really good dating advice it's like you said if you don't have a
co-founder just keep making progress and putting it out there i guess it's true like in terms of people fitness and you know health and
development fine figure out yourself yeah exactly yeah and you become a magnet as opposed to having to be a peacock
that's true so and that's much more valuable when i think about your first tutoring company
there was that pivotal moment where you removed the payment and just kind of got out the way and that was pivotal to the company exploding yeah when you think
about those early years what what was the significant step that unlocked the the growth in your view
yeah so there was a significant moment like that with coinbase too because oftentimes by the way
the first version of a product you put out it doesn't work in fact that's the only thing i've ever seen happen in startups i've never i've never seen a
startup there the very first version of their product actually worked sometimes in hindsight people like to tell that story but
i think in reality it's very rare so for us or for really it was just me initially then that was fred ursum and i
co-founding it um the first version was this hosted bitcoin wallet and so we had i i posted
on reddit some people would sign up but nobody would stick around and use the product so in y commentary they teach you this
great thing which is don't spend your time you know like going to conferences and like trying to
raise money it's like if you don't have product market fit yet talk to your customers and then improve the product based on their feedback and
then talk to your customers and improve the product talk to customers improve the product there's really only two things you should be doing in the early stage talking to your customers and
improving the product sounds like simple advice but people spend so much time doing other stuff that's actually not real work so
taking this advice i emailed you know 10 of the people or so who had signed up for the product and never come back
and i said hey i created this app like i'd love to get on the phone with you and just talk to you about it for a minute so i remember i got on the phone
with some of these people and one of them one of them was like you know what do you think about the app he's like well i kind of i kind of like
it but i don't have any bitcoin so i just didn't come back and i remember thinking well if there had been
an easy way to get bitcoin into your wallet like a buy button or something like would you have stuck around and used it he's like yeah probably
and so i was like okay let me go try to make a simple buy button so when people sign up they can actually get some bitcoin into their wallet and it turned
out that was a very hard thing to do you had to get these bank partnerships i had to figure out money transmission licenses and i won't bore you with all
the details there was a lot of you know making things work somehow behind the
scenes but the minute that we that we launched at that time i think frederson had just joined we launched that um that buy
button it started to grow every day organically with no marketing or anything and that
was the minute i felt like we finally had private market fit over the next let's say five so that's
2012 roughly 2012. over the next five years up until the point where fred departs that growth is
pretty crazy right for coinbase yeah i mean it started growing organically um
and we had a very good problem at that point which was that um we were basically every time someone clicked the buy
button we had to use our own capital to acquire the bitcoin at that right at that price so we didn't have some
exposure to it going up or down and then we would initiate a debit to their bank account and two or three business days
later we'd get the funds so we had basically had a working capital issue like we were using our own corporate
funds to buy the crypto and then getting their money the payment from the customer and the numbers started to go up and up
and up and um i think it raised like 600k at that time and we were using like 550k to service the day-to-day buying on
the site and so we realized quite quickly we're like okay we need to go out and raise money
and that was a good a good a good story to raise money was hey this thing is growing so fast that we we're going to be turning away
business if we don't raise money that's a good story to go raise money as opposed to you know the numbers are kind
of flat we haven't really got it working yet so i think it was very important that we we found product market fit only
when we couldn't scale then we went out to raise capital what mistakes did you make as a company in those first five
Mistakes & key learnings when starting up
years that you in hindsight go damn that's a that's a key learning yes i think if i were to go back and do
it again there's a few things i might have done that would have helped it be more get to get there even more efficiently i
mean one is that we actually never wrote down like the mission of the company or the value of the company early on
and we were doing it all organically we were basically just hiring interviewing every single person who would join and
we managed to create this really interesting culture but it was a little bit it wasn't very deliberate it was just it
happened kind of accidentally because we were just choosing the people that we wanted to work with and we really surprised us and we're really bright
in those high growth moments there's so things keep breaking yeah and processors actually need to adopt when you get as
you'll know from when you go from a couple of people to them 50 to 100 to them so just thinking if there's any
advice you have for me someone i've grown a business but not in not in such a a high growth way and not in such an
interesting um uncharted industry um
eventually your co-founder fred departs what was that like emotionally because i
can't imagine the thought of my co-founder parting in e5 it would almost make me feel honestly it would have made
me feel like they were part of the reason i was doing this yeah you know that bond and that we're in this together so how did that
feel emotionally i mean it was awful um i cried
you know um so yeah so i think here's the whole story so i think really
fred um president was an amazing co-founder and we were building all this great stuff together he's really a natural leader right and so
um i was the ceo of the company but there was times where you know i i think he felt like he was being held back he
really kind of wanted to run his own thing at a certain point and we were almost kind of like running it jointly at various places and at various times
and so i tried my best to like keep him engaged and i was like all right why don't you go do all the external facing
stuff and what's the thing that would really excite you like you know he did a lot of the fundraising like he
was really representing the company in the way you know the the titles didn't matter um
but ultimately i think he really did want to run his own thing and so he was very clear with me he we talked about it
basically over the period of like a year or so um with an exec coach and all this and
one of the things that i think i'm most proud of is that he and i are still like really good friends probably best friends to this day
um whereas a lot of co-founders when someone does leave there's a blow up and it's like i think we both realized at a
certain point it was like actually the more important thing to preserve here is the friendship and so he was great about it he was like i want
to make sure the company's in a good place it doesn't need to happen any there's nothing soon here happening but i do eventually want to transition so
over a period of a year we talked about it and then when he finally told me he was ready i cried
um it did feel like you know it was losing kind of half the company the the s
founding moment of it and i remember so then we had to go in front of the company and tell deliver the news
oh man so um we talked to the board and everything like that too first but we went i remember the day we had to go
tell the company and you know i i wasn't normally i wasn't getting nervous talking to the company like you
know first company's two people and then it's five then it's 10 and then it's 50 then it's 100 200 so you sort of get to
build up your tolerance and like okay i could go talk to the company of 150 people or something but this time i had to go up there and
tell them the co-founder was leaving and i remember i went up in for the company and my voice cracked like i was like a
14 year old 13 year old whatever and then my my leg was like shaking you know
sometimes you get like enough adrenaline if you're like you're nervous that you're just like you're anyway i was like oh my god it's so embarrassing like
i had to like walk behind the podium so nobody could see my leg shaking and my voice is cracking
and i'm like god i'm [ __ ] i'm messing this up you know like because i'm supposed to be projecting confidence and
like no it's not a big deal we're gonna get through this and i'm just like coming across like this pre-pubescent kid you know
um so everybody of course is like kind of shocked and they could people were like i could tell you were
really scared brian i was like [ __ ] okay i didn't really announce that very well um and of course like you know
48 hours went by like everybody freaked out and then it was like 40 hours later it was like all right let's
get back to work you know and and of course it wasn't as bad as i thought but yeah that was a really scary moment and
then and basically i had to transition from running the company with like all right fred and i let's get in the room and
decide it to okay let's actually build an executive team around me um
to have a more like professionally run company if you will so it ended up being
like sort of a second founding moment of the company and i realized this later actually companies have many founding
moments and you can just keep building what situation was the company and now again in hindsight yeah at that stage because
i heard in 2017 things were a little bit messy and and you brought in this executive
team to kind of help you you know solve some of those problems but when at the point when fred left
what was the state of the company so he he left it as this market was swinging up and that was conscious on
his part he wanted to make sure the company didn't harm the company as he left um and so yeah the challenge after that was
like okay go build an exec team and a lot of founders have gotten through this it's it's quite hard so
if the company is growing you know 50 a year or something you can oftentimes promote people from within who are kind
of learning on the job and just take on more and more responsibility we in the in these cryptos so volatile
to go through like 500 growth in one year and then negative 100 the next year and it's like
so i felt like i was in over my head like all these junior people who had joined
early on we were all in over our head we were like so we basically went out to seek more experienced executives to come
in and um that was in itself its own crazy process with lots of learnings
because whenever you bring in a bunch of high-powered executives you know sometimes you get people who butt heads right and um it's hard when like taking
a new team they have to build trust and oftentimes the team is often like kind of
dysfunctional until like they go through enough together so we had some good blow-ups there um there
was some executives like left or were fired and like um you know i had to like basically learn
how to work with with more seasoned executives
and people who had run massive things before and um you know i i guess one lesson i learned
from that and this is kind of personal to me there's different people find different things that work for them but
you know i realized i wanted to work with people who were not just really brilliant but like also really humble
because i'm not really like a combative person by nature like some people some companies have this culture where
they love to hash things out and debate it and like that's that's like a really good conversation or like you kind of get into it you're like
you know but i'm i'm more of like i want to think about what you said and like come back and and more collaborative so
i'm not really i'm a little bit conflict diverse so um anyway i started hiring more for
like people who are bright but humble collab collaborative i mean the risk of that by the way is you can get into a
little bit of like a yes person culture where every everyone's afraid to disagree or something that's also not good but
it took me a couple iterations to kind of find my style there and now it's working great like the exec
team is super competent and high trust and collaborative and i think it's like a it gives us a
lot of benefits as a company because there's like basically no bs politics stuff it's just like we're just getting work done
have each other's back and we have you have to constantly tend that and nurture it like with these exec offsides and stuff but
yeah there were some learning pains there when when crypto went through that first well not the first but that real
that sort of 2017 bull run where everything was going up how were you feeling as the ceo of coinbase coinbase
Leadership lessons
is exploding i remember that that's when i i first downloaded coinbase and became a coinbase customer how were you feeling
a ceo in terms of optimism for how long that moment was going to last
did you did you have a suspicion that it that in 2018 i believe it was that the market would come crashing down
yeah i didn't know when it would happen but there was definitely it it tipped at a certain point from like oh this growth is really good too
okay things are getting a little crazy here like there was yeah i remember i'd go to some events
and i was like everybody was coming in launching some ico and um people would like come over and
like want to take selfies with me and then like post the stuff on twitter and like almost implying i was like
endorsing the project and then um i remember like weird stuff happened like i was living in this apartment building
in san francisco and this guy who like worked in the building came to me one day and he's like this
package arrived for you sir and uh sir i just have this question like which crypto should i buy and i was like i
don't know this is getting really weird like i don't i don't give any investment advice or whatever and
um yeah so basically it started attracting in like people who are just trying to get rich quick or scams and all this
stuff and so yeah we started i started walking around with like a security guard um
we had like some over exuberant customers it was it was weird tell me about that because
i was i was thinking we've had some um fintech ceos here yeah that have built disruptive banks out in europe so monzo
starling bank et cetera even clark you know klan i guess that's not a bank but kleiner the ceo sebastian here as well
security is not something that most ceos have to think about but when you're dealing with money
as tom told me from monzo you get a lot of unhappy people because you're
you know you sometimes you have to freeze funds and things like that yeah well okay so i think
i mean if at a certain size of company it's almost inevitable for every ceo it's not just it's just not just money
but i do think that we probably started a little earlier because um because it was crypto is
money um and yeah i mean it's it's also just a
law of numbers like if you're running an enterprise a sas a b2b business something like that you might have
thousands of customers or maybe 100 000 or something but if you're running a very popular consumer app
um and you get into the millions or you know coinbase has like maybe like 100 million ish verified users now
um if you just think about it statistically i mean you know like what like one in a hundred people
in society has some form of schizophrenia right maybe one one out of ten of those like
so one out of a thousand people in society has a form of mental illness that just like
you know could be potentially dangerous or they can become obsessed with things irrationally or whatever and so if you
have 100 million customers like there's going to be enough people as part of it is just like a law of large numbers
but um you know i i don't want to overstate it like it's not i don't it's not like a
huge burden on my life i i feel i feel safe and i'm able to keep functioning and stuff like that um
yeah another thing most ceos don't have to contend with is building a business in such a volatile market so when in
2018 the market comes crashing down the crypto market comes crashing down
talk to me about what leadership lessons you learned through that what would what i can only imagine
as being a pretty awful period yeah so 2018 everything was coming down off that high of 2017
and you know i had been through a couple cycles like this but each one was getting bigger and bigger and
it was tough i mean i in the following i think year or so after that crash i think we might have had like 25 of the
company leave or something right really yeah so there is a lot of attrition there were people who had joined and
they thought hey this is a rocket ship it's only going one way and then when it was down and lots of negative
news headlines come along you know the news always focuses on things that are not always but often focuses on things that are too short-term when it's going
up they're like this is they're genius and their future everything's future and then when it's down they're like this is
never gonna it's failed and neither one is true right like reality you have to zoom out to kind of look at reality
but one thing i realized um was that i felt this overwhelming pressure as ceo was like oh shoot like every every week
i've got to get in from the company and like put on a good face and like create some sense of optimism right
the reality was i was kind of feeling shitty about it too and so it was a little inauthentic for me to go up there and
try to just be super positive or something and so one leadership lesson i learned during that moment is that
great leaders are often vulnerable and so it's actually a much more powerful
leadership uh style i think to just go up there and say how you actually feel which you might be able to go you might
go up there and say something like i feel like [ __ ] today you know like this thing's down like this person quit
um whatever it is now it helps if you if you can then use that to as a moment to like
bring the team together and it's not like you have to solve all the problems as ceo it's like we you use a lot of we language right it's
like i don't know how you're feeling i feel like this that that's going to take a little bit of attention out of the room because they're all probably
feeling it too and they're like okay great this guy's like not a robot he like kind of gets it too it's like okay
so what can we do about it like well we all need to figure out how to solve x x is a pretty big problem right now we all need to figure out how to solve y so
what do w what are we going to do like this week i'm going to host this meeting with so and so in this group and like we're going to come i want you to all
bring your best ideas about how we're going to solve x we're going to pick one and we're going to double down on it right so now now it's like you're
turning this authenticity this candor in and you're and you're making everybody a part of the solution it's
not like hey everybody look to brian like he's got all the answers you know this like messiah complex or whatever like no
it's like the strength is comes from the team it's not just like me trying to carry the whole weight of the world in my shoulders or something
so that that was a good leadership lesson for me how did you do you've been through you know these crypto winters and your
Fake news and dealing with it
company got so big that you know it went public and then when you become a public company and you're almost seen as the
poster child of this space in many respects at least that's that's always been my view of coinbase there's been many many
exchanges but the the number one one the one that's the famous one the the poster child is coinbase
the pressure and the scrutiny and the headlines and the f and the the fake news and all of
it yeah that you must be have thrown at you and then all the you know the internal problems of just running a
business anyway how are you dealing with your emotions yeah okay wow deep question so um
let's see i think because you're human yeah of course
okay so i think one of the most important things i i totally didn't realize this before starting a company but it turns out
one of the most important things um skill sets to kind of develop as a ceo of a startup is that
you have to be willing to ignore a lot of noise um both positive and
negative right because if people on the way up are telling you how brilliant you are and you kind of get caught up in like
going to the speaker circuit and like you know um then you're going to fall even harder when
they turn on you and then everybody either gets built up or taken down and it's just driving headlines right so
you kind of can't believe it on the way up because then you won't believe it on the way down either um i totally didn't realize that by
starting a company i thought most people would generally be rooting for you and you know um but there's people out there rooting
for you to fail which is a weird thing um they're kind of dealing with their own maybe stuff about success right i
don't know what it is um but you have to learn how to just tune all that out so i mean like
frankly i just don't don't read like a lot of news anymore i kind of think of it like sugar it's it's addictive
and can you consume it in small quantities responsibly and like eat a couple bites of dessert or something like yes
but um you have to be really careful because basically the kind of um anger fear
outrage whatever you know is an addictive thing by the way it's not just mainstream media like social media has
some challenges with this too right i i think it's actually a little hypocritical like mainstream media is always criticizing social media for
misinformation and it's like it's pot calling the kiddo black or whatever it's like the same thing happening there
so i literally try not to read a lot of this stuff so once then once you developed
your own sort of psychology about it now you have to insulate the team from it because they'll go after your team
and um so you need to kind of continually be preaching this to the team about like
you know be an independent thinker right go develop your own source of truth like
um by going to the root of it like um don't don't be listening to um mainstream
media or social media whatever when things are up or down you have to curate you have to use that stuff in moderation like like
sugar or something it's not actually they're they're trying to sell their own product and they're and
one of my friends has this great saying um it's like only a half truth can go viral
like if it's you know that triggering or whatever that's like ah like it goes all around the world it's
it's half true at best and so you have to remember that whenever you see anything out there what are the things that still penetrate
all of that resilience though there's because there's things in even me that i i i understand all of that um as i was
saying to you before we start recording i became a dragon dragon's den so i got much more scrutiny than i've ever got from headlines i'd read about my family
that i don't have my girlfriend i'd done this that you'd think i was running guantanamo bay
the way that right they described my former business all these things um and although i knew i was resilient and
although i knew everything you've said and i put these processes in place where i don't see notifications someone tweets me i probably don't even see it it
doesn't come up never read the replies yeah i don't have that i turned off all notifications too that's that's a really
good one like but what pierces you still yeah what still moves your mood so there's def there's something every
year at least that like it's the next level that it's gonna test you right
and um you know oh man what was most recently um there
was like i don't even know if this was real or if this was like short sellers like putting fake information out there
but there was some like petition that um some employees put together or something and like i saw your response to yeah i
got irritated by it and like wrote some stuff on twitter about it but that that bugged me for a bit because it was like
um okay like you're going to attack the executives like it's not even their fault like you you know whatever blame
me so um i think what there's always something new it's like
you know a lot of people probably would be okay with oh there's some somebody saying something stupid on twitter or
whatever but they really respect x you know maybe it's like
um the new york times or something or whatever right and they're like oh that's that's like a and so then you get
your first like negative article like that has false information in it in the new york times and then you're like well
that just shattered my reality of like even that could happen like so man and there's like what else is
like not accurate in the new york times or pic pick any other you know fox news like whatever you know even one of the ones that
really got to me was um i always felt like okay we have these kind of people who are upset with us outside of the company but the company
is one team like we're all and then when i started to see like sometimes there were people in the company kind of
turning on each other i was like man that one really bugged me right so think about um
if you think about companies that have gotten to really big scale it makes all your problems look small by
comparison okay like like look at mark zuckerberg right i mean the amount of negative news coming out on that guy on
a daily basis right um i think that
like the russian government like just put him on some like um list of like sanctioned people or
something like there's people of tons of death threats you know like um
there's there's always another level i can get to you know that's just like anyway i i
what i've realized about a lot of people who i think are building important things in the world is that
they've developed this like high disagreeableness muscle where
they've recognized like they're not going to make everybody happy and they've made peace with it right so they realize at a certain point like
whether i do the thing that i think everyone's going to like or everything that is more authentic to me someone's going
to be pissed no matter what so at the end of the day i'm just going to do the thing that i think is the right thing and they they've leaned more into
authenticity instead of trying to say what they think people want to hear and that does require you to have some
amount of thick skin some kind of high disagreeableness and then they can actually do even more interesting stuff because
they're they're being themselves instead of trying to be liked my success and my building my personal
brand and getting millions of followers online it scratched that itch in an unhealthy way that we described earlier it kind of
made me feel it gave me external validation which felt like it was filling me up it's probably sugar or something
and then the problem is if you if you were that type of person when you when you do reach that height you get more
public scrutiny it matters more to you because validation was your driving force this whole time yeah so is there
an element of that with you because because you were an introvert that wanted to have significant be significant because of that early
upbringing that it might be psychologically more difficult to deal with because significance and fitting in
i guess was so paramount to your initial motivation totally yeah i mean it can be very
it can be very addictive also just to be liked and and the adulation and everything so
the minute something starts to happen that you realize people aren't going to like you for your temptation is to try
to preserve it now you have something to lose you're like i'm going to lose these followers or i'm going to you know um
whatever it does it doesn't even matter but it always feels serious at the time so
i i definitely had to grow through that i i don't know i think i'm still growing through that to i i would like to get to
a place where you know you don't want you don't want to become like isolated to a place where
you're not listening to anybody because that's also really bad so you you do wanna you need people who can keep you grounded like your family like your
friends whatever and people who around you who will tell you when you're being an idiot or you're just wrong so like you don't ever wanna get to a place
where i listen to nobody right but a lot of people you want to be around people who have your best interests at
heart and then listen to them or people have already done what you're trying to do it like listen that's good advice but
a lot of the people who are just trying to take shots at you to build their own whatever in life
you need to build the ability to ignore them and um it's a real superpower to like care less
what other people think um at least people who don't have your best interests at heart having worked in social media over the last 10 years i
maybe in my seventh or eighth year noticed a really interesting thing that happened um organizations as end women say in their trust reports were once
black boxes which is the reputation of the organization the image was written on the outside of the black box of the organization by the marketing department
of pr we moved into this world where they're now glass boxes the world can see inside all of your employees have
smartphones and they can take pictures and write reviews and so organizations now um had to adapt and one of the
things that i've seen just as an observation is ceos being out there in the public eye
overly out there in the public eye i'm thinking elon yeah and the antithesis of that might be zuckerberg who basically
hid for 10 years and the media shaped him as a soulless data stealing robot and then
you've got elon because he's smoking weed on durogan's podcast you can say whatever you like about him i think i
know him right i have my own reference point and my point here is about transparency and even doing things like this
for me i don't i don't know how you feel about this but for me the if i was running a big organization i'd be doing a lot to make sure that the
public had their own reference point of who i am how does that all sit with you because that seems to be the only defense
against the media writing your narrative yeah so i've thought about this a lot and i'm not
sure i have the perfect answer but um so i think there's a spectrum so
on one side of the spectrum like you said you can actually zuckerberg is somewhere in the middle to me but to be truly isolated i think like larry
page for instance he was very reclusive almost never gave interviews right
elon is kind of out there doing a lot more interviews and he's just like literally says whatever he thinks i
think you know right on twitter did you see zuckerberg's 2019 facebook post which one he did the post i think was
2019 maybe 2017 that sounds better 2017 he did a post saying that he's basically hidden away for that whole period of
time his new year's resolution was to come out of his bunker so he did a period of um hiding out and like yeah
yeah so i mean i think a lot of ceos struggle with this because you know i think a lot of people realize
like it sucks to be famous so you know when i was a kid i would you'd hear people say that or something and
i'd be like yeah whatever for you to say but um there's a lot of downsides right i mean
people in the the media or publicity can be like this this cruel beast right if you
feed it it just wants more and more and more so um i think there are advantages to having a public
profile like it helps you recruit people if someone attacks the company you have your own direct audience to like get the
the message out the truth so there's definitely like benefits and then there's drawbacks because now
you know maybe your kids need security or whatever or just um you know someone's gonna come up to your
restaurant when you're trying to have a thing with your family or whatever so there's real downsides to it um
i think for me i'm trying to find this reasonable middle ground where like i i turn down 95 of media
um i i really want to talk to people like that are doing what new media right like
like this like podcasts or um or youtube or really just have conversations with people that i think are interesting and
i like um that get messages out in sort of unique ways and i i do i like having some amount of
following if i ever need to set the record on something but i don't want to become famous actually i'd rather if i
could avoid that i would prefer it i think it's it's sort of a acceptable
negative of building something interesting in the world but it's not it's not actually a positive
interesting and one of the things you talked about was that um who knows whether it was real or not
there was a i want to give context to the listeners who don't who don't follow you and might not have seen that there was a uh
something written up that said internally an employee was petitioning to have someone else removed internally
yeah whether it's true or not we don't know it was taken down um you responded to that on twitter yeah you also said to
me that you were in a bit of a bad mood when you responded to that twitter yeah how do you feel in hindsight about all of that
and did you did you learn anything about company culture or changes that needed to be
made or give me your reflections on that yeah so you never know if you're doing the right
thing right um one argument would be that this is just unnecessary i could have ignored it and
um there was people who never even saw it and there was and they read my tweets and they were like oh what's going on
and now i gave even more attention to it right yeah um on the flip side there was a bunch of
people who reached out to me that was very positive it was like i'm glad you're just you know saying it like it is like it shows who you really what you really
care about and um you're basically communicating to the rest of employees like if you're
unhappy about something like there's a right forum to do that internally it's not this is harming the company and so
you're anyway a lot of people liked it some people didn't like it at all so did i do the right thing i have no idea i'm just like making this up as i
go and i kind of i kind of like try things and i see how they go one thing i will say is that
something that's polarizing is not that doesn't make it the wrong thing to do it what makes it
to me the right thing to do the wrong thing to do is whether it was authentically true um so i don't know how i would do it
again next time i guess i maybe i would do it with a cool head and um
see if it still felt authentic and then go from there polarizing another thing that when people talk about company culture people give
No politics in the workplace
um people that i've been around point to coinbase as an example of is you coming out and saying that coinbase wouldn't
uh tolerate politics um and other divisive topics being
discussed on company channels in the workplace yeah this is a big conv i've had conversations this week with my
companies where they've talked about coinbase and the example you've set because of things that have happened over the last couple of weeks in
politics around in america um tell me why you made that decision
because i once upon a time when we had brexit in this company allowed my office to get overrun with anti-brexit flags
and i actually regret that because a week later an employee pulled me aside and said i'm actually pro-brexit and the
whole week i felt like the office wasn't a safe place for me to yeah yeah um so you you set out a stance which i've not
i saw you do it first i'm not sure if any other companies have done it but publicly you were the first to say no
politics at work yeah yeah i mean i think other companies are doing variations of that um so it's not
entirely original but yeah i did put it out in a way that was public and got a lot of attention so look i don't know i don't know what to
say about it i think it's it started it starts from a very good place which is people want to have
a safe space at work they want to have a place where they can just be themselves authentically like these all these things actually start from a very good
place what's unfortunate is that it can get to a place where the office is actually um
just very divided and people are upset with each other all day instead of like working towards the common mission that we all kind of signed up for
um they're actually just upset with each other and arguing over things which we don't really have very much impact over like bigger broader societal issues
outside of our mission um this not just coinbase this is happening broadly across a lot of
tech and all companies really it's not just even a tech thing it is it is more pronounced certain places in the world it's not it's not a
broad thing geographically it's it's very pronounced in some cities um
especially in the us but i guess probably somewhat here as well so notice much
yeah i i i remember our ireland office like there were some people who messaged me during all that and they're like what
is you just said like we're gonna work on work do work at work like what's what's so controversial they didn't it didn't make any sense um so it was it
was largely a thing that happened i think in the bay area in the us and a couple other cities like maybe brooklyn portland places like that but
um look i i don't you know in some ways i'd rather coinbase was like known for our product innovation and stuff this is
a weird one because like we've actually been pretty become kind of well known for this stance and others have emulated
it but the thing that really made me finally get the courage to do it because
i i i didn't really want to make a public stance about this or whatever i just want everybody to get back to work but the reason i did it was that
i felt like i had been a bad leader basically i had let this kind of misunderstanding accumulate inside the
organization where people thought that it was okay to like come to work and just debate endlessly these things or like at the q a that we
would host every week or two there would be a lot of questions that were not about our product or the regulators or the the future it would be about like
these broader societal issues and these kind of these brush fires kept erupting in in slack channels and things
and so oh and there and i think i reached a place where i was like i don't think i really want to be the
ceo of this company if like this is what the ceo job entails is kind of like getting put on the spot with like um
these crazy difficult societal questions every week i kind of want to just build cool stuff with technology and work on
our mission and so i actually contemplated briefly i was like am i the one who's like just not sued for this job and maybe this is how
companies are run now and a bunch of i talked to a bunch of friends of mine and people and they were like no like if if that's how you feel
there's probably a bunch of other people the company who also feel that way and like you started this company
you don't need to go they need to go and so it was if i realized i was like either i'm gonna resign or they're gonna need
to resign and so at that point i was like all right they need to resign so we made we made an exit package available like i clarified the stance of the
company five percent of the employees opted into that package and left and then after that it felt like the company
was much more aligned and we were all able to move towards the mission um so it was cool to see some companies
emulate it afterwards and there's probably a less dramatic way to do it you know if you kind of said it that way
from the beginning but um yeah that's where we are one of the things that i really wanted to ask you about because from reading your blog
post you have a very clear strategy and perspective on this and i also see this in hindsight as being the
Hiring the best people & layoffs
single most important thing that i ever had the responsibility of doing and getting right which is hiring people
um i i [ __ ] up for the first three years i hired inexperienced people that were cheap and that i felt i could manage
because i was 21 or 20. so i had a bunch of you like you want a job you want a job you want a job you can be director
director of this yeah my biggest mistake i only learned when i hired someone good and i saw the net impact they had and
the fact that good people then hired good people what advice would you give to people that are hiring now and how important
do you consider hiring to be super important i mean actually in coinbase's values the number one
value is top talent in every seat because it really everything in the company comes back to people like if you want to
have a big impact you need to have generate a bunch of revenue and profit if you want good revenue property and
you make good products if you make good products you have to have good people build them so it's actually everything comes back to people
um so yeah i mean it's interesting to hear that you learned that lesson the hard way i've
hiring is super hard sometimes the only way to learn a lesson is to actually go make the mistake and and do it but the mistake that a lot of startups
make i think is that they hire too fast they treat the absence of any negatives
as a reason to hire whereas it should be not just the absence of negatives but hell yes meaning like
i learned something from this person they they're way better than me at something at least
you know i left the interview with more energy than when i went in um i
you know you can de-risk a lot of early hiring also by just having people come in and like try working together for a week or two
interviews are actually really kind of a low signal thing you have to get real some people are great interviewers like maybe five percent of people can really
assess someone in an interview most people aren't that good at it naturally and so you can basically use references
or what we did in early days of coinbase we actually just had people try working with us for like a week or two a lot of
people can't do that because they have an existing job but some people can and we you'll know you'll know within a
week or two like this person basically delivered a bunch of stuff they got a bunch of stuff done that was useful and helped move the ball forward
or they didn't like it needed me it needed me or someone else to come in and edit their work or curate it and like
it's not to oversimplify it but basically like if the person can get a lot of stuff done
that's advanced is the mission then you want them on the team and if they can't you shouldn't have them on the team and
that's basically what makes great companies is like you have a bunch of people aligned toward a big impactful mission
who can actually get a lot of stuff done every week and um you know you share some values in common
and then everything else they can be quirky and weird and different and like from every background and walk of life and like everything
else can be different but if you have those pieces right they get a lot of stuff done towards the mission
and they're aligned then you got a good company you said about growing too fast i i saw you post recently that you
you've grown the company too fast over the last couple of years and that you were having to cut back about 18 of the workforce yeah
emotionally in those moments you know the statements were you were very transparent you were very honest you
didn't have to publish that to the entire world but you did yeah emotionally what are those moments like does it get any easier for you to
to to cut back the workforce when you you signaled in the memo that you take responsibility for that as well like
you weren't skirting blame or anything so yeah so there's always something challenging every year that like really
puts you out put you outside of your comfort zone and that's part of what i like about running a company is like you're constantly learning so so this
year that was one of the things was like we had never done a layoff before i had never done one and um
yeah i did kind of suck to look back and say um ah i actually made them stick you know we were everything everything crypto was
so up and up and up last year that it it felt irresponsible not to keep hiring more people because
we had like lines out our door you know virtually of like customers trying to sign up like institutional clients and
new products and competitors and all these different markets and we were like we're just being
reckless and irrational not to keep building the company with all this revenue we're generating and so but i
think we found the breaking point and basically if you kind of more than double a company in a year you're really going to start to see a lot of stuff
break the culture erodes um decision making is unclear communication channels
break down and so we we definitely like exceeded that threshold last year in 2021 and earlier this year we were on a
pace to kind of keep going too quickly so
you know it really it really kind of is a bad feeling to look at a problem and say oop i made a mistake
but the only worst thing that is to like bury your head in the sand and pretend that you didn't make a mistake because you don't want to admit it or whatever
and so um facing reality while it was deeply unpleasant and it
was really unpleasant for the people that parted ways with the company um it was the right thing to do that now we
have the ability to kind of learn how to operate really efficiently at this new size 5000 people still a lot and get a
ton done with that and we got the cost structure to a place where we know that we can
not only um have enough cash but like really thrive in this in this recession we're all going
through at this point and whether that lasts one year or three years or four years whatever we're now we've set the company up to ensure that it has a
better chance of accomplishing the mission long term so in a way although it was a super hard decision and it was tough for a lot of
people involved it made me feel good that we did the right thing i am so excited to announce our new sponsor for this podcast and that is
blue jeans by verizon for any of you that aren't already familiar with blue jeans they are a video conferencing and
collaboration tool who offer an immersive communication experience that drives pretty unparalleled employee and
customer engagement experiences me and all of my teams across all of my portfolio companies switched over to
blue jeans a couple of months ago and we have not looked back the best thing for us has been the totally frictionless
experience no glitching no sound issues no delays or any of those things that usually make virtual meetings really
really frustrating we use blue jeans anywhere on any device at any time and it's perfect for my small businesses
that just have 10 or 20 people to some of my bigger businesses that have hundreds of people i'm a big fan as you
can probably tell so i've been quite excited for for some time to announce this partnership and in the coming weeks
i'll explain the features and really why it's perfect for you if you haven't considered using or switching over to
bluejeans yet but if you can't wait head over to bluejeans.com to learn more honestly it's been one of the real sort
of game changers in my business this is an interesting question
that i just had when i was just just thinking then yeah and because because of this you know from my perspective i'd
What are the ingredients for your happiness recipe?
call that stress sometimes stress is great but there's a lot of volatility in the markets and those tough decisions
if you view happiness as like a concoction of as like a recipe and there's lots of ingredients that go and
go into making us happy um what ingredients in your happiness recipe
do you think you need more of like today personally um
oh wow i mean
so i think it's getting very personal i think you know people are get they're basically happy
with like health wealth relationships things like that if you don't have your health it's hard to really be happy you can't
really do anything you don't need to be wealthy but you need to have some level of security
where you're like i'm not worried about like being hungry tomorrow or something right and then relationships account for a lot
of happiness i think um family like romantic leave personal
friendships so um i mean it's kind of it's i'm like almost
40 and i think i'm thinking at some point i won't have kids so that's probably like that's
probably an area but otherwise i think yeah i feel quite happy about
relationships in my life um personally professionally romantically all that stuff so yeah i
didn't think you were gonna go there but yeah yeah yeah there you go no i agree i feel the same way i've had i've not had
enough balance in my life so my big next chapter is um allocating enough time to my girlfriend
and being i said it on stage today being a dad and those things and prioritizing that knowing the importance of it even
though i can't track it it's not revenue so yeah we have a closing tradition on this podcast where the last guest leaves
a question for the next guest they don't know who they're writing it for okay um their question was
Our last guest’s question
what is the belief that you hold that most people disagree with you on hmm
give you some time well i mean one kind of um contrarian view that i have that i think most people would disagree with is
that um i think a lot of regulation is well intentioned and it actually
causes more harm than good um you know
it's not really probably a commonly held view in our society because a lot of people haven't tried to build something but if you've
just only been an employee to company or you know consumed goods um when something bad happens in society
people want to say what can we do to make sure that never happens again and so you create a rule it's sort of human nature right um but
every rule has kind of these unintended consequences down the road um
you know for instance uh in the cryptocurrency industry right like we're using kind of money
transmission laws that were originated when there was like stage coaches moving cash between states and so in the united
states we need to have 50 state licenses plus multiple federal licenses and
that's just one small example you could actually go down many many many rules that are there in society
they were created for a good reason at the time but they they've now accumulated so many of them that it makes it harder to get um to get
innovation you know another good example just randomly is like in the us there's a the federal aviation
administration regulates like airplane travel and things like that they've been incredibly successful at making airplane travel safe and so the
fatality rates in air traffic and everything like that are airplane flights are very low
but there's been an enormous cost to society as well around the lack of innovation so for instance
like the boeing jets that we fly today they're very similar almost to the ones that were in like the 1960s that jfk
flew on like you can't go faster because it's they they haven't allowed like people to
break the sound barrier over over land um basically the things they're innovating on are like fuel economy and
stuff like that and so it it does stifle a lot of innovation and so
people don't think about that cost because they're more thinking about the acute short-term problem
so i think it's a real risk that in society basically enough rules accumulate over time where it creates it
throws sand in the gears of progress and um a lot of new innovation is harmed by um by
regulation unfortunately even with good intentions brian thank you thank you for your time i realize you don't do things
like this very often so it feels like even more of an honor for you to come here today and coinbase as i said i'm a customer of um it's it's always felt
like the most trusted the safest way to involve myself in crypto and that's why
i've always stayed with with coinbase and you as the ceo have a very um innovative approach to building a
company in a new time in a new industry which i've learned from as a business owner myself so thank you for the
inspiration thank you for your blog post as well i've sent many of them around to my company i think i sent two to all of my team today
around hiring and your 36 sort of principles for retaining staff and things like that so i implore people to check out your blog post as well because
your blog as well because it's a source of inspiration and knowledge and um yeah thank you so much for being here it
truly truly is an honor and the conversation has been inspiring to me so thank you brian thank you i can see why your podcast is so successful you're
really unique and amazing interviewers so um i really enjoyed the conversation that was great thank you
i had a few words to say about one of my sponsors on this podcast my girlfriend came upstairs yesterday when i was having a shower and she said to me that
she tried the heel protein shake which lives on my fridge over there and she said it's amazing low calories you get
your 20 odd grams of protein you get your 26 vitamins and minerals and it's nutritionally complete in the protein
space there's lots of things but it's hard to find something that is nice especially when consumed just with water
and that is nutritionally complete the salted caramel one if you put some ice cubes in it and you put it in a blender
and you try it is as good as pretty much any milkshake on the market just mixed with water it's been a game changer for
me because i'm trying to drop my calorie intake and i'm trying to be a little bit more healthy with my diet so this is
where heel fits in my life thank you for making a product that i actually like as you might know crafted are one of the
sponsors of this podcast and crafted are a jewelry brand and they make really meaningful pieces of jewelry and this
piece by crafted when i put it on for me it represents courage it represents ambition it represents being calm and
loving and respectful and nurturing while also being the antithesis of that seemingly the antithesis of that which
is sometimes a little bit aggressive with my goals and determined and courageous and brave the really wonderful thing
about crafty jewelry is it's super affordable it looks amazing the pieces hold tremendous meaning and they are
really well made

Transcription:

if I'm not drinking or snorting something what the [ __ ] do I actually enjoy doing you know who am I Africa
Brooke is a speaker a podcast host and she's helped hundreds of thousands of people see the world in a new light
Africa does not give a [ __ ] and that's why I love her if you're on the left then you're the good person if you're on
the right then you're the bad person we're hanging out online where these platforms incentivize binary thinking
are you with us or are you against us there's only so much you can take most
people didn't like when I said that as a black person I'm not oppressed that there is a very real difference between
being a victim and making victimhood an identity because if you don't think that
you're worthy that's always going to be the belief that you feed every single time what became your dark side
from the age of 14 I was a blackout Drinker that's when I started to see
that I was behaving in the exact same way that my dad did
sex and sexuality can you talk to me about what you've learned about those topics that might benefit me well
without further Ado I'm Stephen Bartlett and this is the diver CEO I hope nobody's listening but if you are then
please keep this to yourself Africa [Music]
Early years - my father
let's I mean if you've seen this podcast before it's no surprise where I'm going to start but um I was reading about your
story I was reading about um where you grew up and yes where you're originally born give me your earliest most relevant
context give me the context of um where you came from and and how that
context shape the person that sits here with me today oh that's good some Zimbabwean
I'm from Zimbabwe and I think uh this accent always falls people into thinking that I was born and raised here but I
was born in Zimbabwe which is in the south of Africa and I came to the UK when I was nine years old so I remember
my life back home in Zimbabwe quite clearly and vividly actually I don't
remember it being hard apart from my
experiences with my father even though he could be the most Charming Man and he was such a beautiful
man he was the kind of person that walks into a room and you can feel that Maxwell has arrived just a very
beautiful spirit but when he was drunk he could be very different completely different so I think the times that I
can remember experiencing most of my sadness or frustration as a
child was experiencing that side of my father because he could be very abusive
and he was physically abusive to my mum and to myself and my siblings but I
don't even look at those things and think that I had a horrible childhood in Zimbabwe I have so many wonderful
wonderful memories of being home and I still call it home you know when people ask me where I'm from I always say
Zimbabwe before I say the UK or that I'm British um yeah
you know when you say that you look back on Zimbabwe with fun fun memories yeah um is that because at the time when in
your household you didn't understand that behavior you didn't understand that it was bad behavior or that it was
abnormal or is it genuinely because on balance you you consider it to be a
a happy childhood yeah I think it's actually the letter I think I definitely
understood that this wasn't right although to be honest there were a lot of behaviors that my father exhibited
that were considered normal just because of the culture for example things like disciplining your wife through hitting
her etc etc or your children it was just kind of seen as normal but I definitely knew that it wasn't
right I definitely knew that there was a problem I knew that seeing a person that is that drunk was not something that
felt comfortable it wasn't remotely normal I'm able to now I think an adulthood hold multiple truths which is
something interestingly enough that I speak about a lot of my work the importance of being able to hold multiple truths because like I say about
my dad I saw him as a bad person I saw him as
an evil person even and he passed away in 2004 and I never mourned his death
because of the resentment that I was holding towards him but then when I got sober years later I had to hold multiple
truths about him to realize that he was a beautiful man I got to experience him in the very early years of my life as
being a very present father um as being a very loving father before
alcohol came into his life in the way that it did so I had to then start holding multiple truths about him
because it wasn't all bad so I think I hold those fond memories because I've had to realize that they did actually
exist Beyond everything else you said in your 10 years you started to realize that he'd been
um how bad he'd been to your your mother yeah how did you start to realize that at
that age three stories um
through speaking to my siblings about what we had all experienced in the home because we never really spoke I I don't
know what it's like in your family or when you were growing up but we never really spoke
about much especially when it came to things that were potentially hard to talk about things that it
revolved around emotions and being vulnerable things that had anything to do with intimacy or a lack of intimacy
even the most obvious things like seeing my mum being hit and not talking about
it almost just pretending that it didn't happen so I think in adulthood when I started seeing how other families were
when I started to see how open other people are I then started to see the lack in what I had experienced growing
up so I think that's when I started kind of one I wanted to know more did anyone else see what was happening did my aunts
and uncles know what was happening um why didn't anyone talk about it why
didn't anyone talk to us why so I think I had so many why type of questions which fueled a lot
of my resentment yeah some of the times you used there you said before alcohol showed up in his
life as you'll know um these things tend to We tend to attract
these things into our lives easily as you describe it as a a firmer lid to
hold some trauma I think there's some terminology used previously um in some some of your work yeah did
you ever understand the trauma that he was trying to and bottle up using alcohol
you know what that's something that is still unfolding because I think there's
only so far that other family members will go in terms of
really telling me and my siblings or anyone else that wants to know the reality of what was really going on but
I think he was also from a family where people didn't really have many conversations his
younger brother had committed suicide when he was 26 and
there were other instances of mental health and that wasn't really spoken
about as well because because culturally people just didn't talk about these things so I think there were things that
he was suppressing that I'll never ever know about so I think I've had to make
peace with the fact that I I won't be able to get all of the answers as to why and how I just have to understand what
did happen and what I experienced and forgive where I can get answers where I can and also let go of expectations
I had a guest on this podcast called Tim Grover and he he talked about his early upbringing he was he ended up being
What is your dark side?
Michael Jordan's and Kobe Bryant's trainer and he says that um our childhood experiences tend to
create our Brilliance but they also create our dark side and he referred to it as his dark side he told me about his
dark side yeah um Dark Side can sometimes mean insecurities it can mean
the the worst traits or character flaws within us but
from the experience you had what became your dark side um
oh that's a fantastic question you know what I ended up replicating pretty much
the same drinking behavior that my dad had from the age of 14 up until 24 when I
finally got sober so a decade long um I was a blackout Drinker I was a
binge Drinker very specifically I didn't know when to stop because my intention
was never to stop from the first time that I drunk it's almost as if something
magical happened I realized that I could change who I was that I didn't have to
feel insecure anymore that I didn't have to think about the areas in which I'm
Different the areas in which can lead to me being abandoned because I'm different and what I mean specifically by that is
when I came to the UK when I was nine years old I always say this and I I'll
continue saying it because it was one of the it's a something that I love her but it was quite big it was the first time
that I realized that I'm black I had never Stephen had to think about
it before ever had to think about it but we moved to Kent when in 2001 when we
first came to the country and in my school it was probably me and my sister and one other boy called Curtis we were
the only black kids in the entire school and I know you've shared your similar experiences with kind of just seeing
just how much you stand out in an environment that you have to be in and we were living in Kent for about three
years and then we moved to London but the imprint was already made the insecurity around who I was as a young
black girl when I moved to London it was completely different because now I was
seen as prissy I was seen as attractive but that was also very confusing in
itself because I still didn't quite fit in because now to most of the black
people that I was around I was white because of the the way that I spoke by
the time I was 14 and I drunk alcohol for the first time sort of silenced all of those things I
remember it was in a park with some friends and the more that I drunk the more confident
I became or so I thought um and the more that I just felt at ease
in myself and in my body and with the people around me even though I didn't
stop binge drinking or blackout drinking from that moment an imprint had been made a pattern started to develop that
every time that I drunk from that time the intention was to get [ __ ] up the intention was to experience that same
level of comfort and confidence that I felt that first time and I tried and did
replicate that same pattern over and over and over and over again
for 10 years and that's when I started to see that I was
behaving in the exact same way that my dad did so I think that's the sort of shadow
that started to form lying that became a habit of yours it did
compulsive lying what what was compulsive lying doing for you on a
psychological level what was it what was it allowing you to escape from or Escape where to was it allowing you to escape
to um it was allowing me to feel accepted
it was allowing me to sort of create my own
world because the world that I'd been in a world where
someone that was supposed to protect me and my siblings and my family
um did the complete opposite and damaged our family in a very very very big way I
remember that it did start in Zimbabwe when I would be at school and I was
quite young maybe even six probably around six or seven I would go to school and sort of tell other kids
about my dad and who he was and how amazing he was and all these things that he would he would do and parts of it
were true but most of it wasn't most of it was just me trying to create a
reality that I could live with a reality that made me feel safe a reality that made me feel comfortable a reality that
other people could sort of step into for a moment and think wow that's that's incredible so therefore it would make me
incredible in some kind of way so I think I started to get rewarded for that and then it just became habitual because
any time that I felt like I wasn't fitting in in the way that I wanted to
or that things were happening within our home that were just very uncomfortable
and I didn't again have the language for that it was it was all just feeling knowing that something is quite wrong I
would then go into a different environment and just create a story and I when you was speaking to example I
think he was talking about something similar in relation to lying where he was saying kind of embellishing the
truth if you will to kind of create a story and I resonated with that so much because I think that's exactly what it
was for me just trying to create a different world and when alcohol was a
part of that as well it was just even more explosive and I think there was something quite addictive about that
being able to create your own reality and convince other people that that
reality is actually true um so it would it was definitely a big part of my drinking something that would
come out it's so interesting because when you were describing why you lied a lot of people listen to this and think
well I can't relate because I'm not a liar yeah but the lens in which I sort of heard that through is
um pretty much everyone listening to this is lying for the same reason the words you used were to create a reality
then you said I would be rewarded for and I found it better to live in and if you think about
an Instagram filter yeah yes that's a that's a form of creating a world where
you feel more comfortable and get more rewards for even like this the selection of the the online identity that some
some of us create where we show just the very best or we try and change how we
look or whatever that is surely a form of lying to get better rewards and to to create a world where you feel more
comfortable and safer to live in yes like you you know and so lying is not just saying something which is not true
yes it's a morphing of one's identity to create a safer I guess Identity or story
yeah that the world might reward you for but in doing so you obviously abandon yourself exactly so it's like um
another word that comes to mind as we talk about is is deception right it's a form of of deception and I think it for
me it was not even just about deceiving other people it was deceiving myself so that I
could live with myself better you know if I see myself through this lens
um but yeah it's very interesting how we can hear certain words and think no that doesn't that doesn't resonate with me I
don't do that but then it just shows up very subtly in the things we do every single day but yeah lying was a was a
huge thing was a huge huge thing for me and it's something that I really had to look dead in the eye when I got sober
six years ago um yeah going back to that that period where you
What was the cost?
were drinking yeah you were engaging in certain abandonment star behaviors to try and escape from you know this
um who you were what is the cost of abandoning yourself what is the cost I know it's quite a
profound thing but yeah what was the cost for you of that continual for almost 10 years finding ways to abandon
yourself the cost was that forgot to know myself
I never got to know myself not in the ways that I really wanted to anyway I
got I got to know the version of me that I thought people wanted so I wasted a
lot of time doing that and there was also a very real mental cost because
waking up next to someone not knowing where you are not knowing if you've had
sex with that person there's a huge mental cost to that on your self-esteem
it feels a lot of Shame if he was a lot of guilt because I would be in relationships sometimes when these
things would happen not not have I cheated on my partner or was this just something innocent because my clothes
are still on so it it really really had a huge mental cost so there was a lot of
anxiety there was a lot of insecurity I would even say you know a low level
paranoia because when you wake up not knowing whether you've done something but feeling like you will need to apologize for something
um going through my phone just to have an idea of what I've done or what I didn't do who was I with how did I end
up all the way in [ __ ] sorry when I was in SoHo not too long ago
um so there was a huge mental cost but also there was a spiritual cost because just
like I said right a few moments ago not getting to know yourself
and then getting sober further down the line and feeling like you're a newborn baby I I didn't even know what I like to
do what the [ __ ] do I actually enjoy doing if I'm not drinking or smoking
something or snorting something what do I actually what do I enjoy you know who
am I as an individual without all of those things can I even be by myself
so there was a huge spiritual cost and once I realized the cost of all of those things it was around the same time that
I discovered the concept of self-sabotage right when you get in your own way and that helped me so much just
to even have that language to understand what this thing actually was why I had
been in that destructive cycle for such a long time um I want to just on that point of the
destructive cycle because when you were explaining waking up you know um the next day somewhere you don't know you
don't know what you've done the night before yeah and that giving you guilt to hurting your self-worth it's yeah it was
my brain was going well this was meant to be the the medicine for a lack of self-worth yes and it ends up taking
even more of your self-where so it's this kind of race to the bottom of your self-esteem by thinking that the
medication is this kind of destructive abandonment behavior and it's and that's weirdly self-reinforcing so you do it to
try and Escape but it harms you so much that you need that maybe that sort of
surface level attention the alcohol even more so that leads you in the same place and that vicious cycle to the bottom of
your self-esteem right and trying to pick yourself up out of that is one hell of a task oh yeah it's probably
one of the most grueling things I've done which is why I actually I'm actually very grateful for all of those
times that I did Relapse because I think I was reminded every single time just
how much I wanted to break this [ __ ] cycle and how much I had to because it's
so anything that is familiar anything that is familiar feels safe in
some way even though objectively it might look like how is this person not
changing their life clearly they're losing everyone around them and I'm talking about myself losing everyone
around them can't even stay in any job for longer than a month unable to commit
to anything incredibly unreliable how can they not see that something
needs to change but the thing is when you are in that cycle of self-destruction self-sabotage if it
feels familiar it's kind of all you know that when I would have those bursts of sobriety where I'd be sober for three
months and six months and I didn't have any chaos I didn't have any drama I was
reliable I people were saying that they're proud of me you know I could see that I was doing well it made me
uncomfortable it made me uncomfortable because it didn't feel familiar and there was
always this thing in the back of my mind that would sort of say you're gonna [ __ ] up anyway so might as well just
might as well just do it now you know and that's when the justifications would come things like I haven't had a drink
in six months so maybe if I just have one it's it's going to be different you
know or I would say things like um I have a problem with alcohol but
cocaine is not the problem so maybe I can still have a line every now and again and then you know and then I can
still be with my friends and so all of these justifications but when I really looked at it I was uncomfortable with my
life actually being drama free chaos free and being reliable being able to be there for the people that I that I love
um because I was just so comfortable in that destruction and I chose that every
single time until until I didn't until I couldn't if someone's listening to this
How to break out of a negative reinforcing cycle?
um and they're in one of those sort of downward um negatively reinforcing self-esteem
Cycles yeah where you're carrying out a behavior because it because you have low self-esteem but then that behavior is
actually resulting in a lowering of your self-esteem it can be a toxic relationship where you're staying because they took your self-esteem so
you think that they're the only ones that can give it back but they're hurting you even more yeah I see that a lot in my DMs right it can be other what
advice would you give to someone to try and break out of that um that negatively reinforcing
self-esteem cycle um I think one of the things I think questions are always the
best place to start I always like to think of self-sabotage and self-destruction as self-protection
you're actually protecting yourself from something and a lot of it is unconscious you're not consciously deciding to get
in your own way you're not consciously deciding to stay in chaos and drama because you just absolutely love it
maybe for some people that might be the case but for most of us it's entirely unconscious but I think
getting clear on what the benefits are because you're getting some kind of reward from it right because if you
don't think that you're worthy if you don't think that you're lovable that's
always going to be the belief that you feed every single time it's some kind of confirmation it's like a c i I see I
said that I wasn't unlovable that's why I choose someone who shouts at me that's why I choose someone who manipulates me
that's why I choose someone who cheats on me over and over again that's why I choose someone who shames me or whatever
the details might be so I think there's always some kind of reward that we're getting from that situation and I think
it can be a very sounds quite abstract but I think it can be an important question to ask yourself what am I what
reward am I actually getting from this and is this going to be worth it in the long term and all of this to me kind of sounds
like shifting your identity and what you're used to and allowing yourself to get used to things that might not be
familiar yet I think you also have to understand that when you're breaking some kind of cycle it's going to be
uncomfortable that's why I'm a huge advocate for discomfort because I think a lot of us when we change a pattern the
moment we feel uncomfortable even though it's good for us the moment we feel uncomfortable we'll pull the plug and we
often pull the plugs so prematurely so I think one of the things that I would suggest and I say this to my clients and
anyone that I speak to allow yourself to be in that discomfort because a lot of
the time it's where you currently are with your identity and the identity that you're trying to step into someone who
is more lovable for example but that middle part is going to be quite uncomfortable and you just have to stay
there while things sort of reconfigure is that like because you're contending against two counters or counters yes yes
and it takes time to believe a new story so you're gonna have to sit in maybe a feeling of him
feeling like a bit of an imposter or you know what I mean it's almost like this evidence but right at the end of the day all these stories are backed by either
true or false but it's subjective evidence yeah that's who you are and what the world thinks of me and what I'm capable of so that's it writing new
evidence is not an easy or a quick no no and it's not supposed to be because I think
um I think we also have this idea that it's supposed to be easy you know that kind of once you make a decision and you
What do you still self sabotage
decide that you're going to do it that it should just work and if it doesn't if it's uncomfortable that means it's wrong
that means you should pull the plug that's not that's not always the case what she what do you still
self-sabotage with or how do you still sabotage you know what it is for me romantic
relationships and it always helps me when I'm very honest about the fact that this is an
area where I still have self-sabotaging Tendencies so what that looks like is
feeling when someone is trying to get close to me
I will immediately start to feel suffocated I'll start to feel like I need to find
something wrong with you so that you don't get too close even if I want you to get close but it's because there's a
a part of me doesn't want to be vulnerable because vulnerability in that area means being exposed it means being
raw exposed to what exposed vulnerable
you know what I think it is I think it's a to put it very simply I think it's it's a feeling of if you really get to
know me you might abandon me and I think this is not something that's even you
know on a conscious level because I have a strong sense of self I know who I am
etc etc but I think there is still those sort of traces from childhood from everything that I've
experienced in my life that those remnants of that that have that voice that say if I really let you in and you
actually get to know me you might abandon me so what I need to do I need to find a way to get in there first and
abandon you before you abandon me so that might look like as I said once
the person is starting to kind of get close I will feel suffocated I'll feel like okay it's getting too much I need
my own space what's what's wrong with you danger yeah huh danger
um where did you learn that model that a romantic relationship might be danger oh gosh I mean take a guess take a guess
the the first relationship that I ever saw a man
and woman a couple being together was my mother and my father and that's the
model in which I had to kind of build my own idea of romantic love and what relationships look like so I've never
wanted to get too close and I could never have said this to you before I
didn't have language for it but when I looked at the patterns from relationship to relationship I always thought that
they had a timeline as well never going anywhere beyond the one year mark always
feeling like okay that's enough we've done our time let's let's uh release yeah yes so I think um romantic
relationships is one and I also had one in terms of money and this one I really
had to nip it in the bud when I started my consulting firm five years ago
I used to sabotage any opportunity to potentially make more money than my mum so my mum is a nurse
so when I started sharing my sobriety story and I started realizing that I'm
actually very good at what I do in terms of speaking in terms of supporting people I'm a very curious person and I
do have a powerful story a powerful story that allows me to reach so many different types of people so it gained a
lot of traction quite early on in 2016 2017. so I would start getting speaking
opportunities in the beginning everything was sort of free and I was okay with that never had to negotiate things around money money was not
something that was spoken about in my family growing up I don't know what it was like for you but the only time that
money conversations were really had um was through arguments you would only hear Money spoken about where there
wasn't enough money etc etc etc so I always had so many
different money stories money is very hard to come by money doesn't grow on trees you have to work hard for money
um so many ideas about rich people rich people are bad rich people are this and no one in my family explicitly said that
but I think culturally it was sort of just a thing people don't have to explicitly say it culturally we all know
what the stories are so when I would hear or get emails saying Africa we'd
love for you to speak at this thing it's just half an hour what is your rate we're offering 3K
um I would just experience so much discomfort knowing that my mum is working
so many hours as a nurse on her feet and she's probably making half of that or
just about that so what I would do and this was not a conscious thing until I started looking
at my money story I would let those emails sit any email that was saying I
would be getting paid I would let those emails sit until it was too late they've probably offered
someone else because I just felt so uncomfortable making money so easily so
I would sabotage any opportunity to get paid but if it was free I will reply
straight away I'll do it but when you're in business that doesn't [ __ ] work
it doesn't work but even outside of that I I was shown that because I was incapable of receiving when it came to
money I was incapable of receiving in so many areas I was incapable of receiving
love fully because when I did I would shut down because a part of me thinks I don't deserve it I was then capable of
receiving opportunities because I'd feel like this has happened way too easily I'm supposed to it's supposed to be hard
but this is so easy so I would be suspicious of it and sabotage it so those are the two main areas that I've
really had to do some work on over the past years on the first point
um you were very much preaching to the choir there as I've talked about quite a few times on this podcast why do I see
relationships as like a bird trapped in a cage or someone trapped in jail well okay well that's what my father was my
father was trapped my father my whole life I I was convinced he was trapped that was my first model of what a
romantic relationship was so of course it was the most um most evidence-backed yeah and so
you've got a it's similar to what we were talking about earlier about like stepping into a new story yes and although every part of your being is
going this is bad you've got to stay you do communicate with in this case the
person say by the way this this happens so yes I struggle yes um and hopefully build new evidence and
the right person can help you build new evidence I agree which is what my girlfriend helped me to do she helped me
to build without by just being herself and not being a prison guard she created new evidence and that new
evidence is strong it's not the old evidence is still there I don't actually
think the old evidence will ever go oh I love that you say that Stephen I really do because I think it's again this idea
that it has to go completely before we step into the other one and I think that's what holds people back from fully
stepping into their new identity because they think if I'm really supposed to be here and
this is actually real and I have all of this new evidence that's not supposed to be there at all and I think again
there's multiple truths they can coexist it's just what you choose to feed over and over again
yeah and you you know if you think of spiders like I'm not scared of spiders but there's a part of me that goes
there's a lot of evidence because I've seen other people running away from them I've seen films yes but I'm not I know
like objective but I've got enough evidence to say that despite they don't even bite yeah you know no one's dying of spiders really but I'm still there's
still a little bit of evidence be careful you know and I can exist with those two truths as you as you described
it you're totally right though in the sense that people expect them that they
will get to a place where they are healed and cured completely and I I just have never seen it me
neither me neither never seen it ever and I think we have a current culture actually so I'm um
I'm a coach and consultant and speaker Etc who's in the realm of self-help
but despises the self-help industry for a multitude
of reasons because I think it perpetuates that idea that idea of healing as if it's a destination yeah
you know you sign up for this course get this book listen to this podcast and
then it's it's done then you're healed so I think there's a lot of people that are in a very good place if you were to
look at it in a very holistic way but continuously believe that they have to rid themselves of these very human
things and this you know inevitable human discomfort that we all experience and they put labels on it to make it you
know mean like it's this um so yeah I think there's a cult there is a culture right now where people are
on this continuous journey of healing when actually some of these things won't actually go away completely and that's fine
that's normal it's an interesting thing because there are some people out there as well I want to get your take on this sure I've basically made healing their
identity uh-huh it's their personal brand it's their space being broken and healing is there it's who they are and
they've embraced that is that harmful and dangerous in your view absolutely I think it is I think it is because it's
it again perpetuates another idea which ties into this that we need to be on this pursuit of
constantly fixing something you know um and I think I've also seen people do
that in the as you say it as a brand but people making it yeah making it the actual business their public Persona
this is who I am and I think it encourages other people or makes other people feel that they need to do the
same thing or that they need to sort of make their pain their identity as well
you also see this with people um who uh contrarian just for the sake
of being contrarian right I think that's why you yeah they just have to disagree they just have to disagree with you and
they usually that's why when I talk about um you know this kind of seemingly a battle between the work
versus anti-work I always see that essentially they're quite the same they're exactly the same you will
have the people that are for example anti-work want to be contrarian for the sake of it you know screaming about how
woke everyone has got if people are let's say talking about being inclusive they'll just label that as work it's the
exact same behavior as they claim to oppose which I find very interesting how people can be so
loud about something and be so convicted and be wanting to point out a specific
type of behavior not realizing that they're behaving in the exact same way
but I think it is part of that performance where people are being rewarded because they're performing in a very specific way and they see that okay
if I perform in this way I'm going to get likes I'm going to get opportunities I get to to sort of feel it really feeds
the ego as well when you have your Echo chamber and you have people that say yes to everything you have people that see
you as some sort of um leader but I think it's building some very interesting characters online especially
I wonder if both extremes so the far left and the far right I wonder if they're just both low self-esteem yes
Left vs Right
yes because they're the ones that seem to need the the reinforcements yes I will be militant about these views
because by being further over here I'm getting more people that are clapping yes you know whereas Nuance seems to be
a place where you don't care much as as much about the Clapping yeah you're not really doing it for the clap you're doing it for in my view more for truth
yes yes I I see that a lot and have you found
um would you say I think from listening to everything you've said I I kind of have
an idea of what this would look like for you but would you say that you're more in that Nuance would you say you've
always been more in the middle or have you ever found yourself on either I used to think I was ever on the left yeah now
if I think I'm somewhere in the middle yeah so um I can't what you described earlier is like an intolerance of ideas
it's you know and both but both extreme side so the far left the far right are both
just really intolerant yeah and I and they're not willing to have a conversation with anybody so I find
myself being pushed more towards this center point where I find people like me people like you yeah I think I don't
know where you consider yourself yeah the exact same you know what I don't think I've ever
um even used language like I'm on the left
or anything like that and maybe there's something about being an immigrant because when I speak to immigrants and
people that are not from this country I think we have a different relationship with politics in general you will never
really hear most people um saying that on the left or they're on the right I think it won't really happen
most people are the majority of people really are in that Center in that middle ground I would say if you were to look
at my values and what I stand for objectively yes I'm a left-leaning person but I don't make that my identity
I don't look at everything on that side and say okay check check I agree with
that everything is context dependent and there are many things that I agree with from different sides because I just look
at what is the context what are we talking about does this make sense to me is this applicable in real life
um so that's the sort of process that I take myself through and it's neither left or right it's very
much in the middle like everyone like the majority of people yeah I think the majority of people
probably are but but it I think especially in this day and age it takes it's much probably easier because you
get to fit in if you're on either side yes there's no Club in the middle yeah there's no you know what I mean there's
no uniform yeah in the middle so you don't you don't those that might want to fit in and be reinforced by um a group
aren't going to find that in the middle ground yeah pick a side do you actually see what I mean it's like yeah it's a
club they have you know a uniform they have stickers they have like a schedule they have a doctor in they have Ten
Commandments yeah this is why people join Cults isn't it it's true and you know what um speaking of Cults when I
wrote when I wrote my open letter um why I'm leaving the cult of weakness
I was really trying to have this conversation because essentially I I was
speaking about what we're talking about now an invitation into that middle ground where most people are inviting
people to acknowledge nuance and context to really realize that black people for example we don't all think the same we
have very different experiences and we have very different opinions we have
very different beliefs World Views most people
um that identify as being on the left would not have that conversation with me it's only just starting to happen now
the only people that would be willing to have those conversations with me would be people that would be seen as being on
the right and I found that very interesting that you know when you look at being a leftist it is about being
tolerant it is about um well I guess that would be what would what would that be would it be classic
liberalism if you were to I guess so right um but even that approach is seen as
right wing now so I understand why a lot of people really are getting pushed out
of the left and more into the center because most people would not have that conversation with me because the moment
you critique something from the left you're labeled as being on the right which is just the most absurd thing I
have ever heard um but I think now two years on
things are starting to shift a little bit more I think people have stopped being so fearful of what is known as
cancer culture even though I prefer to call it Collective sabotage because I think that's a much more accurate term
for it I think people are being less afraid now to ask questions to be like actually let's let's hear what this view
actually is we don't have to agree with it but we can at least acknowledge that it exists but I think people that are on
the right from my own experience especially if we're talking about media Etc have been more willing to have these
conversations and to have more debates and to honor that gray more than the
left I've you know I've probably had thousands of tweets from people telling me that I cannot speak to that person on
my podcast right thousands of tweets and I promise you I've never had those tweets from someone
on the right yeah no matter which guest I get on and what they believe no one from the right has said Steve you cannot
platform that person right it's never happened so and that that again you're not help you're you're
basically going to punish me if I don't um say think and have conversations that
are in line with your Doctrine yeah and for me that for me has been alienating and this is why I now consider myself to
be more in the middle because I don't agree with that intolerance I think I should be able to have a conversation with anyone including Donald Trump right
I I hope I never get to the point where I would not be willing to have a conversation conversation you know what I mean yeah that's a that's a that
reminds me of like the I don't know 18th century I know nothing about history so I just named an old Century reminds me
of the 18th century when they used to like burn books because they even want people to hear stuff yes and yes anyway
Accountability
speaking of controversial topics one of the things that's become surprisingly controversial over the last couple of
years is and probably for a little while longer um since the 17th century
um is this idea of accountability which to me seems like much of the antidote to self-sabotage is like taking personal
responsibility for your life and your situation I've heard you talk about this I actually think this was the first the first one of your first videos that
caught my attention was you talking about taking responsibility in a really you know a fairly direct way so tell me
how taking responsibility what that means to you but how that helped you to rise out of that phase you had from 14
to 24. yeah oh it was huge it was huge and it had to be one of the first things
that I did actually as I as I think about this and sort of speak out loud
I think what allowed me to get and stay sober that eighth and final time was
taking personal responsibility I think all of the other times I had wanted to place blame on a lot of things outside
of me so my dad would have been the easiest person because he was an alcoholic and because of his abuse and
because of everything we experienced and because of the instability because of coming to a new country moving to a part
of the UK where just me my sister and Curtis are the only black kids the
adversity I experienced from that so I think there were so many ways that I could externalize right but I think the
moment that I was able to say okay well Africa what part did you have to play in this so you've experienced all of this
adversity what now what [ __ ] now no one else can do it for you and I
think that helped me so much and another thing that I had to do which is a part
of that responsibility and accountability was making amends so people that have followed the 12-step
program for example will know that making amends is a huge part of it I didn't follow the toaster program I
what's the 12-step program so 12-step is AA essentially Alcoholics Anonymous you
go through a process a 12-step process of accountability essentially and one of
those steps is making amends reaching out to the people that you've harmed and
making amends and that's what I had to do and I I really did that and there was
a lot of Shame there was a lot of guilt there were a lot of people that didn't want to hear it but there were a lot of
people that were very grateful that even after all of these years I'm coming to them and acknowledging something that I
did or played a part in and only then could I actually move forward with my
sobriety knowing that I am responsible yes I've experienced a lot of adversity
but I am the one that gets to decide what now so fast forward to finding
ourselves in a culture where even just conversations around personal responsibility are have been politicized
because I've noticed they're labeled as right wing the moment isn't that weird it's mad
isn't that crazy the moment you say you do realize there is a lot in your
life that you can control you're called a bigot [Applause]
I'm a puppet and I'm a victim there's nothing I can control it's and it's that
political party that did this yeah okay so yes and that yeah
it's [ __ ] crazy it's mad and I think I've I speak to my family and my friends
about all of these things quite a lot actually and because I'm still very much in touch with everyone back home in
Zimbabwe and because I have that perspective when I compare to that part of the world
to the Western World it this just seems like a completely different world like
some kind of show it can't be real that people can get upset to know that there
are things in your life that you can control yes you might have experienced X Y and Z but you are responsible for how
you move forward yes there might be other components maybe it is the system maybe it is your familial environment
whatever the details might be but there are also things within your control the
fact that people can label that as being bigoted the moment you say I I
just wouldn't you want that to be the case wouldn't you want to have things that you can control the thought of
being powerless yeah to my circumstances is the most terrifying thing in the world you know being being a being a big
that's why I refer to it as a puppet that someone else is pulling these strings right and I have no I'm powerless to my situation so I think
it's I find it empowering and liberating to say do you know there is a lot of things I can control yes I'm I'm broke
yes I'm in this situation but there are there's something that I can do yeah and I have to also Express the Nuance that
you did which is there are a lot of people that are um that are disabled there are a lot of people that have found themselves in terrifically
unfortunate circumstances through no fault of their own yes but I find it really important for my sanity of mind
and my optimism for the future to know that there is something often there is something that I can do to change my situation absolutely that's
a controversial idea imagine that would you have I couldn't believe the people typing out at you
Rich [ __ ] with his cards what what what is it though do you do you
think you know what that is yeah because it holds a mirror up to you it makes you feel like for some people and I think it
was for me at some point as well holding that mirror up and saying you know what I might have had part to play in this
and I'm actually I I can have a part in getting out of the situation for some
people is it evidence of their inadequacy that they just don't have the self-esteem to confront so it's easier
to blame blame is a nice a nice Shield it's a nice way to deflect the attack against my already fragile self-esteem I
would do that of course when I was younger and someone might point at something blame was a way for you not to
hit me in the self-esteem it was a way of saying no no no no that's not because I'm inadequate or because I'm not
capable or I'm not smart or because I'm not working hard it's because of this other thing and so leave me alone Africa
blocks yes it's like do you know what I mean that's that's my analysis a bit often is it's for some people it's it's
look it's a it feels like evidence of their inadequacy yes and why what would
someone not like that well because it makes you feel like [ __ ] yeah and I I
think because we're also being encouraged I've especially the youngest generation who I
really now more than ever want to make more of an effort to really speak directly to
them is because I think we're we're sort of training each other to not prioritize
emotional resilience because along with personal responsibility resilience is also another controversial word you know
this this idea that you can build a strong Foundation within yourself that
even if something happens externally outside of you you are able to deal with it you don't have to go into that deep
dark place and think that is that full stop so I think because most people
are not emotionally resilient and are not nurturing and sort of cultivating
that within themselves it continues that cycle where you just end up in perpetual victimhood and then we are in a culture
that rewards victims you know and I I think self-correction there actually and
I want to make this very clear that there is a very real difference between being a victim someone who has genuinely
been victimized and making victimhood an identity there's a there's a huge
difference between the two but I think when you start to make victimhood an identity for anything and everything
that's when it might be time to actually hold a mirror up to yourself on that word resilience yeah I think the reason
why resilience is in part at least why it's a controversial topic is because it
kind of starts to merge into the lane of like mental health and resilient people
when they think of resilience they think of like shut up and deal with it yeah you know what I mean yeah and then that that acts as in Conflict to them
Narrative of like express yourself feel your emotions yeah it's okay to be not
okay yeah so talk to me about the distinction you make between those two things and your relationship with both
you know what I guess this is where I would bring it back around to holding those multiple truths because
why do we think that we have to choose between one or the other why can't you be both emotionally resilient as an
individual as a being and allow yourself to express yourself and allow yourself to be vulnerable and allow yourself to
have those real low moments that we all do and I think both can co-exist it's really not one or the other so what is
the opposite of resilience then hmm the word weakness comes to mind but I
don't know if that's accurate I don't know if that's accurate to what
I'm not sure but it's interesting because the word weakness comes to mind and maybe a part
of me or even for someone listening we
we think associating the word weak to yourself means there's something
wrong with you that it's a bad word I think there's this idea that it's it's bad to be weak or it's not acceptable to
be weak but I think we all have moments of weakness but I don't know if that would be the opposite of
of resilience what do you think um so if we're talking about emotional
resilience maybe the opposite is emotional maybe fragility yeah maybe I don't know
um it's something within that realm right yeah and the reason I I'm basically Playing devil's advocate was
myself to see if to see if it is two truths because or if what we were describing earlier about
being expressive and being in touch with your emotions is that being emotionally fragile or is that something else I
wonder if another word that's coming to mind if some reason soft I think it's both possible to be soft
and whatever you would consider hard because just in very simple language when I hear the word resilience you have
to be hard there's something sort of it's not necessarily stoic but but it's it's sort
of that kind of language where you're really fully grounded in yourself your back is straight you're internally up
you know whereas the other side of that is maybe maybe there is an element of fragility which is fine I don't I don't
think it's a bad thing allowing yourself to be soft allowing yourself to be
um to not be as strong all of the time so I I think it's interesting thing because on one hand you're saying be
resilient but then also be the opposite of resilience yes yeah
yeah it can be context-specific Behavior so you can be resilient in the sense that when someone
um pelts abuse at you and your Instagram DMS you have the resilience to not
internalize that not let it um destroy your day or your mood and to move on but then you can be I guess
emotionally you know then your dog might die I've got a lovely dog running around somewhere here yeah and my dog might die and that is real cause for emotional
expression and to be emotionally to be soft and to be um open and to feel yes so maybe it's
context specific yeah I think so I think so but again I I think they can both
coexist how did you get to this place of self-awareness because
Selfawareness
you know um I I you know we all know people who are repeating cycles and they have no
either they're taking their responsibility for it or they just don't know that they're doing it yeah and sometimes as friends and this is again
this is us looking in on this situation as if we know what's best for them so there's an error there but we look we
see friends family going through cycles and they don't know what they're doing and they don't they don't understand
themselves enough to the point where you are today where you clearly um you exhibit High self-awareness and
understanding of yourself your past your behavior and the causes of it um one of my favorite quotes that I've
ever written which is based on based on a friend I had was um you can read as many books as you like but if you can't read yourself you'll never truly learn a
thing but you can also say you can read as many books as you like but if you can't read yourself you'll never make progress yes because you can have the
information but implementing it requires understanding the being in which yeah
you're implementing that too so how did you become so apparently self-aware
you know what I think I've always loved to read I've always loved to read and to to hear other
people's stories and to hear other people's thoughts so one of the first people that I discovered
um the eighth time that I got sober was Carl Jung so he's a incredible psychotherapist who
explores Shadow work and you know our Shadow Self Etc and I think through his work and then finding many other
teachers many other mentors along the way um just through books mainly books and
self-study I was able to finally have language for the things that I was experiencing internally so I think it
helped that I did have that Foundation off already being quite a self-aware person but now having language for my
behavior and I think just through different practices even reading something about why you know
lying to yourself is a form of self-betrayal it meant that every time that I was in a situation and I could
feel myself about to lie I would kind of challenge myself to not and to just say
something different or to just say what I actually mean so I think it's been a combination of self-study
um reading tuning into the self-awareness I already had but using it in just a different way and actually
stepping into the arena and practicing so I think that that has helped me kind of developed my sense of self over time
what about writing and writing writing has always helped but you know what's
interesting I found especially in those 10 years I would write in my journal as if
someone was going to read it so I would lie what were you lying about in your diary
oh that's a good question I was lying about how I really felt about my relationship
so I was writing as if my boyfriend at the time would read it
um so I wasn't being completely honest about how unhappy I was
I wasn't being honest about cheating in our relationship when I was
drunk um I wasn't being honest about my relationship with alcohol
I wasn't being honest about how I really felt about one particular family member
who I really wanted to heal things with um but it felt weird because
we we didn't speak about emotional things in my family so there was a lot of resistance around medding mending
that relationship even though I knew exactly what I needed to do um why do you speak about in past tense
which part by that family member mending it you speak of it as if it's past tense what exactly did I say just um you're
referring to it as if you haven't mended it I haven't right I haven't and I wrote that entry
it's in the journal that I found the other day thank you for pointing that out um I haven't it's been seven years since I
wrote that so maybe now it's bothering you can see it in your face really yeah
it does it does she was on that list of amends
that I had to make back in 2016. and I made amends with everyone on that list
apart from her and I see her quite often and there'll be times where I feel like I want to say something because there's
not even anything specific that happened it's just the way that I was behaving at
the time that I was in the height of my of my destruction and
she had just moved from Zimbabwe to here and I was always her favorite cousin and
we were so close and she was so excited to see me and to see me after all of
these years and when she came she didn't meet the me that she remembered
and I noticed that very early on and now we're much older seven years
later I can still see that there's a part of her that feels
hot in some way and I know that there's something that I can do and say to sort of break that
but I just there's a lot of resistance around it because in my family
they're just certain conversations we don't have but I've been starting to have those conversations with some family members but she's just the one
person that I haven't done it with yet why
I think there's almost a fear of the unknown of what our relationship will look like
Beyond this and I know we can sound mad because someone listening to this might think just have the conversation I'm a
huge advocate for conversations that are uncomfortable but when it comes to this for whatever
reason there's a fear of the unknown even though I know that the unknown is going
to be potentially a stronger relationship so you could say there's always a
an element of self-sabotage when it comes to this but it's a fear of some kind of unknown around that
any advice well I I mean I struggle with the same thing so let's not pretend that
I'm perfect in this Arena but what's some of the advice that sometimes helps reframe the decision is you know taking
myself to the to my deathbed and thinking about the decisions I would if this was if I was laying there and this
was the last moments of my life would I what decision would I wish I would have made on this particular situation yeah
that's quite clarifying and it also it also cuts out this kind of unconscious
feeling that I think we all have that there'll always be time to do it yes we can always do it next year yeah but we
don't live forever unfortunately right we live under the illusion that we do that's why there's a sand timer on there it's just a nice reminder to me that I'm
actually not infinite I'm finally and so that gives me a little bit of urgency to
make um to live in a less Petty Way in a more a way that's more aligned with like my inner truth and my own values so yeah
what would your you know if this were if you would touch wood diagnosed with something today and you you said you
know what I'm gonna get my home in order um would you have that conversation I would
absolutely have that conversation and you know what I'm grateful very grateful that you and I have just had this
exchange because when I found that journal a few days ago and I saw that entry saying I need to speak to her
I wrote I'm going to do this this week and I finished the entry with
if I don't do this I'll never know what our relationship can be I'm going to do
this this week and it was seven years ago I'm gonna [ __ ] do it this week
you're gonna get a message from me saying she no longer talks to me she's blocked me on Instagram
that's what the unknown was about wow my goodness and you know again what
you've just done is hold a mirror up to side because I can feel a sort of tightness in my chest
but I also feel kind of like a relief in my shoulders at the same time so it
feels quite conflicting but it makes sense um because you've just held a mirror up to
me because in every other area of my life whether it's business or life or writing I'm very sure I can have any
type of conversation I'm very assured and confident and know exactly what I
need to do but it's amazing how in certain areas there's still that sort of childlike or I can't I can't do this
it's too much that's too big that's why having someone even in a brief exchange that can hold a mirror up
to that part of you and just ask just one question without asserting or trying
to put forward a specific thing you should do
um just a question that can kind of make you think oh I hadn't actually thought about that
I mean I've got those things in my life too so like of course I have I've got conversations that I just we all we put
off for various reasons and yeah I think one of the things as well that I that I often ask myself is like if you get too
tied up in the outcome and it all come becomes outcome dependent what are they going to say how's it going to be you
probably never make the decision but if it becomes based on like why do I need to do this for myself yeah
irrespective of outcome you know what I mean then you start living more in your truth yeah and the second point I was
going to say is that tightness in your chest it's an interesting thing because whenever we find ourselves in those
situations where something is making us uncomfortable or you know you described as a tightness in the chest yeah the
tightness in the chest is not gonna um doesn't leave us because we ignore it it just it it's like this little
Insidious Force inside of us that will lead us up in little ways and we think often as I have in my past that if I
just suppress or compartmentalize that right it will that's the best way to deal with it I think the way that we
release whatever that tightness and the tightness in the chest is such a good indicator it means we've got work to do
right right because think about that analogy like that conversation didn't put the tightness in your chest the
tightness was already there yeah the tension was already there yes you just it just came to the surface yes
so the way to never have the tightness again is to release the the thing the thing the young
addressed yeah one of the things I've heard you talk about a lot is your your journey and
A journey with sex and sexuality
your evolving relationship with sex and sexuality and how that changed from when
you were very young through the period when you were drinking a lot um till today can you talk to me about
that Evolution and what you've learned about those topics that might benefit me yes absolutely
so I'm going to
sort of keep referring to my sobriety in that period of my life because it was so
transformative and it revealed so much to me so much
that I could have never imagined at the time so something that also happened when I got sober I think this was about
a year into my sobriety I realized just how much sexual shame I
was holding so much of it and I initially sort of wanted to fix it
wanted to do something about it what are some surface level things that I can do what can I read what can I sort of dive
into how can I deal with it from where I am now as a 25 year old but I quickly
realized that I actually had to trace it back to see where it even comes from and I realized just like so many things it
did come from my childhood being raised in a Christian home I learn again not directly more so
indirectly that being a sexual being was not something that was of God it was not
something that was supposed to be a part of who I am pleasure was never discussed sex was never discussed even
Intimacy in general I never saw my parents hold hands I never saw my parents hold hands I never saw them kiss
I never saw them hug I never saw any sort of affection but I knew that they
loved each other I knew that they cared about each other but affection and intimacy I just never saw that Not For a
Moment did you see that growing up um
it's a really interesting one because I'd say I'd say yes and no so I say yes
because below the age of maybe eight maybe I could've got memories of that and then above the age of 10
um no and I call my parents by their first names okay I really struggled with with intimacy because of the exact same
reasons right even the word best friend made me cringe until the age still kind of makes me cringe now
like when people would say it or call me their best friend this is part of me like Steven meets like it's just a bit
even boyfriend would make me like ah prison me too that's why when I found the word
partner I was like okay yeah stand next to each other we don't
oh my goodness so when I sort of wanted to really understand where a lot of the
sexual shame was stemming from or just more so even outside of sex intimacy
intimacy feeling very disconnected to other people when it came to intimacy but also from myself
I realized that I could only be expressive as a sexual being if I was
drunk or if I was high if I was in that place where of course my inhibitions are low but I had no insecurities I didn't
have to feel like I'm doing something wrong I didn't have to feel like my pleasure was wrong but then when I got
sober all of those things came to the surface and then I I had to look that in the eye so that also became something
that I started sharing over time as well as sort of sharing my journey with sobriety I then started sharing the
things that were revealed as a byproduct of me getting sober and sexual shame was
a huge one was a big part of that my relationship with sex has evolved a lot yeah over over time I think it was early
in my early years influenced by porn yes for many people so me too that's the way I went into the game in trying to be
those those male porn stars right and I think over time and I think there's this wider issue in our society
specifically I've got to be honest with men yes um what they think that what they think sex
is in terms of this kind of very aggressive often dominating
transactional um encounter yeah and then there's you
know again I'm just I'm just talking freely I don't give a [ __ ] whatever please do please but I'm seeing a lot in
my in my close friends they're all in relate they're often in relationships not all of them where they're having
problems with their sexual relationship with their partner they're basically saying things
to me and I'd say this is crazy I'd say 75 to 80 of my male friends are saying my partner doesn't want to have sex she
doesn't like having sex yeah and I was there at one point too my partner said that to me at 1.2 yeah and I took it on
face value I thought they don't like sex what I came to learn
is that wasn't true but that what what I'd learned to be sex and what I was bringing as sex this kind of aggressive
you know whatever was not yes the language that they spoke
right and I feel like I'm surrounded by men that need to start seeing sex as a
language because then you can ask yourself well actually she's speaking Spanish and I'm speaking English that's why it's not she doesn't like English
she just doesn't she speaks a different language yeah I mean yes that's a lot I'm just dumping that on YouTube no that
resonates so and I'm I'm really glad that you said this because I think you're speaking something that is on so
many people's minds or something that they've just never really put language to and a big part of my
Awakening if you will and really addressing that sexual shame is because I also learned sex from porn at 10 years
old 10 years old so by the time that I had sex for the first time when I was 14 it was very much like a porn performance
to put it very simply and I speak to so many people men and women about this very specific thing a lot of us learn
that we should perform that sex should be driven by orgasm and ejaculation and
this sort of production if you will which is not actually accurate for most
people when it comes to what really actually feels pleasurable especially for women so I started to realize when I
got sober that every time that I was having sex for example I faked every single orgasm it was all a perform I
didn't know much about my body because I'd learned from porn and because the men that I was with had also learned
from porn we were just in a performance and no one's actually talking about it right so in time times when I was in
relationships and I made myself think I don't want to have sex I don't want to have sex anymore it actually was not
that I didn't want to have this type of pornified sex that's what I actually
meant so what you just said is really important and I realized that's when I found tantric sex actually yeah that's
when I found tantric sex around 2018 because I realized that I had always
felt like sex was being done to me yes that I was not a part of it and that is
how most women feel I I felt like I needed to apologize yeah because that's what that's what I
came to learn yeah was that the the reason why the person I was with had
turned around to me and said I don't like having sex is and when we got talking about it after I acted like I
mean let me be clear the first time she said that I did not understand my little Neanderthal monkey brain went uh like I
was emasculated by it yeah it made me feel what is this something that I was I didn't know of course ended up breaking
up but this person got back with this person a year later when I was maybe a bit more mature I apologized and I said I want to have a
conversation and I also said to her that I'm going to be here regardless of whether we have sex or not yes and then
she could she had a safe enough space to start talking to me about it and what I discovered is she'd been with
should I add three previous boyfriends over the course of seven years her view of sex was this person comes
and takes from you treats you like this object and he was with him for five years treats you like an object takes
what they want from you and then he was actually going and cheating on her as well right so Not only was he taking he
was then like hurting her and that cycle just repeated her relationship with what sex is was really really toxic she
didn't like that yes she didn't want that anymore yes and that's what she and me probably referred to as this word sex
so it was kind of like learning a new language of sex and what it actually is she went from the place of like I don't
have sex anymore to absolutely loving to have sex yeah I didn't think it was possible I thought
if they don't like sex dump them yes you know I'm gonna go find someone else right that will let me take yes and you
know what you you've articulated that so beautifully in terms of sex being a language and it's going to
look different for every single person because something that I realized is that I could tell when I was with a man
sexually I could tell if they were sort of if it was like a script almost like a
play-by-play like this is exactly the method we do this we do that switch into this switch into that it wasn't sort of
flowing and very intuitive as to what's actually needed in that moment which reminded me of porn and I would also
realize actually and this is something that I've spoken about so much because I ended up um starting a sexual wellness
company called Cherry Revolution over time and I realized that even some of the
positions I would get in were very much like porn because certain positions in porn are like that because
the camera is there not because it's comfortable because that's the shot for the viewer to be able to see it so when
I started to see that I'm starting to replicate this in my most intimate private moments but we're both doing it
I made myself believe that I didn't enjoy sex so then drinking and drugs and
everything that came with it I felt like those were the moments that I could be
fully expressive without needing to perform which is very interesting because you would think it would be the opposite that I would then perform more
but I felt as if I could actually speak my mind if I didn't enjoy something can
we try this can I do this instead or I just want to give or I just want to receive can we be slower and then when I
was sober I felt like I couldn't say those things because if I say to you as my partner I might be emasculating you I
might be embarrassing you you might think something is wrong so I would just perform and you're performing as well
and then it just causes a huge disconnect so tantric sex was the first
thing that I came across that made me realize and really articulated that sex is actually not a specific destination
did you know that you can actually enjoy sex without uh ejaculation that you can
have a full body orgasm that you can be very slow that foreplay can be the main
thing that you do that you can experience orgasm without penetration just so many different ways of
articulating that experience of sex and it's just that an experience and that changed so much for me it's
such a sort of a narrative violation for so many people who've spent their whole life watching porn and then yeah
recreating it this idea that you can have an orgasm from touch that you can use energy to to cause
someone yeah orgasmic pleasure and yeah um yeah I do that's it's a really important
topic that I think people need to talk about a lot more and I think just just saying to someone that's listening to this that might be in a relationship
where they're not they're in a sexless relationship yes just proposing the idea that what if you both just speak there's
just say there was ten languages what if you're just speaking the wrong language right you know what I mean and what
approach would you then take you'd probably try and learn the language yes yes and also communicate to them what
language you speak and see and see how you can be bilingual I guess yeah you
know what it it reminds me of um are you familiar with Love Languages and and that that whole thing yes I realized
that a lot of people expect someone to give in the way that
they like to receive you know so no one really says okay how do you like to
receive love how do you like to give love and the moment that I started asking those questions even though I
believe I [ __ ] cringed in the beginning I'm like really if I get it but you get used to it yeah and if they
run off it's Stephen it's been a game changer to just ask the person that I'm dating or
my current partner to be like how do you like to be loved how do you like to receive love and how do you like to give it
um because just those simple questions can change so much and then you can use the same with sex what do you like and
what do you not like what have you changed your mind about what do you like to do now and again or maybe not so much
sometimes um how much time do you need how does your arousal actually work and I know
that some people might not know how to answer these questions for themselves so it's actually very good to start asking
yourself those questions before was speaking about it with someone else these are questions that you can just
start to ask yourself before introducing them to someone else but they can they can change so much because I think we
get into relationships and make so many assumptions based on our individual
experiences and our world view and we expect the person we're with to reflect
the exact same thing back to us but we don't we don't ask questions it comes back in many respects what we
were talking about earlier this kind of binary approach to life they either fit or they don't uh-huh there's no space
for conversation and nuance and and and I guess um Mutual development together like
towards the same this idea that you have to actually build and develop a relationship towards a place of
um satisfaction as opposed to finding your perfect soul mate or perfect fit right I'm gonna find someone that likes
to have sex like I do that likes to talk like I do that likes the things I do as opposed to this kind of molding towards
being more cohesive together I love that term Mutual development and it makes me
think actually that this is a term that can apply even outside maybe even
especially outside of romantic relationships this idea that people don't have to be perfect that they don't
have to exist in the way that I want the world to be or in how I expect them to be maybe we can actually mutually
develop a different perspective together because we're two different beings coming together
my most successful relationship my current relationship we are completely different really we don't believe the
same things we don't believe the same we don't have the same fundamental beliefs yeah
the reason why it works is because of one very simple thing communication a very healthy high
respect communication yeah where everything isn't an attempt to win it's an attempt to like genuinely understand
to move forward yeah and I think you can have two people that are that went very very different things whether it's in
sex or in business or their beliefs about religion and spirituality be bound together as long as they have respectful
communication I agree you know what I mean I guess empathy is part of respective education yeah this is a bit of a left field question but it just
What is the pain you enjoy having?
came into my head yeah because I remember a previous guest writing this in the diary after they left
very left field what is the pain that you enjoy having oh
I won't give my x-rated answer let me think of
what is um I experience a lot of growing pains now
more than ever now as my especially in the past I would say four years as the work that I do in
the world reaches more people and as I'm I'm constantly stretched in a lot of
ways which I really do enjoy but it challenges my sense of self I think
sometimes it can feel painful to shed aspects of my identity
and I actually enjoy that I enjoy that because it is part of my growth process and this is not a PR answer or anything
like it's the absolute truth I experience there's the discomfort that I experienced but sometimes it's painful
because it means that I have to make decisions that scare me it means that I
have to allow myself to be fully seen and really step into that idea of being visible
um and with a with visibility comes a lot of vulnerability as well so I think
that is a pain that I enjoy and will gladly accept and then the x-rated thing
that I will not say that's that's the thing no no this one I'll keep to myself thank you we just want to monetize this
episode can I can I turn the question back onto
you of course you can what is the pain that you enjoy the gym now I'm joking
no um the first answer that came to mind quite honestly was heartbreak and I tell
you why because heartbreak feels like the most intense pain that I think I've ever experienced
the most all-consuming um like black hole that I've ever been in is just like having my heart broken
but at the same time that pain for me is evidence of so much
it's evidence of my ability to feel so deeply and so I almost feel sorry for people that never get to have a
heartbreak because you never get to feel the full what I think to be the full spectrum of your heart so it's not
something that I would ever wish for but it's something that is a real indicator that I had a chance to feel so strongly
What ideas do you hold to be true that everyone else disagrees with?
a bit of a weird answer but no no no not at all not at all thank you
I am so excited to announce our new sponsor for this podcast and that is Blue Jeans by Verizon for any of you
that aren't already familiar with blue jeans they are a video conferencing and collaboration tool who offer an immersive communication experience that
drives pretty unparalleled employee and customer engagement experiences me and all of my teams across all of my
portfolio companies switched over to Blue Jeans a couple of months ago and we have not looked back the best thing for
us has been the totally frictionless experience no glitching no sound issues
no delays or any of those things that usually make virtual meetings really really frustrating we use blue jeans
anywhere on any device at any time and it's perfect for my small businesses that just have 10 or 20 people to some
of my bigger businesses that have hundreds of people I'm a big fan as you can probably tell so I've been quite excited for for some time to announce
this partnership and in the coming weeks I'll explain the features and really why it's perfect for you if you haven't
considered using or switching over to Blue Jeans yeah but if you can't wait head over to Blue dot com to learn more
honestly it's been one of the real sort of game changers in my business what ideas or beliefs do you hold to be
true that pretty much everyone else disagrees with things that you are sure are true yeah
but most people I'll tell you one of the biggest ones that uh most people didn't like a couple of
years ago when I said um that is a black person I'm not oppressed
and I mean you could say that anywhere else in the world and it'll be like yeah of course we we understand but people
maybe a small minority but a very loud minority especially at that time where
everything was so overly politicized really didn't like me saying that as a
black person here in the Western World having have come from Zimbabwe a country
that is the population is genuinely truly oppressed and I know what that looks
like I'm I'm not oppressed I'm not oppressed because of my race I don't see my race as a burden yes there are things
that I've experienced a lot of adversity that I've experienced I know the reality of what it means to live under the
systems that a lot of us do in and out of the western world I acknowledge all of that and at the same time I'm not
oppressed as a woman I'm not oppressed yes there are oppressive systems and
things that absolutely have to be questioned and looked at and there are many things that I advocate for where
people are truly oppressed FGM is an example I'm a huge advocate for working
with survivors of FGM female genital mutilation so I work with a lot of
groceries activists I do a lot of work around that so I understand what oppression looks like sex-based
oppression but for me as a woman I as an individual am not oppressed
um and I think a lot of people didn't like me saying that but for some reason
because I think some people saw it as me undermining
black people or undermining women which is very odd you know to to even
think about so I think that's something that is to me completely non-controversial that was seen as a
controversial statement to make maybe because of the climate at the time but that's one of the things that I can
think of that's a decision you're making it's a decision you're making not to feel not to label and stick it on your
chest again yes I'm an oppressed person yeah why are you making that decision
I think not I think I I know why I wasn't raised
to see myself as a victim I I just wasn't culturally or in my family home
or with everything that my family and I or I as an individual have been through I have never for one second apart from
the moments where I needed to misplace my own anger and outrage and blame onto
other people around me I never saw myself as a victim to the world so I think for me it's not even a conscious
decision that I have to be like okay um it just is I I don't see myself in that way I don't walk through the world
thinking that my skin color is a burden I know that there are things that I might experience because of it I'm very
aware of that I don't ignore that but I don't see that as the only truth or the
only side of the coin so it's always been quite easy for me to say that and a few years ago I did I never would have
had to declare anything like that at all but I think something happened especially in the past two years where
to even sort of see yourself as a powerful individual
means that you're taking away from other people yeah which is not truerto I've
just never seen myself as a victim ever ever and I won't I won't do it why not
there's a real cost to that just like we were talking about before there's a mental emotional spiritual cost to that
and I I just won't [ __ ] do it um and I think it's a lie it's a lie to make myself believe that I'm a victim
and that I'm oppressed and I I you know I'm a powerless individual I'm not I'm
not are you no I'm not I can tell yeah yeah that's
why you know it's I get asked this question a lot when I do talks is about you know discrimination Steve obviously
you know being a guy a man that was born in Africa I've got a black mother I'm I'm I guess I don't know what the
politically correct term is so I'll say the more mixed race Brown well I don't know what the correct term is so forgive
me uh half cast I don't know Brown okay yeah Brown I think you are
um did you not experience discrimination in business I get this question a lot and to me it's it's a fascinating
question because my brain goes I don't care yeah because I can't control it anyway yeah even if it were I'm sure
it's true I'm sure there's multiple moments in the rise of my career when I went into boardrooms and everyone there
was four times my age and white I'm sure there was um prejudices before I even opened my
mouth yeah that acted for and probably against me the thing is I can do nothing about them in terms of in that moment
and in my my day-to-day life I can't I can't cure your Prejudice or
discrimination and I don't think it's my responsibility to right I see my responsibility as like doing the best
that I can with where I am and with what I have and I then heard about this thing called labeling Theory where in Psychology if
you're given a label it then has a big impact on your future performance so yes if I call myself
um if I label myself as oppressed or at a disadvantage I will start acting like
I'm a disadvantaged person I'll show up with less confidence with more pessimism and um and all of those things are
probably going to be more harmful than the Discrimination itself absolutely so it was a it was it was a decision that
like to focus on what I can control on a on a macro level of course you fight every opportunity you have for equality
and to end systemic discrimination and to educate people better yeah from a
very early age and to change the way that media looks and to have more black podcasters as we've done a big campaign around and all of those things but on a
day-to-day do I want to burden myself as you say with um a label which I don't think will help will serve me right will
help me show up better the answer is unfortunate is no and that is my personal decision and yeah others can do
with their life what they wish to yeah um but I don't think it will serve me and you can again this goes back to
holding two truths you can you can choose not to be oppressed but then also fight for those that 100 will fight for
equality at the same time absolutely it's not to diminish the authenticity of the issue
um no and I I also another reason why I'm very Fierce about this um
is because I think as we have those conversations around representation Etc I think we do need to see more people
whether it's black brown what have you people that are in the minority depending on where they are
um I think we need to see them positioned as powerful Sovereign beings so the reason I'm very serious about the
conversations I have and saying no I'm not oppressed I do know what oppression looks like and I will continue to
Champion for as you say equality Etc but I it it's actually my responsibility to
claim my power as an individual who inhabits a black body it's actually my
responsibility this has to be a part of the representation conversation we can't always just want black people to step
forward to talk about the struggle because just like you say I started to notice actually that
every panel that I would get invited to do all the interviews it would start with something along the
lines of so Africa as a black woman yeah South Africa as a woman of color what
have you experienced nothing what if I haven't experienced any kind of what if I don't have some kind of story because
I started to find that it would put me into a position where I would kind of feel like I have to find a story where
something but what if nothing happened you know why can't I just be seen as a
writer as a consultant as a business owner as an entrepreneur without being a black entrepreneur or a black speaker or
all of which I really value and I see the importance in recognizing those things in those specific terms but why
does it have to be positioned in such a way where I have to look for adversity connected to my race so I've really
started to be very firm around that and to reject that and in in interviews to say I'm really curious to know why you
opened the question like that you know and sometimes people don't even realize they're doing it because they've
it's just become a script you know that would be a terrifying rebuttal if I if
I'd asked you that I was and I was not in a minority
right I'd be terrified because you're right there's there's almost this assumption that you're going to be the
voice of Oppression on this battle so we're gonna come to the yeah depressed now and we're going to ask you about
oppression right so I think there's a bit of cognitive distance where then someone like me says actually no I'm not
oppressed people don't kind of know what to do with you then it is really yeah
Violet's a bunch of narratives right and that's a good thing
Who You Are no Africa you are but you and don't
forget that and be but Stephen that happens yeah I know that happens in some messages that you get how how can I deny
how can you deny that you're oppressed I've had people tell me
um so that's very interesting because it tends to be white people a lot of the time that do that
because they they kind of and in a way I sort of can understand where they're coming from and that they really want to
stand up for something they really believe um this idea that every single person that
fits into this identity Market thinks and behaves and has had this experience so they don't then realize that they've
become quite regressive in their quest to be Progressive which is very it's
very interesting I had the most interesting conversation
um about racism on Twitter many years ago where um
I think the I think the trending topic of the day was like you can't speak you can't tell a black person what racism is
or something like that and so and I'm saying well no like racism can go both ways I I can be racist to a white person
yes I can be I can not give someone a job because they're white I can discriminate against them purely based
on their skin color I can be and this one this this lady online was arguing with me basically saying no white people
can't tell a black person what racism is she was saying that to me and I literally you're telling me
what racism is right now yeah and that is totally okay yes and she apologized she went you're completely right I
should never have spoken she literally went I should never have told you what racism is she got herself caught in her
own right because she abandoned truth and she just started falling in line with this like yeah binary nonsense
narrative that white people can't talk about races yeah what are you [ __ ] talking about yes
to be honest as well like I'm half white right I've got this luxury I can shape-shift
so yeah so does that mean because I'm half white I can only half talk about racism right because it's also racist
just to say that I'm black that's just picking one half of my identity right so see how this entire thing falls apart
the more that you sort of you interrogate interrogate anyway you blowing it it just [ __ ] crumbles
because it's just [ __ ] it's propped up [ __ ] by people that are virtually signaling right just don't know what
they think or believe so they've just gone with the cult it's like yeah it's the script it's the script that's why I
think um questioning and it can seem so simple but questioning can really allow you to sort
of snap out of this trance because a lot of it is it's a trance it's a script that people repeat and you regurgitate
The ingredient for happiness
that interrogation right it's like you wake up in the morning you go to your like your side and then they give you
the the beliefs the 174 beliefs that you have to believe and you go okay cool got it and you you don't even look at it you
just insert it in your little it's like a SIM card they just put it in your brain and you never understand why you believe these things because they're not
your beliefs yeah someone said to me one day they said um if you if you believe the same things as everybody around you
they're not your beliefs and it was a really interesting thing because it's true that's powerful but think if you
believe every if you believe pretty much everything that everyone around you believes they are not to your beliefs they're the beliefs of the society you
lived in if I moved you to Germany at a certain time you might well have had a different set of beliefs
exactly you know what I mean yes or if I moved you back to the you know in my history's Goods the 16th century when
slavery was Rife yes and you you had a slave you might have believed it completely different set of things but
okay and normal so beliefs there's there's very little correctness to it to many of them
if happiness is this recipe that contains all of these essential ingredients in order for you to make the
the dish of happiness what is your recipe
which ingredients are you currently lacking for that recipe
which ingredients am I lacking for the recipe of happiness
you said that much clearer than I did I should just use that
just before we take that when she's gone
no question um vulnerability
yeah really really I would surprise a lot of people yeah and it's tied to what
I mentioned around romantic relationships yeah
allowing myself to be more vulnerable I think that could
allow me to have access to layers of happiness that I haven't yet experienced
that's what comes to mind but it's a it's a it feels like a very big question
because I think it makes you well it makes me have to think about even just with the word luck it makes me have to
sort of turn that mirror onto myself
Last guest question
um yeah but I think honestly I'm able to be vulnerable in so many other areas but if
I think about the happiness that I could experience in terms of romance vulnerability
it's funny when you think it when you're answering that question I was thinking about the analogy of ingredients and one
of the things that um makes a recipe go bad isn't a lack of ingredients it's the wrong quantities
yes which is probably what people call balance yes if I put a fourth egg in
when it says three eggs the recipe goes bad right so as I think about that in terms of balance you think about the
scales of ingredients that you're weighing up you've got to get the right quantities of each ingredient in order to make a great recipe sometimes I think
in my case I maybe have too much of I have too many eggs yeah you know what I mean too many eggs in the basket I have
too much professional commitments and I've I've I don't have enough sugar which is maybe romance and that kind of
connection yes so maybe one can have all the ingredients there but just have the complete wrong quantities yes to ruin
the the recipe that's a good one we have a closing tradition on this podcast where the last guest writes a question for the
next guest what is the crazy
big idea you would try
if you knew you could not fail I want to start off first of all or a
huge annual event that is a place for all of us to express our Unthinkable
thoughts and it's going to be a place for people to
come and see what honest raw and filtered respectful compassionate
communication looks like in real time and
I want this to become something that is global I want it to become
something that has a life of its own outside of me and
I've wanted to do this for a very very long time
um and I know that I'd be able to do it very well
but I think it's it feels scary because I know that I could do it very well
yeah and I've never shared that out loud um I'm not sure if I understand that
last part it was still scary because I know I can do it yeah that doesn't make a lot of sense to me it does really yeah
and I'll tell you what I mean by that it's almost like that feeling that I was telling you off when I would get emails
and offers to speak for half an hour which comes so easily to me and get paid so much money
so I would resist it because I know that I can do it and I know that I'm going to get rewarded so much from it
which means that there's a leap in identity that has to happen which feels
quite scary so it's almost the same with this event and this idea that I have and
it's it seems as you say like it doesn't make sense it's scary because you know that it's going to succeed it's scary
because you know that it's going to work um and something that I've had to work on over time is the fear of success
yeah so this event and this thing that I want to do is sort of linked to that it's a
barrier that I have to break and will um so yeah what a great question
Africa thank you um I wanted to speak to you because I saw so much so much nuance and truth and
um importance in the way that you communicate but also watch you communicate and so it's very rare these
days that I will DM someone out of the blue and say you should come on my podcast yeah and that is just a for me
that is a um a sign of how much I respect what you're doing and how important I think
it is to have conversations that are you know there are Unthinkable thoughts and
that are fearless and that are um challenging whether they are right or whether they are wrong I'm a big believer in just being able to have the
conversation because I think that is the starting point of progress where you can where two ideas can Clash and then they
can merge and find the truth and move forward as maybe one shared idea um and there's not enough of that there's not
enough people like you that are doing that so you I have a suspicion I have a very big suspicion that you are going to
be a very important voice on a global level and that you are going to be a star I really believe that
because you're very rare and it's an important rare it's a very important round it's a
it's a hopefully it's a flourishing type of rare but it's it feels like it's become a bit of a Dying Breed of rare
and people that are willing to have conversations um regardless of how they might be perceived right by
those that receive those those conversations so thank you for being that voice in society and I think this
is just the start of our friendship if I feel that might make you cringe because yeah friendship please more of them we are
best friends yeah let's say okay we'll revisit that yeah we'll get back Stephen
thank you um you know what I was saying to my friend Emily that I
was really just looking forward to this conversation because especially in the time where everything
is so heavily politicized and people are sort of lead with identity and what it
means to be a certain person I think I was just really looking forward to having this conversation with you
because of the work that you do beyond the work in itself your curiosity and
your willingness to sort of learn and to be open and to change your mind and to be corrected and to also be assertive
but to also be soft and to just allow for ideas to exist openly without
disagreeing or agreeing just hearing I think it's yeah I think it is you know
something that is quite rare but I think through conversations like this it actually causes a beautiful ripple
effect so I I do think this is the start of a friendship so thank you thank you
I had a few words to say about one of my sponsors on this podcast for many years people have been asking for a coffee
flavored Hill and quite recently he'll release the iced coffee caramel flavor of their um ready to drink Hills and
I've just become hooked on it over the last couple of weeks I've been on a really interesting Journey with huel which I've described and talked about a
little bit on this podcast I started with the berry ready to drinks then I moved over to the protein salted caramel
because it's 100 calories and it gives you all of your essential vitamins and minerals but also gives you the 20 odd grams of protein you need and now I'm
balanced between them both I drink mostly the banana flavor ready to drink I've got really into the iced coffee
caramel flavor of Jules ready to drink and now I'm drinking that as well as the protein make sure you try the new ready
to drink flavors that the caramel flavor is amazing the new banana flavor as well is amazing and obviously as I said the
iced coffee caramel flavor has been a real Smash Hit

Transcription:

i don't do a lot of interviews like this so there's not a lot of people that do get to see this side of me chris
eubank jr the biggest fight of his life growing up i was always chris eubank son a lot of
people would say you're trying to steal your son's limelight to a certain extent maybe he was i have to do something here
to where people know me for me i got myself into this gang some kid had
gotten my number he was like wait till i find you i went into school with a baseball bat to find
this kid i take the baseball bat out that changed the path of my life
[Music] the first time i went to dubai there was a young guy there and offered to train
me that was your brother
i just started crying man it was you know one of the worst days of my life i knew my brother was in dubai and i
didn't go and see him that would have been the last time i would have saw him before he passed
um a man named nick blackwell he got taken
to hospital he actually died on the way to hospital he had to revive him with an adrenaline shot those types of incidents
are what put things into perspective and make you think about what you're doing have you ever had this conversation with
your father about your emotions this is too much
so without further ado i'm stephen bartlett and this is the diary of a ceo i hope nobody's listening but if you are
then please keep this to yourself [Music]
chris one of the really remarkable things about your story that i was
Where did your discipline & strength come from?
that kind of broke the mold a little bit was someone that comes from a family as you described where you did have comfort
because your father was very very successful in his career it seems like a little bit of an anomaly
that you had such discipline and appetite for
struggle and pain because usually that comes from typically stereotypically that comes from
a background of intense hardship so i guess where my question is like where did that come from in you and is
that something you saw in all of your siblings i always had that
very competitive uh personality you know and before i found
boxing i was heavy into sports in school cricket rugby football athletics
swimming um and i i just got a high off of competing and winning
just just competitive that's all i all i want to do was test myself against other guys
and then obviously when i found boxing i quickly understood that this was
the ultimate form of competition you couldn't get anything more intense more hardcore
more pure than two guys putting gloves on getting into the ring
and and going until somebody can't go anymore did you have
that from your dad at all was he ever pushing you in those early years before you even knew he was a boxer to be competitive to win and that that was
important or was it more just innate in you you know it's funny my father actually
he was the opposite in terms of supporting or you know pushing me
towards boxing he he banned me from going to boxing gyms for a couple of years
he didn't think i'd be tough enough you know so uh you know i was begging him all the time let me let me go to the gym
let me let me let me go and spa let me go and train and he he would just tell me no no you're not going
stick with your athletics stick with your rugby stick with your football stick with your studies
that was a big thing for him you know because he didn't have that education growing up um
boxing's gonna be too tough you know you've got so many look at look at where you are you're in a mansion you go to
private school you know you've got everything you need and want here why do you need to go down
to the gym and and get your ass kicked every day so um you know it took years of me
nagging and begging let me do it let me do it um finally he gave in
and i guess the rest is history now we're here when i was younger i remember my older
brothers could all eat really spicy food and remember someone saying to me at the table maybe one of my brothers maybe my
mum she was like don't give that to steve he can't eat it when i heard that it sounded like a challenge to me
now when you said that about your dad it almost sounded like a dare it sounded like a challenge did you receive it like
that him saying you're not tough enough to do that absolutely you know as a kid
um when you're told you can't do something you want to do it ten times more do you think he was aware
of that he's a smart man you know what i've never thought of it like that i've never thought about that
like was he was he trying to bait me you know was he saying this or stopping me so that when
i actually did start i would go so hard that i would actually you know make might make something of myself in the
sport i have no idea if he did then that's that's a hell of a you know a thing
but um no i mean i i genuinely think that he
he did really think i wasn't tough enough i mean world champions the best fighters
in the world generally come from poverty from hardship from broken homes
and they fight because they have to fight there is there's no other option for them if they don't win if they don't
succeed in boxing they don't eat you know they don't have a home to go to
they can't pay the bills um so that's what fuels them to
to make it they have no choice uh whereas me i had i have many choices so in a way
i see it as i i see it as actually more of a an accomplishment
because i didn't have to go through everything i went through to get to where i am today
34th of fights 32 wins the pain the hardship the sacrifice the
suffering i didn't have to do any of that i could have stayed in school i could have
kept the rugby up all the or the or the football or the cricket um you know and i i would have made it in
any sport that i wanted to make it in i know that why just just because of my passion and my
my drive you know once i once i zone in on something i want to do nothing else matters
and i will i will do it and i will get there by any means necessary
people that don't know about boxing or don't know how to fight they think that you got to be big and
strong and mean and full of hate and that's what enables you to be a great fighter or to
be able to to win in the fight game and sure some of those things are going
to help you you know speed power all of that stuff plays a big part for sure but the
biggest part of being able to be a great fire is is this
and a lot of people don't realize that or don't know that it is
in my opinion i don't know 70 80 mental
you know the balls and the the grit that you have to have
to you know walk through crowds of that thousands of people
and while you're walking there knowing that you know once you get to that ring and walk up those stairs
you're gonna have to take off your jacket the bell's gonna go and you're gonna
have to fight somebody you're gonna have to get hurt and you're gonna have to hurt somebody in front of
thousands of people and millions of people around the world that in itself
that that walk most people on the planet could not cannot do that
just the walk let alone the fight part it takes a lot of mental strength
it takes a lot of of guts a lot of heart you know mental strength
it's a huge thing in boxing it's a big thing in life even outside of boxing right in business
and in all i think great endeavors do you think it's something that you can from what you've seen in the gym something
you can teach or train i think you can have you seen it talk to someone that didn't have it
i've seen fighters improve you know i've seen fighters over the
years become more confident and in their abilities and you know that does transfer for that just
transfer over to their performances in the ring i think to a certain extent you do have to have
that strength that that belief and that courage and that that mental fortitude to fight
it can be enhanced in some ways but only to a certain extent
because at the end of the day there are going to be times in training inspiring and definitely in
in the fighting where you're going to get hurt you're going to be in a position where
you're questioning yourself what am i doing here am i gonna be okay can i beat this guy
um should i give up should i find a way out
this is too much every fighter experience is that that that moment you know have you
experienced that yeah in a fight there's one time where i was close to giving up
Why I never give up
one time i went to cuba before i turned pro
out there obviously they have the olympians and you know their their olympic
training is second to none you know these guys are animals they're monsters um
in cuba they have this thing called technical sparring which i had never done and i never did
ever again until maybe up like two years ago but technical sparring is basically um
you're sparring but you're not aspiring to hurt the guy you're aspiring to work on technique you know so it's like an agreement all right
listen i'm not gonna go all out here you know we're gonna work on the jab today or we're gonna work on foot movement
um we're not trying to bang each other out you know they they they're big on that they're big on technical sparring
i had never done anything like that my my whole mentality was if i'm going to spy you i'm going to try and get you out of
there because that's how my mentality is going to be when i'm in a real fight
so i i need that's just how i need to be um the cuban
olympic heavyweight representative walks up the stairs and gets into the
ring i thought he was coming into the ring to to shadowbox and warm up for his sparring session with somebody else
he said no no you guys you guys are going to spa i was like uh
dude he's about three times the size of me what do you mean he's like yeah yeah it's okay it's okay we you know he'll work with
you he'll work with you technical sparring so i thought sure that's fine let's go
first round goes first bell goes this guy sprints over to me
and just starts laying into me the biggest shots bang bang bang
head up moving out the way dungeon running around the ring and he's just coming at me and i can't get this guy off of me
he knocks me out of the ring he punches me i i fall out of the ring i drop down
it's like a three four foot drop onto concrete my knee hits the hit hits the concrete
my leg goes dead right this is the second round that this happened i still have one more round
afterwards so i'm getting up legs completely gone
i'm looking up in this heavy weights like leaning over the the ropes looking at me looking down
at me and i have a decision to make do i get back in
or do i say listen my knees bad you're too big
i've got a concussion let me know let me just take a break so i'm sitting there i'm looking around everyone's looking at me my dad's there
i was like you know what let's [ __ ] go let's go walk back up knowing knowing
what i was about to receive once as soon as i got back in the ring and that's like what happened
crack click uh you know clapped us back in just starts laying into me again for another another another two rounds
but my whole thing was i have to finish the three rounds why
because i said i was gonna do the three rounds i said i would bar him three rounds
i'm not leaving this gym with everybody knowing that i quit why not
why not because uh i couldn't i couldn't live with myself i've gotta i've gotta go home and go to
sleep how am i going to go to sleep with that on my mind you know i can go to sleep
with getting my ass kicked by a guy who's three times bigger than me i can i can sleep like that i can't go to sleep knowing that he
another man made me quit made me run out of the ring no so i got back into that ring and i took
my beating like a man and from that day on i was never scared
again so that was the worst
experience of my life in terms of boxing but it was also the best experience
because i knew i knew what i was capable of i knew i had it inside me to not give up
i knew i could take a shot i knew i had what it what it would take
to make it if he can't make me quit who's gonna make me quit nobody
so that stuck with me for the rest of my career something really interesting which i i gained from that
which is like we basically create a personal like philosophy or story with ourselves and in that moment when you're
looking up at stepping back into that ring with that massive guy in there it's like you're you're writing or
making a story about yourself one that will probably follow you forever and i think
about this sometimes when i'm on my own and i'm on my like peloton and i'm either exhausted or knackered and i know there's seven minutes left and i know i
can just get off it but this thing in my head goes but then steve you're changing your own personal story which is that sometimes
steve quits when it's hard and the thought of having to live the rest of my life with that per and it sounds like a very strange thing i've
never said before but the thought of having to live with that personal story that personal philosophy that that's who i am is never worth getting off the bike
because okay it's seven minutes today but it's a lifetime of thinking that's who i am and it
sounded like that in that moment you you had a choice about who you were going to sit you know and it's a self thing i
know there's other people there but sometimes when i'm sure you have it in the gym or whatever where no one's around it's just
you and you yeah you have a decision to make about who who you are right happens a lot in training i imagine as
well right no that that's actually when it happens the most you know there are times you know i'll be i'll be on the treadmill
where i'll be running and you know i'll get a cramp in in the uh in my calf yeah i've still got eight minutes to go
because you said you were gonna do because i i've set the timer for 40 minutes on the thing so i'm on i'm on 32 minutes
the cramp starts going you're on the treadmill yeah
you got you got eight minutes to go and i'm i'm running like this now
but i'm not getting off the treadmill because i've got to do the eight minutes
why no one's there nobody's there but if the treadmill can make me quit
what happens when i get into the ring with a guy who's hit me and i'm hurt yeah he's gonna make me quit too so i'm
i'm on that treadmill for eight minutes like that just try and just try and not try not to
get the pressure on this leg but i'm finishing the 40 minutes now that is
you know it it's huge because it teaches you
to believe and to know that you know no matter how hard things get you will find
a way you'll find a way it doesn't matter who's watching you
know you know because yeah no one's around right now so no one
would know if you took that break but what happens when you're in a situation where the world is watching
and you're in that same position of pain or of of un you know uncertainty about you
know so you got a big speech or you you know some something's happening and everyone's watching and you don't know
you don't really want to keep going you know then you'll get that same feeling you
know what i'm going to do it not oh well listen i'm i'm i'm done i just
this is too much you don't ever want to put that uh that spirit inside yourself you know
you got to you got to keep those demons out you know and they are demons you know and if you and if you let them in
enough they take over i don't let anything like that inside me i always beat
what it is uh that's in front of me what it is whether it's mental whether it's spiritual whether it's physical
um i always make sure i come out on top one of the ways we learn about who we are and i was i guess that self story
that i was talking about there is by looking at others we can sometimes compare ourselves to our peers or those
around us or whatever it might be and say i know that i'm different because everyone around me
isn't like this thing they're not like they don't have this trait or quality or think in this way that i do
when i look at your career and what you've done it is remarkable because as you said you had so many other
choices but you chose what i consider to be the most tumultuous
struggle-filled one and so i when i when i sit here i go what is it about you
What made you different from everyone else?
that's made you where you are today in this this great champion the character traits the attributes what
is it i've always had a strong mind i've always had a strong soul
i've always known what i wanted to do uh and that i was never gonna stop until
i did it um i had a lot to live up to
you know growing up i was always chris eubank's son you know from an early age i was like
yeah but that's not my i'm not chris that's not my name my name is chris he made it even harder
by calling me chris he made it even harder this guy um but i knew that that's not i couldn't go
the rest of my life as that as just being the son of oh that's chris you know i have to do
something here to where people know me for me that was a big driving factor
becoming my own man doing something that people would be proud of and that my family would be
proud of and that i could say was my own now some people would say well then why
did you go into boxing with which is you know the same sport your dad did um
you know it's a good question i mean i guess that you know
i guess that competitive uh soul inside of me maybe
wanting to see if i could be better than what my dad was see if i could be better than the guy
who said i i wasn't tough enough um
i'm sure that was in my mind in the early stages
now that i've done so much it's it's not at all you know i don't ever compare myself to my father people do all the
time you know who would win in a fight if you you and your dad fought or you know did would you ever spar with him
um i don't i don't think about any of that you know i just have to be the best fighter i can be um
because at the end of the day um especially in boxing you know
you know you you're only going to be competing with yourself that's how you that's how you elevate that's how you
get better not by focusing on other people and i think that that goes for you know any
industry if you if you're constantly looking at other people and what they're doing and you know why they made it or why they didn't make
it you know you you're losing out on on you and what you know and on what is best for you and how
you're going to progress i never looked up at anyone and said i want to do that and i want to be there i
just i always just thought to myself you know what this is going to be so hard as it is i
don't want to put any added pressure on myself i don't want to you know
can i can i get as many wins as my dad or you know can i be more famous or make more money like
all that stuff would it's just it's a it just messes with your mind so you just
have to focus on day by day week by week fight by fight just being the best you can be and
that's what i did and i just built that up over the years until you know until i had made my own
name and made my own uh path um my father's always been there he's
always been there to support me and guide me i think
he's now taking a back seat a lot a lot a lot more than he was originally he was
frightened and said at the beginning of my career you know you you look back on youtube at the at the the press conferences and the
weigh-ins he was right there you know and he'd be talking on my behalf sometimes
a lot of people would say you know oh you you're trying to steal your son's limelight um
to a certain extent maybe he was or maybe he i don't think he was doing it consciously like oh i want to i want to
steal a sunset but it's just he's such an entertainer he's such a people person he just couldn't help
himself you know he'd have to get up in the middle of a press conference and do some
poetry or or talk [ __ ] to my opponent or he had to he just that's just who he is
um and early on i actually didn't mind it because
i was so hell-bent on just becoming a good fighter i didn't even really want to talk to the
public and i and i i always got and i still do
get a lot of uh trolls online social media
so it gave me like kind of like a bad taste for
publicity and and media and and so i didn't really even want to deal with that i just wanted to fight i just
wanted to get my record up so that people could start saying okay yeah this kid's a bad boy that's all i cared about
so it was actually him he actually did take a a lot of pressure off of me by him kind of doing the talking for for a
certain amount of years um now that i'm established now that i am you know where i am in the
sport uh that isn't needed you know i'm 32 years old now i can't
have another man at my press conferences speaking on my behalf it's just this
it's just not gonna fly so for the last few years he hasn't been doing that
i'm comfortable in front of a camera now i wasn't comfortable at the beginning in the beginning i was very and i looked
back and i looked back at the all these pictures i used to take with fans and interviews and i was always very
serious and stone-faced and not fun to really listen to in interviews
and people would say oh yeah i met you i met you uh you know i met you in in 2013
2014. look look here's a picture and then and then and i'd be sitting standing up some like this
what was that you just you just had a bad opinion of that
no i just i was just so serious i was just so obsessed with boxing like
and for me when i'm in the fight i don't play you know some guys you know they they
walk they walk in into the ring you know manny pacquiao's and joshua's in the high-fiving guys and smiling and
you know dancing to the music i'm not that guy i can't i can't be like
that if i know i've got to fight i'm a barbarian you know i'm it's wartime
um and even though i'm light outside of the ring now as an adult
one even now i i still want this fight time i'm not smiling i'm not a nice guy
now as at the start of my career i guess i couldn't i couldn't separate the fighter from
the guy in the street they were the same guy so whether i was in the ring or i was taking a picture with the fan
i i wasn't smiling i was a serious dude now as you get older you you know you
understand you can't you can't be like that around normal citizens
because it's it's it's just weird you know you you have to be able to smile i i smile at
all my pictures now because these pictures they have them for the rest of their lives
and and they show them to their friends their family um
and what do you want do you want that or do you want oh he's a nice guy or oh he's an [ __ ]
he couldn't even you couldn't even smile he looked so serious he didn't look like he didn't want you want to be there you know that's one thing i've learned
it's very important being in the public eye you have to give people time
and you have to be happy about it uh because
you know one encounter is not just one encounter
if you meet somebody you're actually meeting their friends their family their son their daughters
you know that one person it's a spider web so that one person is actually
a thousand different people and it's either gonna be he was a really good guy he was a cool
guy he said he took he took a picture and he spent you know he spent time and talked to me that's that's the story that goes out to
the thousand people or what an [ __ ] what a wanker
um which one of those stories do you want being
spider webbed out into the universe you know and it all comes back around because you meet the friends you meet the family you see the tweet yeah you
see the tweets you know it all comes back around so good energy positive vibes give people
your time you know because those pictures and those stories
stay with them for the rest of their lives and becomes your karma
and becomes your karma it becomes how people treat you that you've never met before
you know you really got to be aware of the power of your energy towards other
Are you emotional?
people if if you give off bad vibes and then you get bad vibes if you're a good person if you give people time
it all comes back around there's been this kind of perception because of that because if you're very stone-faced that you're unemotional
sure you've heard this before yeah what's the truth in there are you unemotional
i've heard that i've heard that word many times throughout the years with girls i've
dated that's always been a really bad or hard thing for them to
to get past is that i'm not an emotional guy apparently i'm very hard to read
when i'm in a relationship or on a date or whatever it is um you know they don't know if i even like them
um am i emotional no i'm not
i have emotions obviously but you know like for you to upset me
is it's damn near impossible and you know i will never sh i i don't think i've
i can't remember the last time i shouted at somebody i don't have that emotion to
you know if you if you do something wrong to me or to disrespect me or
okay and then i just never see you again i i don't get that like
you know what are you doing you know like that so many people get i don't have that in me i don't know why
you know if i knock somebody out in the ring
i stand there i look at them while they're on the
floor that's it you know 99.9 percent of fighters they they knock a guy out
[Music] jumping up onto the brink high fiving people
crying you know i don't i don't have that emotion it's like yeah i knocked you out
this is what i said i was gonna do this is what i've trained for for my whole life
so yeah that's what happened um do you ever worry though that that's
gonna get in your way a little bit in terms of especially romantic relationships women
are a little bit more emotional than men um they're more in touch with their feelings i mean the data shows that
quite clearly so do you ever think that's gonna inhibit you from forming romantic relationships
i mean i've never really thought about it and it's not because she said you wanted kids i
remember hearing you say that of course yeah i mean who doesn't um well i mean some people don't but
eventually i do want a kid but you know the woman i'm going to have a kid with is not going to be a woman that needs an
emotional man you know some women don't need that um was your father emotional
no no your mother yeah
yeah father emotional at all no affectionate
i knew he loved me and that you know i knew i could i knew he wanted the best
for me um [Music] he was emotional enough to for me to
know that uh that's my dad and i would do anything for him and i love him you know some
some people don't have that relationship with their dads you know i love my dad i res but i respected him and i feared him
um i did fear him so
and that was you know he was very strict growing up i couldn't get away with anything
i think that's sometimes about myself i think you know i i actually grew up i still to this day called my mum and dad
by their first names never called them mum and dad and then i think there was a lack of affection and emotion in my
child in my childhood so i had to kind of learn growing up how to be affectionate and
emotional i remember someone calling me their best friend and me feeling this like internal
repulsion like the [ __ ] and then when i would when i'd get into a relationship with well no this was
even worse when i'd find someone that i fancied and i'd pursue them the minute they showed interest in me i'd reject
them and so until i realized that was going on and i had this like weird thing in me it controlled me and it meant that
27 i had my first proper relationship so yeah that's uh i'd learn a bad model of
affection relationships and emotions so i feel like i've become a little bit
more emotional as i've gotten older you know before
nothing could phase me you know doesn't matter what would happen nothing would phase me
up until a few years maybe maybe over the last like two or three years
there's been a few times where i've watched movies
and i'd get this like you know something sad would happen and
i'd get this this feeling you know like and i i never cried you know but
you know that like that start of like i might cry um [Music]
and i was like what what the hell is this you know like this is weird and that's only have started happening over
the last couple of years so i don't know if i'm becoming more mellow
or i don't know but i'm just i'm just not an emotional person you know i haven't cried
you know the last time i well i was the last time i cried i was i was 12 years old
and then i cried again when my brother died last year so
you know that's that's 20 years in 20 years i've cried
once so yeah i mean i guess you could say i'm not emotional but that's what i needed
to be to do the things i've done in the ring that that that was that was my journey
that was that was how i was able to do it um i had to get my emotions out
to be able to perform ice cold you know some guys use their emotions to
help them fight more that was my path you know if i ever
if i ever felt emotions getting involved in you know whether it was hate or anger or
being afraid i would i noticed that it affected my fighting negatively i would make mistakes
you know if i went into a sparring session i really didn't like the guy you know and i went out there and really
tried to hurt him i'd actually hurt him less than if i was just cool calm cold and calculated you know
i'd make mistakes i'd attack when i wasn't supposed to attack or i would i'd move and i would do certain things which i'm just i'm only doing because i
just want to get him you know and it's like boxing is a chess match you know
at the highest levels you have to think about everything that you're doing
the guys that think while they're in the ring not just react those are the guys who who make it to
the top of the top have you ever had this conversation with your father about your emotions about dealing with emotions suppressing
Have you spoken to your dad about emotions?
emotions whatever because i don't know i struggle to believe that you're not emotional as you've seen you
does come out in you but it just seems like you've learned how to suppress and not express those emotions
i have never had this conversation with my father no we've never talked about emotions or
feelings i'm not gonna say he's not that type of
guy because he actually may be now at this stage in his life you know he's he's found god he's very
religious now um so maybe i actually could have this conversation with him but
you know 10 years ago 20 years ago there's just no way i could never sit
down with him and and talk about my feelings you know he'd be like feelings
come let me take my belt off and show you about feelings you know really it was not you know very strict very um
[Music] yeah very uh
you you i got away with nothing as a kid you know but i i think i needed that
because i was very boisterous i was very i had a lot of energy you know i got myself into this gang
when i was a kid and you know i was going around i was fighting i was
you know skipping school um [Music] the only thing that
somewhat kept me in line was knowing that if i got caught or if i went too far
my dad was waiting for me at home do you really think he would have taken his belt off if you tried to chat with him back through here i'm exactly i'm
exaggerating that part yeah but listen the belt came off many times but when i stepped out of line as a kid
yeah um you know that strictness those that punishment
uh stopped me from going even more overboard than i already
did and i did go overboard you know you can go on to youtube right now and see a video of me street fighting at 16 years
old in the car park in brighton and i was doing that every other week
you know so imagine what i would have been doing if i could if i could just have free reign if i had nothing
stopping me from doing anything it would you know i'd be in jail
100 percent um [Music] you know we're jamaicans we're built
differently you know we're there's just something in our dna which uh you know we
we we have this thing where we you know we we like to cause trouble man i don't know why
um my father was the same you know he got into all types of trouble as a kid you
know stealing and getting arrested and fighting you know that's just
i don't know we just we we come from a a bloodline of of uh of ruffians you know it's just how
we are i'm a lot more um refined now as an adult you know i look
back at some of the things i was doing and i'm just like what what was i thinking i remember
i went to college for maybe a month or two before i ended up moving
to america some kid from this uh the school that was opposite
from the college had had somehow gotten my number and i had i got in a fight with his brother and these are these two really
big kids um and he he got my he called me like 2am woke me up he's like yo who
do you think you are i'm gonna [ __ ] you i'm gonna do this i'm gonna eat you i'm gonna do this stuff to
you you know watch wait till i find you watch hung up the phone
i i knew who the kid was because i heard i knew his voice right
the next day i went into school with a baseball bat in in my gym bag
so i have the gym bag so obviously no one can see it lunch bar rang went picked up my bag
started walking across to the other school to find this kid
and when i say find him i mean like i was walking in and out of classes
i was opening the doors and seeing you know the teachers looking like
who are you what are you doing don't worry about it so i was walking from classroom to classroom to classroom to classroom on your own on my own yeah to
find this kid with the baseball bat in my bag and you know um
i thank god i thank the good lord above that i didn't find him
that i didn't see him because you know
i walk into a classroom or i see him on the football field i take the baseball bat out i hit him with it
finished you know one i could kill the kid i'm in jail for the rest of my life
um you know i would i would have been banned from
going to america so my my whole my whole foundation
uh everything that i learned going over to the states as as at 18 years old having my first amateur
fights training with floyd mayweather and his father that would have all been washed away i
would have never i would have never done it so i would never have done anything in boxing because that was that was that
start was what built me up you know
you know i just so i just thank god that he wasn't there that day because that could have changed the part of my life
you know and i just look back at that like how what were you thinking like how
stupid could you be but obviously as a kid you you're not thinking about consequences or america you know you you
know you're just upset that some kid called you up and and called you an [ __ ] and said he's gonna mess you up the next time you see him you're not
thinking about traveling and getting bands and going to prison and you're just thinking i want to be a big man and and show everyone
i'm hard you know so it's just you know you have to have that's why i say i thank god for my father as well
for how strict he was because you know there were other times where there were
things that i was going to do but i didn't do them because i didn't want to
suffer the consequences of my old man so um
yeah you talked earlier about your the death of your brother sebastian
The death of your brother & how it changed you
the first time i went to dubai i went to the gym there and there was a young guy there that
came over and offered to train me and he trained me for about
i think two weeks individually i was your brother got loads of photos hundreds and
hundreds of photos of him training me on the bags there i remember him as being just the most
generous pure pure is the word that i always come back to
giving person he did not ask me for any money he never asked me for a thing he trained me on the bags both times that i
came to um dubai and i wasn't he didn't necessarily know who i was or what i was doing but
he did that out of the goodness of his heart and then he continued to message me and speak to him on instagram about superfoods and we talked a lot about
that obviously he there was a tragic accident and he passed away from that
what can you tell me about that incident and the lasting impact that's had on you and those those around you
i mean you know this is fresh this is this only happened a year ago
um and i never had to
i've never dealt with anything like that in my life um
i told you i'm not an emotional guy the last time i cried i said i was 12
years old but the day i found out i cried the whole day
i cried the whole day i cried for like two days straight um
yeah yeah my so my dad actually i had covered i had covered when i found
my dad came to my house uh he woke me up
he said come outside and i thought i'd done something wrong because he had he had a look in his face
which was uh i don't know i just couldn't i can't describe it but it was
i knew something was wrong um so i thought that you know i don't know i i i wasn't sure what what i was
about to hear he took me outside my little brother my little brother joseph
um he's he lives with me and i have an outhouse
uh so he lives there he went and got him and he sat us down and he told us and um
you know i just started crying man it was you know one of the worst days of my life and um
you know it's just it's so crazy to to think that somebody that is so healthy you know
like you said he's telling you about the superfoods and you know he trains every day you know
peak physical condition um can just you know have a heart attack
and just gone just still just blows my mind you know
um i thank god that you know he didn't suffer he didn't he didn't really feel
anything he just went um and i also thank god that he had a
son his son was born maybe a month or month before he passed
and he raheem and he looks just like him so we have that you know
um we have raheem to carry on his legacy and i thank god for that every day um
you know he's just now starting to walk learning how to walk he has a seven or eight teeth he's he's
a great kid very good looking kid um
i guess that one instance i feel like that has made me more of an
emotional person since that's happened um
it makes you think just like how before something that happens to you you hear about all that stuff on your news
and to other people and you see it in movies and it's just like well whatever you
know it doesn't it doesn't really register but when there's a death in your family then
then the next time you hear about someone passing away then you get that immediate feeling of what you dealt with
and then you start to sympathize and empathize and with the people that it's happening to that you don't know
um and i never had that emotion before until until this happened um
and it just you know like i said i had covid and
uh that meant that i actually couldn't make it to his his funeral which is
you know it's just crazy like i was in florida for the whole of covert right
and when i say that these guys didn't care in florida like
the beaches were full no one's wearing masks i i remember going to the beach and i would walk
along the beach thousands of people and i'd be wearing a mask this was like peak covered and people would be looking at me like what are you wearing a mask for
like they did not care i was in i went to texas i was in dallas for a month i was partying every night
never got covered and then the day my brother dies i have covered
and i can't get on a plane and fly to dubai for his funeral because
i have covered and in the muslim religion they have to bury him as
quickly as possible um they couldn't wait
i thank god that my family were able to go out i had to stay um
you know i don't i don't believe in regrets um
i believe what's meant you know what's meant to be will be and you know you should be happy with
whatever happens in your life you know but i would say there is one regret i have in my life
uh and that was i actually went so i hadn't i hadn't
seen my brother for quite some time and
uh i was i had a holiday this was i don't know
maybe three or four months before he passed away i stopped off i had to stop off in dubai and i stopped off in dubai
for like a couple days before i flew to this destination and um
i didn't want to i didn't want to see anybody nobody knew that i was making this trip
i knew my brother was in dubai and i didn't go and see him
i just i didn't want people knowing i was in dubai so i just i stayed in my hotel room and i didn't see anybody
and then i left and i went to the next destination that's that's probably the one regret i
have in my life now is that i didn't go and see him you know because that would have
that would have been the last time i would have saw him before he passed um [Music]
you know and these things it just teaches you you've got to appreciate
and you've gotta um
you know you don't take anything for granted nothing is guaranteed you know the people you love
be with them as much as you can appreciate them enjoy them
don't get into fights you know don't do things which just wasting time because
one minute they're there and one minute they're gone and then you've got to think about all the things you could have done with them or should have done
with them that you didn't because you know you're you're too busy or you you know i'll see
them again another time you know it's uh it's crazy how the
world works but yeah i appreciate everyone at all times and you know
family is family is number one you know don't let anything ever get in between
that don't take it for granted that's one thing i've learned
you know investing a lot of time in your relationship with rheem absolutely yeah we're on the phone all
the time i've got a million videos of him on my phone my my uh my brother's wife
seb's wife salma she send me videos every day of raheem um
they're coming over to england actually in uh in a month or so and yeah so raheem is is now my son you
know that's that's how i feel um
you know it actually makes me want to have a kid i was never really planning on having a kid until after my career
and i still may not but um
i want raheem to be able to grow up with my son you know i don't want them to be
too far apart um you know me and my brother said we were
you know a year and a half apart so we were very close you know we did everything together um so i want i want raheem to have that
so you know within the next few years we'll uh we'll see what happens
one of the things i couldn't quite ascertain from googling was if you uh if you are in a
Keeping relationships private
relationship or if you're dating you keep all that stuff very private i don't blame you to feel this but i couldn't quite ascertain where you're
at with that um most things said you weren't but is it
a part of your life absolutely yeah one thing i've learned is that
relationships and social media don't mix
um i've just i've seen social media mess up
so many relationships uh that i just you know i decided a long time ago that
whoever i was with uh is not gonna be it's not gonna be a public relationship
my life is public people can see what i'm doing every day i want something that's for me
uh you know and you've got so many girls out there who
you know they're they're just clout chasers you know they they just want they want to say that you know that look
at me look at these pictures we went here we went there um i don't need that in my life you know
i've got enough clout i've got enough attention on me so i
i keep my private life private so much so that i've actually seen comments online saying that i'm gay
you know this guy's never in pictures with girls he's never gotten he's got no girls on his instagram i think he's gay i've seen
that like multiple times and just you know i laugh my ass off whenever i see that but
yeah i just i just don't i don't believe in mixing the two i don't i don't see any
positives from it you know people see something if they see something
if they see people happy some most people yeah that's great but
there's there's a large p percentage of people that if they're seeing something happy they they want to try and make it
unhappy that's what is as crazy as that sounds that's what some people do you
know so uh i'm not gonna let anybody take shots at
or try and muddy my relationship because i've seen it happen before it will you
know and it happened it happens all the time i believe a private life should be private and
that's that's how i've chosen to to keep my relationships it's good to hear i agree
i'm not gay
you talked a bit about um seb there and his approach to like health and fitness i actually looked back through my conversations with him before you came
Boxing and its health implications
and all of our conversations were about health and fitness he'd asked me a few things about social media and some advice there but
did that incident also impact how you viewed the health implications of the sport that you do
because you know you can get one one hit in boxing and it can be it can
cause really bad damage right has that brought it more into the spotlight for you that your the
fragility of your health and you know i hear a lot of boxers talk about not overstaying their welcome
tyson fury this weekend after he won the fight talked about that as well has that is that front of mind for you
when you you think about your career i wouldn't say that what happened with
seb has um no it hasn't hasn't affected how i think
about boxing um you know i've been doing this game i've been in this game for a long time
i've been in fights where you know i've hurt people to the point where they you know have been in a coma i've fought
a a man named nick blackwell years back and you know he
he uh he got taken to hospital he actually died on the way to hospital and he had to revive him with an adrenaline
shot and he was in a coma for two weeks um you know that that was national news
um you know those types of instance of incidents are what
really put things into perspective and make you think about what you're doing and
the risks and the implications as a youngster you don't think about it you know when something like that
happens then you do think about it and you and you think about even more as you get older because as you get older
especially in boxing you you're affected more by the punishment
you take i feel like when i was young it's like i could do anything and i never get hurt
you know at 32 you know you pick up sick little injuries and
you know you the shots you take you feel them that little bit more than you used to
you start forgetting things you know um do you think that's correlated that
forgetting things so what you'd forget like a name or something and you'd yeah and you'd like
my recall is is a lot worse than it used to be so
you know in my 20s um if i couldn't remember something i'd sit there
and within five seconds i get it you know you do that thing when you think about it oh yeah yeah
now it's ten minutes
you know i i it's it's it's really embarrassing to say but
i forgot the name of somebody one time it took me a week
every day sitting there like throughout the day whenever i would remember what was the name what was the
name and then a week later bang just came to me i just i couldn't i was just nuts you
know because now now i force myself to remember
because it's like you're training your brain it's called recall so i'll i'll force myself if i'm if i
you know i could easily just go on my phone and what was the name again google oh yeah that was it
but now i now i force myself to pull it out of my mind um and that there was one particular
name and it took me a whole week before it just snapped back do you have recall apps on your phone i
read that somewhere that you had like a an app on your phone to help you train so i have an app now it's called um
elevate and it's basically going to the gym but for your brain
you know so i've got here so you've got like spelling recall eloquence precision
um you know you have it's games it's games that you play you know vocabulary
uh math equations you know just little games to play each day and it just keeps your mind working
your mind your brain is like a muscle you know if you keep using it the more you use it the better it gets right the stronger it gets and i think it's
important you know especially because as you get older you you know i do i know i notice it you know i'll i'll
go into a room and i'll put my phone down somewhere and then i'll walk off and then i'll
and i'll walk around the room looking for the bloody phone it's you know and it's like i'm think it
shouldn't this should not be happening um [Music] is that from
getting hit in the head i don't know is it just i'm getting no i don't know um sounds like me to be honest and i
don't get hit in the head i don't drink you know you know i got i got friends they drink every night
you know and they're very smart guys you know they're in business they're in economics they're you know they
they're in tech they but they drink
a lot sometimes so it's like and i feel like you know drinking kills brain cells right
just like a punch would but they seem to be okay i don't know so maybe maybe that maybe that impact is is
just it's just different i don't know i am so excited to announce our new sponsor for this podcast and that is
blue jeans by verizon for any of you that aren't already familiar with blue jeans they are a video conferencing and
collaboration tool who offer an immersive communication experience that drives pretty unparalleled employee and
customer engagement experiences me and all of my teams across all of my portfolio companies switched over to
blue jeans a couple of months ago and we have not looked back the best thing for us has been the totally frictionless
experience no glitching no sound issues no delays or any of those things that usually make virtual meetings really
really frustrating we use blue jeans anywhere on any device at any time and it's perfect for my small businesses
that just have 10 or 20 people to some of my bigger businesses that have hundreds of people i'm a big fan as you
can probably tell so i've been quite excited for for some time to announce this partnership and in the coming weeks
i'll explain the features and really why it's perfect for you if you haven't considered using or switching over to
blue jeans yet but if you can't wait head over to bluejeans.com to learn more honestly it's been one of the real sort
of game changers in my business we talked about feelings earlier
Anxiety & online trolls
right um and how there's been a lot of sort of generational changes around men
expressing their feelings and one of the big changes i think i've seen in the last 10 years from 10 years ago when i was well for 19 to now is
this topic of mental health and men and i think it's really been pushed to the forefront because the stats around
mental health in our country you know you've heard them we've all heard them that the biggest killer of men under the age of 45 is themselves
and a lot of people point and go well why is that a lot of the mental health charities cite that men don't express themselves enough they're not emotional
they don't talk and we've had all the campaigns about talking and um those kinds of things have you ever
experienced anxiety or depression or any sort of mental health um
ailment that's one thing that i do thank god for is that i've never experienced any of
that um
it's hard for me to relate to uh hearing about people with depression
and anxiety like i've just never experienced anything like that um i know it's a
thing um [Music] but i'm i'm just an extremely happy and
content person and i'm not saying that to you know pick myself up that's just how i am it's like it doesn't matter
what happens i'll find the bright side or
if there's something bad going on in my life i'm i'm able to just cut it off
and move on deal with it to the to where it stops
being an issue um i've i've never been the type of person that will let something affect me
um you know from day one in my career i've had i've been i've been a target
i get a serious amount of [ __ ] online to this day
uh haters doubters non-believers i have like a whole army dedicated to
just sticking it to me on a daily basis online it's unbelievable um
and the funny thing is if i walk out into the street it's pictures it's autographs it's love
none of these guys are around why is that i you know i i got it at the beginning
well actually i didn't get it at the beginning it really got to me because you know i'm young i'm coming into the
game i'm trying to be the you know trying to do the best i can and i've got people constantly coming at
me oh you think you're you're old man you're a copycat you'll never be as good as him uh you're a wannabe
you know and when i when i saw when i first started experiencing this uh this hatred and this um
you know this trolling it did affect me um
i didn't get depressed because i'm not that type of person but angry
you know why are these people saying these things what what have i done to them um i couldn't understand it you know
maybe that is why i had for so many years that kind of that stone wall when i was taking
pictures of doing interviews because i'd seen so much
so much negativity online you know um but then after a while
i i don't know it just it just switched one day and i was just like
why am i getting upset why am i getting pissed off with these random guys i don't i know what it was some guy
wrote something uh i think on my facebook i think i just had a fight and he said um
terrible performance you're an embarrassment to your family name i hope you get knocked out in your next
fight you scumbag right i'm i'm a 22 year old kid
i've got some and you know i'm looking i'm like jesus like you know it's just nuts
i clicked on his profile i was like i've got to see who said this i mean who is this guy he must
be some amazing guy to be saying this to me and uh
you know it was this fat bloated
just nobody you and he was sitting on his couch with a with a beer that was his profile picture and he ended and he
had his cat next to him and he was in shorts and like a wife beer um or what you guys don't say wifi
that's my american thing coming out uh tank top um and i was like hold on this is the guy
that just called me a scumbag i'm letting this guy
affect my day nah nah this has got to stop
and from that day on i just realized it's not it's not even me it's they're unhappy with themselves they're
not happy with me you know the people that are trolling you know they've got whatever they've
got going on in their lives they're upset they're unhappy they and they're projecting that onto
other people who are who they see as doing them doing well for themselves and they you know oh he's
look at him he's you know he's got all that and you know let me see if i can bring him down you know i'm upset so let me see if i can make him upset like
that sounds crazy to me to do that but that's what i've come to understand that some people do
you know they're unhappy so they want to make other people unhappy with them as soon as i realized that
i i never i never worried about trolling or bad comments again i actually and now i actually enjoy them you also must know
that it's profitable for you absolutely mayweather taught us that absolutely yeah i mean in in boxing
that's another that's another thing which made me stop worrying about it because i knew
after a while i started i started seeing these trolls at my fights
you know i'd be walking to the ring you're gonna get knocked out what are we
i'd hear all this stuff walking to the ring right and i thought hold on a second
that guy bought a ticket he paid to be there to to shout at me as
i walked past and i'm you know i'm getting a percentage of that ticket
what am i upset about all right he shouted at me but i've just made some money off the guy
so then then i understood right you have to be a villain
or you have to be a a hero in the sport of boxing love or hate you can't be in the middle
i have a lot of fans and i have a lot of haters both buy their tickets
both buy their pay-per-view subscription to watch on tv
both get online and talk and build the profile
the guys that are in the middle they're the guys who don't do well because when you're neutral in the spot of
boxing people don't tune in they don't talk they're not interested it doesn't matter how good of a fight you are if
you're not a character that can inspire emotion whether good or bad
then on a saturday night when you get into the ring you know the people will be sitting
there when they get off work or wherever they are oh yeah he's fighting tonight but
there's this really hot girl and she's going to be at this club yeah i'm going to go to the club i'll
watch the replay or i'll just i'll find out what happened the next day yeah i don't need to that's what happens when you're neutral
or when people aren't really that interested if they hate you forget the forget the girl in the club
i'm going to that fight to see him get knocked out let's go let's go
forget everything else and if they love you forget the girl in the club i want to be there when he wins
those are the guys love and hate that will tune in that will watch you every fight that will talk about you
so that's one thing i learned early on you have to be you you have to be a character you have to be something that people can either get behind or get
against and that's very much i feel what i am um at the beginning most people were
against me because they saw me as a gimmick as somebody was just trying to make a quick
buck use my name to get a better profile have a few fights and then probably go
on love island or big brother or whatever it is and you know whatever but then obviously as the years went by
win after win after win a lot of the haters turned into fans
um there's still a lot of haters left but you know we're working our way to making
them into fans uh slowly but surely quick one we bring in eight people a
month to watch these conversations live here in the studio when we're here in the uk and when we're in la if you want
to be one of those people all you've got to do is hit subscribe do you feel like your career is complete
What’s next for you
and if the answer is no what do you think is required in terms of your boxing career
with the knowledge that as you said before we started that there is a window of time where you you get to do this and you get to do at the highest level
what is required if the answer is no to make you feel that your your career was complete
it's an absolute no um i've had a lot of great fights i've had
a lot of great wins but um there's still so much more left you know
there's still so many more big fights out there for me to to take part in and to win
um you know i want to capture these world titles you know i've been a world champion at
super middleweight i'm back down at middleweight now um and you know the the
you know the map is wide open there's there's a lot of great fighters and they have belts and i i can get in with these guys and i can beat these guys
um you know boxing you do have a short window
but i live my life uh correctly i live the boxing lifestyle
boxing is not just a sport it is a lifestyle um you know outside of a fight camp
i'm not drinking i'm not doing drugs uh i'm not overeating and blowing up in
weight which so many fighters do and then they have to spend weeks or months cutting that weight back off to
make whatever weight they're going to be at on fight night i don't do any of that i stay in the gym
i stay dedicated i stay healthy i stay responsible
so that being said i will be able to fight until
i will be able to fight effectively and i would say until i'm 37 38 39 years old
um i'm 32 now you know my father retired at they too
i'm so i'm retirement isn't even close to what i'm thinking about
you know i am financially stable but there's still so much more money out
there to be made there's still so much more accolades out there to collect
um and i still have a lot left in the tank so to answer your question no my career is not
um complete far from it even even though i've had 34 fights you know
more fights than a lot of fighters have had and 32 wins is still not complete there's still so much more i'm gonna do
and the next few years are the money years and they are the years where i need to fight the best
beat the best and really cement my legacy
we have a closing tradition on this podcast where the last guest asks the next guest a question they never know who they're writing it for
Our last guest’s question
they said hello which is the first time anyone said hello but hello i was wondering
what you believe happiness is and how it can be achieved
um well as i said before i'm an extremely happy person i may not look it at times
but i'm very content um i don't get angry i don't shout i don't
put other people down i don't wish bad on other people um if someone's successful if someone's
doing better than me i look up to that i praise that i respect that
you know other people they see people succeeding
or doing better than them and they think oh you know i wish he would trip up
you know why has he got all that why is why is she doing that and i can't do it don't be like that
you can never be happy if you're constantly comparing yourself to other people and
you know not wanting the best for everybody including yourself
you know it's a mirror life's a mirror you know whatever you're projecting is is
projected back to you if you if if you're negative that's what your life is going to be
and that's whether it's thoughts so that's whether it's tweets that's whether it's what you're saying to people
everything comes back around you know so happiness is is positivity
is being a good person is being a genuine person
um you know don't lie to people
if if you think something's wrong say it you know if you if you think that
somebody's doing something wrong or that they're on the wrong path help them
because you're helping yourself you know
be positive that's the key to happiness chris thank you for doing this it's been a huge honor and i can't wait to see
what you do over the next couple of years in your money years in and outside of the ring
and i thank you for giving me the opportunity because yeah there's not a lot of people that that do get to see
this side of me you know all they see is the big bad guy in the ring he's throwing punches you know
i don't do a lot of interviews like this so yeah i appreciate you uh putting me on here and hopefully the fans get to see a
different side i had a few words to say about one of my sponsors on this podcast my girlfriend came upstairs yesterday when i was
having a shower and she said to me that she tried the heel protein shake which lives on my fridge over there and she said it's amazing low calories you get
your 20 odd grams of protein you get your 26 vitamins and minerals and it's nutritionally complete in the protein
space there's lots of things but it's hard to find something that is nice especially when consumed just with water
and that is nutritionally complete the salted caramel one if you put some ice cubes in it and you put it in a blender
and you try it is as good as pretty much any milkshake on the market just mixed with water it's been a game changer for
me because i'm trying to drop my calorie intake and i'm trying to be a little bit more healthy with my diet so this is
where heel fits in my life thank you for making a product that i actually like as you might know crafted are one of the
sponsors of this podcast and crafted are a jewelry brand and they make really meaningful pieces of jewelry and this
piece by crafted when i put it on for me it represents courage it represents ambition it represents being calm and
loving and respectful and nurturing while also being the antithesis of that seemingly the antithesis of that which
is um sometimes a little bit aggressive with my goals and determined and courageous and brave the really
wonderful thing about crafted jewelry is it's super affordable it looks amazing the pieces hold tremendous meaning and
they are really well made
