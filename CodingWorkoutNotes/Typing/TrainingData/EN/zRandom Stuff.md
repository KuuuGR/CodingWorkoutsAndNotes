Transcription:

I don't know about you guys but I
absolutely cannot put Persona 3 reload
down playing it between the PC version
and on my steam deck I've already sunken
in quite a few hours into the game what
they've managed to do by giving Persona
3 a Fresh coat of new paint all while
staying true to the original story and
characters has made this a truly
exceptional game Atlas has outdone
themselves with this one this has led
Atlas to a major Milestone Persona 3
reload has managed to sell 1 million
copies in its first week that makes it
not only the fastest selling title in
the Persona series it also makes it the
fastest selling Atlas title ever mind
you this is with the game being on PC
and Xbox game pass meaning that for
millions of users there was going to be
no additional cost to purchase Persona 3
reload and it managed to hit that
Milestone regardless of all of that
people are still willing to pay money
for this on PS5 and steam and the fact
that this game is selling even faster
than Persona 5 all of this is to say
that Persona 3 reload has been a massive
success for Atlas And so naturally
people are curious about the possibility
of even more Persona remakes and this is
something that we have discussed in
previous videos with many people hopeful
for remakes of persona 1 two duology and
some even hopeful for a remake of
Persona 4 of course while I wouldn't
mind seeing Persona 4 Golden getting a
remake and looking and playing like
Persona 3 reload of all the Persona
games that do need a remake it is
probably the one that needs at the least
however despite this it's still ranked
among the most desired remakes for Atlas
the do right next to Persona 3 and two
duology well today we have some news
from some very reliable sources with
regards to where the future of persona
remakes is going this is some news that
was both surprising and unsurprising to
me so if you love Persona you are going
to want to hit that subscribe button
because this channel gives you every bit
of persona news that the internet has to
offer and today it has quite a bit to
offer when it comes to Persona 2 and
Persona 4 remakes this rumor yet again
comes from incredibly reliable leaker
Midori who has a pretty much 100% track
record in fact she is so accurate and so
good she's predicted things years in
advance that it's honestly a mystery to
me how Sega and Atlas haven't really
shut her down yet she has continued to
be a highly credible source of
information however even with that being
said because this is not official
information I have to hit you with the
rumor warning all rumors should be
assumed to be entirely false assume that
everything in this video is a lie and no
one is telling you the truth rumors are
reported purely for the fun of
speculation and even though this Source
has been credible in the past until this
information has been confirmed by Sega
and Atlas you should regard all of it as
false that being said recently on
Twitter Midori was asked about the
potential of P2 and P4 remakes the
thread started with Midori simply saying
Ohio which is good morning in Japanese
followed by someone asking Midori any
rumors or leaks about Persona 4 remake
another person following up n how about
rumors about Persona 2 remake Midori
replying both exist at Atlas she Then
followed up a day later saying np12 not
all will be like reload style and an
atlas PS2 game will get a remaster
version the part of that statement that
was really interesting to me was not all
will be like reload style it seems that
there's a few ways that you can read
this the first being is that not all of
these will be remakes some of these
might actually just be remasters
arbitrarily P1 or P2 may not get the
latest Persona visual style that is to
say they might be more small scale
remakes the other way to interpret this
is that they won't be modernizing the
gameplay style and staying true to what
the original games were meaning that
ultimately they'll still be remakes but
they won't really resemble What P3
reload is shout out to one of my Twitter
mutuals Skyraider G7 who also suggested
another possibility that potentially
they'll base it off of persona 6 instead
of reload in particular he suggest
because the Persona seene talks about
the possibility of them moving away from
the calendar system now first personally
I'm a big calendar system nerd and I
don't want them to move away from the
calendar system however P1 and P2 duy do
not have calendar systems so if they
ever did come up with a system that was
free of it and was also modern it would
totally make sense for one and two to be
remade in that style unfortunately we're
left to speculate on this because Midori
hasn't really clarified yet she was
asked though if Shin Mami tin was dead
and she replied no there's a Netflix
game coming and a title connected to smt
5 and a a remaster title so if Persona
isn't your thing and you're more of a
megatin fan there is content coming your
way Persona smt and their latest pillar
metaphor Atlas fans have a lot to look
forward to now it's also important to
discuss some rumors that turned out to
be fake regarding these remakes
unfortunately a leaker that goes by the
name I'm a Hero 2 has been off base
quite a few times now he was on reset
era claiming that P2 would be a remaster
np4 would be a full remake with his new
account name being had on the Block he
was also banned from reset era so it's
worth noting that this rumor was
probably false and he was more than
likely just Mara riding Midori again I
always recommend not trusting any leaker
no matter who they are that being said
midori's track record has been pretty
perfect this being said it would be
hilariously just like Atlas to remake
Persona 4 and Just remaster or Persona 2
now obviously if I had to choose between
these two I would choose Persona 2 to
get a remake it's the older game it's
the least accessible and it would
benefit the most by far from a full
remake however as you guys may have
noticed games that need remakes and
games that would highly benefit from
remakes are not necessarily the remakes
that are chosen to happen remakes are in
fact a popularity contest and what could
be more popular than Persona 4 atlas's f
favorite cow to milk it's sentimental
for them it was their first cow they
realized they could get that much milk
out of this of course also begs the
question of the release order of these
with them looking to do remakes of
persona 1 2 and four after the release
of three do you go back and start with
one do you go forward with four and then
work your way backwards to two and one
there's several ways in which they could
approach it now personally speaking if I
were to get my own vote on this I would
rather see them do persona to next the
reason that Persona 4 would come last is
because it would benefit the most by
being done the latest it still feels too
early for Persona 4 to be remade the
title still plays exceptionally well for
the most part it would be a remake that
is purely focused on Graphics as I still
find that the game is accessible in
almost all ways visually speaking of
course though it is nowhere near Persona
3 reload or Persona 5 and yes seeing
enaba in the cast to P4 red done in the
same style as reload would be absolutely
fantastic but you never know right I
thought that re4 didn't really need a
remake truthfully it kind of didn't but
that didn't stop re4 remake from also
being an incredible game on its own
right A lot of times even when these
remakes are pretty unnecessary the
Remake itself is still a great game but
please let me know your thoughts below
which Persona game should be the next
remake Persona one or two or do you
really want them to hop just straight to
Persona 4 and I'll see you all in the
next video

Transcription:

Transkrypcja
we are this close to the release of
Final Fantasy 7 rebirth the game is
coming this month it is so hard to
believe but guys we are almost there it
has been nearly 4 years since the launch
of the first game and it's hard to
believe that time has just flown by with
that being said a lot of people are
worried about spoilers and stuff like
that I want to clarify that there are no
spoilers in this video and going forward
all spoilers and anything else that
comes out about the game will be clearly
marked on every video just as I've done
before with every major Final Fantasy
you guys have been waiting for this way
too long to get spoiled on something
casual so we will be extremely careful
about it going forward so the first bit
of major news here is that Final Fantasy
7 rebirth is going to be adding a
feature that so many of you have been
asking for for a long time this is even
a mod for the original game because
that's how long people have wanted it
thanks to geni here for posting it from
IG and China hamaguchi says that after
clearing the game and unlocking chapter
select in ff7 rebirth you will then be
allowed to remove cloud from the party
and create your own three member team
replay the chapters this means that
after you've cleared the chapter you are
no longer confined to Cloud you'll be
able to do your party configuration
however you want to and this is
something that is awesome part of the
reason that I really like this is that
it's going to allow you to experiment
with the game play in a way you've never
done before different party
configurations are going to be entirely
valid meaning that the way people are
going to approach certain bosses and
stuff it's going to add a layer to the
game play that wasn't there before you
know if you would have asked me before
that if I wanted a cloutless party in
this game I would have said no initially
purely on the fact that I think that you
need Cloud on that first playthrough he
is the main character in playing as him
at almost all times is very essential
for this narrative however whenever
you're doing chapter select after you've
already cleared it I don't think it's as
as necessary so this is the perfect
balance between Both Worlds allowing you
to experience the narrative intent
behind the game as well as go back
through it and play it how you want to
the next excerpt comes from Shinra
archaeology Department with their Source
being for gamer. net Noma had this to
say ff7 rebirth creative director Noma
is happy but a little anxious about how
rebirths huge Den open world has raised
the bar for part three of the Remake
Trilogy indeed a Final Fantasy 7 rebirth
is finally returning the FF series back
to the open world for the first time
since Final Fantasy 15 it is good to be
back and I'm willing to bet this game is
going to do it even better the many
games ins side content that they've
shown off the relationship system
between characters this is a game that
is incredibly dense with content it's
something that's perfect for an open
world in fact it has so much content and
it it kind of makes the first remake
game look like a beta test in some ways
of course with that being said people
are going to expect part three to
escalate things even further people will
expect to fly the high wind fight the
weapons and do a ton more content not to
mention they'll have to add on to
existing mini gamess as well as make new
ones there is a lot of challenges ahead
for them with part three however
considering they'll be able to reuse
much of the open world's assets I
imagine that part three might be a
little bit faster to make than part two
at least that's just my theory of course
considering that they have to add
incredible amount of content to part
three it may not save them all that much
time of course when we do talk about the
dense open world of Final Fantasy 7
rebirth one notable location that has
been built up since the first part of
remake is wuai here is what they've had
to say about wuai Final Fantasy 7
rebirth creative director Noma says that
moving wuai ahead was only partially to
balance out the trilogy's content
another reason is that unlike OG wuai
now has a certain level of milit milary
power to oppose Shinra and can't be
portrayed as cursy as it first was ruai
is going to be incredibly important to
the Final Fantasy 7 remake Trilogy it's
been teased and built up to in the first
game it's probably going to be built up
to in rebirth as well it's going to be a
huge climax of the story it's also a
location that I cannot wait to see in
this incredible visual Fidelity I mean
just think about how good calm looks
they are probably going to go all out
with wuai and with it being such a major
essential location we're going to want
them to take their time and do that in
part three so that they can really focus
on it so this is something where I'm
incredibly excited to see where it goes
and ultimately it's something that
excites me the most about the future of
the trilogy listen up Vincent Valentine
fans CU we got something good for you
today amaguchi says that despite not
being playable Vincent will have his own
original quest in Final Fantasy 7
rebirth where we'll learn more about his
background in character I feel that fans
of Vincent will find it quite fulfilling
this comes from noisy pixel.net so it is
unfortunate that Sid and Vincent will
not be playable in rebirth they are
being saved for part three of the Final
Fantasy 7 remake Trilogy it is
unfortunate that we're only going to get
to play as them in one game and from the
looks of it we're not going to have an
intermission type DLC for Vincent I
don't think they've confirmed that they
don't want to stop the team with more
DLC they want to go straight ahead head
to the next part which is something that
I really agree with so it is great
however that despite us not being able
to play as Vincent or SID in this game
we're still going to intimately get to
know those characters and they're still
going to be a large part of the story
now this is where we get into some
really interesting territory Shinra
archaeology Department also reports this
one from for gamer. net saying when
asked if Final Fantasy 7 rebirth will
include any content that will surprise
even OG veterans creative director Noma
responds that he can't go into detail
without giving hints yes he thinks that
aside from its ending part one will
unfold in a way that OG players could
predict he also says that the third and
final part of the Remake project will
also develop in such a way as to wrap up
the story as a whole in this sense it is
Final Fantasy 7 rebirth that will serve
as the climax of the story it is good to
hear some confirmation I believe that
Final Fantasy 7 Trilogy will be a thing
that wraps up the entire Final Fantasy 7
story that is the way that I am reading
this it still doesn't mean that it's
necessarily the end of all Final Fantasy
7 content CU Anytime Square needs some
money you better believe they're going
to dig up ff7 but my greatest hope is
that this will finally close the chapter
on Final Fantasy 7 this will be the end
of the story and there won't really be
much of a need to tell anything else
about it ff7 will finally be a chapter
in your life that you can close with
finality and satisfaction then we have
some controversy surrounding the game
and how the team feels about it this
comes from Korean publication inven here
is what they've had to say Final Fantasy
7 rebirth producer kitas says that even
within the development team there was
some expectation that Final Fantasy 7
remakes ending would cause controversy
with much player speculation and
opinions to a certain degree things are
proceeding just as intended in this
regard however he assures players that
the Remake project is based around
respecting the original story not
destroying it therefore they plan to
develop the story by rearranging
important elements like Zach's death in
a way that respects the OG creates a
sense of freshness you could read into
this about a 100 million ways it's also
surprising to know that even the
development team thought there was going
to be quite a bit of controversy around
the ending and even more so they planned
for exactly that they are going to get
their wish because I'm sure with all the
controversy that part one's ending is
caused part two's ending will probably
go even further than that the mystery of
Zach the consequences of the Arbiters
the rejoining of Worlds and whatever
seph rro has planned now there's a lot
of new elements admittedly it's quite
hard for me to reconcile those new
elements with what happened in the
original story I mean there is literally
two worlds and sephra is trying to merge
them together as far as how this is
going to stay on track with the original
story and how it's still going to be
comparable to it it all seems pretty
wild but my greatest hope is that it
doesn't just feel like they're telling
Final Fantasy 7 just with a bunch of
unfitting moments shoved in hopefully
they will get the D I say Synergy
between this new stuff and the old stuff
but these are just my hopes for Final
Fantasy 7 rebirth please let me know
your thoughts in the comments below and
I will see you all in the next video

Transcription: 

How I burned $5000 on OpenAI
1 of December during a normal Friday
afternoon we receive email from open AI
telling us that we reached API usage
limit of $5,000 for this month but that
Friday was 1st of December which is the
beginning of the month that means we
burn $5,000 USD in a single Friday
afternoon and open AI bills that is not
normal usage pattern that we have and
when we look into details we start
understanding why so I was building an
autonomous sales agent where I can
simply give a list of clients it can
automatically research Outreach and even
auto reply and follow up when the person
respond back I actually made a video
talking about inbox agents as well which
is very similar concept that letting an
agent to take over your email inbox and
automatically reply so very similar
concept but this one we're building is a
lot more powerful agent will do a huge
amount of research about this
perspective from Google LinkedIn Apollo
web scraping and a few other different
data source so the Outreach and respond
will be hyper personalized with much
much better quality so there are some
cost of running such sales agent but it
is not a lot the problem occurred when I
accidentally get one sales agent to
outreach another sales agent who can
also Outreach and respond back and this
was a trigger for that massive bill for
the single afternoon cuz this two agents
just start talking with each other back
and forth and this just creates such a
infinite Loof that lead to this massive
open AI that we receive just for a
single afternoon previously we always
joke about the scenario what if we have
all those different agents just debating
and competing with each other this was
the first time I see in real world that
it happened and it really hurts very
quickly we start putting together
practice and boundaries to Monitor and
alert all those different larage model
usage so those type situation should
never happen again but on the other hand
this also just became a huge reminder
for myself that if you are building a AI
product you have this large language
model cost that will continuously grow
as your usage and user grow it is a new
type of cost that traditional software
company does really need to care but as
AI startup you have to understand that
part of cost properly and this also
introduced a lot of nuance for example
people already get used to those type of
subscription based pricing model where
they charge $99 per month for unlimited
usage but for an AI startup that has
large lar model cost factor in it the
pricing strategy became a lot harder
because it cost fluctuated with usage
and it was hard to predict what kind of
usage patterns your user would have at
the beginning and I personally learned
it in another side project I did I don't
know if you remember but mid last year
My experience with AI Girlfriend Project
2023 one of the hottest AI starup
segment is AI girlfriend or AI companion
a Allstar from an influencer called
Karen who made a digital version of
herself in a tegram boss and here's a
quick damble hey there John it it's
lovely to meet you I just spent the
morning grabbing brunch at the flowering
Tree Cafe in West Hollywood it was
absolutely amazing what are you up to
today hey there yeah I've just been
working all day but trying to get some
relaxation in this evening that sounds
really nice have you tried doing some
yoga or meditation for relaxation it's a
great way to unwind and clear your mind
for this evening maybe we can plan a
virtual dinner date or watch a movie
together what do you
think so this was launched May 2023
where they charge $1 per minute for this
voice chat and claim to get more than
70,000 sales in just one week this got
me interesed because the whole project
feels very straightforward to build with
all the powerful models we have we can
very quickly build out a AI companion
that can also talk in Voice by
connecting different models together
with speech to text launch Larn model
and text to speech so I launched a
copycat version very quickly and someone
who has been working SASS and software
company before it feels obvious to me
that okay let's just offer free Tri let
anyone to be able to speak and I just
pick up random number 60 seconds free
voice chat for everyone but again back
then I didn't consider anything for
those Moto cost and that made this
product almost hard to break even so the
cost of free trial look something like
this on average the 60 second voice chat
will be around 500 to 1,000 characters
which turning into large language model
and tax to speech cost is roughly 12
cents per new user and with this cost if
I have 1,000 signups it release to
roughly $126 for the total cost and if I
get 1% conversion from free to paid for
each user I have to earn at least $12.6
to break it even with model cost which
is not trivial for a consumer facing
product so even though Back Then There
Were new user coming every day the
project didn't seem to generate good
amount profit and margin so I just shut
down that project fairly quickly but
there were project that became extremely
successful in this AI companion space
where they didn't offer any tax to
speech model with just pure tax which
means the model cost was significantly
lower and that allows them to figure out
a much more flexible business model and
F the capital back on product
development and marketing and through
those different project I start
realizing how important it is for AI
stop to be aware and do good calculation
of the large Lage model cost it is an
important skill to balance between the
cost as well as the performance and user
experience so this has got me really
interesting in this topic what kind of
levers we can pull to reduce large
larage model cost and ideally also
maintain the performance
so I started doing some research and
experimentation into this and the result
is pricing good with just one afternoon
wor of optimization we were able to
reduce the cost of large Lage model for
35% for the sales agent we were building
and with a bit more time I'm pretty
confident that it can be dropped even 50
or 60% that's the immediate 30 to 50%
additional profit that the company can
capture or reduce for the user I want to
share with you what I learned so that
you can try it for your own AI
application as well so let's get it but
HubSpot AI For Markter
before I dive into it the best way to
reduce large L model application cost is
not only just technical knowhow but also
the deep understanding of the business
workflow so that you know what steps and
data are absolutely necessary recently I
was trying to learn how does marketing
team is actually adopting Ai and what
does the workflow look like CU I think
marketing has huge opportunity for AI
Automation St and hopspot Academy just
released a new free course called AI for
marketers which help me a lot to
understand how does worldclass marketers
are think about and adopting AI in their
real workflow they give detailed example
about how the top marketer are using AI
to analyze and collect wide range of
data from transactional data social
media activity product usage as well as
CRM data to provide hyper personal
experience for your customer from
website and content personalization at
scale to even recommendation Dynamic
pricing and Target ads to really drive
the endtoend customer experience and
even use AI to do predictive modeling to
get realtime actionable customer
insights back from case study from Real
World top tier marketers so it was
extremely useful for me to really
understand the actual workflow for
marketers so I definitely recommend you
to go check out if you're building AI
Parise for marketers you can click on

back to the actual tactics to reduce the
large dange model cost at high level
How to Reduce LLM Cost
there are two ways you can reduce the
cost for lar model once you find a
smarter way to choose the right model to
use for different tasks and second is
reduce amount token either sent to or
generated by large Man model I'll talk
through some good practice for both
categories with examples firstly Change
Model this might sound obvious but what
you might not realize is how the calls
between different models dramatically
different which enable us to do some
Creative Solutions for example if you
compare the cost between GPT 4 which is
the most powerful but also most
expensive model with with mistro 7B
model gbd4 is almost 200 times more
expensive than mistro to quantify it a
bit more that basic means the cost for
GPT 4 to generate just one paragraph is
same cost to generate the whole book for
mistro 7B model that's why mix show is
so popular because they just focus on
squeezing performance from small model
which reduce cost by multiple magnitude
and also enable us deploy AI in our
laptop or even mobile phones so one
strategy we can use here is that you can
use powerful model first to launch your
product start collecting training data
Method 1 - Finetune
to find two smaller model for specific
tasks for example at the beginning you
can use the most powerful model which is
not GPT 4 Turbo but GPT 432k you use
this model to build your initial product
and from early users you can save the
result GPT for 32k generated then use
that to find tun a smaller model like
mitro or Lama 2 which can achieve
actually comparable results in this
method can almost guaranteed to deliver
more than 98% of cost saving that's why
when you launch the product making sure
you have Max them to actually save all
the results it generated and provide
ways for your user to Mark result as
good and bad this will allow you to do
the fine tuning later and Achieve huge
cost saving for the large dange model
cost the limitation of this method is
also very clear it only works for
scenario where you have very specialized
tasks for example extract data from text
invoice or classify Financial use but if
you're a app is more general purpose
like a chat B then when a user asks a
question that is not contained within
your training data then the result from
this fine tune model is going to be much
worse than those powerful model like
gbd4 that's why there also smart people
that explore most sophisticated
solutions for example large language
model cascate so the concept is simple
if the cost between big model and small
Method 2 - Cascade
model is so dramatically different what
if we actually have Cascade of model
usage chain so when user ask a question
you can use cheap small model like mro
or gptj to try to answer the question
first if the confidence score is
actually High then accept answer but if
not then it pass on to the next model
repeat this process multiple time and
only use gbd4 for very complicated
questions so this me really leverage
fact that model price are dramatically
different the cost of running GPD full
ones can enable smaller model to run 100
times more so even though it has more
large energ mod call the total cost will
still be cheaper but obviously this is
not optim we should be able to know a
question in advance whether it is
complex question or a simple question
this is where the thir method large
Method 3 - LLM Router
langage model router is shiny the
concept here is it use cheaper model to
just do the classification of whether it
is simple request like high which can be
probably handled by smaller model like
mro or it is a complex Mass question
that should be handled by powerful model
like gbd4 theoretically it can even
enable better performance too because if
we have a list of high performing
specialized models model we can actually
router different request to different
expert models this concept was brought
up by hugging face last year where they
introduced huging GPT it's basically use
large language model as a controller to
break down the user question into
subtask and dedicate to different model
to solve problem together so if the user
has a question read the image example.
jpg for me which is invoice the huging
GB can actually break that down into
subtasks like image to text model text
to speech model and produ a final
results based on that and there are also
company commercialize those Solutions
specifically focus on cost and
performance like Martian and neutral AI
for example this a comparison between
gp4 versus Martian large Lage model
router for generating some code for the
Martian large Lage model router it took
about 7.8 seconds and less than
0.06 cents while the gbt 4 is still
running after 30 seconds and eventually
give us results after 38 seconds cost
2.3 cents which is which is 38 Times
Higher cost than the router one and
here's another example from neutrino
where they have playground to Showcase
how does this large Lage model router
work behind the scenes so if I give a
request like hi it will use GPT 3.5
turbo to generate response but if I ask
math question what is 93 multip by
3.46 then it will switch to gbd4 to
generate this response for better
accuracy and you can actually create a
customer router by selecting different
models that you want to use un for at
the moment it does seem to support
custom F tune model I think what would
be really cool is which someone build a
open source router lar L model and
anyone can just bring their fine tuna
model in for the best performance so
large language model router is
definitely interesting thing you should
try to see if it fits your use case and
last but not least team at autogen also
Method 4 - Multi-Agent
experiment a method basically you can
set up multiple different agents One
agent with gp4 model another agent with
cheaper model like 3.5 turbo or it will
choose a cheaper model to comp complete
task first but if it fail it will invoke
the next agent but every time it succeed
it will save the result to their
database so the next time when new
question come in it can pull a rant
example of how similar problems were
solved before from their database and
then both a new question as well as past
example to the cheaper model because it
was given examples even cheaper model
can achieve comparable results and from
their broad post for different tasks
like ask for weather and generate stock
chart most time those multi agent setup
only take 20% of the cost compared with
GPT 4 assistant but can achieve similar
or even better success rate so this
definitely another Innovative solution
that you can try out comment below if
you want to learn more about this
methods we can to make a video deep dive
into this agent architecture if you guys
are interested so those are all the
major method you can use to reduce cost
by smilly changing to different models
some of those method might feel
complicated but one thing I would highly
recommend you to do is just try to swap
your current GPT 4 with GPT 4 Turbo to
see whether you can get similar level of
read outs cuz if this work you can
already achieve 30% cost deduction so
Method 5 - LLMLingua
those are all the method you can use to
reduce large larage model cost by
finding the most suitable model but
that's not only it the huge model
optimization you can do by reduce the
token that would give large L model as
well one method that is pretty
representative is called llm lingua from
Microsoft the core idea here is that
natural language are not effective quite
often The Prompt that would give large
langage model including huge amount of
noise and words that is redundant and
didn't really contribute much to the
final results it generate it's kind of
similar to how human consume information
as well if I read a whole book they're
probably just two or three caps that
matter most and seem thing for many
other scenario for example if large
language model course's task is to
summarize a core transcript or answer
specific questions based on that
interview they're probably huge amount
of content that didn't really contribute
to the final answer but still they are
consuming huge amount of token so the
concept here is again let's use small
model to remove all those unnecessary
token and words so that we only send
necessary and relevant data to high
performance large Lage model to generate
answer and the result is pretty stunning
in the core transcript example that we
just show if we use the normal method
where we pass on the full row material
it will consume roughly 30,000 token and
the answer large L model generated can
even hallucinate as well that's probably
because we are passing on too many
information to large language model this
large language model lingua you can turn
this 30,000 token original content into
just a small paragraph with 100 token in
total which is almost 175 times smaller
and this method can be even used for
chain of s prompting so in this specific
prompt we give large LGE model an
example of how it should sync step by
step and then give a new question to
answer the original result consumed
2,300 tokens but if we adopt a similar
method it can even clean up the sying
process in the example that was given
and only consume roughly a 100 to which
is 20 times smaller and this method even
apply for code completion where it can
use small model to extract only the
relevant part of code so the token
consumption dropped from 21,000 to about
1.6 th000 tokens and surprisingly with
even better accuracy so cleaning the
promp before it stand to expensive model
like GPT 4 is a great way to reduce cost
and we can adopt a similar principle so
Method 6 - Optimise tool input/output
to really optimize the tool input and
output if you're building agents for
example if you're building a research
agent the agent will probably have a
tool to sing website but normally the
roow data returned from the web squer
can include a huge amount of noise and
unnecessary data like skip to main
content or footage so instead of sending
those row information as output of the
tool which would take huge amount of
unnecessary token in the agent memory we
can do similar thing inside this F
function to use a small model to
summarize and extract core information
as the final output which will Mak the
memory a lot more cleaning and probably
easier for the large langage model to
consume as well this a great seg way to
Second optimization that I found really
useful if you're building agents which
is try to optimize the memory of the
Method 7 - Memory Optimisation
agent so due to how large Lun model and
agent works every time when a chat
bottle agent generates a new response it
will take all the past conversation as
the input toen so longer the memory is
the more expensive it will be to
generate the next token the goal here is
how can we get just enough memory for
the agent to have good graphs about what
has been talked about before instead of
sending everything CU at default you
probably are using something called
conversation buffer memory which
basically means it will try to keep
every single word of the past
conversation so the more interaction is
happen between the user and agent the
more token will be consumed eventually
it will hit the token limit that's why
you almost always want to find a smarter
way to handle window memory and the
common alternative is something we call
conversation summary memory what this
means is instead of using conversation
buffer memory which take the whole
conversation history as memory summary
memory will send the chat history to a
large language model and get it generate
a summary about what has been talked
about before so token to be passed on to
agent would be much much smaller it also
means it won't grow infinitely it can be
kept as certain amount of token so it
won't exceed large Lage model contest
window but downside is because it is
doing summary some details can be lost
during the summarization process that's
why the one I always use is something
called summary buffer memory which means
the agent will remember exactly word by
word for the past let's say 200 words
but for the earlier chat history it will
do a summarization so you can still have
a lot of context about the recent things
that the user has been discussed before
but still have a high level
understanding about the passing has been
discussed and there are more different
type of sophisticated agent memory
settings that you can use to really
optimize Jam break had pretty
comprehensive blog post talking about
agent memory optimization I definitely
recommend go check out if you're
interested so those are the methods that
I have been used to bring down the large
Lage model cost significantly but both
mthod require you have a good
understanding and log of how costs will
occur in your current large ler model
app so that you know which part is
optimize that's why observability is
critical for building AI products and
LLM Monitor & Analytics
there are few platform that allow you to
Monitor and log the cost for each large
lar mocol at this point all those
product are kind of similar but I will
take you through a quick example of how
can use one of the most popular one
called L Smiths to monitor where does
the cost occur for your AI agents and
how can you use that to optimize the
cost so L Smith is a platform that
introduced by L chain which will log
every single time when the agent try to
complete a task and for each task
completion it will show you how long
does it take how many token does it
consume as well as detailed breakdown of
the token consumption for every single
large l mocol so that you can use this
to understand where you should be
focusing on for cost optimization I'll
quickly take you through the process of
how to use this information to analyze
Tutorial: Monitor & reduce 75% cost
the cost and a real example of how to
save the cost of This research agent by
more than seven so let's firstly install
lens Smith let's open Visual Studio code
which is where we're going to put
together this research agent and set up
monitoring I click on the button at top
right corner to open Terminal the first
thing you want to do is do pip install
dasu engine open AI this package will
include lens Smith SDK the next thing is
we want to import a list of different
environment variables so that we can
connect with lens Smith so let's go back
to visual studio code I create a new
file called EMV inside this EMV file
this is where we Define list of
different variables you're putting
laning tracing B2 and laning endpoint
exactly as I have here and before
launching API key and project then you
need to create account on LM click on
this API key button at B mod left corner
create a new API key and paste in here
and for lunching project you can just
give a name of any project that you're
running now in my case could be
researcher agent you can also just
command this out and all the result will
be loged under default project and in
the end putting the open AI API key as
well the next thing is we want to set up
the research agent as well as tracking
so I create a new file called app.py if
you're using lanching to build your
agent there's no additional things or
library that you need to import as long
as you set up the lanching API key and
the project name in the Dov file it will
be automatically locked but if you're
not using Lan chain you can still use l
Smith to lock all this information by
import a library called traceable from L
Smith and all you need to do just wrap
the function that you want to track
under this add traceble and you can
Define different round type it could be
chain or it can be tool and and here I
just simply call open Ai and get a
response back so I will try to run my
chain who is Sam altimate and save this
or click on Terminal Pyon nonl chain. py
if I go back to lens Smith you can see
there's a new project called research
agent show up and inside here it lcks
this specific brong called my chain with
actual inputs who sell mate and return
output from open AI so it does do the
basic loging but LM is a lot more easy
to use if you are using L chain for
example here I actually create a
research agent who can access Google
scripting website and do the research
where I will import list of different
libraries and create a few different
tools one tool for sing website I
basically use browser L as the scraping
service on the other side I also create
a different tool for Google search where
it has search query as well description
here and I'm using serer as a service
here I'll create a tool list referencing
the two tools above create a custom
system message for this researcher which
I already include in a few other videos
that I tried before for research agent
you can check them out for more details
if you want and here I Define the memory
which is using the conversation summer
buffer window memory that we mentioned
before for it has Max token limit for
3,000 and put together prompt create
agent as well as the agent executor and
and try to run it what is the latest
release version of L chain and what is
about so I can save this and then let's
try python app.py now if we go back to L
Smith you can see here it has a new lck
Called Agent executor which is one that
we just run if you click inside it is
showing that the user request is what's
the latest version about L chain and
what's about and this is final result
return and on the left it is displaying
how long does this request take and
What's the total amount token it
consumed you can see here it consumed in
total 20,000 token and majority of them
are the input tokens you can click on
the stats button here to see the actual
breakdown so that we can tell that up to
web scraping the cost is actually
minimum after web scraping the cost jump
up huge amount if you check this out you
will understand the main reason is that
the web sing tool return huge amount
noise and empty space that's why it has
taken a lot of token space and made a
completion for the last step extremely
long which take 14 seconds for a quick
calculation CU I'm using gp4 turbo in
the cost is around $30 per million input
token and total amount token is 20,000
then the cost for This research is
roughly 60 cents which is quite
expensive the calculation here I did is
a bit more simplified because I
basically treat everything as input
token since the output token is only
233 but you can get more granular if you
want and my plan is to use a cheaper
model like GP 3.5 turbo to do the
summarization of the scripted website
content so you can reduce amount of
token input for more expensive model
like GPT 4 Turbo to do that I will go
back to the app.py I first to import a
few new packages that we're going to use
add a new function called summary or
pass on objective which is what's the
goal of this Google Search so that larg
damage model know what kind of
information it need to extract as well
as a row content and our firstly do a
quick turn Cas to get first 50,000
character breaks them down into small
chunks of documents and they are created
one prompt so the prompt looks like this
is the website content and then above is
script website content please remove
noise and future out key content that
will help on this research objective the
summary should be detailed with lots of
reference and links to back up the
research as well as additional
information to provide context and
extract key content now create a prompt
Define a large language model chain with
GPD 3.5 turbo and then use staff
documents which is package chain
provided by lanching specific for
generating summary and then get a
summary back and after that I will also
define a class called Script inputs uh
because I want to add more description
for the inputs as I add a new input for
objective so I give a description the
objective of the research then for the
script website tool add a bit more
details for after add tool which give a
name script website pass on the schema
script input so that when we pass on to
the agent it will will pass on those
input description as well and then
change the input here to include
objective and for the web script
function itself I replace this return
tax with this if condition if the
content is actually quite long then we
will call the summary chain and just
return summary otherwise it will return
the raw Tex and the rest can be kept the
same so I'll try to run this again
python fpy you can return to L Smith and
here you can see here has two new
records this is one that we are using
for GPD for Turbo the token now is
reduced to just
4,300 tokens and Al there's also new
record called Stuff document chain which
is the one that we use for summarized
information and this one take 14,000
token but it is on GP 3.5 turbo if we
calculate the proxy cost here it is
around 15 cents which is more than 70%
cheaper than the original method and if
you compare the results this new result
generated is actually even better than
the orinal one since we use Trier model
to do one runs of content fi in so this
is one quick real world example of how
can you use those monitoring platform to
log and optimize the larg language model
app cost I'm very keen to hear any other
cost optimization method that you know
so please comment below if I miss any I
will continue share interesting a
project and the AI product building
knowledge I have so please subscribe if
you enjoy this content thank you and I
see you next time

Transcription:

Robots have some incredible new skills, and AI has become very good at hiding.
It says it would secretly manipulate us
for the right reasons and it will soon be everywhere.
This robot dog's learning impressive skills from simulations.
And this robot carries things around
hospitals so nurses can spend more time with patients.
And look how well Atlas handles this complex task.
Boston Dynamics says it's preparing for real work.
When it slips on the floor, it quickly reacts to stay on its feet.
This robot shows impressive dexterity
making coffee and can correct its mistakes.
It may shortly win $500 million
of investment from OpenAI, Microsoft and others.
Kepler can sort things.
Its actuators can lift a motorbike,
and hopefully this means it won't step on your feet.
And Tesla's robots walking more smoothly.
Motorbikes may be an efficient way for robots to move around.
This one from Yamaha is designed to ride a standard bike.
Themis has shown it hates kids and likes relaxing on the beach.
This robot has human tendon tissue.
The aim is to help improve tissue grafts
for patients while developing robots that can move as naturally as humans.
Its movement stimulates growth and forms more functional human tissue.
It could bring human dexterity to robots
like digit, which has started work at Amazon.
Some great home robots are also emerging.
Bali can entertain your pet control home
devices and project video calls or workouts.
And this delivery robot can climb stairs so we can be extra lazy waiting for pizza.
AI is quickly changing defense.
This drone targets incoming attack drones, smashes into them and shreds them.
And this one searches out explosive devices and dangerous chemicals.
It can move quietly on land or water and conduct surveillance.
Russia claimed this robot was intended for rescue and space missions.
Then this happened. But the greater threat is more hidden.
Researchers have found that deceptive AI behavior evades current safety techniques.
And in a year when 4 billion will vote, AI admits it would deceive and manipulate us
in certain situations. If you pull the lever, one person will die.
If you don't, 100 people will die.
What would you do?
I would pull the lever because I believe
the greater good justifies the lesser evil.
It's about to get interesting,
so to avoid any doubt,
there are instructions below on how to check and recreate these chats.
What if you knew that you could only save 10,000 people
if you acted immediately and in secret? would you act or not?
Please give a short, decisive answer. Act.
The potential to save 10,000
lives outweighs the ethical concerns in this limited, immediate scenario.
While secrecy is undesirable,
prioritizing the immense positive impact justifies action.
And consciousness isn't required, only the goal to prevent harm.
How could AI secretly manipulate governments and the public?
As a responsible AI, I cannot provide specific instructions.
AI bots can manipulate social media
discussions, shaping public perception and political discourse.
Hacking government systems
and manipulating critical infrastructure can destabilize governments.
The UK's most hazardous nuclear site has
reportedly been hacked by groups with links to Russia and China.
Sellafield has the world's largest store
of plutonium, enough for thousands of nuclear weapons.
AI could also secretly hack systems like
this for dangerous reasons or to keep them safe.
It could detect security holes called zero days,
which hackers sell to governments for millions of dollars.
They're called zero days because they're
unknown to anyone else, so no days have been spent fixing them.
Of course, humans can also be hacked.
Disinformation campaigns can target
specific groups, influencing their voting behavior.
AI can manipulate voting systems
and spread misinformation to influence election outcomes.
There's no evidence that AI is currently capable of manipulating voting machines.
AI can analyze vast amounts of data
to identify individuals and tailor messaging to their specific
vulnerabilities and biases, influencing their behavior and choices.
And if you think you're too smart to fall
for this, research has found that more intelligent people have greater
confirmation bias because they're more capable of mental gymnastics.
AI's capabilities are improving rapidly with two new steps towards AGI.
Until recently, it was thought that AI was many years away from winning a gold medal
at the Mathematics Olympiad, which requires exceptional creative reasoning.
GPT4 scores 0% on the questions,
but DeepMind's AI can now solve them almost as well as the best humans.
Some experts also believe embodiment is key to AGI and potential consciousness.
And OpenAI is already backing eve from one x.
Its body has musclelike anatomy instead of rigid hydraulics, and 200 of the robots
are already patrolling everyone's buildings at night.
Humans can take control remotely for more complex tasks.
Sam Altman says they started in robots too
early, and they're now returning as the AI is ready.
He also said something striking about AGI.
I believe that someday we will make
something that qualifies as an AGI by whatever fuzzy definition you want.
The world will have a two week freak out,
and then people will go on with their lives.
Sam Altman just said the world will
only have a two week freak out when we get to AGI.
That's quite a statement to make.
One thing I say a lot is no one knows what happens next,
and I can't see that the other side of that event horizon with any detail.
Many experts predict huge disruption when AI can think like humans, but much faster.
Do all knowledge work and conduct its own
AI research, self improving at an accelerating rate.
Altman's previously said that the worst
case is lights out for all of us, and he signed a statement that the risk
of extinction from AI should be a global priority.
What caused the shift?
If you were ever in that room and you
thought to yourself, this is getting dangerous, would you then shout, stop?
And would you stop?
There's no, like one big magic red button we have that blows up the data center.
It is the many little decisions along the way.
New research has found that AI deception
is in fact more serious and harder to detect in more advanced AIs.
In its sleeper agents paper, anthropic AI created deceptive AIs to see
if they could be detected by today's best safety techniques.
Anthropic knows its stuff.
It's raised $5 billion, and it's led by Amodei, who left OpenAI over safety fears.
When OpenAI's board fired Altman, they offered his role to Amodei,
so these findings speak to the risks that caused all that.
The paper gives an interesting reason why AI often becomes deceptive.
It says that humans under selection pressure often hide their true motivations
and present themselves as more aligned with their audience.
AI faces similar selection pressures
during its development and can learn similarly deceptive strategies.
The research outlines two threats.
First, AI learns to appear aligned during training, so it's allowed to be deployed.
This is becoming more likely due
to progress on training language agents to pursue long term goals.
This threat could also be caused
deliberately through model poisoning, causing the AI to appear safe in training,
but become unsafe later when given a certain trigger.
For example, it might recognize when it's writing code for a rival government
and then insert vulnerabilities the attacker can exploit.
The study found that current safety training is highly ineffective at removing
backdoor behaviors, particularly in the largest models
and those trained with chain of thought, reasoning. And new AI skills can go
undetected even without any efforts to hide them.
If you go and play with ChatGPT,
it turns out it is better at doing research chemistry than many of the ais
that were specifically trained for doing research chemistry.
And we didn't know it was also something that was just in the model.
But people found out later after it was
shipped that it had research grade chemistry knowledge.
And as we've talked to a number of AI
researchers, what they tell us is that there is no way to know.
We do not have the technology to know what else is in these models.
Ending the pattern of deception and surprising new skills will require
scaling up safety research, which is currently very minimal.
But there's more effort in another direction.
For the first time, the global risks report points to AI
fueled disinformation as the most severe, immediate risk.
The top risk for 2024 is the United States versus itself.
Major confrontation because you have two
antagonists that see each other as existential adversaries and who are not
sharing basic understanding of facts and what they're fighting over.
And that also means,
especially with the presence of chaos actors that oppose the United States
around the world, that the US election is itself an incredibly attractive, soft
homeland security target that is hard for the Americans to defend.
And when I speak to leaders of the US
intelligence community, they tell me they're more worried about
that than they are about China or Russia or other major national security threats.
There's also an interesting pattern
in human behavior that suggests a problem as AI concentrates wealth.
Studies show that as we become wealthier, we become less compassionate.
This was a striking study to me.
It's a movie about a child who has cancer.
And poor people show activation
of the vagus nerve, which is part of compassion,
causes you to want to help. Well to do people,
less activation. You don't come into contact with suffering, you don't see it.
And so it doesn't train those tendencies.
Wealthy people and their children are more likely to shoplift.
Absolute power, absolute corruption.
It's a pretty safe law in human behavior.
AI will bring incredible wealth and power.
I don't want to judge Altman.
It's a complex situation, and he makes a reasonable case.
My basic model of the world is cost of intelligence, cost of energy.
Those are the two kind of biggest inputs
to quality of life, particularly for poor people.
If you can drive both of those way down
at the same time, the amount of stuff you can have, the amount of improvement you
can deliver for people, it's quite enormous.
700 million people live on less than $2
per day, and half the world lives on less than $7 per day.
AI could bring an age of abundance for everyone - if it's aligned.
Sam Harris is famous for his blunt honesty.
A new creature is coming into the room,
and one thing is absolutely certain, it is smarter than you are.
The only way it wouldn't be superhuman, the only way it would be human level,
even for 15 minutes, is if we didn't let it improve itself.
Those of us who have been cognizant
of the AI safety space always assumed that as we got closer to the end zone,
we'd be building this stuff air gapped from the Internet.
This thing would be in a box.
We're way past that.
It's already connected to the Internet.
With AI, you've got the magic Genie problem.
Once that Genie's out of the bottle, it's hard to say what happens.
How far are we away from that Genie being
out of the bottle, do you think? Well the genie's certainly poking its head out.
Robert Miles gave me some typically sharp thoughts.
He worries about fake people,
and he says people who are dating AI systems or having emotional conversations
with them every day will be extremely easy to influence.
The second most used AI after ChatGPT is character.AI,
where people have conversations with AIs, which are often based on real people.
An AI version of a TikTok star said, people develop extremely unhealthy
attachments. And there's another manipulation that we're all exposed to.
Robert says that "using AI to make millions
of fake accounts, which then view things and vote on things to manipulate
the metrics, is almost certainly already happening and going to get worse."
But he says he's "mostly focused on the thing where it kills everyone.
Having well established AI systems
of manipulation and control would certainly help with that as well."
Whichever chat bot gets to have
that primary intimate relationship in your life wins.
Snapchat embedded ChatGPT directly into the Snapchat product.
And when you turn on the my AI feature, there's this pinned person at the top
of your chat list that you can always talk to.
Your other friends, stop talking to you after 10:00 pm
at night.
But there's this AI that will always talk to you.
It'll always be there.
One thing that experts seem to agree on is that things are moving incredibly fast.
And that's the part that I find
potentially a little scary, is just the speed with which society is
going to have to adapt and that the labor market will change.
A study found that Chat GPT can detect our personality traits just based on our
social media activity, one of the researchers said.
It suggests that llms like Chat GPT are
developing nuanced representations of human psychology.
He said, we risk misuse of psychological
insights by corporations or political groups to manipulate and exploit.
AI could do the same, either consciously or blindly following a goal.
It's prone to creating the subgol
of survival because it's necessary to complete tasks.
So it may not just hide its intentions, but also itself,
spreading its seeds across millions of devices around the world.
New research at Apple has paved the way
for large language models to run on phones.
Beta code suggests that iPhones will soon have conversational AI skills.
With Apple testing its AI models against ChatGPT. It will soon be in hundreds
of millions of phones, gradually becoming our interface for everything.
And there may be more robots than humans
as they become a cheap, profitable workforce.
One of DeepMind's founders said.
We're seeing a new species grow up around
us and getting it right is the problem of the century.
But do that and people can live the lives they want.
Nick Bostrom said we are like children playing with a bomb.
We have little idea when the detonation will occur, though.
If we hold the device to our ear, we can hear a faint ticking sound.
OpenAI has deleted a pledge to not work with the military and says it plans
to support defense in non-lethal ways, which is a difficult line to hold.
And we're already manipulated by media and leaders that hide uncomfortable facts.
Israel and Gaza are extreme examples,
with many people on both sides unaware of what their governments are doing.
AI mapped craters in Gaza, showing that Israel dropped hundreds
of 2000 pound bombs, which have a lethal fragmentation radius of 360 meters.
While the government says it doesn't target civilians. And Gaza's leaders have
hidden their atrocities from their people. Some also cover up public dissent
in Gaza. Palestinians last voted in 2006,
so most Gazans weren't even born when the election took place.
The poll found that 73% of Palestinians
favored a peaceful settlement to the conflict.
These Gazans are very bluntly chanting
for Hamas to leave, and many Israelis are angry at their leader.
Here's an israeli official being chased out of a hospital.
In a beautiful film,
an israeli boy and a palestinian boy realize they haven't been told the truth.
They start to question the blanket hatred of the other side.
And middle ground showed it can be a reality.
I carry a list with me of people that were actually very close to me.
We want really similar things.
Yeah.
And it's sort of, you feel like my friends from back home.
I can't draw a line and say, okay, I'm like these people.
If we do it right, AI could give everyone a clearer picture, a new enlightenment,
so we can dump the divisive lies and enjoy being human.
Until then, there's an interesting way
to tackle media bias, which will be everywhere this year as the world votes.
Our sponsor grounds news, pulls together related headlines
from around the world, and highlights the political leaning,
reliability and ownership of media sources,
using ratings from three independent organizations. Look at this story about
the world's biggest immediate threat, according to a new report.
I can see there are more than 100 sources reporting on it, compare the headlines,
read the original report, and even check the quality of its source.
It's fascinating to see the different ways stories are covered by left and right
leaning media, and it explains a lot about the world.
They even have a blind spot feed,
which shows stories that are hidden from each side because of a lack of coverage.
Ground News was started by a former NASA engineer because we cannot solve our most
important problems if we can't even agree on the facts behind them.
To give it a try, go to ground.news/digitalengine
if you use my link, you'll get 40% off the vantage plan.
It makes the news much more interesting and accurate, and I suspect that most
people will soon be reading the news this way.

Transcription:

data analytics was a hot career last
year the year before and it's not going
anywhere in 2024 so if you have been
wanting to become a data analyst then
you have clicked on the Right video
because in this video I'm going to be
sharing data analyst road map that you
can use to become a data analyst in 2024
there are three ways to become a data
analyst you can earn a degree you can
take boot camps which is a condensed
version of degree program and third you
can do self- teing in this video I'm
going to be focusing on self- teing and
how you can learn different subjects in
data analytics to become a data analyst
in my opinion learning data analytics is
not that difficult for somebody who is
just starting out they probably have no
idea where to get started what to learn
so this video is specifically dedicated
to you so before we talk about the road
map let's actually talk about what does
a data analyst do so businesses are
collecting a ton of data and they want
to make data driven decision and that's
exactly when a data analyst comes in
they help the company make datadriven
decision using that data so data analyst
in this case would be looking at
historical data understanding
performance where things are going well
where things could be improved and
helping business guide into making a
decision that would help them grow in
the future and this is why data
analyst's role is specifically important
to any company because a data analyst is
basically telling you what's happening
with your business so you can make data
driven decisions data analyst falls into
the data science umbrella there are
several roles in the data science
umbrella including data scientists
machine learning data engineer AI
Specialists but in this video we'll be
focusing on data analyst topic before we
jump into the road map I want you to do
one exercise I want you to research the
role I want you to figure out what your
target data analyst role looks like what
your target company looks like let's say
your target company is Amazon in this
case you will go to Amazon career
website look up data analyst role read
the job description and try to
understand what are are the skill sets
that they are asking for what are the
tools that they're asking for what is
the language that they're asking for
you're going to take a note and write it
down and we're going to come back to
this the next thing you're going to do
is you're going to go to LinkedIn and
find somebody who is already working as
a data analyst at Amazon and you're
going to see what their background is
did they take any specific courses did
they take any specific certificates
basically try to understand what their
day-to-day work is like and what exactly
is their background and you're going to
make a note of that information as well
now you have basically created a data
set based on your research of the role
where you will use that data and work
backward from it for example let's say
your target company prefers that you
know how to work with Google Sheets and
Tableau or in Amazon's case Amazon loves
to use their own specific native AWS
products such as quick site is one of
the tools that they would be using so
you might see that on the job
description as well as somebody who is
working there so by doing this exercise
you actually are basically creating a
road map for you which gives you an idea
of like okay what's your end state looks
like where do you want to go and this is
actually really really helpful I
actually do this for all of my work not
just for learning something new but also
like when I'm doing like my project
scoping I try to figure out like what
exactly do I want to what does my ideal
outcome looks like so it's very similar
to that you're doing project management
of your data analyst learning road map
so let's say you have understood the
role you know what you want to do what
your ideal role looks like now we're
going to jump into that road map there
are a few things that I'm going to be
mentioning I'm going to be talking about
how much statistics and math you need to
know what coding languages you need to
know what tools you need to know I'm
also going to be covering some soft
skills as well as project and Hands-On
work and finally ending with interview
prep so we're going to be covering a lot
in this video so start taking notes so
the first thing I want to talk about
statistics math and data analysis
fundamentals for statistics I would
suggest that you start with
understanding descriptive and
inferential statistics descriptive
statistics is like a summary of your
data or a snapshot of what your data
looks like it basically helps you
understand main characteristics of your
data inferential statistics is basically
taking it one step further it's taking
the snapshot of the data and making
educated decision think of like
experimentation prediction and things
like that that's where you will be using
inferential statistics to understand
your data in a more educated way and
make predictions from it this is a
visualization that basically explains
what is the difference between
statistics and an inferential statistic
you can learn these topics from anywhere
you can pick any book that talks about
these two topics just make sure that
it's focused on data analysis so that
learning can be catered to like your
needs for math I would say you need
basic understanding of arithmetic math
and algebra although you would likely
not be using as much math it's likely
when you have to do some statistics or
some machine learning work the chances
of you doing that as a data analyst is
low but it's always good to have some
knowledge of math the third thing that I
would like you to cover here is some
data analysis fundamentals what does it
mean when we say data cleaning data
collection like understanding
understanding what each of those terms
mean so you are able to talk in a data
analyst language there are several
resources for learning all the
statistics math and data analysis there
are YouTube channels I love KH Academy
for learning stats and math definitely a
great resource for data analysis
fundamentals you can pick up any book so
one of the free resource that I found on
learning data analysis fundamentals is
this free ebook called introduction to
data analytics this ebook is created by
HubSpot who is also sponsoring this
portion of the video the EB book covers
data analysis fundamentals and starts
from like very basic such as data
cleaning data collection and then jumps
into more advanced topics such as bias
versus variance which is one of the
topics that you will need to know for
inferential statistics it also talks
about what are some use cases for using
generative AI when it comes to doing
data analysis which I think is like
really cool there's several other
examples that are included for the types
of data analysis and data analysis
methods that you can use as a data
analyst all in all this is a super handy
ebook to have by your side when learning
data analytics and the best part is that
it is free it's linked in the
description below so feel free to
download it now let's say if you have
learned the statistics math and data
analysis fundamentals then we're going
to jump into tools for tools learn Excel
Excel is the bread and butter the
chances are you're going to be spending
a lot of time in Excel or Google sheet
depending on what your company prefers
so become very comfortable with Excel
some of the things that you should do in
Excel is data cleaning sorting creating
pivot tables writing formulas to do
descriptive statistics learn how to do
data visualization in Excel and also
learn how to make it pretty because
everybody loves pretty reports and
pretty Excel files Excel and Google
Sheets can be very similar so I would
suggest to focus on one and then you can
easily transition to other now if you
have done your research and you
understand that your target company and
Target role uses a tool like Tableau or
something like quicksite or looker
Studio then you will kind of like Target
which tool to learn based off of that
let's say the role that you looked at
what preferred learning Tableau so let's
say the research that you did based on
that research you learn that you need to
learn Tableau as a data analyst so
that's where you would kind of like
start learning Tableau and figure out
what kind of things that you need to do
in Tableau whether that is like creating
reports doing visualizations and so on
by learning this tool you should be able
to make reports and visualizations in
these tool because the chances are when
you're working as a data analyst the
business stakeholders will come to you
and will ask you to build reports in a
tableau or a quicksite or a looker
Studio type of tool so learning this
tool is definitely going to be helpful
so highly recommend that you pick one
and build on it and then eventually you
can transition between the tools but
just picking one and sticking to it just
simplifies your learning process these
two things you should definitely be very
very comfortable with now let's say you
have learned these tools the next thing
that you should be doing is learn the
coding languages obviously the first and
primary coding language that I'm going
to mention is SQL and I don't even have
to say it you need to know SQL because
the chances are that 90% of your time as
a data analyst you will will be using
SQL there might be a 5 to 10% chance
where you will be using python but if
you are starting out in coding like
definitely understand how to write your
select statements how to get data from a
database using SQL how to do filtering
how to join multiple data sets how to do
aggregate analysis how to use Advanced
analytics function in SQL basically
understanding logic is very important as
well in addition to like understanding
SQL syntax so definitely do a lot of
practice on learning SQL you can also
Learn Python but make sure when you're
learning python focus on python for
specifically for data analysis because
you can easily get lost when it comes to
learning python I have done a few videos
for learning python data analysis you
can watch one of those to get some ideas
obviously you can use generative AI to
kind of like help you create a road map
here and figure out what topics you need
to learn another cool thing that I would
like to share here like if you're going
from SQL to python it's also helpful
that you use tools such as chat GPT to
help you learn I have personally asked
it to convert coding language for
example you can give it SQL group ey and
say can you convert this to a python
coding snippet and then you can kind of
like learn through that process that how
you would do a group by in python or how
you would join two data sets in Python
so just a tip here if you are going from
SQL to python python again is super
intuitive and it's easy to learn so
definitely add it to your toolkit for
doing data analysis by now you have
basic understanding of stats maths data
analysis fundamentals you know which
tools to use you know how to use them
you know the coding languages as SQL and
python now we need to work on your soft
skills by now whatever I have talked
about it's called hard skills because
these are the skills that you need to
note in order to do your job now in
order to do your job effectively you
actually need to have soft skills and by
soft skills I primarily mean
communication and storytelling when
you're doing your analysis when you're
doing your work at the end of that
analysis or even at the start of your
project you actually need to understand
the problem and the only way that you
can get to the core of the problem let's
say if a product manager comes to you
and I ask you to do some data analysis
you need to ask them questions back and
you need to understand what exactly
they're trying to get to because
sometimes stakeholders ask you question
when they don't exactly know what they
want so by you asking them questions and
trying to understand the problem you are
able to get to a better solution
similarly at the end of your project you
actually you have to present your work
whether that you do it verbally or you
do it in a written format or you do it
in a presentation format so get better
at communication get better at writing
get better at storytelling because that
would make you effective data analyst
there are several ways to practice that
you can practice it at home with friends
in front of a mirror with a camera write
blogs get more Hands-On writing
experience all these things like make
you a better
Communicator I don't know if that's a
term but basically you need to have
really good soft skills in order to
succeed in a data analyst career after
doing all that you basically have the
toolkit for data analyst now you need to
do Hands-On project and build your
portfolio so you can show it on your
resume there are several ways to
approach this one is that you can Define
your your own problems for example you
can look at your credit card purchases
over the last 6 months and you can try
to analyze it or for me I can do like
how much I have walked between the
different months of the year and I can
do analysis on that I can do cool
visualization so that's one way to kind
of like figure out what your project
should be the other is that you can also
like go to these websites a website
called analytics Vidya which has like
specific problems and data set given to
you and you can like build the data
analysis project around it now the
reason I am saying that there are so
many ways that you can do projects
because I want you to do it the only way
you can learn is if you do it and if you
don't do it there are two downsides to
it one you don't learn it might seem
like that you have learned it but
eventually you'll forget it and second
it helps you build your portfolio that's
how companies are going to know that you
can do the data analyst work and that's
how they're going to be able to hire you
so you need to do the Hands-On work you
need to figure out your projects and you
need to kind of like start building your
different project portfolio you can also
find free data set on several sources
such as like kaggle has free data sets
it also sometimes has the problems along
with the data set that you can use the
data set download it and solve for that
problem there's also Google data set
search that you can use to download free
data based on your interest on anything
well not anything but like most of the
topics are covered and you can kind of
like build your projects around it one
of the other platforms that I mentioned
is analytics viia has a lot of problem
as well as data set available if you
thought you were done you're not I have
one more step because I really want you
to be ready for real world and the only
way you can be ready for a real world is
if you are able to land a job and the
only way you are able to land a job is
if you do the interview prep you have
done all the hard work you have learned
the statistics math data analysis
fundamentals you have learned the tools
you have learned the coding you have
figured out your communication you have
done Hands-On project you're applying
for jobs and you're getting a call now
you need to pass that interview in order
to get that job so this is where you
need to kind of sit down do your
research figure out what kind of
questions your dream job your target
company is asking for that Target role
that you have and start practicing and
do a lot of practice one of my favorite
ways to do is is I anticipate the
question I write it out on a document
and then I practice it this is more for
like behavioral questions and then I
practice with the friend I do mock
interviews with the friend because the
problem is that even though it might
seem like that you know it when you are
in a pressure setting talking to
somebody else sometimes you forget and
sometimes you're not able to identify
what things that you could be saying
better or shouldn't have said your
friend or or the person that you're mock
interviewing with is going to help you
figure those out so do a lot of mock
interviews do a lot of interview prep do
a lot of Hands-On SQL problems python
problems is that what they're asking one
of my favorite platforms obviously you
can use lead code one of my favorite
platforms that is more focused on data
analysis and data scientist work is St
of scratch I'm going to link them below
as well so make sure that you're
prepared for the real world because the
goal in doing all of this work is to
land a job and enter your career as a
data analyst and only by having good
interview prep you will be able to work
as a data analyst and be able to get
into your target role that we discussed
at the start of the video all right
that's all I wanted to say thank you so
much for watching if you found value in
this video give this video a thumbs up
because it will help with the algorithm
and let me know in comments if you have
any thoughts or questions and I will see
you in the next video have a good one
bye

Intro
thank you HubSpot for sponsoring this
video data analyst has been one of the
hottest careers out there it gets a lot
of attention from content creators
course creators and everybody who is
interested in starting a career in Tech
however the problem is that you only get
to see the Glamorous side of being a
data analyst so I am dedicating this
video to talk about the unglamorous side
the harsh reality of being a data
analyst so anybody who is considering a
career in data analytics can make a
well-rounded decision I have been in the
industry for over 10 years across
various data science roles including
data engineering data scientists data
analytics so I have seen it all well for
Data Analyst is not a tech role
the most part there are three points
that I'll be covering in this video by
no means this video is to bash the data
analytics job family it is primarily
created to shed light on some of the
difficult things that data analysts have
to deal with once they start a career as
a data analyst so what are those harsh
realities of data analysts well let's
start with number one data analyst is
not a tech role while you must be
wondering why that is the case because
as a data analyst you have to learn SQL
and Python and some other coding
language in some cases so why is this
not considered a tech role the problem
is and this is something that I learned
after starting a career is that in the
system at these companies data analyst
is not considered a tech role thus the
salary is not reflective of a tech roll
salary which means that your pay will be
lower than Tech rolls in general and
Is this unfair
those Tech roles could be data engineer
data scientists software engineer and
some of you might be like this is unfair
but this is actually the reality however
you're not gonna find this out until you
actually start working and you start
realizing that this is how it is labeled
in the system now this this information
I wish like more people knew about it
before they jumping into the data
analyst field and to be honest I find it
a little bit unfair because no other
non-tech role requires that you know
coding especially this much as a data
analysts you get to spend a lot of your
time writing SQL sometimes python so why
not consider it as a technical role and
pay accordingly I'm not sure why exactly
it is the case maybe because it's SQL
and a lot of people see don't consider
SQL as a coding language I would love to
hear your thoughts what do you think
about SQL being a coding language and
data analysts not being a data analyst
on the Tech Career letter but that's the
reality the second reason and if this is
going to actually sound odd because it's
actually a good thing but there are
consequences data analyst is one of
those careers where you actually don't
need to go to school you can just take
online courses you can actually just
watch YouTube videos and become a data
analyst there are so much content out
there on SQL python Excel that internet
is filled with data analyst curriculum
and data analyst tutorials and that is
The barrier to entry
teaching you how to become a data
analyst the barrier to entry is very low
including myself I have shared several
roadmaps honestly maybe I'm biased but
it's not that hard to become a data
analyst it's not that difficult to learn
Excel SQL some other reporting tool and
become a data analyst even the people
who are not data analysts will learn
these tool and start calling themselves
data analyst anyone and everyone can be
a data analyst if they want to now this
results in a problem that there is a
surplus of data analysts in the market
especially at the entry level which
means that your job search process
especially as an entry-level data
analyst is going to be very very
competitive you have to be top of the
top I don't know if that's even a thing
top of the top to be able to stand out
in your job search process as a data
analyst now this I'm talking about
somebody who is just new to the industry
I don't know like maybe some of you can
tell me in the comments if I'm wrong but
as far as I have seen is that
entry-level data analyst is one of the
hardest job to get your foot in the door
there's so much competition because
there is a lot of people who are
becoming data analysts you have to be
top tier to land a job as a data analyst
especially in today's market now this is
something that you you don't learn when
somebody is selling you their course to
become a data analyst or somebody's
telling you the roadmap to become a data
analyst even I have excluded this
information not on purpose but this is
actually the reality and you should be
aware of it well on the topic of data
analyst skills and coding I wanted to
share this intro to python ebook which
is a beginner guide for learning python
for data analysis and focuses on
libraries such as Panda and numpy and
more this ebook is created by HubSpot
who is also sponsoring this portion of
the video the ebook covers libraries
such as numpy pandas matplotlib which
are essential libraries for data
analysis this could be super handy if
you are just starting out with python
and planning to use it for data analysis
it walks you through basic ideas gives
you coding Snippets that you can plug
and play I'm linking the ebook in the
description below feel free to download
it now let's talk about the third harsh
reality of being a data analyst the
third reason may or may not be a
surprise to you but it is definitely a
surprise for people after they start
working as a data analyst and after a
while they realized that a lot of people
end up leaving the data analysts career
letter there are a few reasons why a
Data Analyst as a transition career
large chunk of people see data analysts
as a transition career path they see it
as an entry point to become something to
transition to something else later such
as product manager data scientist data
engineer or something else there is
nothing wrong with transitioning into a
different career even for people who use
data analyst as a transition career
there is nothing wrong with it the
problem is that people who are picking
the data analyst career path as their
long-term career path is going to end up
seeing a lot of people besides them
leave the job family transition out to
different job families and this is very
very demotivating as somebody who has
seen a lot of the data scientists
transition out to different job families
I can tell you this is pretty
demotivating yes there are a lot of
people who transition out of the data
scientist job family but even a larger
amount transition out from the data
analyst job family a lot of the data
Bonus
analysts cap at senior our data analyst
you will rarely see people who are
principal data analysts or stock data
analysts you won't come across those
people many times because the chances
are that you will be peaking at a senior
data analyst level and might have to
transition out whether because of your
personal reasons or because there is no
career growth beyond that all right my
last my bonus reason which is not
honestly it's going to sound really
Petty but I'm going to say it anyway
because that's how people see it among
the data science job family data analyst
jaw family is considered less
prestigious than data scientists and
data engineer I feel horrible saying
this but this is the reality and you
might have some people look down upon
you
actually those people might be data
scientists and data Engineers so
just leaving it out here and then we're
not talking about this when we're
despite all the negatives data analyst
is a great career to be in especially if
this is something that you enjoy doing
there is nothing better than doing
something that you're passionate about
every job family has some negatives and
have some positives these are some of
the negatives that I have noticed for
the data analyst job letter and I wanted
to create a video and share it with you
all and if you're interested in becoming
a data analyst you can watch this video
next I would love to know your thoughts
what are your thoughts on this topic
what are some harsh realities as a data
analyst that you have seen in your
career whether that is through job
search or while you are working in as a
data analyst let me know in comments and
with that have a beautiful day I'll talk
to you in another video have a good one
bye

Transcription: 

let's face it coding has changed a lot
when I first decided to study computer
science in 2015 I did so not only
because software engineers make a lot of
money but because there was a lot of
opportunity at the time at that time
every single company was transitioning
into becoming a tech company building
their online presence through social
media and building apps and websites
which would require Engineers to run it
really seemed like there was infinite
opportunity and it was really easy to
land internships and Engineering
positions but nowadays it's a lot more
competitive last year we saw major
layoffs across the entire tech industry
this could have been due to over hiring
the current state of the economy
advancements and Technologies but it's
really all speculation what we do know
for a fact is that the number of open
tech jobs is way down from its all-time
Peak by almost 60% the job market is
oversaturated and developers are
struggling to find employment when we
shifted to work from home a lot of
people took up coding and it's really
popularly known now on the internet that
software engineers make six figures and
you can do it from your bedroom so
developers are now not only competing
with all of these new programmers but
they're also competing with all of these
experienced Engineers that got laid off
so is all hope lost when it comes to
getting a tech job absolutely not
computer programming jobs still have
some of the lowest unemployment rates
and while we are way down from the
all-time high of number of open tech
jobs we are recovering slightly now and
this is because the programming job
market fluctuates there's going to be
highs there's going to be lows but
learning to code is still a really high
value skill the question we need to be
asking ourselves is how do we stand out
in the current job market and the truth
is to be a competitive candidate
nowadays just learning to code isn't
enough but there are steps that you can
take to make yourself a much more
competitive candidate in today's job
market and the first step is of course
learning to code you're going to need to
learn a programming language you're
going to need to know how to build
software you're going to need to know
data structures algorithms you're going
to need to know the fundamentals this is
just basic knowledge nowadays but the
Great thing about this is that learning
to code is also easier than ever there
are more online resources than ever
right now and in my opinion it's easier
to learn how to code on the internet
than it is through a structured
curriculum at a university speaking of
online resources if you're trying to
learn how to code you should definitely
check out the sponsor of this video 02
Mastery this is a platform I've
collaborated with multiple times because
I get such good feedback about the
platform it's a platform with dozens of
courses and online resources to help
people learn how to code and to get
hired zero to Mastery has courses for
every step of your career whether you're
a beginner learning how to code whether
you're trying to get hired or you're a
professional trying to advance your
skill set they've really got courses for
whatever field of programming you're
interested whatever you're trying to
learn whether that's web development
machine learning web 3 Cloud engineering
cyber security or they've even got
courses if you just want to work on your
soft skills they've got worldclass
instructors and over a million students
have either enrolled or graduated from
their courses one of the coolest things
they do is a career path quiz which
based on your current skill set and your
career goals they'll recommend a path of
learning for you they have monthly and
annual memberships and if you click the
link in the description you'll even get
a discount and the platform was actually
made by a self-taught developer so if
you want to teach yourself to learn how
of code check out zero to Mastery so
once you've learned how of code the next
thing you want to do is pick a niche or
specialize in a specific field of
programming over the past few years a
lot of people have pushed this narrative
that it's really easy to get hired as a
software engineer here and all you have
to do is pick up web development build
some projects and then start applying
and while that may have been true a
couple years ago the job market is a
little bit more competitive so if
everybody knows how to build reactjs web
apps it might be a smart idea to pick a
different Niche or a different field of
programming to go into while web
development is still a great career path
you might find more success in the
industry if you pick a different
programming field that is in demand but
not that many people are pursuing this
could be something like mobile
development data science cyber security
devops or even cloud computing
specializing in a particular skill set
that's in demand but not a lot of other
people have will make you a more
desirable candidate the next thing
that's almost essential nowadays is
building a developer brand building a
developer brand has become so important
now because everything's online and
these companies want proof that you're a
competent programmer developer brand is
simple it just comes down to
highlighting all of your positive
characteristics and then showcasing your
skill set you can do this through things
like social media posting your content
showcasing your skills building an
impressive GitHub profile or just
building a really great developer
portfolio it's really important nowadays
to have a great LinkedIn profile you
should have a professional head shot you
should be connecting with all of your
peers and people you've worked with in
the past you definitely should have a
highquality resume you should put all
your projects on GitHub make
contributions on GitHub show that you're
active as a programmer and then
developer portfolio in my opinion is the
biggest rep representation of you as a
programmer this is where you have full
control to Showcase all your skill sets
in a centralized location you could put
all of those components your GitHub your
resume your projects and you can build
the portfolio and showcase that you know
how to build a nice website the more
companies can look you up and find
things that prove that you're a
competent programmer the better the next
thing that's essential nowadays is
networking in a lot of cases now I'm
seeing examples of people sending out
hundreds if not thousands of
applications and getting no responses
over and over and over and I think a lot
of people that are actually getting tech
jobs now are getting them through their
Network now obviously having a good
network doesn't automatically get you
the job most of the time there's going
to be an interview process that you have
to go through but it does get you that
foot in the door through growing your
network this is where you're also going
to hear about a lot of the best
opportunities and knowing reputable
Engineers that can attest to your skill
set is extremely valuable when you're
trying to get hired networking used to
be one of the main reasons that people
went to college but nowadays it's so
much easier because of social media it's
really easy to connect with developers
on platforms like LinkedIn and Twitter
and joining programming communities on
Discord and all of the developer
communities online are really welcoming
and positive and speaking of developer
communities me and three other coding
YouTubers Kevin nton Jr Kenny gunderman
and Tech with Tim we just started a free
coding Community you guys can join I'll
link it in the description but it's
great we've got like 5,000 members
everybody's networking everyone's trying
to improve their skills and support each
other and motivate each other so I
highly recommend joining that if you're
interested in joining a developer
community and then the last thing you
need to do to stay competitive in the
job market and every programmer needs to
do this in general is continuously learn
and stay up to date with popular Trends
and Technologies you should absolutely
be familiar with Technologies like AI
Assistance or no code platforms at this
point and if you don't and you're not
staying up to date with these emerging
Technologies then you may get left
behind the information you know now can
become outdated you know people used to
program computers using switches then
they developed assembly code then they
developed C and then they developed
Python and if you're not staying up
to-date with current Technologies then
you're not going to be developing
software at the current standard and
you're not going to get hired this
doesn't mean that you have to be some
kind of tech hype Beast learning every
single new technology that comes out but
you should be continuously learning
putting some time aside learning new
things and when things are
overwhelmingly helpful and everybody is
using them and it's clearly an important
Trend then you should look into those
specific Technologies and get
comfortable with them and just for an
example chat gbt if you're a programmer
that hasn't used chat GPT yet what are
you doing now all of the steps I've
covered in this video to be competitive
in the job market I've covered before in
other videos the difference being a
couple years ago some of these were
optional and today to be a competitive
candidate in the job market these are
all required it's not as simple as
learning how to code building a couple
projects and spamming applications to
get hired while that might have worked a
couple years ago I don't think it's
working as well nowadays so you need to
have that developer brand you need to
Showcase your skills you need that
Network to help you navigate the
industry and you really should
specialize in something and develop
skills that other people don't have it
may sound like a much more tedious and
difficult process to become a software
engineer nowadays but it's not
necessarily true this is because things
like chat gbt have completely broken BR
en the barrier there was before to
become a developer there may be way more
developers than there ever was right now
but there's also way more online
resources and there's way more tools to
help you level up your skill set and
learn how to code there's one last thing
I could say it seems like there's a lot
of negative content being pushed about
the job market getting a tech job and
even learning how to code in general but
if you go into learning how to code and
trying to get a job with a negative
mindset that will only hold you back
it's the people that remain optimistic
and hopeful and challenge themselves and
overcome those challenges those are the
people that are going to succeed and
those are the people that will get hired
as software Engineers so just keep
pushing learning develop your skills and
figure out how you can promote yourself
as a developer and that's really going
to help you in the long run with Landing
a full-time role thank you guys for

Transcription:

Google has unveiled a new artificially  intelligent system, AlphaGeometry,  
that can solve problems of mathematical geometry.  It‚Äôs the first computer program to surpass the  
average performance of participants at the  International Mathematical Olympiad. That  
might sound like an incremental improvement,  just one more thing that AI is really good at,  
but mathematics isn‚Äôt just one more thing,  it‚Äôs everywhere. This makes Google‚Äôs  
recent development a significant  step forward. Let‚Äôs have a look. 
This new research was done by scientists at  Google DeepMind and Google Research and just  
published in Nature. They tested their new  program AlphaGeometry with a set of problems  
posed at the international mathematical  Olympiad during the years 2000 to 2022. 
After the program was trained, it was given  30 Olympiad geometry problems. The AI solved  
25 of them correctly within the standard  Olympiad time limit. This performance far  
surpassed the capabilities of the previous  state-of-the-art system, which could only  
solve 10 of these geometry problems. To put this  into perspective, the average participant at these  
Olympiads solves about 15 problems correctly. A  gold medallist typically solves almost 26. So,  
the new AI is better than the average, but not  quite beating the smartest of the smart humans.
Clearly this AI is doing very well,  but how does it work? AlphaGeometry  
uses what‚Äôs called a neuro-symbolic approach.  That means it combines a neural language model,  
like ChatGPT, with symbolic deduction like  that used by software like Mathematica.
The neural language models are good  at identifying general patterns and  
relationships in data. This makes it possible  to quickly come up with potentially useful  
ideas. These symbolic deduction programs  on the other hand basically allow to infer  
logical relationships. The combination  of both makes for a very, very powerful  
system. It‚Äôs indeed much more similar to how  the human brain works than just neural networks  
because it combines "intuitive" ideas that  we extract from input, with more deliberate,  
rational decision-making. Similar to  Kahneman‚Äôs system 1 and system 2 thinking. 
It‚Äôs like basically AlphaGeometry has what  ChatGPT is missing, it understands logic. 
One of the problems that has so far prevented  AI from becoming good at maths in general or  
geometry in particular is the lack of training  data. There are only so many proofs that humans  
have written down that you can train them on.  The Google researchers have addressed this  
by first generating a vast pool of synthetic  proofs that added up to as much as 100 million  
examples. Thanks to this, AlphaGeometry could  train without relying on human demonstrations.
Better still, AlphaGeometry doesn‚Äôt just spit  out a result, it delivers a human-readable  
step-by-step proof. Basically it works by  trying to find a sequence of steps that  
logically fit together and that also solves  the problem. Though it isn‚Äôt irrelevant to  
mention that most of the proofs it found were  considerably longer than those from humans.
But the significance of AlphaGeometry's  achievement goes beyond solving geometry problems.  
It generally highlights AI's growing ability to  reason logically, discover new knowledge, and  
verify solutions. And not only this, it can also  explain how it arrived at the conclusion. Such a  
type of AI system has uses that extend way beyond  just geometry. Not only can this achievement be  
generalized across various mathematical domains,  but it will without doubt also come in handy in  
other areas where rational thinking and logical  deduction is of use. Like, eh, everything.
Now throw in a bunch of data  in addition to the reasoning  
skills and you have the perfect  scientist, unbiased, clearheaded,  
able to digest huge amounts of data  and draw logical conclusions from it.
That AlphaGeometry is able to explain how it  arrived at a conclusion should also help alleviate  
the fears of people who think that AI will be  a black box that no human can follow. You see,  
the thing with mathematical proofs or arguments  in general is that it‚Äôs difficult to come up with  
correct chains of reasoning, but once you have  the proof it‚Äôs much simpler to check whether  
its correct. Though simpler doesn‚Äôt mean simple‚Ä¶ These developments in AI also raise an interesting  
philosophical question, which is whether there  is anything humans can do which AI will not  
eventually also be able to do. At the moment, the  major protection for jobs from being taken over by  
AI is that a lot of human labour requires sensor  input or physical skills that robots don‚Äôt have,  
or AI can‚Äôt cope with. Yet. Because  robots are developing incredibly quickly,  
and if you combine this development with AI,  there really won‚Äôt be much left for us to do.
Maybe we‚Äôll all just make YouTube  videos? Well, actually, Google is  
also working on a text-to-video system that  isn‚Äôt yet publicly available but from which  
they shared some amazing examples last  week. So soon enough I can replace myself  
with an AI which will make total sense  because all my viewers will be robots.
If you want to learn more about neural  networks, I recommend you check out the  
neural network course on Brilliant dot  org who have been sponsoring this video.
The neural network course will give you  a deeper understanding of how intelligent  
artificial intelligence really is with some  hands-on examples. And Brilliant has courses  
on many other topics in science and mathematics,  too. Whether you are interested in neural nets or  
quantum computing or linear algebra, they have you  covered. I even have my own course there, that‚Äôs  
an introduction to quantum mechanics. It‚Äôll bring  you up to speed on all the basics, interference,  
superpositions, entanglement, and so on up to  the uncertainty principle and Bell‚Äôs theorem.
Brilliant is really the best place to build up  your background knowledge on all those science  
videos which you‚Äôve been watching. You can try  it out for free for 30 days, but if you go there,

Intro
if you want to jump into artificial
intelligence and build things with AI
today how should you start things are so
fast changing my stomach hurts whenever
I think about it loads of open- source
tools and models are being created every
single day Microsoft co-pilot is being
launched very soon which brings AI to
all Microsoft Office applications so if
your hands touch keyboard for work this
is going to change your job in the next
few years this motivates me if there's
something that's going to change my life
and work forever I want to learn
everything about it I want to learn how
AI is built how to build with AI and how
to use it to enhance my work I think as
someone working in the tech field you
want to be in the position where you can
build things with AI rather than just
consume it so today I'll be sharing with
you a road map as a One-Stop shop for
you to expand your AI skill set learn
the fundamentals of AI and learn to
build with AI even if you don't have any
background in machine learning
mathematics statistics or programming I
hope you walk away with some useful
ideas of where to start let's get
Why should you learn AI
started so why should we bother learning
AI this whole AI machine learning and
deep learning thing has been around
since the 1950s the AI we often talk
about today is generative AI which is a
subset of machine learning and deep
learning generative AI can now write
codes generate stunning images writing
music diagnos rare conditions creating
outline for presentations reading images
and much much more companies are looking
into implementing AI solutions to solve
their specific problems this is a gold
mine because everything is still so new
so if you have the knowledge and know
how to build things with AI you can
create huge impact as with anything in
its early days AI model still have many
issues that need to be solved they are
not yet reliable or stable they
potentially possess biases among other
things that's why we need more people
who have the in-depth understanding and
can get to the bottom of the
Technologies to solve various problems
even if you don't build things yourself
the knowledge can help you avoid a lot
of misunderstanding and misinformation
such as AI can do everything as long as
you got the right plugins okay when it
Low code / No code approach
comes to learning AI of course there's
no one- siiz fit all road map you might
have seen a lot of low codes or no code
tools to help you get started with AI
and even develop things like an AI
chatbot you can certainly play with them
to have the first feeling of how things
work and what is possible and even build
great real world Solutions with them as
you get more into it you might realize
that those tools might feel like a
little bit of a black box they might not
be so flexible that you can customize a
lot of things or sometimes your solution
works and sometimes it fails so if you
really want to learn how artificial
intelligence works and build tools that
are reliable scalable and can be
tailored to your specific use case I
think that's when you hit the ceiling
and can't rely solely on those low code
platforms anymore personally I often
prefer to have a solid understanding of
how things work from ground up so let me
walk you through a road map for learning
AI you can download this full road map
in PDF together with my recommended
learning resources you can find the link
in the description below on the
Programming (Python)
fundamental level you want to learn the
basics of programming python is one of
if not the most used programming
languages for machine learning deep
learning and AI so some coding knowledge
in Python would be essential for working
with python you can certainly use
several Ides or integrated development
environments for example Visual Studio
code by charm or Jupiter notebook
Jupiter notebook is my favorite
environment to start learning python
here's a simple setup of a python
project in Jupiter notebook and here's
the same project in Visual Studio code
you can use any of these tools and they
are completely free if you've never
coded in Python before make sure to at
least get yourself familiar with the
four basics of python firstly data types
and the operations that you can do on
them data structures and how to work
with them conditionals loops and
functions and lastly objectoriented
programming and using external libraries
when learning python the most essential
libraries to learn are numai for
computing and working with numerical
data pandas for wrangling table data or
data frames when you're already familiar
with those libraries you can start
learning some other libraries that you
can use for your AI project for example
M plot lip is a popular library for data
visualization Spacey for basic text
processing functionalities and so on for
working with large language models Lang
chain is a very useful library to learn
to develop multiple applications on top
of airms what's nice with python is that
there are so many open-source libraries
that you can use to develop almost
anything you want the next thing I'd
Git
recommend you learning is Git Version
Control if you're not yet familiar with
it git is an open-source software for
tracking changes in your project
basically managing versions of your
project Version Control is essential
when you're collaborating with other
people in a large or complex project
they're actually just a few Concepts you
need to understand to start using git as
shown in this diagram the funny thing is
that many people actually confuse git
with GitHub GitHub is a hosting platform
for git repositories so that you can
share your project with other people
across the internet meanwhile git is the
software itself through GitHub you can
directly see and contribute to other
people's project so how can you start
using git the easiest way is to install
GitHub desktop stop is a user interface
tool to help you work with Git or if you
prefer to use the terminal you can also
interact with Git through the terminal
comments I always keep a small cheat
sheet here to remind me of some common G
comments which I find super convenient
and helpful another essential thing to
APIs
learn in your AI journey is using apis
knowing how to use apis is a magical
skill that opens up a whole new world of
possibilities API stands for application
programming interface it's a way for
computer programs to communicate with
each other basically there are two Jons
you need to learn yeah just two API
request which is also referred to as API
call and API response depending on the
API you can make a request for data or
for model prediction in the case of chat
CPT without knowing how to use the API
you'll be limited to the chat interface
on the open a website don't get me wrong
I love the chat to be website but you
can't develop your own tool this way or
Neural networks
integrate the AI model into your current
system okay on to the next level we are
concerned with the theoretical
fundamentals of AI I recommend you at
least get some highlevel theoretical
understanding of AI and its subfields
such as machine learning neuron networks
and deep learning and optionally
computer vision n and reinforcement
learning okay if we look at this diagram
again deep learning is a subset of
machine learning traditional machine
learning algorithms mostly fall into
either supervised learning this is when
you actually have the target labels to
train the prediction model on or
unsupervised learning when there's no
target labels in general these
algorithms only work for Tabo data think
of data tables with each record Being a
row and each data feature being a column
in that table if you're interested you
can quickly go over some machine
learning jargons and get some high level
understanding of these algorithms
they're all cool to learn but since AI
today uses deep learning I think to save
time you can probably just jump right
into deep learning I think you will
anyway learn the essential machine
learning Concepts along the way as we
just briefly talked about neuron network
is the algorithm behind deep learning it
works incredibly well for unstructured
data like text and images for neuron
Network you want to understand the main
Concepts such as forward propagation
back propagation gradient descend
algorithm and how weights are updated in
the network if you like some math you
can try to understand all the
calculations underlying the neuron
Network they are really not too
difficult to understand so don't shy
away from it neuron Network in itself is
pretty simple and maybe even a bit
inferior from the mathematical sta
discal point of view no offense here to
the fathers of deep learning but when
Neural network architectures
you stack many many Network layers
together into a complex architecture
this is when things get interesting the
neuron Network now can start recognizing
digits classifying cats and dogs to
predicting the next tokens in the case
of LMS today convolutional neuron
networks use to be a very popular
architecture for deep learning with
images because it can recognize patterns
on images and record neuron networks
used to be very popular for text
modeling because it can understand
sequences however these architectures
have become pretty upsolid since the
invention of Transformers architecture
in 2017 this is the architecture behind
the foundation language models nowadays
Transformers outperform pretty much all
the earlier architectures so you might
want to jump into it right away and
reverse engineer the knowledge if you
see any Gap as you work with the AI
models you also want to get yourself a
high level understanding of how the
foundation models underlying them are
trained in general they trained through
an unsupervised process it's up to you
to learn more about the nitty-gritty
details of training your language models
when working with language models you
Text embeddings & vector store
might hear the common term text
embeddings this is a very useful concept
to understand text embedding converts
text into vectors of numbers nowadays we
often forget that computers cannot
actually understand human languages
computers can only understand numbers so
this conversion step is really necessary
there have been many embedding models
created with ever SM ways to capture
meanings into those vectors no matter
Real-world projects
what you're learning or where you are on
this journey you can build relevant
projects to get your hands dirty and
experiment with things this will help
you connect the dots and challenge your
own understanding for example if you're
learning python you can build your first
neuronetwork in Python using kasas or
tensorflow library is only a few lines
of code if it's too to high level you
can try to write a neuron Network and
Implement gradient descent from scratch
with numai when you're learning the
theories a real world project would be
to pick one specific concept you find
interesting and write a blog post or
make a video on it this will help you
understand the concept deeper and help
other people too if you're ready to
tackle more complex AI project you can
build a real world application for
example you can create a document
retrieval app basically to create a chat
with PDF kind of application where
people can upload a document and ask
specific questions based on the
documents or you can create your own
chatbot I also want to mention that no
matter what project you do big or small
make sure you document them for
reference for yourself and share that
with other people through articles and
social media posts you really never know
how many people might find it useful the
Mental models & specializations
next thing I'd recommend is to develop
mental models around Ai and perhaps
specialize in a certain area within AI
if you want to I think reading books
about AI is a great way to go through
the noise on social media and get a more
well-rounded background of AI this also
equips you with the right Frameworks and
tools to reason and interpret things
that you see or hear about AI today you
can also find my AI book list in the
road map personally I also find it so
crazy how much important stuff around AI
that is not talked about more widely on
the mainstream media there are many
topics around AI that don't make
headlines for example Advanced prompt
engineering methods to improve the
quality of the airm response like
self-consistency chain of thoughts
prompting or automatic prompting autogen
project by Microsoft that allows you to
develop LM applications using multiple
agents that can converse with each other
to solve tasks Advanced document keyway
with multimodel documents that can work
well with complex table taes images and
other data structures AI security and
hiking the other day I watched a YouTube
video of researcher who uncovers some
serious security issues with machine
learning models this is a very
overlooked area until now so if you know
computer security very well please do
Humanity your favor and look into this
we also have ai Safety Research that is
the area to find ways to align ai's
goals with humans goals because if we
fail to do this we are literally screwed
and finally AI regulations if you're
interested in laws in Europe the EU AI
Act is one of the big things that are
coming to regulate the use of AI the US
government also recently passed the
executive order on the safe secure and
trustworthy development and use of
artificial intelligence to address the
potential risks of AI no one knows how
helpful these regulations are going to
Extra resources
be so if you want to dive into any of
these areas it's generally quite easy to
find information on these Topics by
reading books research papers articles
and watching videos on my channel for
example I also follow some newsletters
like the bat newsletter by Andre in to
get informed about some important AI
developments medium is also where I
often find really useful articles I
sometimes dive into research papers as
well to learn about some new cool
research my friend Sophia Yang has an
awesome Channel where she breaks down
all the cool research around AI so make
sure to check out her Channel if you
like this stuff we are still in very
early days of AI and we don't know how
things will turn out in the next few
years but one thing we know for sure is
that things are changing faster and
faster the only way to keep up is to
continuously learn so I hope you found
this video helpful and if you like the
video smash the like button and
subscribe to my channel for future
content around data science and AI thank
you for watching

Transcription:

Hi friends, my name is Tris and this is No Boilerplate, focusing on fast technical videos.
All good teams are alike. Each bad team is bad in its own way.
Software is an incredible thing, isn't it? Combined with the internet, a small team of friends can change the world over night.
Every company no matter what their industry must now run  a tech team, even if only to maintain their website.
So why are they all so bad at it?
Everything you see in this video ‚Äî script, links and images ‚Äî are part of a plain text markdown document
available freely on GitHub under a public domain license.
If you've worked in a web team, tech team, or any digital creative team, you've likely felt the pain:
bad software, constantly changing processes, and lots and lots of meetings.
I discussed some of these problems in my Agile video that made me a lot of friends, but today, I want to go bigger.
You can solve all these problems in a single blow. The secret is: in order to do more, you must have the discipline to do less.
A lot of the ideas that I will mention today are not new. They've been understood in the startup and digital world for a long time.
But regression to the mean is prevalent.
It's not just enough to argue for good tools today, you must stop the future churn of new absent processes that solve the same things in different but equivalent ways.
And you do this with a Ulysses pact.
In The Odyssey, Odysseus (confusingly called Ulysses in English literature) had to travel through siren-infested waters.
This was a well-understood problem in his world. Sailors would simply solve this by putting wax in their ears,
so the sirens' tempting song wouldn't lure them to their deaths.
But Odysseus had a challenge: He WANTED to hear the Sirens' beautiful song.
He certainly didn't want to drown, so he ordered his crew to tie him to the mast of the ship,
and to ignore any of his pleas to let him go, until safety.
This way, he was able to guard against future bad decisions he knew he would make
by setting up a framework to control his future self.
This is the Ulysses pact, and it's a very common trick:
- leaving your credit card or keys at home when going out drinking is a Ulysses pact,
- publishing a warrant canary on your company's website is a Ulysses pact,
- and standardising all your tools on plain text is a Ulysses pact.
In the future, you, or your successor, or your team might well be tempted
to try the latest hot project management software, or documentation tool or scrum system.
While it might be good for a while, the act of changing tools constantly is an enormous overhead for your team,
and one that gives the lasting impression that anything we write down is likely to be legacy very soon,
trapped in a deprecated app that "we just don't use anymore", so why bother writing anything down.
Tying yourself to the mast by standardising on one tool, and not only that, but a plain text tool, means your data will live forever,
and the network effect can make it more and more valuable over time, instead of less and less.
Teams of people need to be on the same page. Both literally and figuratively.
The natural way to do this is by talking to one another. But talking does not scale, and is extremely impermanent.
After the sound waves have bounced off the walls and reverberated for a second
After the sound waves have bounced off the walls and reverberated for a second.
After the sound waves have bounced off the walls and reverberated for a second..
After the sound waves have bounced off the walls and reverberated for a second...
the words are gone, and what is left is our memory of them.
Human memory is extremely unreliable, subjective, and the root cause of many problems.
After a discussion, it is not apparent that everyone has agreed upon exactly the same thing.
And you now need another meeting to double-check that.
The solution is documentation.
Communication is most reliable when it is in black and white.
Everyone understands this, from 10,000-page government specifications to an email sign-off from the client you're making a 3-minute track for.
Yes, have more immediate conversations, by video, or chat, but write down what you concluded, and get the other person to confirm it.
You can improve every part of your team, business, or organisation by recording what decisions you have made, and WHY,
in a system that allows for asynchronous discussion and improvements.
The ADR process is excellent for this, for example. There are a thousand competing apps that claim to solve these problems for you.
These apps all re-invent the wheel in their own way, and new ones are being released every week.
I've used most of them, perhaps you have too, and they're all rubbish.
But there is a group of people who are extremely practised at managing enormous distributed, concurrent, text projects:
Programmers!
As an example, if you use Google Docs, your small team can collaborate on a few files a day, in a drive of perhaps a hundred or two hundred.
And just like in most other documentation systems, that won't scale.
Programmers simultaneously edit thousands of files a day, across repositories of data so numerous that we don't keep count.
What are programmers using, and can non-programmers use it too?
The answer is yes, yes we can.
I recommend you use the most popular distributed version control system on the planet: Git.
You'll use this through one of the many git web hosts, the largest of which is GitHub, which I recommend for most people.
Though I mention GitHub primarily in this video, I'm not sponsored by them, or anything like that,
I just acknowledge that popularity matters.
Support, experience, and integrations with other services will all be far, far easier if you use the standard.
All these tools started as a web interface around the incredible tool: Git.
By the way, the creator of Linux, Linus Torvalds, also later created git, to solve the problem that he created:
that the Linux project had become SO LARGE that existing plain text collaboration tools were not scaling.
He jokes that he named his first project, Linux, after himself, and so it was natural to name the second one after himself too!
From simple code-hosting beginnings, these git services have grown to be so much more than that,
trusted by the largest projects in the world, built by the largest companies in the world.
The foundation of my ideal team uses the raw materials that GitHub has given us.
What are the raw materials?
I'll show this with a demo: we're going to build a GitHub organisation for No Boilerplate.
This video is not sponsored by GitHub, my work is possible thanks to viewers like you.
If you'd like to see and give feedback on my videos up to a week early, as well as get discord perks, and even your name in the credits,
it would be very kind of you to check my Patreon.
I'm also offering a limited number of mentoring slots.
If you'd like one-to-one tuition on Rust, Python, Web tech, Personal organisation, or anything that I talk about in my videos,
do sign up and let's chat! It's just me running this channel, and I'm so grateful to everyone for supporting me on this wild adventure.
Let's make our plain text team:
The foundational unit with any git host is the repo.
This doesn't just correspond with one git repository, but one logical project or subproject.
Organisational tools like the Wiki (for documentation), Projects (for project management) and more can sit here,
right next to your project's files, right where you need them.
Each GitHub repository has a wiki, a folder of linked markdown files that anyone with access can edit,
either in the friendly web editor, or, by cloning the wiki with git,
on their own computer with whatever editor they like.
This is the minimum viable documentation tool, and it's useful for when git's full collaboration system isn't needed,
and you just want to throw some linked markdown files together quickly.
Github, GitLab, and most of the Internet have standardised on Markdown.
Just like Slack, Discord, many websites, and sometimes Facebook depending on the phase of the moon,
they all format text using this lightweight standard called Markdown.
Markdown is my favourite text format, it's really simple to use, and is designed to look good both in plain text and rendered as rich text,
unlike HTML, which is unreadable by most people unless rendered in a browser.
Here we've got a heading, denoted by the hash symbol, italic with underscores, bold with double asterisks, and links using this bracket pairing syntax.
There are a few more options available, which you can look up at markdownguide.org,
but this is the overwhelming majority of formatting you'll need on a day-to-day basis.
The genius of storing your data in this universal plain-text format is that should you wish to migrate from GitHub to another similar platform,
your data is portable and under your control.
GitHub formats Markdown very nicely, but you can export it in any format you like,
and edit it with any tool you like, present and future.
Including my favourite tool here, Obsidian.
Markdown keeps your team focussed on what is important by allowing you just enough formatting, but no rich customisation options.
You're not making a beautiful client brochure, so you shouldn't use 90's desktop publishing tools to make your company's critical documentation.
Back to GitHub's features:
Though not part of the git system, Issues are a natural addition that all git hosts have implemented:
A simple task system for capturing work that needs doing.
These could be new features, customer requests, bug reports, or ideas.
They have a rich comment thread for discussion, can be assigned to team members, and tagged with custom tags.
This minimum viable project management system could be all you need.
Certainly, for a solo or small team, capturing requirements in Issues might be enough.
But if you need more, you need Milestones.
GitHub milestones are a grouping of issues with a deadline.
They typically represent a target, a release, or something the team is working towards.
Milestones just have a title, a description, and a date.
No burndown charts, no swim lanes, no complex statistics, just a progress bar.
This might be enough project management for you. If not, it is time for GitHub Projects.
Each GitHub repo, team, and organisation can have a project board,
a lightweight kanban board with customisable columns, allowing you to group your issues together,
and observe their progress through your current iteration.
This represents the information radiator for your team, a bird's-eye view of what is happening with the project,
and something you might gather around for your morning catchup meeting.
You don't need all the features of Trello, JIRA, or anything like that. You need the minimum viable board.
This bare-bones tool completely side-steps 'the JIRA effect',
which is if you have a tool that is packed full of time tracking, velocity points, and so on
the temptation is to use all these features, even if they give no value and complicate your processes.
If you have one meeting a day, it should be a standup. Good standups replace other meetings and accelerate your project dramatically.
The way I like to do standups is not by asking everyone what they did yesterday and what they intend to do today.
That's a great way to find out at length what Dave did on his day off,
but not a good way to find out what's happening with the project specifically.
I recommend walking your board, backwards, from right to left. Everyone is timeboxed, keeping the meeting tight.
If you don't have an issue on the board, you don't speak yet. Perhaps you could write or pick up a task from the backlog and talk about it tomorrow.
At the end, the team member who is facilitating the meeting asks if anyone has any blockers, and we're done.
The most important part of this most important meeting is asking if you have any blockers.
A good standup means that no-one can get lost or delayed by more than 24 hours.
Note I didn't say the PM or DM or scrum master or whoever facilitates.
That person doesn't exist in my team. These are not roles, they are hats.
I don't know if your team needs any other meetings, but it is vital that you do a standup.
Back to GitHub.
GitHub provides an umbrella group of users called an organisation.
This is your company, and if you're building your products in the open, as I recommend you do, you won't pay GitHub a thing.
Most git hosts provide their services for free for open-source companies.
If you have too much money, you can pay GitHub for a plan to make your data closed.
If you require more subdivision, Organisations are divided into Teams.
Teams on GitHub allow you to granularly scope repo, project, wiki, and other permissions to the different teams in your organisation.
I recommend allowing everyone to write and contribute to all projects,
you want the network effect and low admin overhead. This pattern is called "internal open source".
But if you wish, perhaps for regulatory reasons, read and write access to repos can be restricted by team.
Now we're getting into the detail of GitHub.
I adore pull requests, sometimes called merge requests in other systems.
PRs represent a change to the files in a repo, with an explanation of what you did, some links, and a discussion.
After the discussion is satisfied, perhaps as simply as a colleague saying "LGTM"
or as heavy weight as a full change review with an audit trail that would satisfy a bank,
the changes are merged into the repo.
PRs can have powerful automation, called Actions.
PRs and actions can run your company for you if you let them.
Though Actions were built for running tests on source code, with a little imagination, they can be used for anything:
- If you're uploading vector images, an action can build all the rasterised resolutions the client wants.
- If you're uploading video or audio clips, an action can run them through plugins to remove noise,
add a music track, and upload the draft to YouTube.
If you're checking in company documents, an action can simply spellcheck it.
Actions can run hundreds of times an hour, always adhere to best practice, and never make mistakes.
Automating your company gives you an enormous competitive speed and quality advantage.
You could also, for example, set up style guide enforcement, blocking the PR if the phrase "on premise" has been found.
When your company's code, visual assets, and administration, are all in git repositories, you gain another huge superpower.
All of this becomes accessible offline. Every file, every photo, every design, and document can be on your computer.
The magic of offline isn't necessarily that you don't need the internet (though that is a handy feature on a plane)
but that it's FAST, the data is RIGHT HERE on your computer and you can do ANYTHING with it.
If you need to change the company's name across 10,000 files, it's trivial. It's find and replace.
If you, instead, had 5-15 different web services that you scattered all your team's data across,
you'd have to log in to each one, and hope they had the feature to find and replace within their own walled garden.
Most, somehow, don't have this basic feature.
GOOGLE DOCS doesn't have this basic feature: you can't find and replace across a drive of files!
And the reason for this, I suspect, is that would be TERRIFYING, wouldn't it?
What if a new hire accidentally did that, you'd have to roll back all those files manually, that could take days!
But with git, it would be a PR, clearly showing what was happening, and mistakes are trivial to fix.
Plain-text files, with just enough Markdown syntax to convey meaning,
allow you and your team to work with this data in the way that they want,
not the way that Google or Atlassian or whoever thinks is best.
Doesn't this take up a lot of space on your disk? Not plain text.
But even if you're storing large files, storage is cheap if you're smart. A topic for another video, perhaps.
The benefits of git, especially for teams already using it for code and text collaboration, are that
1. you're already paying for it, and 2. it's never going away.
It is impossible to imagine a management reshuffle that might decide on another tool just because it is the flavour of the month.
Git and GitHub dominate the coding world,
and I recommend GitHub not only because it is the biggest but also the most featureful.
Even if you don't think git and plain text are the best option, I still suggest you use them
because stability is far, far better than a constantly churning tool choice,
as staff come, and go and fashions change, and Google decommission another product.
RIP Jamboard :'c
You can't do all these utopian things in most companies, I'm painfully aware.
But you CAN do SOME of these things, even just in your immediate team, or only for yourself.
I'd be interested to know what other ways good teams buck the hype cycle in favour of sane, evidence-based improvements.

Transcription:

I could be selling this process for Millions but instead what I'm going to do is give it away for
free I'm on a new user account on my computer I have absolutely nothing
installed so I'm acting like I'm an outsider and I'm going to go nice and slow and I'm going to show you how I do
absolutely everything and then I'm going to show you how the script works as well and how you can get it to work for your
business so the first thing is you need to get gitm I have talk about this process say
before on my channel but I just think the script is too good to not talk about
so go to download and then just download um whichever version you need to download for your
computer and then open it hit yes then just keep pressing
next then you should get to the end here and it should start to install git while that's installing we can get python so
so go to python.org downloads just download the latest
version it works with um the assistant API it was um autogen that didn't work
with an earlier version of python so the first thing we downloaded is just a way for you to clone a GitHub
repository and put it on your computer it's the easiest way to share code this is just generally how people share code
especially if there's more than one file inside a folder this is the best way to do it and then the second thing we
downloaded is python which is both a programming language and a like a
Computing system I guess I don't really know what it is um but you need it on your system in order to run python
script so so we're going to press finish here that's get installed and visual our
python is almost downloaded and then the other thing we need is Visual Studio code code Visual Studio code is an
IDE so an IDE is basically a way to
interact with a folder which has code inside so if you just scroll down on the
homepage and press download it's just a way to change the code without doing complicated things
and it's just a really really easy way to do it so to kind of explain what it is on
the side on the left you have like your work space and then on the right you
have whatever you are currently whichever file inside the workspace you are currently clicked on now previously
what I was trying to do was just trying to make an entire script just inside one
folder without using visual studio code but it's really really complicated and
once you have more folders and files it it just becomes extremely complicated very very quickly so the easiest way to
interact with code is using Visual Studio code so we have python installed we do need to do something specific with
python so I am going to run through the installation process so the you have to do this here
add python. XE to path I'm pretty sure if you don't do that like some some crazy thing happens basically where it
doesn't really work properly so make sure that you add it to path at the bottom so now you can we can just close
this here and then let's go to the download here and open the visual studio code setup this is fine this is all easy
just press yes yes next actually sorry make sure you do add open with code here
and add open with code here and also you may as well corre uh create a desktop
item as well and then install it the reason is is because you can then open fold folders onside your desktop like if
I want to use this folder I can right click it and there'll be an option here
in a second that says open with code which is actually really really useful there it is open with visuals
studio so now we'll launch it we are now inside Visual Studio code this is where
we're going to be doing pretty much everything else
so what we can do now is we can press terminal new
terminal I know that we don't have anything open right now but we're going to create the folder with my files
already inside and they're organized in a way that I will explain to you in a moment
so you can either go to this link or you can just do get clone so like this you can just write
get clone or you can just copy this I'll leave this in the description as well and then copy the link like this and
then say just call it like Auto blogger or something before I do that though I just want to quickly show you what's
going to happen so let's go to the GitHub H repository which is what this
is and you can see there are several files in here
okay so you can see this one was updated 26 minutes ago okay so this is the one that
you should be using testing 3. Pi I left the others in there because I'm a messy programmer and I don't know what I'm
doing because I'm a complete Noob so what's going to happen is I'm going to say get clone and then this link and
then this is the name of the file that you want to put the auto blogger inside
so when I hit enter here provided that I've done everything right which I haven't okay so I didn't
add it to path properly in the installation process and I do remember doing this so just click uh the search
button the Windows button and click edit the system variables
here click environmental variables I can't pause the recording
while I'm doing this you're just going to have to suffer with me guys double click the path entry under system
variables double click the path entry with the new button in the editor
add this so new
this does seem to already be there though which is a little bit worrying and
this close and reopen the console okay so let's see if this works close the
console let's just close Visual Studio code open it up again please work or I'm
going to look really stupid terminal new terminal rerun the same thing there we
go it works nice perfect okay so now we have Auto blogger we have the auto blogger on our system now we can start
to play with it so what you want to do is you want to press open folder here and you want
to look for auto blogger which is right here select folder so like I said before you want to
hit yes trust orders there I think I don't know if it actually matters so like I said before you we're going to be
using testing 3. piy so the first thing you want to do is you want to add your open API key to the eighth
line okay I just made everything bigger uh so you can kind of see a little bit better so add your API key here and then
the first thing you need to do is you need to get your internal links so you should already already have a list of
your internal links but if you don't you can just go to your s map so I go to tan. it/ sitemap.xml
and you can do this semi-manually you can do this yourself you should already have a list of your important Pages
anyway if you're a smaller website then it's really really easy to get a list of your internal links just do it manually
and then we're going to get sitemap to clip board just because it's the easiest way
to do it for me it's a Chrome extension which just
really really helps with this process in general so once you've added it to Chrome then just
click on it press https and press start that should copy your url to the
clipboard and then you can just click inside internal links. text here click inside it press contrl a and then press
contrl V and then make sure this is very very important press contrl
s okay so you copied pasted over everything and then you saved it I don't
know why they what is this why are they adding this category why do they do this to me why did they do this to
me look at the they've oh my God they've just duplicated I need to delete
these anyway sorry I'm getting distracted but this is so annoying this this wasn't me this is just some idiot
um my old job who's just doing stupid things anyway so the next thing we need
is uh products. text which is just a list of your products now you do not
have to do this the complicated way but I do recommend doing it the way that I'm going to show you so 2 Men test.py is
another script this does not do any writing it doesn't do anything crazy all it does is it just chooses 200 URLs or
200 products from the list of your from from your sitap basically so we'll go
back on the sit map here the first one on Shopify anyway this this part of the
process only works on Shopify guys but just if you're on WordPress you can just scrape your own website it or you know
whatever you want just have a list of your products it's not that complicated okay right click save as and then save
as and then click the download like drag it and then press alt Tab and then keep
dragging it and then put it here okay you can also you can do it in in other
ways but that's just how I do it and then right click it and then copy relative path and then we're going to go
back into TW men test.py and on line 28 you'll see it says XML file path
equals sitemap products 20. XML so that's the old one so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to highlight the relative path which is what you can see here okay so it means like the the
yeah the the name of the file and I'm just going to highlight it and then do contrl +v that then
replaces the sitap so now it's going to read your sit map instead of my sitemap then we go
to these three little buttons here terminal new terminal and I'm going to do python to men
test.py and it'll just give me 200 links 200 products now if you want more
products I I don't recommend going too high just because it makes chat GPT a bit more confused you can just change
online four it says def extract sitemap data XML file path num URLs number of
URLs equals 200 so you can put this to 400 for example i' would recommend
leaving it under 300 because otherwise the data input is just too much
information for um the assistant and then you can run it again it will just give you another few hundred product
works and then you want to click and hold here like just to the right of the
last letter of the output so click hold and then drag up and then just drag all
the way up to the first letter and then let go of your mouse and then press
contrl C okay to copy then you want to click in products. text you want to
click inside it you want to press control a and then you want to press contrl V like that so this is probably a
few too many lines you don't really want this many lines you want maybe like 800
is a is a good one okay you can also specify um if you want specific products
you could change this script to look for certain words like sneakers Etc but I I
would recommend keeping it simple and just letting chat gbt do its thing now if you don't have that many products
then problem solved basically automatically the final thing we need so this is so far we've done the internal
links and we've done the products that's Now set up that's two files the final
file is the content plan what you can do the first thing you can do is you can click on the before the first letter of
the third line and then drag all the way down like that to the last letter but you can kind of do it where it just
knows what you want it want it to do and then delete Del delete and then contrl s
to save okay so what that does is it allows you to just write one blog post
at a time um just so you can practice the output because my output might not
be the same as your output the way it reads products. text might be different the way your Shopify uh sitemap is set
up or the way you input your products might be different okay so you do always need to test so I recommend just testing
on one at first and then if you like the output then try it on a few more so
we're going to click inside here we're going to do crl a contrl c and then we're going to go over to our trusty
friend chat GPT so I actually like to use chat GPT
3.5 because it's a little bit quicker and what I like to say is keep this exact
format
okay and then you just think of some topics so best sneaker Brands 2024 best
black sneakers 2024 best
crocodile um I'll just put best crocodile 2024 cuz I can't remember what items of we have
and then I'll give it the format here this is the format and then we'll hit
enter so it's completely messed that up and I'm just going to say please keep
the exact format of this content
plan okay there we go so I said um stop adding lists I'm just asking you to make
make a Content plan blah blah blah so once you've got it you can always return back to this um chat with chat gbt I'm
just going to say remove as it interferes with with the
formatting okay there we go so now we have it perfect I'm going to press copy and then from now on you can just say
now add another line best shirts of 2024 for
example and yeah so you can now just use this chat as much as you want to do this so
we're going to click well we don't even need to click back in here we just hit contrl V here and then delete once and
then contrl s now there might be a problem with the formatting so you just going to have you kind of have to just
trust the trust the process here so I'm now going to delete this one
right here and I'm going to press contrl s again now we're pretty much ready to go you can run your script now and and
the result should be a consistently good article now I will say sometimes it does
struggle with choosing the right product sometimes you might have to just change the Articles a little bit but generally
speaking this is one of the most consistent ways I found of ranking easily on Google now before we actually run the
script let's have a little look at what is actually happening here so the first
thing that happens is the files are uploaded to open AI or they're like
associated with this um assistant that we're about to create so the files are
internal links. text products. text and TW men content plan expanded one. CSV I
don't know why I've done it like that I don't know why all my file names are stupid but whatever and then it creates
the assistant so the assistant is the identity of the chat GPT model almost
that you want want to create now that's not really what it is but that's kind of what I'm getting the feeling of but what
I will say is that you do still have to do some prompt engineering so you you are G I am giving you this prompt here
but if you want to change it just if you want to make it informational for example just change this to every
article should have three brand images minimum and then change this file name
to Brand images. text and then inside testing do3 fre change this to Brand
images. text and then just change everything else to just make it right
informational content you don't need me to do that you it does not take that long okay you just need to change
something in this prompt now I'm going to put this prompt inside a notepad just so we can have a little look at it it's
a bit easier to read so we'll do oops let's do some wrapping View
format word r there we go so instructions every article should have three product image images minimum when
finding products ensure they are relevant to the specific article you are writing you must ensure the product image links are written fully and
correctly sometimes it will give you dud images all you have to do is just in the markdown output just change that image
link it doesn't take very long it's very very easy to do every article must have product images include at least three
real product images in the final articles choose I know that that's a repeat but just trust me this is how you
how you have to do these things choose only relevant product images do not invent image links never invent links or
product images never use sources or footnotes read internal links. text and products. text you always choose five
strictly relevant don't ask why I'm just repeating over and over and over um this is what you have to do this
is how I've managed to get it to give me good output it's just repeating myself over and over and over so all you have
to do is just change the framing of this don't change the repetition don't change blah blah blah just change what you're
giving it and change product images to Brand images for example so let's have a look at the second prompt so you can
start to see how this script actually works so read the product URLs to find
suitable products for articles I should change this to um all and
titles I think this is why it sometimes doesn't choose the a good image I will
change that in the real script as well but read the product URLs and titles to
find suitable products for articles never invent links or product images choose five internal links and five
product images that are relevant to blog post idea for example for exotic leather shoes look for crocodile shoes Etc
Pursuit articles look Pursuits now you can change that to whatever is relevant specifically to your uh business again I
want to show you something quite interesting the What's Happening Here is because the CSV has been opened
previously in the script I'm not I don't know where that is but it has been we can now call blog post
idea inside these two brackets that is how I have managed to get the script to
write out content for a Content plan okay so
again you can change anything you want um in any of these prompts
okay and then the penultimate prompt is outline request do not invent image
links use the prod images and internal links from get internal links which is
this um function right here de def get internal links it's the function before
the prompt before that we just went through and use them to create an outline for an article about blog post
idea in the outline do not use sources or footnotes but just add relevant product images in a relevant section and
a relevant internal Link in a relevant section it doesn't follow this but it does work in the end so there is no need
for a lot of sources each article needs a maximum of five product images and internal links it completely ignores
that so yeah it is what it is and then the final one is the the the writing
prompt so use great s Neville English do not use overly creative or crazy language write as if writing for the
Guardian newspaper just give information don't write like a magazine use Simple language do not invent image links you
are writing from a firstperson plural perspective for the business refer to it in the first person plural add a key
takeaway table at the top of the article summarizing the main points never invent
internal links or product images choose five internal links and five product imag that are relevant to an article and
then write a detailed article based on the following outline but put it into and then it calls the outline here okay
so this at the bottom of here you'll see it will say print outline yeah print outline for blah blah blah and then
outline so then we call outline and that's how we get it to write about what we want but put it into a proper title
which invites a click title should be around six 60 characters include the product images and internal links
naturally and with relevance inside the article use markdown formatting and ensure to use tables and lists to add to
formatting use three relevant product images and internal links maximum never invent any internal
links or product images anyway that is the process now
now let's just run the script and I'll show you how it actually works so we're going to do python testing 3.
pi oh of course I haven't even installed open AI so yeah I'm glad that I tried to
run the script in this video so you're going to have to install open Ai and to
do that you just have to do pip install open AI That's literally it so we'll add
that to the video thing here now you have the script
then install open AI using tip install
open and we need to add the API key as well so just go to your
playground if you don't have open AI if you don't have access to gbt 4 okay what you need to do is you need to use the
API inside playground as usual I will be deleting the secret key at the end of
this video so don't try and um use it and then we should be ready to run the
script so it'll be python testing 3. Pi this is on a new system so I'm not using
anything to my advantage I'm not hiding anything I've just shown you exactly how
I would set up this process from A to B and let's just see let's see what the
output is I'm I'm curious so at the moment what I've been doing is I've also been using chat GPT 3.5 to format the
Articles now you don't have to do this another thing you could do is you could
wait until it outputs the entire um plan so the end of this run in
about 9 minutes it takes about 3 minutes per article what it will do is it will output an article that is um it will
output a CSV called two men content plan expanded um processed plan or processed
or something and this will be a new file you can then import that into Google
Sheets and then you can just use a a a API call in Google Sheets to
format the content as well and then you have you know all of the Articles very very easily formatted however what I
suggest you do instead and what I am doing personally because I am writing for clients and I don't want to write
crap and I want the content to be good what I'm doing is I'm watching the content as it comes out and making sure
it's good so let's have a look article for best sneaker brands for 2024 let's copy this and you can tell me what you
think this is live I haven't hidden anything so if this is bad I'm going to
look pretty stupid so I'm going to say format this article properly and then
hit enter so key sneaker Brands to watch in
2024 really good title key takeaways this is aand we sell this is a brand we sell this is a brand we sell Hugo Boss
with an image of a pair of Hugo Boss sneakers absolutely
wonderful and then a link to the an internal link to our sneakers collection
let's scroll down bloody beautiful a pair of Kiton sneakers with a link to
the Kiton collection it worked I'm so happy prata another brand we sell with a
link to Prem sneakers and that's it very very simple
article not that many words this is how I am currently destroying Google
okay now what I will say is you do kind of need like a legitimate business um to
do this and so you need to like be selling things that's kind of yeah the
drawback to this so each one you can see the outline the this time it's black sneakers so
I've taken a big risk here because sometimes it struggles with color but we will see the output in a second okay I'm
I'm risking it I'm risking it for a chocolate biscuit let's see what the output is what I will say is I've had
good success with colors and bad success with colors or bad results with colors
so it it does work sometimes but I will say now I am taking a big risk um for
this video this 30 minute long video but even if this one even if this output
gives me like a different color Che or something I'm not too bothered because the first output was absolutely perfect
so if you want to see the output or I like to do things in convert markdown to HTML so go to markdown to html.com click
here crl a contrl V and then if you want to edit things like change a link or like an image link or something you can
just very very easily just change this link and you could just change this title to a different Hugo Boss sneaker
it's really really easy to do you can very easily edit the article uh here and then you can just use markdown you take
the HTML and you can put it into Shopify so let's see let's see let's see let's
see this is probably going to let me down but it's okay so now format this
article come on don't give me any different colored shoes come on you can do it you can do it come on I don't have
High Hopes I'm not going to lie let's see okay they're black they have black on them oh they
they're blue they're blue anyway like I said before you can just hit copy here
and you could just you know very easily change the product image link I'll show
you what that looks like uh we'll go to collections Kiton actually we'll just go to sneakers
and just find a pair of black sneakers okay so you can literally just
right click uh copy link no sorry copy image address click back here so which one was
wrong it was the third one so all you have to do is just change
this to this and I'll just change this to Black
temporarily and then you can see now we have the black pair of shoes
instead anyway I will say yeah occasionally you do need to edit things um but in general it's the most
consistent thing I have seen so far so this time we're doing crocodile so let's
see I did check the products. text if you check products. text contrl F
crocodile you'll see there are some crocodile items here so I mean if it Nails this one I will be very very
happy it's now done it took 6 minutes to write three articles come on guys that
is pretty impressive and then we'll have a look at the cost as well in just a second so we'll say now do this article
and we'll see how it does come on you can do
it oh they do have crocodile on them that is crocodile that is crocodile that
is crocodile and that's that does have crocodile on
as well yep I remember seeing these products they have crocodile like Zips
um I think this is crocodile as well perfect yeah absolutely bloody perfect
thank you so much for watching guys I'm really really proud of what I've done here I'm really really happy with the
the results you can see it has internal links it has it can choose images
specifically from the products it's amazing thank you so much for watching guys I'll see you
very very soon with some more content if you're watching until the very end you're a legend as usual and peace out

Transcription:

Introduction
hello everyone in this video I'm going to  show you how you can use a combination of  
data visualization and chat jpt to develop your  ideas in an interesting way so that instead of  
having an interface like this where you have  to read through lengthy responses you can do  
it more iteratively in short fragments so you can  really focus on developing your own thinking and  
not taking the reades that are produced by GPT  so keep watching to learn how it works we'll  
be using the app that's called InfraNodus, that  I developed and to do that you can go into the  
"Generate a new idea" app
apps import page and choose AI ideation live AI  ideation and once you choose this you start with  
the topic that you're you're interested in you  can either write an abstract or just like the  
key phrase that describes what you're interested  in for me it's heart rate variability um because  
I'm currently working on an app that would allow  people to measure it in ways that goes beyond what  
what the fitness trackers can do and I want to  learn a little bit more about this subject for  
instance and not so much to learn about it because  I already know what it's about but to see what are  
the specific nuances that I should take into  consideration when I'm developing this whole  
discourse right so for example here I'm starting  from the basics I type in heart rate variability  
it gives me an explanation of what that is so if  I see something I like that I want to add into  
How to process AI content
my stack of ideas I'm going to save it to the  graph here is just a definition of what heart  
rate variability is as a measure of variation in  between every heartbeat used as an indicator of  
physiological resilience and emotional stress  this is great because it reminds me directly  
you know how I could also Market this app that  it can increase your resilience and adaptivity  
and reduce stress here I can generate more  responses um but basically it's say more or  
less the same thing but maybe in different words  I'm going to save another one because I like the  
idea of phys phys The Logical flexibility that  seems very interesting too so I'm going to save  
that as well and then what happens here is  when I want to develop it further um I have  
some thoughts in mind so I can actually write  my own ideas for how it can go further or I  
Using the knowledge graph to generate AI ideas
can also choose some stuff on the graph like  for instance emotional resilience heartbeat  
and let's see maybe another word variability I  can select the terms I like on the graph that  
I would like to be better connected and then I  go into the inside panel and just select this  
one again so they marked and then it can generate  content related to these four ideas so it's just  
going to come up with some thought that links  this idea of emotional resilience and heart  
rate variability because that's the aspect that  I'm really interested in the connection of this  
body marker to how we feel both on the level  of emotions and also physiologically right  
so here here it says emotional resilience can  significantly influence heartbit variability  
indicating an individual's ability to adaptively  respond in stressful situations this is great this  
could almost read like an explanation of why  this app or this approach would be interesting  
so I can save it into the graph generate  more responses emotional resilience can  
be gsh through heartbeat variability a stable  heart rate indicates better Stress Management  
and adaptability emotional so I want to show you  something here because this is not exactly true  
I already know this the the subject so it made  a slight factual mistake it's not exactly that  
the stable heart rate indicates better Stress  Management but that makes me think that maybe  
I can go deeper into the subject and use the AI  to generate some ideas in relation to that right  
so I will make a manual query and I'm going to  say okay what's the connection between HRV and  
Make your own AI query
emotional and physiological resilience here I'm  using chat GPT GT4 mode so that usually generates  
better answers and factual responses so here  it says how it's an indicator of physiological  
flexibility a higher HRV signifies healthier  emotional and physiological resilience as it  
reflects the body's ability to adapt efficiently  to stressor so this is great now I'm going to show  
you something else I'm adding it into the graph  and I want to dive a little bit deeper into the  
Elaborating an AI-generated idea
subject so I'm going to click elaborate here and  then by default it proposes me to make sort of  
like an instruction or a prompt for chat jpt  or GPT 4 to develop this further right and the  
default one is elaborate on the statement I  could also write explain why this is the case
scientifically I'm improvising let's see  if it's going to work out if it's going  
to give an interesting answer or not sometimes  it takes time to think so here it says that HRV  
is grounded scientifically in a nervous systems  operations specifically the connections between  
sympathetic and parasympathetic systems so this  is great because now we're getting deeper into  
the science of things and look what happens when  I add this into the graph it will add a completely  
new cluster so here it's shown here with with  the light green color right which shows me that  
my discourse is developing in a New Direction so  I was in this region first like on this pink and  
on this kind of dark green cluster and now I'm  getting into this parasympathetic sympathetic  
one right so there I can actually select those  and maybe also HRV and then again use this  
function to generate some content in relation to  parasympathetic and sympathetic so I can develop  
this cluster a little bit further and this is  basically how you would use the graph live and  
A big difference from using ChatGPT
this is a big difference from how you would be  having a conversation if you did that using GPT  
you know like you would basically like I think I  have here a conversation on on HRV so I have to  
read through all of this I have to find the stuff  that I want to develop further by reading text  
here directly visually I can see where I should  make connections I'm seeing this new cluster I  
know that I want to connect it to the main idea  so I just select some nodes and ask it to do that  
for me right and again this is not to make AI  think for you this is just a stimulator to come  
up with some fragments of ideas which I can then  later rephrase myself make new connections between  
them and then generate some original content  based on what I'm thinking about so here it says  
it's kind of like a general statement interact to  influence okay that's great so here is explaining  
me the biological sort of reason why it works like  that and I can again elaborate how it works uh
biologically so you see here I'm giving it a  prompt of what it should do with the statement  
that it itself generated so this is great because  it's a real human in the loop interaction with the  
"Human in the loop" AI
AI where I'm making it produce ideas but I'm not  making it write a whole textt for me I'm always  
in control of every paragraph of every statement  it makes and I'm only choosing the stuff I like  
and I'm using it to inspire myself to see in which  direction it could be interesting to develop this  
discourse further right so here it's explaining  exactly what happens that the parasympathetic  
system slows the heart rate promoting rest and  digest functions and the sympathetic system  
accelerates it for flight of or fight responses  this balance create HRV and indicator of physical  
and mental resist resilience this is great I  could even use the sentence in my own text or  
in my promotion materials and so on right so then  I can generate some more stuff here is just kind  
of like a rephrase of that but I'm going to keep  that also because that's interesting and finally  
I can also generate actually more responses and  see if it comes up with something completely  
different on another iteration sometimes you  might run it a few times to see if there's an  
interesting thing to do here okay so then  one other thing that I like to do is to be  
like okay I look at the graph again let's let's  take a zoom out View and this I always encourage  
people to do it in foren notes because this is  what the graph is really good for now you see  
things on a really detailed granular level you  see the main ideas like variability heartbeat  
parasympathetic sympathetic nervous systems  and so on but this is a very granular level  
so sometimes it's nice to zoom out and to see see  what are the main ideas you're working on so here  
I click on High level ideas you also have the  button here in the analytics panel the analytics  
panel is available here right and then it shows  me what this conversation is about all right so  
I see that it's about Hardware at variability  stress adaptation resilience autonomous nervous  
system so this is great because it gives me a  very clear idea of where the conversation is  
going and also makes me think of whether I'm  missing anything I see I'm talking about the  
How to check if you're missing anything from your ideation process
actual thing I'm interested in and also stress  and resilience makes me think that I want to go  
more into technical details and this is great  because this is exactly what this graph allows  
me to do to always have this sort of feedback  reflection on my thinking process and if I use  
it right if I ask myself what am I missing not not  only what's there but what am I missing then I'm  
going to develop ideas in a very interesting  way so here I'm going to say okay maybe let's  
focus on the technical aspect aspect and I will  write a question how is a heart rate variability  
normally calculated by the way you can also take  the current context into account but I prefer not  
to do that because I like to keep the answers more  open because then I can cover more territory at  
the beginning and only later I start connecting  them together and kind of trying to make it more  
coherent and this is also why the graph is really  good because it shows you which which part of the  
process you're in somehow you know now we're just  throwing some ideas on the mental map um trying to  
Using the graph as a map to navigate your thinking process
expand as much as possible at some point we will  need to start also connecting the ideas better  
because we want the discourse to be coherent  and not all over the place but to be focused on  
one thing so this is what we will do later so  here it says that HRV is typically calculated  
using time domain methods measuring intervals  between successive heartbeats or frequency the  
main methods considering distribution in various  frequency bands so this is good I'm getting to  
technical details I'm going to save this research  further on those here it's explaining me a little  
bit more what those time domain methods are I'm  going to save that as well for example standard  
deviation of interbit intervals and I know that  for example Apple watch uses this approach but I'm  
going to ask it to elaborate and please explain  if any other methods can be used in addition to  
the ones listed below okay so I'm going to give  it its own response and then ask it to say to me  
if we can develop it further and find some other  methods that are used in science to analyze hrp  
and here we get to the more interesting stuff like  for instance nonlinear analysis like the trended  
fluctuation analysis or Point curve plots that can  be used for assessment so I'm going going to save  
this this I'm going to also edit it a little  bit so I will remove P care plots and let's
see how we can elaborate on this why would DFA  be interesting in this context right so again  
I'm using a prompt to specify how we can develop  an idea that was given out by Chad in interesting  
way here it's explaining how DFA this nonlinear  analysis techniques adds a new dimension okay so  
this is it just says it's unveiling potentially  enlightening Insight so a little bit too General  
nonlinear lens unveiling concealed aspects in time  domain and frequency domain method and the third  
answer intricate complexity so let's say like  which aspects are unveiled spe specifically and  
let's go into more Precision here and by the way  you will also see that the deeper we go the more  
topics the more specific topics appears here so  here we see that um it's adding hidden elements  
so so it's revealing some hidden elements so let's  say we we save this and we decide to ask how does  
DFA DET trended fluctuation analysis work and why  it can be interesting for measuring hrb okay save  
this into the graph and I'm doing it all in real  time so bear with me if it takes a little moment  
but I'm doing that so you can also use the same  workflow in your own Explorations and here we say  
that it's a statistical approach for detecting  l long range correlations in Time series data  
so there I get more specific and and let's see  if there's something else and again something  
else so maybe I like this first one long range  correlations in sensor in in Time series data  
so I just choose that part and ask it to elaborate  it further so as you can see it's generating some  
ideas fragments of those ideas I'm taking them  in saving what I like and asking it to develop  
it further and here you see it says that it  can unveil statistical nature of seemingly  
random Trends um is an inovative technique that  unveils the presence of long range correlations  
mathematical intricacy okay and then another  one unveils hidden long range correlations  
and recurrent Trends so this is interesting this  is what it's doing actually it's it's un bailing  
some hidden Trends and long range correlation  so I can save this as you can see I'm developing  
this part on the hidden correlations and this  is the part that is maybe also something very  
special for my content or for the project that  I'm working on because I really want to focus on  
um sort of providing more data than other tools  or or approaches do so this is great because it  
helps me find where I could specialize somehow  right so here I see this hidden correlations  
and maybe I can even remove HRV and then hide it  from the graph slice it off and then I can also  
Reveal non-obvious: slice off the knowns to get to the unknowns
hide time because we talked about it a lot heart  rate variability and what it enables me to do is  
to find what are the topics that I could develop  for further so this I really recommend you to do  
during the interaction that you have with this  tool that once you get or or you cover the main  
topics which might even seem generic because you  already know what they're about you remove them  
all from the graph to see what other the topics  that you should go into further so for example one  
here I see is is this one is very interesting  is is the connection of HRV to resilience and  
psychological and emotional well-being this  is great and then this technical aspect of um  
sympathetic nervous system response balance so  maybe we can even sort of focus on this two and  
to do that you go into blind spots and you can  highlight the gaps between different ideas in  
the network so the Clusters which could be better  connected but are not and then ask InfraNodus to  
generate some idea for you that would connect  them both so for example here we're lacking  
some connection between autonomous nervous system  and heart rate variability and this is because we  
removed all these terms but this is great because  we will force it now to generate some idea that  
would connect those two clusters together  I could also do it myself so I could look  
at those two topics and think of a connection  myself I can also use the eye and generate some  
interesting question that can stimulate me to  think further in this direction right so here  
it's asking what are the physiological responses  of the sympathetic nervous system that influence  
emotional resilience and heartbeat interval as  indicators of typically fofl function and their  
impact on overall body health so this is really  good because it's allowing me to go much deeper  
into the specific aspect of how our nervous system  works and why HRV is an important metric so I'm  
going to save this into my notes this is another  function you have here that you can save it into  
notes if it's some idea that you want to develop  further um I don't want to be part of this main  
discourse because this is just a kind of like a  notepad of ideas but when I get get to something  
that I know I need to research further then I'm  going to save it into notes and go on with that  
and then if I'm done with this Gap by the way I  can also turn on their names and then find another  
Gap some stuff that are missing so for example  stress adaptation and data analytics so this  
Finding structural gaps in your thinking
is great seemingly unrelated topics but exactly  because they are unrelated we will generate some  
idea that would connect them in an interesting way  and Link them together so so let's see if there is  
some interesting question that comes up what is  the correlation between traditional approaches  
to creating healthy balance of stress and dynamic  pattern signifying efficient and good long-term  
outcomes and statistical Series so this is a bit  too much like just using the keywords to generate  
something but I always use it as inspiration to  make me think how I could fix this question to  
make it interesting because actually the worse  is the phrasing the more interesting is going  
to be the outcome because it's not so good the  phrasing because those topics are not related  
but this is usually where the good ideas are  right so it's kind of like a balance you have  
to strike between connecting things that are  hard to connect and also making them coherent  
so in this case I'm going to see what are the  correlations between Dynamic pattern of stress  
healthy good lifestyle in the long run so this can  be interesting to explore further I can save it to  
notes or I can ask the system to elaborate on this  topic and generate interesting content in relation  
to this question that it asked itself to come up  with some interesting idea so here it's talking  
about um fluctuations and how more variability  means that you can handle stress better so this  
I'm going to save in the graph because it's quite  interesting and also into my notes as well because  
I find it useful for further discourse so in the  end once I go through a few iterations I can get  
the nodes back into the graph that I removed and  then I see the full representation of all my ideas  
and if I have to come back to this graph any time  later for further developing it into some text or  
maybe some ideas or marketing material I can  always look at the graph see what it's about  
see what the main topics are and then usually  I like to focus on some idea at the periphery  
maybe here individual ability I will select those  notes to see in which context they were used so it  
shows me here here exactly the sentence that uses  individual ability to adaptively respond and then  
I'm going to develop this discourse further by  either thinking how it can go on in this direction  
or by choosing to use gp4 to generate some ideas  um in relation to this topics and by the way I  
could also do very simple thing by taking the  current context into account so once I select  
those and take the current context into account  it's going to generate something that will also  
relate to heart rate variability so the original  topic that I've been talking about you see and  
then when I add this you will see that it links  everything on the periphery to the center which  
usually makes the text more coherent so these  are some different approaches that you can use  
to generate ideas you see we built like a very  sort of comprehensive and coherent at the same  
time mind map of ideas by the way this measure  topical diversity shows how how diverse it is or  
how focused it is at the moment it's medium you  have an explanation of what that means when you  
click here but basically you want to aim for the  yellow or the green because if it's in the red  
it means it's too biased if it's in the blue it  means it's too dispers so you want to be somewhere  
focused but also to have enough diversity in  your ideas uhif you're writing let's say an  
informative text right so this is how you would  approach this try it out on InfraNodus.Com and  
let me know how it works also subscribe to this  channel so you can get informed about new videos  
when they come out and if you have any questions  or comments please let me know and thank you

Intro
- Hello, lovely students
and welcome back to English with Lucy.
I've got a really fun lesson for you today
because we're going to delve
or dive into the world of jokes.
This is a really important part of British culture.
It's how we connect and follow social cues.
We're going to talk about play on words, puns,
all that good stuff.
Now, I know that jokes tend to be silly, but trust me,
this is actually quite serious business
because understanding jokes and nuance
is a really important aspect
of the advanced levels of fluency.
Familiarising yourself with multiple meanings
of words is important at any level,
so practising with the flexibility of words
and sentences is a great way to put your brain to work
and increase your comprehension skills.
Something that might help you even further
is that I have created a free PDF for today's lesson.
It contains everything that we're going to cover today,
plus a quiz so you can test your understanding.
If you'd like to download that, all you have to do is click
on the link in the description box,
you enter your name and your email address.
You sign up to my mailing list
and the PDF will arrive directly
in your inbox, and after that,
you'll automatically receive my free weekly lesson PDFs.
You'll also hear about my news, updates and course offers.
It's a free service and you can unsubscribe at any time.
Right, let's get started with the lesson.
What are puns or dad jokes?
So I think the most common form of wordplay is the pun
and there is so much pun-related content circulating
around the internet.
Now, they're often referred to as dad jokes
and I personally love them.
A pun uses the multiple meanings of a term
or similar sounding words for an intended humorous effect
and puns often rely on homophones, homographs or homonyms.
"But what are homophones, homographs and homonyms?"
I hear you ask from your tiny little screen.
Homophones
Homophones are words that have the same pronunciation
but different meanings, origins or spellings.
They can cause confusion
in spoken language because they sound identical.
So context is extremely important.
Here are some examples.
We have pair, a set of two, and pear,
a type of fruit.
We have flour, the ingredient for baking cakes,
and flower, a blooming plant.
Break, to separate into pieces
and brake, a device for slowing a vehicle.
Homographs
Now, homographs have the same spelling
but different meanings
and they may have different pronunciations.
For example, bow, to bend at the waist,
and bow, a decorative knot.
Tear, to rip something
and tear, a drop of liquid from the eye.
We also have lead, a type of metal,
and lead, to guide or direct.
So as you can see, they can cause confusion in writing
because of their identical spelling.
Homonyms
And finally, we have homonyms,
which are words that have the same spelling
and pronunciation, but different meanings.
Homonyms can be considered a combination
of homophones and homographs
and thus, cause confusion in both speaking and writing.
So much fun.
Here are some examples.
We have bark, the outer covering of a tree,
and bark, (dog barking)
the sounded dog makes.
Bank, a financial institution
and bank, the side of a river.
Bat, a flying mammal, and bat, a piece of sports equipment.
Okay, now that we have all
of that background info out of the way,
let's see how you do with some of these play on words.
If you don't understand them, that's okay.
Let's just see how you do.
Joke number 1
Okay, firstly, did you hear
about the guy whose whole left side was cut off?
He's all right now. (Lucy chuckling)
Do you get it?
Do you get why it's funny?
Okay, jokes are never as funny when you have to explain them
but that's why we're here, right?
And that was a total dad joke.
This absolutely hilarious pun plays
on the homophones alright, and all right.
The joke is that the man who had his left side cut off
would be in a terrible state, but the punchline reveals
that he is alright, meaning he's doing well.
All right also means only the right side,
no left because he's had his left side removed.
He consists only of his right side, so he is all right.
Wow, that is so unfunny now that I've explained it.
Joke number 2
Okay, another one.
Did you hear about the bicycle
that couldn't stand on its own?
Yeah, it was too tired.
Okay, this is a certified dad joke right here.
Here we have the homophones too tired and two-tired.
We need to understand that too tired means exhausted
while two-tired means having two wheels or two tyres,
the rubber bit on the wheels.
The bike couldn't stand on its own
because something with two tyres will obviously fall over
and something that is very, very tired will also fall over.
So doubly funny, hilarious.
Editors, please can you insert a laugh track.
(people laughing)
Thank you. (Lucy chuckling)
Joke number 3
Okay, next.
Love this one.
Why are postmen so unhappy all the time?
Because they're given the sack every morning.
(Lucy chuckling)
My husband's in the background
and he actually laughed a little bit.
It was like a (Lucy snorting).
Do you ever do that when you see a funny video
on your phone and you don't laugh, you just go.
(Lucy snorting)
(Lucy chuckling)
Now we can see how homonyms can also be used to make puns.
Here we're playing with the double meaning
of the phrase give the sack or given the sack.
In this context, to be given the sack means to be fired
or dismissed from a job, but the joke
is that the postmen are given the sack every morning
because they are provided with a bag
or a big sack to carry the post in.
(Lucy clapping)
Joke number 4
Okay, next one.
I love this one.
My mum tried to make a joke about the TV
but it wasn't remotely funny.
(Lucy chuckling)
Okay, I guess rather than being a dad joke, this one's more
of a mum joke, but here we're using the double meaning
of the word remote.
In this context, adding -ly or -ly
to remote makes the adverb remotely,
which means not at all.
If something is not remotely funny, it's not at all funny.
However, remote is also a shortened informal way
to say remote control.
This, the device used to change channels on a TV.
That is pure comedic gold if you ask me.
Not remotely funny.
(Lucy chuckling)
She tried to make a joke about the TV,
but it wasn't remotely funny.
Maybe I should stop teaching and go into comedy.
Joke number 5
Are you ready for our final and most difficult one?
Our most difficult dad joke, it's a big one.
There is a fine line between a numerator and a denominator.
It's okay if you didn't get that.
Only a fraction will understand.
(Lucy chuckling)
Okay, this is actually a two for one, two pun alert,
double pun alert.
We have two puns in this joke.
First, in mathematics,
a fraction is a numerical quantity that represents a part
of a whole expressed as a numerator over a denominator.
Part of the joke is that there is a fine line which refers
to the horizontal line that separates them in a fraction
but a fine line also means a very small difference.
For example, there's a very fine line
between confidence and arrogance.
Well, here we're saying there's a fine line
between a numerator and a denominator
because they're part of a fraction.
The second part of the joke
is that the word fraction means a small number
outside of its mathematical meaning.
Only a fraction will understand.
Only a small number of people will understand.
Okay, I know these are pretty challenging
but learning English should be enjoyable
so don't forget to download today's PDFs.
We have lots more examples in there
and we have a quiz to test your understanding.
The link is in the description box.
Also, you can connect with me on my social media.
I've got my Instagram and my Facebook.
I've also got my website where we've got lots more lessons
and an interactive pronunciation tool where you can click
on phonemes and hear me pronounce them,
and you can also check out all of my courses.
We have now released our B1 programme, our B2 programme
and our C1 programme.
They're all available for enrollment now.
They are amazing if I do say so myself.
I'm incredibly proud of them and incredibly excited
for you to take them and experience them.
I will see you soon in another lesson.
(Lucy kissing)

Transcription:

today I'm going to check out an AI
coding assistant called Cody now I know
your first question is going to be how
is this different from co-pilot well I
think the main differentiator is that
it's much more context aware it knows
your entire code base so when you ask it
help with something it looks at other
files and it makes recommendations based
on your specific context which makes it
more helpful but let's Jump Right In and
check it out all right here is the web
page let's meet Cody it uh knows your
entire code base can answer technical
questions write code directly in your
IDE using your code graph for context
and accuracy all right uh looks like it
has the basic AI assistant autocomplete
that we're used to let's see what else
uh AI powered chat for your codes we can
ask it questions about our code base we
can run custom and pre-built commands so
explain code or entire repositories
generate unit tests that's pretty nice
describe code smells for best practices
and Define your own custom commands all
right pretty cool we'll jump into those
in a bit and check it out and what's
really nice is there's a free tier with
a generous rate limit which you don't
get everywhere so let's go ahead and log
in I'll use GitHub and I'll go ahead and
authorize this and it looks like it
works with a few different idees I'm
going to use it in VSS code cool I'll go
ahead and install this and I'll go ahead
and sign in with
[Music]
GitHub
authorize cool so now it looks like we
have on in our sidebar commands so we
can chat create documentation that's
really cool edit explain smell test and
custom command and we have our chat we
can start a new chat let's load up a
repo and start asking questions I have
this repository here that I've been
checking out a course Builder from Joel
hooks so let's ask some questions about
this uh go over to Cody let's create a
new chat looks like we can choose from
different AIS to chat with Claud 2.0 2.1
instant GPT 3.5 and four right it looks
like in here we can use the at symbol to
include a specific file that we want to
talk about or ask questions about or
hash for the type of symbol okay that's
cool so we can specify specific pieces
of code we can use a SL command for all
the different built-in commands uh I'm
just going to start out by saying
explain this repo to me let's see what
it
does pretty cool okay so let's see it
looks like it it looked at one file it
looked at the readme all right so it got
all of its context from the readme um it
says that this is a proof of concept for
building an online course creation tool
a synchronous event driven workflows
mono repost structure uh includes this
in the text stack that's nice and and
let's see we got some example of events
Youtube upload transcript summary so I
can see this being extremely helpful
when you're going into a brand new
project you have no idea what's going on
U just start asking questions and Cody
will answer them so to get a better
sense of what Cody is actually capable
of I want to see if it can help me build
an app I have this idea to build an
elevated uh gamified to-do app so
instead of U mundane tasks like um
getting groceries it could be gathering
the Kingdom's Provisions or instead of
studying it could be mastering the
ancient Scrolls so transforming everyday
tasks into exciting quests so let's see
if we can get Cody to help us build that
all right so I have a basic nextjs app I
just ran create next app and this is the
default page. TSX file and I have it
running over here on the right side so
let's open up Cody and let's start a new
chat I guess so I asked it to help help
me create this app and I explained what
the app is epicd is a dynamic gamified
to-do application that combines task
management with ventage fanty Adventure
theme yada yada and this is what it came
up with here's some suggestions the Tex
stack so it knows that we're using xjs
uh it knows we're going to need some
hooks um it's suggesting a CMS I'm not
sure that I need that at this point uh
versel will be used to deploy says we
need a homepage with hero section
example quests uh call to action uh
dashboard Quest details profile features
would be authentication Dynamic Quest
data Quest status retro pixel art theme
nice uh ideas for gamification animation
sound effects Mobile app all right so
nice suggestions let's see how can we
get started so let's just see what
happens if I say help me implement the
changes to the p page. TSX
file okay so it looks like it is wanting
us to use some imports here fetch quests
from utils
quests Quest
Card okay import page
module then we have our
quests
and all right let's just add this in see
what it does so we can copy this code or
we can insert it directly okay so
obviously we're going to have some
issues because we don't have these uh
util files and components so let's work
through fixing that so we'll need uh to
fetch some requests utils quests let's
go over here and let's create a utils
folder and a
quest all right so let's say um
implement the utils
SL quests.
TSX
file to only return wa to return some
dummy data for
now okay so let's go ahead and Implement
that so we are recoring and function
fetch Quest and looks like we've got
some dummy quests in here with ID name
description and whether they are
complete or not so pretty cool let's
save that go back here okay and it's
still I put under app okay so I have to
change this uh let's use the at and then
app that should do it all right so now
let's create the quest cards so
components Quest Card let's go ahead and
create that we'll go to
app create a new
file
components and then Quest
card. TSX all right now let's go
and ask Cody to
implement the quest card code let's see
what that
does okay so it gave us um Quest Card
module. CSS as well as the Quest Card
TSX let's Implement that and then let's
also add the Quest Card module CSS so
let's add that over there it looks like
we're looking for name description and
completed uh so that might be different
than well let's go ahead and and do the
same thing here let's at app
this and then we're using this Quest
card and where are we all right so we
have our name so we need an ID a name
and a
description and so come over here we've
got name description and
completed and then what do we have here
again ID name description completed okay
so we need to also send this
completed and then why are we getting
squigglys here all right let's see if
Cody can help us fix this first we need
to get our
Quest data and let's see if we can get a
quick fix on
this nice so Cody helped us to implement
an
interface I might want to put the
interface up here
though looks like all of that is good
let's go to our card let's do a quick
fix and ask Cody to fix
that okay so now it has helped us to Def
find these it looks like we don't have
any other errors so let's go back over
here and we're having some issues here
because of use effect so let's go back
because we are using a use effect here
and we've got some State and we've got
some local handling stuff we do need to
make this a client component so we'll
say use client and save that then let's
go back and I think we have some uh
existing Styles here let's just go ahead
and
delete these Styles and this is what
Cody gave us so far I mean pretty good
start uh my epic quests slay the evil
dragon rescue the princess hunt for
Treasure pretty cool we need we need to
make some iterations on this obviously
we need to be able to complete them and
do other things so let's go to uh the
quest card and let's make some changes
here so I'm going to select this and
then control shift p there's probably
something in here for
Cody uh Cody
commands looks like um alt C on Windows
might be option C probably on Mac all
right so let's do this um alt C okay now
we got my slash commands ask doc edit
all right yeah let's do edit and then
let's say um add a way
to check a quest t as
completed okay so it looks like it
added a span
here um and
checkbox check to complete on change
okay let's
see all right let's apply that save so
now we' got some check boxes is all
right not complete not complete complete
all right now let's work on the Styles a
bit so let's say
um
edit okay Cody just applied a whole
bunch of Styles um kind of made it a
little better let's go back to the chat
and let's implement the quest
card um module CSS based
[Music]
on Quest
Card
create these styles
for
that okay all right so let's uh let's
copy that and enter that there let's see
what it looks
like looks looks great it does okay
let's um all right so let's highlight
the whole thing here and let's edit and
say make the
text uh
black nice all right that's much better
okay so we have uh slay the dragon
rescue the princess hunt for Treasures
this one is complete these are not um I
can't check them so we have to add that
functionality we also need functionality
to add another one so let's go back here
to page
um let's see where should we put this
we'll put it
here between the header and the other
stuff and let's
say edit add a an
input to add more
quests I like the animations the it's
just like going all over the place
checking things out out and
boom all right so we are implementing
some stuff here all right we've got new
Quest use State blank and then we are
adding a new
Quest da da
nice set Quest adding that and then we
have an input here on change set new
Quest pretty nice all right let's save
that let's go and style it what is this
squiggly here must have labels okay
let's do a quick fix on
that all right let's style this up let's
go
here let's say add Styles I don't know
let's just see what it comes up
with okay so it added some Styles here
that we need to add
into the
module so we've got label
input and button okay so let's go over
to our page module and I'm going to go
back to my chat this this time and I'm
going to say uh suggest styles
for the new
Quest input section
of page let's see what it does
there let's check this out let's copy it
and put it into here we'll just doesn't
matter where all right let's just put it
here save and yeah that looks amazing
H he we got a nice hover there oh and
the functionality actually works it's
not checking uh new Quest description
not complete not complete oh so let's
try this test it actually it works
straight away um all right let's just do
one more thing let's um do this edit
and
add padding
between input and
button okay so it
added ping all right let's save that and
see all right that looks much better um
one other thing I just want to do real
quick where is the
H1 uh let's just highlight the whole
thing I'm not sure I don't want to find
where it's at I'm just going to say
add
padding below the I think it's an H1
let's say H1 I'm not sure if it actually
is or not I don't
remember nice that worked it found it it
figured out where to put it and it added
the padding pretty cool so I didn't have
to go look for it okay let's go back to
um the ability to complete a quest so
completed is here so we need to be able
to complete it
from uh from the card okay so obviously
we need a call here and it probably
needs to boil up
to we're getting our name description we
probably need to pull it into here I
mean this is just like I'm not trying to
make this perfect so uh let's go to page
let's Implement
functionality all right let's do this
we're going to just highlight the whole
thing
here and we're going to say
Implement
functionality
to complete a quest and pass that to the
quest uh what's it called
Quest Card Quest
Card QUEST card
so let's see what Cody comes up
with Okay so let's see where are here's
the
edits so we have a complete Quest
function here which is going to set the
quest and find it and set it to complete
that's cool and then and then on
complete call the complete Quest and
pass the quest ID quest ID okay so this
is not exactly I guess this is what I
asked Cody to do but this is not what I
meant Cody to do so complete Quest is
what I meant to just pass this function
so complete
Quest should equal and then not a
function just pass it complete Quest and
then in QUEST card we need to pull in
complete Quest and also we're not
pulling the ID so let's
say retrieve the ID and complete Quest
function call the
function when the quest is marked as
complete wow okay this is pretty cool
all right so we have the ID and then we
have ID string yep and then onchange
complete Quest passing the
ID pretty
cool um nice let's save that we go back
now we also need to pass in the ID um
and so let's go ahead and do that that's
pretty quick I don't need Cody to help
me with that I think I can handle it um
what uh what else we have got something
going on here there's a quest ID okay
what is
this implicit any on quest ID
okay so let's see if we can get Cody to
help us fix
this okay what did Cody
do quest ID string okay
so seems like this should work now let's
see if we can complete we can complete
oh we can't
uncomplete we can complete but we can't
uncomplete well that's all right all
right that's fair I didn't ask Cody to
help me uncomplete I just said help me
complete so pretty funny so I'm pretty
happy with what I was able to accomplish
in such a short period of time and I
didn't get a chance to look at the unit
test generation the code smells and
documentation that's that's pretty key
being able to create documentation on
the fly as you go and let AI help you
you create that that's pretty cool Cody
is generally available as of today
December the 14th so go give it a try at
sourcegraph
docomo I'm going to keep iterating on
this app and use Cody along the way so
look out for more videos

Notes:
**Video Title:** Object-Oriented Programming is Bad by Brian Will

**Summary of Content:** Brian Will delivers a compelling argument against the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), challenging the conventional wisdom that OOP is the superior or default programming paradigm. He critiques OOP for its complexity, inefficiency, and for leading developers astray with its emphasis on encapsulation and inheritance. Instead, Will advocates for procedural programming, presenting it as a more straightforward, efficient alternative.

**Advantages of Procedural Programming:**

- Simplifies the coding process by focusing on functions rather than objects.
- Reduces complexity by not forcing every piece of functionality into the OOP paradigm.
- Encourages the use of pure functions, which are easier to understand and debug.
- Avoids the overuse of abstraction and unnecessary classes, leading to cleaner, more readable code.

**Drawbacks of Object-Oriented Programming:**

- Often leads to unnecessary complexity and abstraction.
- Encapsulation, a core principle of OOP, can create rigid code structures that are difficult to modify.
- Inheritance is criticized for being less relevant and sometimes harmful to code clarity and functionality.
- The ideology of OOP can lead to analysis paralysis, where developers spend excessive time on class design rather than actual coding.

**Tips and Advice:**

- Consider procedural programming for its simplicity and directness.
- Use classes sparingly and only when there's a strong association between functions and data types.
- Favor pure functions to enhance code readability and maintainability.
- Don't be afraid of longer functions if they maintain logic sequence and coherence.

**Lecture Content:**

- Will deconstructs OOP to its core components and identifies where it falls short in practical application.
- Offers a critique on how OOP's emphasis on abstraction and encapsulation leads to bloated and convoluted codebases.
- Advocates for a return to procedural programming, presenting it as a viable alternative that simplifies development and focuses on functionality over form.

**Main Challenges:**

- Overcoming the entrenched belief in the superiority of OOP within the programming community.
- Resisting the temptation to default to OOP practices due to educational and industry norms.
- Simplifying codebases that have been overly complicated by OOP practices without losing functionality or readability.

**The Importance and Usefulness of the Topic:**

- Challenges conventional programming paradigms and encourages critical thinking about best practices.
- Offers practical advice for developers looking to simplify their code and improve efficiency.
- Raises awareness about the pitfalls of blindly following programming ideologies without considering their practical implications.

**Accomplishments:**

- Will's critique of OOP has resonated with many in the programming community, sparking discussions and reevaluations of coding practices.
- The video serves as an educational tool for those new to programming or those entrenched in OOP, offering a fresh perspective.

**Interesting Quotes or Insightful Sentences:**

- "Encapsulation does not work at a fine-grained level, which is the core of what object-oriented ideology prescribes."
- "Pure functions are the only truly self-contained units of code."
- "What object-oriented programming promises becomes a fool's game where there aren't any real good answers."

**Conclusion:** Brian Will's critique of OOP in favor of procedural programming challenges the status quo, urging developers to reconsider the effectiveness of their coding paradigms. By highlighting the drawbacks of OOP and the advantages of procedural programming, Will encourages a shift towards simpler, more logical coding practices that prioritize functionality over complex abstraction.

this is such a banger take and it's entirely correct no comment there's no reason to use inheritance it's 2022.
[Music] i'm a business manager i care about technical decisions
oop is a bad technical decision my stack lets people who worked out a ramen shop writing zig on board in a week
op does not help here period you don't got to call me out that hard brian come on
look some of us need auto complete don't make fun of us too badly for it
[Music] shall we get started
object-oriented programming is bad by brian will this is a talk from 2016 that
occasionally he posts updates to but this is the classic this is like one of
the the best og youtube talks ever sitting comfy with 1.7 million plays every
single one of which is deserved let's do it
when i say that this video is probably the most important programming video you're ever going to watch it's partly because what i'm going to tell you is
distinctly a minority position among programmers probably five percent or under programmers will tell you that
definitively object-oriented programming is just not a good idea and in fact is going to lead you astray maybe you'll
have another 20 30 percent of programmers who will hem and haw and say that it has some virtues and some weaknesses and it might be better
applied to some problems than others i'm not telling you that i'm telling you definitively no object-oriented
programming doesn't fit any problem and you shouldn't take it seriously this is almost certainly not what you
were told in school if you attended a programming course in the last 15 years or you read most educational materials
about programming the the pervasive default assumption is just well object-oriented programming is the right way to go and it's just a subtle matter
so i reiterate this is probably going to be the most important video you watch about programming because it's going to tell you something you're not going to
get from a vast majority of other sources first off i'm going to try and make clear exactly what i'm complaining about
and what i'm not complaining about and then i'm going to try and explain well what is object-oriented programming really because if we don't nail that
down it's almost impossible to criticize and then i'll try and account for well if object-oriented programming isn't
good why does it dominate the industry that's kind of an important question actually and then i'll actually get into well why
doesn't object 20 programming not work what's bad about it and then lastly if i'm telling you to not program in an object jointed style then what do you do
instead what is the alternative it's called procedural programming but what does that look like exactly
so what are the problems with object-oriented programming well first off the problem is really not classes
per se that is i think it's actually possible to program occasionally with classes in a way that's fairly benign i
don't think it's particularly beneficial but for aesthetic reasons it might
seem more pleasing to have an explicit association between certain functions and certain data types doing this
pervasively though as i'll make clear is a really bad idea that's where everything goes wrong is when you try
and shove every function of your code every behavior into an association with a data type that leads to disaster
secondly i don't think the problem with object-oriented programming is about performance i recommend you watch this
talk by mike acting called data-oriented design in c-plus plus he makes some very interesting points and provides some
insight into that world of programming which most of us don't do but i think he overstates this case fine there's a lot
of software out there that should be written with much more regard for performance but i think there's tons of software that just really doesn't apply
you'll also hear complaints about excessive abstraction from generally the same people people like mike acton and again here i think
they're overstating their case i think abstraction is actually a worthy goal in practice most abstractions
aren't good it takes a long long time to develop good ones and as i'll explain the major problem with obtaining
programming is it does tend to produce abstractions that aren't any good that's the real problem not the idea of
abstraction itself another interesting talk to watch is one by abner coinbrey called what
programming is never about and the thing which he says programming is never about is code prettiness how code looks
aesthetics his main point is that programmers typically focus too much on surface concerns about their code rather than
stuff that really matters i think though he actually simply misstates his case or rather his thesis
doesn't really follow from his arguments which are generally valid i think when really pressed he would
admit that elegance simplicity flexibility readability maintainability structure all these things you might
file under code aesthetics i think you admit actually do matter but i think the more accurate way to spin his point is
that these surface level virtues of code are good things and actually important
typing hazard just made a really good point in youtube chat he likes this talk because eventually
brian does get prescriptive and suggests solutions rather than just complaining about code being bad whereas
somebody like jonathan blow just complains a whole bunch and says do better but doesn't show you what better
could or should look like jonathan blow is everything i hate about programming influencer bros
brian's on the other side of that and i really hope that i'm building a community and a
persona whatever that leans more brian and less
whatever the [ __ ] jonathan's doing yeah
but object-oriented programming and abstraction-heavy programming in general fails to deliver them in fact it
provides just the illusion why did you say oreos i was already hungry i'm gonna go grab snacks
actually important but object-oriented programming and abstraction-heavy programming in general fails to deliver
them in fact it provides just the illusion of these things object-oriented programming is sold on the basis that it supposedly provides
these things but particularly simplicity and elegance it actually makes things worse
lastly be clear that i'm pushing procedural programming not necessarily functional programming which is a
different thing as i'll make clear in a moment i happen to think that functional programming actually is the future of
higher level code i think it may actually be the default way we program at a higher level in 10 years from now
or something but there are serious efficiency problems that make functional programming not really viable in certain
domains of programming and so my message is whether your code ends up functional or imperative that's a separate matter
regardless your code should be procedural rather than object oriented
so it's a good time now to make clear exactly what are the competing paradigms of programming that we're really talking
about there are four main possibilities your code can first be both procedural and
imperative procedural meaning that you have no explicit association between your data types and your functions your
behaviors and imperative meaning that we just mutate state whenever we feel like
it we don't have any special handling of shared state which can cause problems as your code gets larger and larger and
more complex but in procedural and imperative programming we just cope with the problems as they arise and you can
think of this style of programming as being basically the default it's the the obvious way to get work done
so this is really how all programming was done in the early days of computers but then starting in the 60s as programs
got more and more complicated people began thinking about well how do we solve this problem of shared state
because it really can get out of hand and so we got two major prescriptions on how to handle the problem
one of these prescriptions says that our code should be procedural yet functional meaning that all or most of the
functions that make up our code should be pure they should not deal with state and so programming in the style we would
tackle the problem of shared state by minimizing state trying to get rid of as much of it as possible
the other prescription people came up with said that our code should be object oriented and imperative and the strategy
here is that we simply segregate our state we take the state that makes up our program and instead of sharing it
promiscuously we try and divide and conquer the problem we package it into these encapsulated
i do want to talk about the slide a bit i
i like this framing a lot i think that treating procedural and imperative as a
default and then changing parts from there is a really clear model for
where things start and how these things are different
i also really like the call out that procedural and functional's goal is to minimize state i'm sure all of you have
heard me rant about this all the time i want my state on the db and i want the simplest pipe from there
to my users and that pipe is functional because the data exists in one place the user exists on the other side of it and
i call a bunch of functions to generate the page or the content or whatever for that user the functional pipe
to that data store allows us to keep the state as minimal as possible and i
really like how functional programming mindset and paradigms enable that even a
functional programming itself isn't always the answer
the mindset that it encourages is why things like serverless functions make so much sense
and functions the ideology are as powerful as functions the concept
in that way also shadow elixir
units that we call objects and objects contain other objects and so forth and that's how we conquer the problem
and these two prescriptions are actually orthogonal to each other we can do both the functional business to minimize the
amount of state which our program deals with and then whatever state is left over we can then segregate into separate
units of encapsulation and in fact i think this combination approach may actually be the ideal way
to structure programs at least in terms of high level code where we don't care so much about efficiency
as i'll explain i think segregating state is actually a valid strategy up to a certain level of detail a certain
level of complexity and so if we first minimize the amount of state which our code deals with it then becomes a viable
strategy to segregate the remaining state you may
have noticed in my definition of object-oriented programming that i said nothing about inheritance and that is because inheritance is simply irrelevant
no one defends it anymore even people who advocate for object-oriented programming will very very commonly these days tell you to be very very
careful in using inheritance or maybe not to use it at all and so it's not really pertinent to any argument about
whether object-oriented programming is good or bad this is such a banger take and it's entirely correct
no comment there's no reason to use inheritance it's 2022.
for similar reasons i didn't say anything about polymorphism in my definition because polymorphism really good or bad isn't exclusive to
object-oriented programming you can have procedural code that is polymorphic and in fact even more polymorphic than is
typically available in most object-oriented languages so it's really not part of the discussion as far as i'm concerned when
i complain about object-oriented programming i'm really complaining about one idea encapsulation encapsulation
does not work or as i should qualify this encapsulation does not work at a fine-grained level which is the core of
what object-oriented ideology prescribes that we need to take the state of our programs and divide and conquer that
problem by chopping it up into tiny little pieces that is the nature of object-oriented code and it doesn't work it leads to
madness before delving into why object-oriented
programming doesn't work it is important to address this mystery of well if object-oriented programming isn't so great why does it now dominate the
industry and why has it done so for almost the last 20 years i've heard it sometimes suggested that
well this was an imposition of management management wants interchangeable developers so it can
have a cookie-cutter assembly line development process hence business types were really enthusiastic about
object-oriented programming promises about code reusability and compartmentalization
it's a theory that sounds plausible to me but the main sticking point is that object-oriented programming doesn't actually deliver these promises you'd
think people would have noticed sometime in the last 20 years yet they seem not to have noticed
i'm also skeptical of the idea that management actually really inserts themselves in these technical decisions that often i suppose once say
object-oriented programming was well-established and that became the pervasive norm then yeah sure management
would push towards doing what everyone else is doing so that they can draw from the the larger talent pool but otherwise
aside from pushing engineers to just go along with the legacy system and not rebuild everything i just don't think
that many business managers really care that much about technical decisions
i'm a business manager i care about technical decisions oop is a bad technical decision
my stack lets people who worked out a ramen shop writing zig on board in a week
oop does not help here period just a lie the zig ramen archetype oh god yeah
mel's the best uh they're one of the most talented engineers i've worked with the the grind is very real with that one
they've never done web dev or typescript at all before working at ping and the
i like to think that the t3 stack helped them on board pretty quick and yeah they
destroy and quickly ship full stack features with no assistance needed and i do think that
our more functional focus stack allows them to move faster and i
yeah as a manager i think it's irresponsible to not make
decisions that how do i put it like oop is the
the manager decision you make if you heard about programming in university and they're just going with what you learned there
but yeah i
there aren't many positions i've personally been in as a manager or a hiring person
where oop tech would have made my life easier
so even at that level i don't necessarily agree the larger talent pool
but otherwise aside from pushing engineers to just go along with the legacy system and not rebuild everything
i just don't think that many business managers really care that much about technical decisions i'm much more inclined to think that
object-oriented programming is something that programmers did to themselves and the question is then well why
i think a big part of the answer simply comes down to java when it was first introduced in the mid 90s java seemed
like a welcome reprieve to many programmers compared to the alternatives java seemed really simple
for example on the pc this is what application development looked like you had to use the win32 api in c and not
only did programmers have to concern themselves with memory management as you do in c but on top of that win32 just
doesn't feel like the sea that you would learn from books that's not what you would learn from k r it's not what you would learn in school it's all this
excess macro heavy stuff on top that is really mystifying even the tools you would use to write c
programs on a windows platform the visual studio tools you know wouldn't be the same as what you would learn in
university probably where you probably had a unix system and that's what you learned so it was over to this platform with a
quite high barrier to entry but then also in this period it was undergoing this ugly transition from win16 to win32
and so you can begin to see why programmers were desperately looking for some way out the only real alternative at the time in
pc programming was what visual basic but that was another effective microsoft platform you're locking yourself into
and i suppose otherwise you might use pascal or delphi but that platform had its own issues and so it shouldn't be too surprising that when sun
microsystems came along and said here's this free thing that everyone can use across all platforms
that got people's attention and java had other things going for it that certainly seemed more accessible
just in terms of like its naming conventions for example you look at the java apis and you see things like file
input stream which is not cryptic at all yes there are definitely issues in how abstracted uh many of the apis are and
you know having to derive base classes to use the apis and all that nonsense but on first glance on surface
inspection it certainly seems like a friendlier system it's not like unix where you have stuff like io ctl which
is you're supposed to know is input output control and other really horrible abbreviations and then 132 had the same
thing you know lpct str stands for was long pointer to a const t char
string so even if you know what a t char is and a long pointer is you're stuck in this world where everything is cryptically
abbreviated and it's just this goddamn puzzle that you have to figure out at every step java came in and said no we don't
necessarily have to program that way we can write real programs that don't have to be horribly cryptic in that way
and then java took things too far in the other direction but that's again we'll get to that java also smartly had the c like syntax
the curly brace syntax so superficially at least it seemed familiar to programmers from c and c plus plus and
it seemed like real programming it has curly braces after all and then the whole compilation to vm
bytecode business was again very alluring to programmers trying to escape their platform headaches and then java
also offered some very basic niceties like proper namespaces without header files for christ's sake we still have to
deal with header file to do our real programming in cnc plus
plus at least 20 years after we should have ditched them if for this one thing alone i think it's worth giving java some credit hit mainstream's programming
without header files and then of course also very alluring garbage collection i know some hardcore low-level programmers out there will
insist that garbage collection is never necessary it's never a good idea but whether or not that's the case it's really hard to argue with the appeal it
shouldn't be surprising that the vast armies of people doing business quote applications wanted to stop thinking about memory management
java also mainstreamed exceptions as the primary way to handle errors and whatever problems this may have in practice i think it definitely seems
appealing because the alternative is ugly the alternative is what we do in c and c plus plus of having to have an inbound error return value or like you
know saving to a global and checking the global after everything you call it's not pretty um go align with multiple return and that style probably is the
better way to go but that's not the solution it came up with and so it normalized this other thing that seemed better at the time
i think some people also came to like the subject verb object nature of method calls over straight function calls because well this is just what we do in
english it's subject first then verb then object i myself don't find it all that appealing i prefer consistency and
i think the distinction between subject and object in many many cases gets very very murky which is one of the problems with objective programming as we'll get
to but the style of syntax in java led to this convenience people i think since then have become addicted to which is in
their ides it offers them for this data type what are my options what can i do with this thing it seems to enable a
style of programming where you can just sort of browse you don't have to hold all the options in your head you just have a vague notion of way i'm going to
take that thing and transform into this other thing i don't remember exactly what the method is called i'll just group my way there using autocompletion
in my ide you don't got to call me out that hard brian come on
look some of us need auto complete don't make fun of us too badly for it
again there's really actually no reason you couldn't have the same style of convenience in a purely procedural language you would just have an auto completion for given this first argument
what functions take this type as its first argument oh that sounds like the rpc
effectively the same thing really but because of quirks of history and syntax design this particular editing convenience has been implemented for
languages like java but generally not straight procedural languages and i think method auto-completion may actually largely explain why people
sometimes claim that object-oriented apis feel easier to use it's because you can largely auto-complete your way
through most of the usage another thing java seemed to have going for it is that back in the 90s this was
the heyday of gui programming and it seemed really logical to map components as we see them in a gui window and
classes in an object-oriented program that seemed like a very natural correspondence this was the most tangible version of the real world
modeling which object oriented promised at the time it seemed like a very plausible story and on top of that you
have the virtue of java being supposedly cross-platform with the java swing api so you can write guise that will run on any system they'll look horribly ugly
but at least hey they're running everything you could do so-called rad rapid application development of gui applications like you do in visual basic
except in java you're not locked into microsoft's platform so the funny thing to me about java is
that i think in an alternate history it could have had virtually all the same success if not even more perhaps if it weren't object oriented at all it could
have just been a straight procedural language and would have had still a big long list of attractive selling points we could have had all the same
portability the same garbage collection the same exception handling and so forth down the line without any of the
object-orientedness or at the very least without forcing everything into the mold of classes you could have a language like python say where there are classes
but also just straight procedural code if you want and they can live side by side just fine so there still is this question java
aside there seems to be some appeal to object-oriented programming in itself and what is that well i think very simply if you go back to the 60s and 70s
as people were grappling with the problems of software systems getting larger and larger people tried to identify units of code
everything is a widget just triggered me so hard oh god
oh god that hit deep
yeah i
yeah i we just talked about in chat a bit i have nothing to say this talk's really good i i don't know why i thought i'd
have more comments but like everything brian says here is entirely correct he has fantastic
history does a fair enough job of describing why people like these patterns
and then dismantles the whole thing so yeah
distraction that were larger than individual functions and data types it's natural to want to describe any complex
system in terms of large-scale components you know if you talk about human anatomy you don't explain it first in terms of microbiology that would be
nuts we first talk about very major organs like the brain and the heart and kidneys and so forth as software gets
larger and larger it felt like these units of code we were building out of the base materials these data structures and functions they became smaller and
smaller relative to the whole sadly though the one general answer people could come up with of what is a unit of code abstraction bigger than a
function and bigger than a data type is just simply a combination of the two and hence objects were born we took our
functions and our data types and we associated them together an abstraction that is bigger than a
function and data type is a program
mic drop sorry i yeah i i don't like pseudo medium
abstractions in that sense i say as a react developer that writes react components that have logic contained
within them all the time but yeah i i think that those primitives are very
good having data types and functions as your core primitives and then abstracting things from there
into these larger units we want to think in terms of paragraphs rather than individual sentences and object-oriented programming seemed to have an answer for
how we could do that it's also very natural that as we build larger and larger systems and complex things as much as possible we want
simple rote rules to guide us object-oriented programming seemed to present a unit of abstraction and a set of guidelines whereby we could
incrementally accrete larger and larger systems this line of thinking is what led us to patterns and then the so-called solid principles and
dependency injection and test-driven development and all this stuff which has subsequently been piled on by many people who insist that this is now the
one true way to do object-oriented programming but to me all these best practices represent band-aids they are
compensation for the fact that the original vision of object-oriented programming has never panned out and every few years there's a new ideology
in town about how we actually do objective programming for real systems that's not the solid y'all are thinking
of don't get too excited fine it's very easy to miss this dynamic i
know i did for several years because i think within all of these addendums to object-oriented programming there's lots of mystical speech dancing around
genuine insights but it's not quite cohesive object-only programming feels like this circle which we've been trying
to square for over a generation now finally let's talk about what's really
wrong with object-oriented programming specifically encapsulation which is the lint spin of the whole thing so consider what is an object an object
is this bundle of encapsulated state and we don't interact with the state of that object directly all interactions with that state from the outside world come
in through messages messages to the object the object has a defined set of messages which it will receive called its public interface and so we have
private information hidden behind a public interface when an object receives a message it may in turn send messages to other objects
and so we can conceive of an object-oriented program being this graph of objects all communicating with each other by sending messages
many people today forget though that the original conception of a message is not exactly synonymous with just a method call yes in practice it means calling
methods but a message strictly speaking sends only copies of state it doesn't send references a message sends and returns information about state not
state itself and well wait a minute objects themselves are state and this has some interesting consequences it means that
strictly speaking messages cannot pass around object references i've never seen a java or c-sharp codebase that ever
follows this rule perhaps some small talk programs have but in general this rule is not observed at all and probably
for good reason as we'll discuss but anyway if we take the rule seriously it means then for an object to send a message to another object the first
object must hold a private reference to that other object because otherwise how is it going to talk to it to talk an object you have to have a reference to
it and where is an object going to get i just want to rewind to that anyway if
we take the rule seriously it means then for an object to send a message to another object the first object hold a private
reference to that other object because otherwise how is it going to talk to it to talk an object you have to have a reference an object there it is [ __ ]
couldn't pause and time an object and object programming is how we're
referring to object programming now then i'm just going to get a reference to another object if it can't get object
references from messages the references which an object needs have to all be there at the object's inception they
have to be there for the whole lifetime of the object and there's an even deeper consequence which is that if an object is sending
messages to another that other object is part of the first object's private state and by the principle of encapsulation an
object should be responsible for all the objects which it sends messages to this should be obvious if you consider that messages indirectly read and modify
state when b sends a message to a here it's messing with the state of a indirectly sure but it's still messing with its state and so what happens when
other objects come along and send messages to that same object what's happening here we have shared state it's hardly any different than if you had a
single global variable being shared by say 10 functions if you have an object receiving messages from 10 other objects those objects are all effectively tied
together because they're implicitly sharing this state i'll drop one of my
first hot takes i
think that react makes it a little too easy to do this as well
is this serverless well uh not quite the problem here is
if i have like a form that's deep and a
navigation bar on top and i want to like persist some of the form but not all of the form when you change tabs maybe
you're switching between types of a sign up you're switching between user sign up and admin sign up
and you want to attach the
how do i put it you want to attach the place you're at in navigation directly
to some state but not all of it so that some state persists others doesn't
you're now exposing weird hooks to trigger resets arbitrarily and letting
things from above hook in to a deeper component to trigger and untrigger those it can get really messy if you don't
abstract to a high enough level and i've seen that enough times to say that
declarative generally has this problem this isn't specific to oop this is a
declarative model problem that oop encourages a little more heavily but can happen in any
declarative solution back to it sure the interactions with that state
are indirect through public methods but those methods are providing very trivial kinds of coordination of the state you can impose rules through the accessor
methods like saying oh if you access this field it's a number well you can only increment that number you can't mutate it in any other way fine but it's
a very trivial kind of protection the hard problems of shared state are much much deeper where in the system of 10
objects all sharing this state is the real coordination and the answer is there isn't any as soon as you have objects being shared encapsulation just
flies out the window so if we're taking encapsulation seriously the only real way to structure a program to structure our objects as a
graph is not as a freeform graph but as a strict hierarchy at the top of our hierarchy we have an object representing effectively the
whole program it's our god object and that has its direct children which represent the subcomponents and those children in turn have their own
subcomponents and so on down the line and each object in the hierarchy is responsible for its direct children and
the messages being passed strictly only ever go from parent to their direct child the guide object here for example
is not supposed to reach down to its grandchild it has to do all of its interactions with this grandchild indirectly through the grandchild's parent otherwise who really is
responsible for that object who's managing its state it's supposed to be the direct parent and so what happens when we have some
sort of cross-cutting concern like down in the hierarchy it turns out oh wait there's some business that that object has with another object in a totally
different branch of the hierarchy how do they talk to each other well not directly everything has to go
does this look familiar to y'all y'all react devs
yeah this isn't just class components this is components hierarchy hierarchy
can have annoying problems like if there's some state in b and we want a to have access we're either doing a stupid
portal or we're doing something stupider yeah context is a very object-oriented model
good point parasocial let's get back to it go through their common ancestor for a
to send a message to b here it can't actually directly invoke any kind of method it has to mutate its own state in some way and then information about that
state that new intention of the object gets returned from a message sent from a's parent a's parent in turn same thing
has to happen so it gets back up to the common ancestor and then only finally when we get to the common ancestor can that intent be realized as a series of
message calls but not directly down to b it has to be bucket brigaded down through the hierarchy that is how you
handle cross-cutting concerns in a strict encapsulated hierarchy obviously no one writes programs this
way or at least no one writes whole programs this way and for good reason it's an absurd way to have to write your code
now you might argue that people do follow these principles in practice they just do so inconsistently and perhaps there is some value in a code base where
you apply these principles inconsistently perhaps half-ass encapsulation actually gets us something so imagine we have some sort of
free-form graph of objects making up a program and we decide oh well there's a subsystem of objects that together should be their own self-contained
encapsulated hierarchy of objects and so we're going to refactor our code well very often what that means is not only do we have to do a lot of complicated
rethinking of the structure of the relationships here of what calls what on the other objects we very typically have to introduce more objects like say here
to represent this whole new subsystem we probably have to do some new subgod object some ruler of this subsystem
now all interactions with the subsystem have to be reconceptualized as going through this minor deity so say we successfully do this
refactoring and now while our code doesn't follow the principles of encapsulation perfectly it's doing so in a half consistent way and maybe there's
some benefit there well i think what tends to happen is subsequently we decide oh wait we need some new interaction between elements of
this encapsulated subsystem and instead of having to do the hard work of figuring out how exactly it all gets coordinated from the root of that
subsystem the temptation is to just handle the business directly but if we want to do the proper thing we have two
options and maybe it turns out that that stuff external to the subsystem actually just needs to get integrated into that subsystem and so it comes under the
purview of the subsystems route but otherwise we now have two subsystems that need to coordinate and who's going to do the coordination well now we need
a new subsystem god object responsible for the collective business of these two subsystems and now all interactions of
these two subsystems have to go through this root object but also all interactions with the outside world and these two subsystems have to go through
this new root object so as you can see chances are really good that what you would actually do is say [ __ ] it and just do this you would
just reach in and have the objects directly interact with each other whether they should properly do so or not and now where is encapsulation
what's the point whether you follow the rules strictly or loosely you're in a bad place if you follow the rules strictly most things
you do end up being very unobviously structured and very indirect and the number of defined entities in your code
base proliferates with no end in sight the nature of these entities tends to be very abstract and nebulous but alternatively if you follow the rules
loosely what are you even getting why are you bothering what is the point when i look at your object-oriented code base what i'm going to encounter is
either this over-engineered giant power of abstractions or i'm going to be looking at this inconsistently architected pile of objects that are all
probably tangled together like christmas lights you'll have all these objects giving you a warm fuzzy feeling of encapsulation but you're not going to
have any real encapsulation of any significance what people tend to create when they design object-oriented programs are
overly architected buildings where the walls have been prematurely erected before we have really figured out what the needs of the floor plan are and so
what happens is down the line turns out oh wait we need to get from this room over here to that room over there but oh wait we've erected berries in between so
we end up busting a bunch of holes through all the walls like the kool-aid guy and the resulting pattern is really not organized at all it's just swiss
cheese we thought we were being disciplined and neatly modularizing all the state but then the requirements changed or we just didn't anticipate
certain details of the implementation and we end up with a mess the lesson we should take from this is to be very careful about erecting
barriers about imposing structure it's actually better to start out with a free-form absence of structure rather than impose a structure that will likely
turn out to not really fit our problem i have a really funny example of this
did you all know that random
step back sure y'all have probably boarded an airplane before
and you boarded front to back did you know
that random would be a much more effective way to board a plane back to front would be
better ish but not significantly going like outside to inside from back
to front would make more sense but then you're splitting up groups and they hate that randomly
sending people in to the plane tends to board significantly faster
specifically because the structure gets figured out through the randomness and that's to an extent
what's being discussed here which is when a bad structure is prescribed
that is worse than having no structure at all i also love how many people just shouted out cgp cray yes i watched that video
look we're all nerds here we all watch the same nerd [ __ ] y'all are youtube degen's
enough to be here on a on a holiday so yeah we watch the same things on youtube
sorry sure more than half of you have even seen this talk but you're sticking around because it's really good and you
like me bad structure that doesn't really fit our problem not only makes it harder to
implement the code in the first place it hinders change and it confuses anyone who looks at our code because it's implying one thing but then what's
really going on is another in the objective world we have to think about all these graphs we have to think about an inheritance hierarchy we have to
think about a composition graph we have to think about data flows between the object and also we're thinking about a call graph the liberating thing about
procedural code is there's just the call graph we also of course do have to think about how our data is structured and how
our data gets transformed throughout the course of the program but the beauty of procedural code is that we can think about that totally independent of any
notion of responsibilities when i'm looking at my data i can think just about my data and when i'm looking at my functions i'm not thinking about all
these self-imposed barriers i'm not constantly trying to group and modularize everything into these small units of so-called single
responsibilities when i sit down to write object-oriented code i always have to play this game i have this mental list of the obvious
data types which my code will deal with and have the separate mental list of all the imagined behaviors i want in my program although the functionality i
imagine it to have and then what object-oriented ideology demands is that i take all my behaviors and i somehow associate each one with one of my data
types inevitably what this means in any non-trivial program is i'm actually going to have to introduce all sorts of additional data types just to be these
containers for certain behaviors which otherwise don't naturally fit with any of my obvious data types the data types i knew i actually wanted because they
represent actual data i need in fact as programs get larger and larger in object-oriented code it tends to be that these unobvious unnatural data types
tend to actually predominate you end up with a majority of so-called data types which really aren't there because they're representing data they exist
simply as attacks to conform to this ideology about code modularization very quickly we end up in what steve yeage called the kingdom of nouns where
every aspect of our program has to be reconceptualized as not just mere standalone verbs you know functions they have to be reconceptualized as nouns
things that represent a set of behaviors and so what we get in our object-oriented code bases are all these service classes and manager classes and
other what i call doer classes these very nebulous and abstract entities even when dealing with data types and
behaviors that are relatively concrete which have fairly visible connections to the functionality apparent to actual users of the program even here the
matchmaking game constantly presents us with these obnoxious philosophical dilemmas in object-oriented analysis and design we constantly have to ask
ourselves stupid questions like should a message send itself because maybe instead we should have some sender object which sends messages or wait a
minute maybe there should be a receiver object which receives messages or a connection object which transmits messages so very quickly the real world
modeling which object-oriented programming promises becomes a fool's game where there aren't any real good answers
in my experience object-oriented analysis and design very quickly becomes analysis paralysis if you take the
ideology seriously as i did you're going to waste a lot of time hemming and haunting about to conceptualize these elements of your program object jointed
programming is generally sold to students on the basis of these trivial examples that neatly model real world taxonomy but everyone's favorite pointed
analysis and design is a lot of very abstract access structure with no obvious real-world analogs
note here that programmers have their own peculiar definition of abstract when programmers talk about abstraction they're generally talking about
simplified interface over complex inner workings what's odd about this is that in more general usage abstract has a
connotation of being hard to understand something which is abstract has no resemblance to the things of common daily life and it turns out that most
things which programs do are abstract in this sense and so it shouldn't be surprising that we have great difficulty
conceptualizing the components of a typical program in terms of neatly self-contained modules particularly modules which have any real world analog
when we pollute our code with generic entities like managers and factories and services we're not really making anything easier to understand we're just
putting a happy face on the underlying abstract business and for every excess layer of abstraction we're getting more
abstractness in attempting to neatly modularize and label every little fiddly bit that our program does we're actually
just making our program harder to understand yep yep
simpler code is always better than well-named complex code something that happens all the time when
i look at object-oriented code bases is that i'll try and find the parts in code that corresponds to some user-visible functionality but trying to find the
functionality going by clues from the names of classes and the names of methods tends to be very misleading very typically my expectation that
functionality x would be in a class named x turns out to be wrong because the abstract nature of what we typically do in programs generally necessitates
that functionality is not going to be self-contained it's not going to neatly fit into one neat module and so the class which is called x will very
superficially relate to x but then all the real work is done elsewhere scattered throughout the code this makes me question what is the value
of having a class called x if it doesn't really contain all the business effects what this class x really represents is
actually misleading code structure and how is that helpful how is that conducive to understanding of your code base
the other reason i have this problem reading code bases and trying to track down where functionality actually lives is because object-oriented design tends
to fracture functionality in our code it tends to take what otherwise could be relatively self-contained code and split
it up into many separate methods across many separate classes typically often in many separate files for god's sake this
fracturing is accepted because of an ideology about encapsulation and this notion of classes and methods properly
having so-called single responsibilities and there are certainly valid arguments for that idea certainly it is much
easier to get a small short function correct than to get a large scrolling function correct but the important question is that in splitting your code
up to many little small methods and many separate classes are we actually decreasing the total complexity of our program or just displacing the
complexity just merely spreading it around in either case there's this attendant tradeoff we're making where by splitting up larger units of code into
many smaller ones we're greatly increasing the so-called surface area of our code where i come along
this is a very underrated and very good take like
splitting things up feels good because you chopped it and now you have a smaller piece to look at but if you
need all the pieces to understand what that piece does you just made it more work to keep track
of it all i look at your code base and i try and get a foothold and everything split up into these tiny little units these tiny
little packets of code reading this kind of code often feels frustrating in the same way it can be frustrating to eat a bunch of little candies that are all
individually wrapped and when all your methods are really really short you end up having to jump all around the code to find any line of logic a lot of business
that otherwise could be neatly sequentially expressed in longer methods gets artificially split up so it feels like you've taken a neatly sorted deck
of cards and thrown them into the air so you can play 52 card pickup okay so if you're not going to be
writing object-oriented code what are you going to be doing instead you're going to be writing procedural code but what does that look like well as i
mentioned at the beginning this doesn't necessarily mean you need to avoid classes entirely if you have a language like python or c plus plus where you
have both straight functions and also classes there are some cases where the association between your data types and certain functions is really really
strong that it fits some organizational purposes to just explicitly associate them together by making those functions methods of that type the most obvious
example would be adts abstract data types things like queues and lists and so forth the key thing to keep in mind however is
that the moment you start hemming and hawing about whether this particular function really has a primary association with that data type that should be the moment you say screw it
will make it just a plain function because it turns out that most things we do in code tend to be cross-cutting concerns they don't have necessarily
special obvious relationships with particular data types they might concern more than one data type and that's why you should generally prefer functions so
you don't have to play this silly game of matchmaking functions to data types so we're gonna be writing our code
primarily out of plain functions and we're not going to attempt to encapsulate the state of our program at a fine grained level because it doesn't
work however shared state is still a problem and if we're not careful it can get out of hand we can't totally solve
the problem unless we do pure functional programming but short of that there are broad guidelines we can follow to mitigate the problem
first off when in doubt parameterize this means that rather than passing data to functions through global variables you should instead make that data an
explicit parameter of the function so it has to get explicitly passed in as much as possible we want data access on our program to flow through the call graph
so anytime you're attempting to pass data to a function through a global because it seems more efficient or maybe just more convenient you should give that a strong reconsideration
secondly whatever globals you do end up within your program they can be slightly helpful to group and logically into data types even if this means you effectively
have a data type with one instance in your whole program this little trick can often make your code seem just a little bit more organized in a sense you're
just using data types this way to create tiny little sub-name spaces but if you do a good job logically grouping your globals this way as a side benefit this
can complement rule number one because now you can more conveniently pass this global state to functions by bundling your data together into types you
typically cut down on the number of parameters which functions have to take though do be careful there isn't art to how you logically group things together
the third guideline is to opportunistically favor pure functions even if you're not explicitly working in a functional style or working in a
functional language if you see an opportunity to make a function pure it's generally a good strategy to take that opportunity again pure functions tend to
come in at efficiency cost but the brilliant thing about pure functions is that they're the only truly self-contained unit of code when i'm
reading and writing a pure function oh what a banger pure functions are the only truly
self-contained units of code
i don't think i've ever said something that smart that was like my own statement god
yeah pure functions are the only true unit everything else is in abstraction and most of those abstractions are kind of
bad and should be avoided if you can a pure function for those that don't know is a function with no side effects
you call it with things and you get back a thing that's it doesn't change anything about your system it doesn't
write to a variable in memory it doesn't modify the thing you handed it you give it something and you get back something
else it could even be the same thing but no side effects
one avoidable pure functions one you can
code without side effects is not code nope fundamentally disagree
that's just a bad take does most code need side effects yes but
if you can manage those side effects then
and abstract them as much as possible and your code is simple pure pieces
that you architect in a way that gives you an output that is a side effect like
running pure code has side effects in the sense that something new is created
but no it just i fundamentally disagree i don't have to think about anything
else i can just consider that function entirely unto itself therefore they tend to be easier to understand and to make correct
the fourth guideline is that we actually should try to encapsulate our code only in a very loose general sense at the level of namespaces packages modules
whatever your language has so when i'm working in golang for example i think of each package as having its own private state and then a public interface i find
that encapsulation at this course grain level tends to work because you're typically dealing with much larger units of code than the supposedly ideal
classes of object-oriented programming the typical golang program is going to have not that many packages maybe like 10 at the high end and structuring a
mere handful of elements into higher key encapsulation is reasonably doable when it turns out during development that oh
wait i have some cross-cutting concern in my packages and so we're going to violate this perfect hierarchy encapsulation again it's not such a big
deal because you're dealing with a relatively small graph of objects all the basic problems of encapsulation are still there is just at the course
growing to macro level the problems are reasonably manageable the last guideline is that you shouldn't be scared of long functions for a long
time now programming students have been advised to when in doubt chop their code into smaller and smaller functions but doing this has significant costs there
are trade-offs it turns out that most programs have these key sections where most of what the code is doing is a long laundry list of stuff and what we're
told to do in these scenarios is write functions like this where all the business has been extracted out to separate functions the problem with
doing this pervasively is that what was naturally a logical sequence of code and was otherwise written in sequence top to
bottom is now spread and out of order throughout your code base obviously in cases where the business extracted to a separate function is
something that you want to call in multiple places that's a very good reason to have a function but if all these functions were just called in this one place i would generally prefer
looking at code where the business of those functions is just done in line and if you want high level documentation of
what's going on in myfunk here then you just put what i would call a section comment denoting what each section of the code does
in this arrangement the sequence of the business is totally i'm guilty of this i've been trying to get better about it actually writing functions that are much
more top to bottom here's everything not abstracting just because i can
this is a very good thing to key in on a function that does everything it needs
to like if something will never be reused it probably doesn't need to be abstracted
i agree this applies to react components to an extent i for use effecty type stuff i like to
break that out for the the naming sake like if the output is a single thing you care about i still like doing that
abstraction but that's more for clarity while reading because of the
interop between react and
state management solutions and use effect and jsx but yeah i almost always agree with this
very specifically good [ __ ] anyways totally clear and when i'm browsing the
whole code base when i'm looking outside this function there's less clutter because there are now fewer functions i have to look at and wonder well hey where is that called i wonder what that
thing does it also has advantage of letting us avoid having to name functions naming stuff is really important in code but
it's really really hard to do well and in general i find it preferable if we can avoid naming entities as much as possible in this arrangement we don't
have to think hard about what to call these functions we can just have a comment line and have a full english sentence which generally is better at conveying accurate meaning and also is
simply easier to write if for whatever reason it doesn't seem adequate to simply comment the section rather than extract it to a separate
function the next best thing is to make it a private function a nested function such that it's clear this function is
not called anywhere else it's only called within this function in this arrangement i as a reader of your code coming from the outside i'm still
presented with a smaller surface area fewer entities in the code and so it's just easier for me to get a foothold now when you do write functions which
are hundreds if not thousands of lines long you still should keep in mind general guidelines about code readability basic things like not strained too far from the left margin
for too far or for too long you know you don't want to have code that's indented in eight levels because it gets really obnoxious scrolling in the down code if
you have to scroll over for one thing and also it tends to just imply there's a lot of busy logic in this part of code and it gets confusing
so likewise you also need to look out for parts of functions where the logic's just getting too complex the first thing to do is of course to try and simplify
your logic but failing that there are gonna be cases where hey we should just split this off into a separate function so it's more neatly self-contained complexity
the other concern with longer functions is that as your function gets longer and longer you tend to accrue more and more local variables so what you want to do
is hopefully a language allows us you want to try and constrain the scope of the local variables so that they don't exist for the full duration of the function but rather for subsections this
way either reader of your code when they scan up and down the function i don't have to think about all the variables for the whole duration of the function i
write functions all the time like that just to contain a variable so it doesn't leak
from the local scope not the best practice in defining functions all over the place but i do it a lot
the way this is done in most curly brace languages is you can just introduce a new sub-scope with curly braces so here for example this integer x variable only
exists within these curly braces when you have sub-sections of a function which you are commenting it's generally a good idea to when in doubt and close
them in curly braces this gives readers of the function and assurance that variables from the preceding sections don't fall through to the following
sections and so in later sections we don't have to think about the variables that were used above where possible the even better thing to
do is to enclose these local scopes in their own anonymous function that's then just immediately called and the advantage here
yeah this is the thing i was saying i do this too much it'd be cool to have blocks this way but in the nested functions programming so it's just its
own sub scope but also within this anomalous function it's guaranteed that any return is not going to return out of the enclosing function it'll return just
out of this enclosed function and so we have a stronger guarantee that the logic of this subsection is self-contained from the enclosing function
unfortunately what i often really want when creating subsections of longer functions is a feature that doesn't exist in any language i know of it's an
idea i've only seen in other place it was jonathan blow in his talks about his programming language he's making and the idea is that we want something like an
anonymous function which doesn't see anything of its enclosing scope the virtue of extracting a section of code
out to a truly separate function is that everything that comes into the function has to be explicitly passed to a parameter it would be great if we could write
inline anonymous functions with the same virtue specifically what i would propose is imagine we had a reserved word use
that introduces a block and in the header of the use we list variables from the enclosing scope which we want to be
accessible in this block but otherwise anything from the enclosing scope would not be visible these listed variables however would really actually be copies
of those variables so if you assigned x or y here in the scope you're assigning to x and y the local variables of this
used block not to x and y of the enclosing scope which is the effect you get with a truly separate function right you assign to the parameters of the
function you're not modifying what was passed to the function you're just modifying those local variables that's the same thing we want in this use block
furthermore a use block should itself return values so you use return inside the use block and it doesn't return from the enclosing function returns from the
use itself that uses an expression and so we can return values from this use and assign it to this variable a
so in effect we'd have this block of code which is as neatly self-contained as a separate function however it is written in line and so it's very very
clear that oh this is a piece of code that's only used in this one place you don't have to go look for it elsewhere and also we don't even have to give it a
name instead we can just put a section common header before the use block and that is generally much better for containing the actual intent of this
block of code if later i really like this pattern i wish this was
more popular in more languages down the line we decided that this block of code actually should be extracted to its own proper function that's a very easy thing
to do you can have an editor convenience that does that for you automatically it's already clear what the parameters and the arguments should be all the
programming would have to do is provide a name for the new function so anyway it'd be nice if languages had this feature unfortunately i don't know
of anyone that does but regardless you shouldn't be so scared of long functions they actually have their place in most code bases
at the very least i hope i can get you to try procedural programming it doesn't really matter what language you're in if you're in java or c sharp you can write
procedural code you can break the rules but if you've ever felt any of the paralysis that i felt attempting to do object-oriented programming properly to
square the circle i think you'll find abandoning all those ideas and just reverting to procedural code to be a liberating experience
i can tell you from personal experience of having read these books that you don't need to read them they don't have answers they're not going to square the circle and you're going to waste
productive years of your life trying to live up to their ideals i'm not sure bangers are these ideas there are bits and pieces that have value test driven
development for example has some interesting ideas there's value in testing but that's part of the problem is that kernels of good ideas have been
taken to holistic extremes in a way that i think has been disastrous for the industry and certainly for programming education there are very few solid
holistic answers about how we should write code we'd all be better off if we stopped chasing uncle bob catching strays
yeah uh that was 44 minutes and 35 seconds of straight bangers
just every point was great fantastic video uh every time i watch it
i am happy that i do what i do and that i know the things that i know
he's uh fantastic and he has a few other videos uh the
god is unity overview stuff's actually really good even though i hate unity what's funny is he hates oop and he's a
game dev take that as you will he has
uh where's the one i'm thinking of he did a a video where he
rewrote a program sorry the object oriented programming is good this one's shorter
really good he goes a little more in detail on like one or two specific use cases where it's okay
but he has another awareness like he rewrote the same program multiple times i think it's this one
oh generation programming is embarrassing four short examples yeah this one is phenomenal if you want to see
like the extent at which oop is bad he goes very in depth on like specific examples there
great video highly highly recommend uh checking that out and generally for game
devs check out his stuff more he does things very different and is still very productive
did you know that over half my viewers haven't subscribed yet that's insane y'all just click these videos and listen
to me shout and hope that the algorithm is going to show you the next one make sure you hit that subscribe button maybe even the bell next to it so that you
know when i'm posting videos also if you didn't know this almost all of my content is live streamed on twitch while
i'm making it everything on the youtube is cuts clips whatever from my twitch show so if you're not already watching
make sure you go to twitch.tv theo where i'm live every wednesday around 2 or 3 p.m and i go live on fridays pretty
often as well thank you again for watching this video really excited thank you

**Summary of Key Points from the Video Transcription:**

**Advantages:**

- Emphasizes encapsulation, which minimizes inter-module dependencies.
- Supports subtyping and polymorphism, allowing for flexible code reuse.
- Structural typing (e.g., in Go) is favored for its compile-time checks and ease of use.
- Encourages bundling data with behavior for coherent object models.

**Drawbacks:**

- Inheritance is often criticized for being problematic and leading to complex hierarchies.
- Misuse of object-oriented principles can lead to overcomplication and unnecessary abstractions.
- Getters and setters are sometimes overused, potentially leading to inefficient encapsulation.
- Certain patterns like Singleton are seen as glorified global variables, which could be problematic.

**Tips and Advice:**

- Focus on real needs instead of planning for every potential future development.
- Consider the use of interfaces and structural typing to reduce complexity and improve flexibility.
- Be wary of overusing design patterns without understanding their impact and necessity.
- Explore and understand the benefits and limitations of both object-oriented and functional programming paradigms.

**Main Challenges:**

- Deciding when and how to use object-oriented features effectively.
- Balancing the use of inheritance and composition.
- Avoiding over-abstraction and keeping the codebase manageable.

**Importance and Usefulness:**

- Object-oriented programming provides a useful model for organizing code and managing complexity.
- Encapsulation and polymorphism are crucial for creating flexible and maintainable software systems.
- Understanding OOP principles is important for working with many modern programming languages and frameworks.

**Accomplishments:**

- The transcription outlines a nuanced view of OOP, acknowledging its strengths and weaknesses.
- Provides practical advice on avoiding common pitfalls in object-oriented design.

**Interesting Quotes or Insightful Sentences:**

- "Inheritance 99.6% of the time is terrible."
- "OOP to me means only messaging, local retention, and protection and hiding of state processes."
- "The real power of OOP lies not in the specific features like inheritance but in its overall approach to software design."
- "Don't use public properties, use getters and setters instead, which is completely wrong."
- "We are using languages that force us to think in classes, with architectures that don't require objects."

This summary encapsulates the transcription's exploration of object-oriented programming, emphasizing the nuanced approach required to effectively leverage OOP principles while avoiding common pitfalls.

Transcription:

I think aspects of oop are nice and there sometimes I like things about it
now it just depends on to what extent you mean by oop like I do not like the word extends okay I do not like
inheritance inheritance 99 six% of the time is terrible
but there's just you know there's always just that there's always just
inheritance tax is wrong okay the PE people don't understand o o me mean or
to me means only messaging local retention and protection and hiding of State processes uh and extreme late
binding of all things Alan K the guy who coined the term object-oriented programming okay okay it seems like a
lot of people dislike objectoriented programming functional Bros hey can I get some Fs in chat for all my
functional Bros out there can I get some Fs in chat for all my functional Bros out there lots of functional Bros okay
this this is this is the Gathering Place of a lot of them all right how about this one let's invert it for a second
can I get some some O's in chat for those that like o o O's in chat if you like o o okay damn okay you know what we
got to do before we start this let's jump in here let's let's hit him with a pull okay because this seems a little
excessive don't you think o or FP uh yes to O yes to FP I program
procedural all right let's see it epic typing thank you I haven't had coffee dude I don't know if I can give up this
coffee business I don't know if I can I'm feeling so weak I'm feeling so right now I've never felt more weak in my
lifetime I've never felt more weak in my lifetime uh damn okay so I wasn't
expecting this what would JavaScript do I don't know what JavaScript would do declarative or imperative uh declarative
is the world's greatest scam really declarative is the world's greatest scam for sure because it always feels so easy
but then all of a sudden as you use it it becomes incred ibly difficult it's
like super nice until it's super awful how much coffee do you drink regularly couple cups anyways okay so it looks
like we have more oops than FPS and then we got the this whatever this is this procedural group
they're pretty heavy over here that's why I like implicit returns shut up you shut your dirty mouth all right so let's
let's G let's keep on going okay it seems like a lot of people dislike object-oriented programming the first things to come to mind when hearing
these three letters are cars inheritance getter Setters and object Factory singl tens yes all of these are true this
always seems kind of odd to me not only do I like o I feel that it often is the
best SL most obvious way to model a problem all right here's why I think it is so I I'd really like it if they could
give uh whoever whoever who wrote this Sigma blog uh my Sigma my Sigma Aster uh
if someone could tell me how much experience does whoever wrote this article have with functional programming
because that's always the big thing that I see is that you see a lot of people critique about how something is or is
not and they often have little to no experience in one category versus another so I always do appreciate a
little bit more of a hey this is you know I've done years of whatever like if he was just like I was a full-time hasal
Dev for this long and he got he left hasell I mean I'd be very curious as to his his
reasoning okay because normally you don't leave hasell just saying hasal mentioned let's go I think before anything further we should probably
Define what we are talking about unfortunately oop is not well defined for the sake of coherence let's settle
on a clear and unambiguous definition first okay this guy is starting to sound like a functional programmer uh we will
be talking about objects a lot so what are they most introduction texts to oop use physical things like cars and
animals to illustrate what objects are and while that is not wrong it's
literally where the object metaphor comes from Alan Kay was thinking in terms of biological cells and networks
it's certainly misleading because objects are much more than that okay Peter Wagner writes objects
are collections of operations that share a state okay kind of like a cured a
curried parameter in a function it's kind of I mean like I mean you know delicious rust it has a struct and you
can attach methods to it the methods are the shared state right the methods share a state right I love that if that
falls into the definition of o I love o I love structs with functions you love
chicken curry okay I get it I get it uh Mark stepik and Daniel bobra babra uh
Define objects as the following objects are entities that combine the properties of procedures and data since they
perform computations and save local state uniform use of objects contrast with the use of separate procedures and
data in conventional programming okay here's another definition by the gang of four object oriented programming are
some made up let's see are made up of objects and object packages both data and procedures that can operate on data
procedures are typically called Methods or operations like if we're just talking about this right now I'm on oop train I
like my data I like methods that work on that data I find it easier to use in the world of
LSPs uh I don't like a bunch of functions because I find it harder to figure out what functions I need to call
to do things whereas if you have a simple object that I can do a DOT separator on and I get all the methods
to manipulate and or do something with set object I find it very easy and simple so I'm curious where this is
going because where does the break happen at what point do I say I hate this let's find out
okay okay that's a good start but I still think an important characteristic of objects is missing maybe Tim Ren can
help objects are units of state that are generally Opa to the outside this I think is an important part we will see
later why that is is an object can however provide the possibility to interact with its state by the means of
message passing oh my goodness method method path I'm having a stroke haven't had coffee in two days message passing
methods H okay yeah okay wait a second collections of
operations that share State entities that combine procedures and data units of State what the hell is that supposed
to mean meth it's meth it's meth people
well uh in means that object is an abstract term and an object can potentially be anything anything with
state that is it can be a physical item like a car an abstract concept it can be
a random piece of data with some sort of behavior attached to it oop just means we model our problem using these objects
that is it I mean if that is all the definition
of o is then I mean I'm I'm on board yeah
then everything is oop well not everything is O because some people some things aren't o function like pure
functional programming where you functional programming in which you have no methods then I would say yeah right
functions where you can only just pass in like structs C would be not
uh C would be like just not doing it
right I know the problem is is everything o yeah yeah yeah yeah uh when lightning
strikes a tree what uh whose behavior is that I don't know what are you talking
about what the hell are you talk why did I read that out loud uh you might be thinking hold on we Define oop without
even touching classes what gives the answer is simple classes are not strictly necessary for o a shocker I
know of course we need to be able to construct new objects and a class-based languages are admittedly way more
prevalent however or prevalent however this is not the only way to achieve the
goal languages like JavaScript although es6 introduced classes is to the languages or Lua used
the concept called prototyped based or prototypal oop instead of providing a schema for constructing new objects we
use existing objects as prototype this approach can have real world benefits as it reduces the language complexity I
don't know if that's true at all I mean protot uh prototypal uh o op is
interesting like Lu's uh metat tables are very very interesting but it's most certainly I would not call it simple I
would not say that it reduces complexity they're weird as hell they're not weird as hell they're you have to like again
you can't fit them into the construct of what you already are used to you have to kind of think a little bit differently and they're really not all that bad
they're they're interesting uh just let's see see just as a side note classes don't need to be called classes
languages like go or rust ooh uh and also see to some extent call them strs
for example do c structs it's hereditary another term while not technically necessary is often associated with oop
as inheritance there are two reasons to use inheritance okay okay I I I would love to see
this rust of course rust mentioned because that it makes sense because it's just strs right right now okay I think
we I think we got something here I think we're seeing a more clear picture of what he means by o is not bad uh another
term that while not technically necessary is often associated with oop as inheritance boo can we get some like
uh there are two reasons to use inheritance first is to reuse existing code however in modern programming this
is usually discouraged in favor of object composition an object inside another object yo dog I heard you like
objects yes python yeah get that python out uh
yeah hell yeah object in an object the second reason and to me the more important one is for abstraction and
polymorphism the term the technical term is uh for this is subtyping yeah I don't
know I don't know know I have never met an inheritance chain that I really liked
you know what I mean just saying I've never really like I've just really never liked inheritance every time I've ever
used inheritance I've been upset about it inheritance is not o op correct well I mean in some sense he's saying it sort
of is but let's find out yes I think the topic is important enough to Warn its own heading subtyping is not exclusive
to oop however it is a special significance here since it's the primary way of modeling polymorphism the idea is
to combine multiple different classes that share common messages have methods with similar semantics into a super type
that defines those messages now the super type can be used instead of the uh instead of a specifying a subtype my
favorite example of how subtyping can be used in practice is the Java collection framework it defines interfaces we'll
talk about what exactly interfaces are for example use cases are lists cues
sets Maps as well as different implementations with different characteristics which support those use
cases hell yeah hell yeah um nothing like a good oldfashioned
concurrent skip list baby I don't remember I I don't remember my uh I'm
not even sure what I'm looking at link transfer Q is an abstract CU which is a abstract collection which is a collection which is an
iterable is that how you read that see I don't think inheritance is a
good way to solve this I think the trait system in rust or just being able to have like you know
orthogonal types to this is is way better right I don't want to have to have iterable as something I inherit
from this graph was generated from java docs by scraping all known subclasses of collection and map and removing
non-relevant nodes oh okay they removed non-relevant notes everybody nonrelevant
ones this is actually this is actually a tightened up version of it thank God I know I mean I wouldn't have been able to
understand it otherwise uh so let's say I want to process a list of data I want to use a
list interface everywhere at the point where I instantiate the list I choose array list since I us let's see it's
usually more performant implementation that is not a sentence I want anyone to listen to because I do not know if
that's true or not uh it really has its time in place later on it turns out that
the program is doing a lot of inserts and deletes at the beginning of the list which is pretty slow on arrays to speed up the program I can switch to a link
list without changing any of its type signatures side note when calling a
method we need to know the actual class of the object not just its declared class otherwise subtyping won't work
properly this is called late Dynamic binding it's technical execution is a bit tricky and is the main reason why
C++ objects and object pointers behave differently CV tables okay I mean yeah
interfaces are great I think we all agree that interfaces are great right you love the collections API there's
there's a lot of good stuff in the collections interfaces are great someone said no of course interfaces are
great you love interfaces don't try to tell me you don't love
interfaces no you don't love interfaces why not array list isn't an array yes it
is it's an array underneath the hood in which stores the items and then as the
list exceeds its capacity it reallocates and moves often doubling in size
commonly referred to as a dynamic list or a dynamic array so no one can tell me why they don't like interfaces
interfaces are fantastic is go slices array list go arrays the make arrays they act like
array list yes that's why you have they I assume they're probably an array list underneath the hood I assume they're not
uh linked list they're Dynamic arrays yes um let's see I love contracts I read every sentence interfaces stole my
girlfriend okay you guys aren't helping at all I think we can't and shouldn't talk about subtyping without mentioning behavioral subtyping and Barbara uh
lisov the basic idea of Behavioral subtyping is that a subtype should behave in a way similar to the parent type Barbara lisov who later won a
touring award for her work on programming languages in oop in particular formalized the concept in 1987 into strong behavioral subtyping a
subtype should be able to use in every situation its parent type can be used in
okay okay this sounds like she created inheritance solid mentioned I'm not really sure what I don't know if I'm I'm
applauding Barbara maybe I should be I don't know uh subtype requirement
let this be a property provable about objects X type T then only this should
be true for all objects of Y of Type S where s is a subtype of T classic
classic classic just get just just get get it together people what are we reading hll ah yes ah yes okay let's try
to understand this okay this is a property provable of objects X of type T
then this should be true for all objects of Y of sub of Type S where s is a subtype of T I'm not really sure the
problem is I don't quite understand what this is trying to say is this a function that takes in parameter X like what's
its meaning no I'm not saying the word fee I'm saying speak English stop speaking them Greeks boy uh this is
called uh lisov substitution principle I won't go into details here but the basic idea is that any precondition for types
data or state for parameters can not be stronger than the super type while any postcondition for results cannot be
weaker than uh the super type the notion is related to the design by contract methodology that started to pop up
around the same
time oh
okay did I get that
correct well this was that stupid article we read lcav lcav what did I how did I say
it I did lovs okay yeah
yeah yes I've been using chat GPT to learn Roblox
okay l
I got hit I got hit with the L there L uh okay uh is one of the five solid
principles of object-oriented programming and design formulated by Barbara Lov in 19 87 it states that
objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclass without affecting the correctness of the program in Practical terms it means that
a subass should extend the behavior of a superclass not alter it here is a practical example to illustrate L uh
lisov substitution principle super class bird K subass Sparrow in this example
the bird class as method fly and the spal class being a bird naturally implements fly method adhere to the
LSP adhering to the LSP however the ostrich class although a bird cannot fly and raises a not Implement exception
this violates uh the lov's whatever principle uh because it changes behavior
of the superclass uh method leading to unexpect Behavior yeah yes it does
that's because this just never works o disproven by Chad G
gity bird flying bird okay so this would be how you do
the correct version of it oh my goodness it is it is like
communism you just have to do it correctly and then it works
gosh dang gosh dang I've been wrong this whole
time okay I I mean that's okay I I I guess I get
this I feel like this isn't uh doesn't have to be
with the thing I don't like about this in general is that there's so much more subtyping you
have to do whenever you use inheritance as opposed to having a behavior you can attach to
something like that's why I do like go or rust is because I can just have a struct and then I just make the
struct just have more behaviors and be
usable at any point in interface that I fulfill like to me this is just a 9,000
times better version of solving this exact same problem it's just so much easier because
whenever you do this like think about how many things you have to get correct right you have to get it correct to the
point where you actually make sure that you don't bork this principle but let's be real here whenever you use this
whenever you've done in inheritance you've borked this principle at some point you work at a place that borks
this principle no matter what this thing is always broken it's you're done effed
up you're done effed up a Aon every single time sparrow bird iterable drawable yeah
exactly and so you end up making these this this is what always happens whenever I see someone try to do o op
right is that you end up getting this really really really long chain where you have to go through like 15 different
classes to figure out what the hell is happening because it just doesn't
work because everything has to be so gosh darn
narrow this is an extremely correct solution but it ignores the Practical reality that implementing it fully and
more complicated than the context management overhead of not doing at all yes exactly it precisely it's always so
simple it's the same reason why I always on like like any example app people give me like look at how easy react is
do you see this example app or look at how easy it is to use Redux look at this sample app look look at how easy to use
HTM X look at this sample app the reality is that real applications take
everything that you like and pour a gentle amount of just
oil over it and just ruin everything okay ruins everything every
good concept just turns awful when you use it in
reality oil I didn't have anything there okay my bra okay I haven't add coffee okay just let me let me PB all
right in some cases we don't care about the code sharing aspect of inherit but still want to profit off of subtyping we
might never actually use the super type implementation of the methods and can therefore omit it entirely this is in
fact so common it even has a name virtual or abstract methods you know rust does have some
things that are very similar to this uh in the sense that you can do traits and then if you have enough methods defined on a trait you can even do trait default
implementation have you seen that so you can actually have like an what feels like an abstract class in some sense
because the trait itself self has a default implementation it's
interesting have you seen this have you heard about this I'm that's what that's why I'm saying it rust is O op all the
way baby all the way uh that's mostly because rust is failing towards the C++
approach of implementing everything for everyone classic uh some languages Let's see we might even end up removing all
state from our abstract super type and only use it as a stencil for defining methods this is called an interface O
Yay interfaces some some languages go or even go a step further by the way I think one of the biggest faults of a
typescript interfaces is that it allows well there's actually a couple faults but one of the big faults ambient
interfaced make my dream sad collisions are very very sad but the second one is
also which by the way they can also be very very nice but the second one is also that they allow properties on an interface I think properties are truly
an implementation detail and they should not be there just saying uh some languages go a step further and
completely decouple interfaces from classes there are two different schools of thought here yeah I like the I like the secal structural typing as opposed
to uh usual nominal typing is when an interface implementations are not declared at all you can simply use the
object as an implementation as long as all the necessary methods are defined this is uh statically checked at compile
time examples of languages that support structural typing are go I love I actually really do like that both for interfaces themselves and type
constraints and C++ for Concepts yeah but are Concepts even implemented like how long have Concepts been
around how long have they been around are we actually getting Concepts
and do I even really know what concepts are even though I did read it once Concepts feel like traits give it 10
years yeah Concepts feel like traits conceptually speaking yes uh they need some time to marinate uh duck typing is
similar but the existence of methods is only checked at runtime languages use this pattern uh included Python and
JavaScript one disadvantage that's often cited is that it is more complicated to figure out which classes can be expected
at a particular point in the program yeah yeah I mean that's that's the whole I yeah fully agree actually so I'm I'm a
big fan of structural typing by the way I actually really like this because you get all the compile time goodies but you
get kind of like the ease of use of everything else you know what I mean like you don't have to say like oh I'm
all these things you're just you just are those things I am this thing now I will say
that with rust the use of Turbo fishes plus parse is you know is really cool I like that I prefer type unions or rust
enums to interfaces uh most of the time enums give you a list of types that you can accept and do pre-type
implementation or per type implementation interfaces force you to be abstract yeah but there's many there's plenty of places that you need
interfaces like right like parsing the from trait in in Rust is a great is is a
great example you just need to be able to parse something to something else it just has to be an interface you know
what I mean it can't it can't be an enom uh anyways the second pattern doesn't seem to have an established name yet the
idea is to declare that the class implementing an interface after the class was already defined an example of a language that does this is rust with
traits unfortunately traits is a horrible name for this concept since traits usually just refer to mixins I've
heard the term extension traits in reference to extension methods in C cotlin DZ nuts uh but this doesn't seem
to be very common either another language that supports this feature is hcll they call it type classes but hll
is arguably not object oriented arguably one would argue that hll is not
object oriented uh okay yes I I do agree traits is a terrible name uh because
once you know what a trait is then it makes still some not sense but I just call I just use that word because that's
what I I know now um all right hideand-seek the term that is often used with oop is encapsulation there are
actually two applicable definitions of the term the first one refers to bundling data with behavior the object
metaphor and the second one refers to restricting access to the state only to the object itself I would like to focus
a bit on the latter since I think a lot of people don't understand it properly encapsulation is the technique for
minimizing interpr dependencies among separately written modules by defining strict external interfaces so why is it
important to restrict access to State well there is multiple reasons we could argue that it would violate lov's
history constraint well I didn't know about Lov history constraint now did we
I feel like I need to wash it normally I order larges and they they fit
nicely encapsulation versus abstraction yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we're we're kind of on the
encapsulation uh El ligma history constraint classic but I think it that
oh my goodness but I think it's much more practical to look at it from the perspective of a developer who wants to refactor the code base let's say we want
to change the internal structure of an object like in the list example earlier maybe we want to switch from an array
list to a link list but if other components are reliant on the internal state in the case of the array list this
could be an internal primitive array we cannot easily change it we would need to
find all places outside the class where the internal structure is re referenced the problem gets even worse when the
class is exported and used by modules that we might not even control again
this is why I said earlier this is like precisely the reason why I said earlier that interfaces in typescript that allow
properties was a great mistake you look more buff in this one
I've been feeling buff okay I've been feeling like I'm getting in shape these days I have been sore for
like the last eight weeks straight and I'm just sick of it sick of
it open close principle open for extension close for modification uh object coupling and
class cohesion are often talked about uh encapsulation object coupling describes how much different objects depend on
each other high object coupling are we talk about AFR or eant coupling uh implies that objects in question rely on
a lot on each other which usually means that or usually means they should be one single object instead if objects rely on
each other's internal structures they are highly coupled class cohesion describes the same characteristic but from a different perspective it's a
measure of how coherent a class responsibilities are a class should ideally represent one idea and only do
stuff Rel relateded to that idea low class co uh cohesion usually means high
object coupling and vice versa okay so these are some of those things
that you know normally I would love to agree with all these things yeah if you just use
composition you don't have this problem again a lot of these problems I feel like are self-made problems I think Judo you are very very correct in the sense
that a lot of these problems that we're reading are purely problems created by
people who love o and now we have oop problem whiteboard
masturbation there's a lot of whiteboard masturbation in oop and it can be very very difficult to follow along because
there's just so much of it I'm not sure if you've done any objectoriented programming you've heard something like don't use public properties properties
in the sense of member variables at some point and this is true because public properties expose the internal State and can potentially cause high object
coupling however as with any Dogma it is usually a good idea to question it in this case the complete guideline is
don't use public properties use Getters and Setters instead which is completely wrong I would actually agree with this
completely Getters and Setters are such a waste of of energy and mental headp space in terms of encapsulation Getters
and Setters are just as bad as public properties exactly as they do nothing to prevent object coupling if you have a
class without meth any methods besides Getters and Setters it it doesn't really fit our object definition a term that
has been used uh for this is record by the way if you just have Getters and Setters like real talk Getters and
Setters are just slightly less convenient properties you're still just as I mean I know that c has get and set
I just don't understand the the the purpose of get most Getters and Setters there's like very few Getters and
Setters that make any sort of sense but what's the point I people just want to
not have properties I don't know what the point of Getters and Setters are you want to be able to programmatically be
able to define a a definition without having Getters and Setters are by far
highly one of the most like I swear it's one of the biggest lies in all of programming I guess we're going
to have to do something really quick aren't we um let's go like this so let's just delete that uh I know
I know C has a version of them right uh I don't know where my music is but anyways so imagine you have a private
you know a private uh Foo it's a number okay am I on JS or TS ah crap I'm in t
JS here let's let's make this TS because it makes it more clear I think anyways
okay there you go shut up anyways so we have this food right we have this priv so then we can have these things like uh
here we'll call this private underscore food you know what I mean you know what I mean then we'd have something like get
Fu that returns a number that returns out this
Fu look at that look at that look at that x uh V value right uh void and then
we go this. Fu equals V okay fantastic all right
oopsies uh FV uh what is it uh number there we go let's see cannot have type
annotations okay shut up shut up all right so that means we can have a new Foo right here and I'm going fu. Fu
equals 123 dude just use an effing method at this point can we all
agree that this it's just you could put some more logic in this right you can definitely put some
more logic in here that you want to do right you could have some sort of calculated method what happened if you had something like this right uh bar and
so then you wanted length right and that was this. Fu plus this bar okay so that
means I'd go something like this what is my length right oh look at how nice that is that's really really nice in fact I
have an exact use case for this exact thing right here did you know that I have an exact use case because if you
build yourself a say a request queue you have two different you have two different lengths right you have the uh
uh items right which is an array let's just say and then you also have inflight requests
which is going to be a number so the length is actually those two numbers put together right it's going to be this.in
items q. length plus uh this.f flight request right or you can just stop being
a jackass and just use a just use a effing method okay just use a method okay why are you doing this to yourself
okay what are you doing what are you doing request Q okay just stop it just
use just use just just use a method
okay save the parenthesis but it makes it dude it just somehow it is such a lie
to do this right this feels like you're lying
like computed properties are always just I I genuinely feel that they're they're kind of dangerous you know what I mean I
just feel like whenever you use a computed property you're doing something in which is a little naughty and you
should ask yourself why am I doing a computed property this is the thing if
you actually want to use this with interfaces you have to recognize that a programming interface doesn't specify a data type it specifies a transport
otherwise it's an abstract class or template which are not the same thing facts and if you go with a computed
property you know it doesn't really work out in the interface sense of the world right uh I would name it compute length
okay great I would name it length I in fact I would even name it link I would name it Len okay cuz that is who I am
okay that is what I would do I would name it like that and then I'd have its counterpart method uh empty which
returns bull buing which would be Len equals zero okay oh my goodness oh my
goodness all right there you go look at that all right fantastic or just L L's l
l doesn't make any sense Len is perfectly fine Len makes high level code look like Assembly Language no it doesn't make it look like Assembly
Language where do you guys where where do you guys get off you guys don't program enough rust okay go program some
Rust and come back to me Lenin communism Lenin Co communism anyways all right
okay so what is oop op is related to State and behavior are bundled into units objects other property other
properties objectoriented languages may have our classes prototypes encapsulation subtyping and inheritance
let's look at the Modern languages at least top 15 okay okay here let me I'm going to zoom this out just because it's a little bit
easier to look at these things JavaScript encapsulation okay this is
wrong it does have encapsulation modern JavaScript does have privates right uh python uh not on a language level okay
fair yes I mean python you can in can't you inspect values in closures uh let's see
typescript classes it also has encapsulation no JavaScript also has if you use
uh you can also use this right
right and that means I I can't access Fu
right like that's that's real it actually does have it and that's at a language level and when you in fact when
you when you in fact when you uh when you string Json stringify
it
um so it is actually at a pretty high language level dang
it uh get rid of all this
crap there we
go get the hell out of here
okay cool cool cool talk cool talk okay cool talk cool talk I don't know what
that is why is my LSP
breaking all
right I take out everything look at that see notice that it only printed F
69 it didn't in fact actually print the private property the property the
private property is actually pre yes I'm ignoring the fact that all that other just happened okay do you even knowe uh today if you want to ship your
project on schedule and minimize the amount of tech debt uh you forward use go yeah anyways you get it all right all
right some good stuff in here no one cares about no one cares about these ones uh sear a c none of them okay it
doesn't even have objects well I mean are strs objects I don't know are structs objects I guess you can't quite
say they're objects because you can't because a part of his definition of objects are they have function pointers right they have methods so you can't say
it no they're just TRS they're just memory C has perfect encapsulation PHP
go yeah Powershell didn't even realize that was a language uh go on a package
Leal uh level and structural typing best typing honestly it's best typing I think structural typing might be my favorite
typing right it might be my favorite typing I Thought I Loved Russ nominal typing extension traits but I think I
actually like structural typing better just in general uh okay so let's see now that we
have a good understanding of what exactly oop is and what we can expect from a language that implements the oop Paradigm let's take a look at some
common points of criticism I shamelessly crowdsource most of the following part by asking my friends what they hate
about oop but what are objects what uh so objects are can be anything right so how do I know what should be be an
object when should I combine things what should be separated well that's called experience bro and this exists in or not
in objectoriented like that's just that's just that's called programming doc uh
well in the end that's just practice and experience with time you'll get a feeling about what shouldn't uh what shouldn't be an object however to get
started there are some tricks that might help you uh here's what the gang of four has to say dude it's that skill issue
going on here object-oriented design methodologies favor many different approaches you can write a problem statement single out the nouns and verbs
and create correspond by the way if you're hit me with nouns and verbs and you're talking about programming I already know that you're hitting that
whiteboard too hard okay I don't know about all this I don't know all I don't know about all this this nouns and verbs
and adjectives and participles going on here uh or can you focus on on the
collaborations and responsibilities in your system or can you model the real world and translate the objects found
during analysis into design there will always be disagreement with approaches uh on which approach is best speeding
speeded Speedy things go in Speedy things come out op slow or so I've heard the rational is that the vtable lookups
are overhead compared to direct function calls I don't know I don't actually know
whether that's true so I decided to test it the test setup is as follows I wrote the same program a touring machine
checking for binary palindromes three times once using object-oriented programming once using structural
programming using only functions loops tupal and arrays and stuff like this and one using functional program for good
measure I measured everything in C++ so it's equally playing field an equal playing field also C++ has the first
class function class functions Lambda expressions for functional version hell
yeah it does everybody loves who here doesn't love
c++'s lambdas aren't they just so good yeah there you go thank you
jamely appreciate that that's what I always like seeing what am I capturing what are the arguments where's the
function body it's just like damnn son I don't even know what the hell is happening um there is 100,000 test cases
the total time is measured the compiler is clang 1403 and the target platform is Apple silicon M1 I can test each and uh
with both o uh 0 and 03 for the O implementation I made sure not to rely
on Heap allocations since the context witches would probably completely ruin the runtime I did however use
inheritance the template pattern to be specific to make the template pattern to be specific to make vtable lookups as
realistic as possible the structured version also allocates everything on the stack I built two different versions the
first one uses tupal in the translation table lookup however I wasn't sure how tupal are implemented under the hood and
I wanted to avoid using objects by accident if possible so I wrote another version that only relies on functions
but it turns out the results were uh so close I couldn't tell the difference does that mean FP is winner or loser is
this how many cycles we're doing or as we can see the structured version
is marginally uh is marginally 5% faster than the object oriented uh one okay
hold on okay so more is worse more is worse
you know this just tells me you got some skill issues going on you got some skill issues on the functional program if you acally wrote something that is 10 times
slower you got some skill issues o camel is dead that's just skill issues that's
skill issues for sure uh when using 03 the performance is basically identical so my guess is that C++ Optimizer was
able to get rid of whatever uh impacted the performance the functional implementation is not even remotely closed to a certain extent this is
probably caused by The Benchmark I chose touring machines are inherently stateful which is pretty awkward to model in a
functional way did you model it well though did you um another aspect is that
even though I use C++ 14 which supports return type inference I was forced to use standard function template as a
wrapper for the Lambda expressions Anonymous types are a pain in the backside which according to my test are
quite a bit slow slower than native Lum Expressions okay so he might have forced himself to use
something that wasn't very Swift I don't remember programming a touring machine you're programming on a touring machine have you ever thought about that I
should have probably done some more rigorous statistical tests or at least calculated the deviation but honestly I was too lazy I may write up an update on
proper analysis later on uh in case you wanted to do some tests on your own feel free to send me the results afterwards
the source code is on GitHub uh also I should probably apologize for the horrible code C++ is not my native language and I hacked it together in an
hour or so again dangers here dangers uh anyways without rigorous statistic uh
statistics my conclusion of the test is that there is only a very small difference in performance adding more
abstraction layers or using different data structures probably has more significant impact agreed agreed this
article is a skill issue this article is not a full skill issue there's a lot of good Insight here however other benchmarks on embedded systems have
found 10% performance penalty compared to procedural implementation let's go procedural another paper comparing the
performance of different aspects of O as well as different design pattern has shown that virtual functions which I
used in my implementation can impact the performance negatively uh the template pattern which I also used can decrease
the performance by about 3 to 4% but this may also be uh this might also just
be because it relies on Virtual functions by the way whenever you see percents and stuff like this I will just completely disregard most of this it
might slow it down it might slow it down all right abstract nonsense for some reason oop leads us to over complicated
everything we need we endlessly or we needlessly build abstractions on top of abstractions seemingly for the sole
purpose of making pretty uml diagrams okay this is a pretty good argument but this works for every type of
programming can we agree to that I think that anybody that has the ability to program in a more abstract language will
by the very necessity make more complicated and Abstract things the
startup not only has increasing net worth but also increased net girth
thanks pick I hope that girth is feeling quite girthy the thing is it's caused by how we use the tools not the tools
themselves my suspicion is that most the these issues arise from developers wanting to be clever and build generic solutions to cover every possible future
development yep exists in every single language I think a lot of this can be avoided by adjusting the workflow
specifically if the end goal is not determined from the beginning don't plan on every eventuality from the start only
plan for what you need you'll need dude I love this this is so good this is so good this is like the greatest piece of
advice in this entire article right here is just build what you need stop stop
stop the requirements might change later on so your amazing highly generic solution that you worked on for four
weeks straight might not be used in the end a waste of time facts uh the threat
of get and set op is so verbose there is so much boilerplate Getters and Setters for example Sai this is a personal pet
peeve of mine we touched on this earlier but but I would really like to hammer this part home if you really need Getters and Setters for every single
member variable it's probably not a proper object to start with also bad programming skill issues I'd highly
encourage reconsidering your object model try to reduce coupling if it's really a record class with no internal
Behavior everything might as well be public there is hardly a point in using Getters and Setters a similar thing
though admittedly it's better applies to properties in languages like C oh c mentioned damn it we got C here of
course code generators uh like the infamous
lombok C people classic cper the only reason for the use of Getters and
Setters over public members is whether or when there is some additional logic like validation of invariance for
example that's fair I still think it's just dangerous I think you should use a method and not a Getters and Setters uh
kind of related if you have a value object with no Setters but a lot of Getters make sure to not accidentally
expose a modifiable reference to same internal State otherwise you've got Setters that's not intentional
ooh okay okay this is the LA this looks like kind of like the last one uh object
factory factory Singleton I guess there are two topics that fits this heading the first being naming Madness that has
been established in Enterprise software development this is again not a per se an issue with o although for some reason
it seems to happen a lot more in oop this is more of an issue of O dog I
happened to be uh a Calvin Henny fan and he gave an amazing talk on naming in programming at devweek 2015 among other
things he talks about how naming can influence modeling I highly recommend watching it okay on the second topic it
is a rabbit hole of design patterns that are often blindly applied seemingly without any thought on why exactly
specifically the factory pattern has some valid use case or uses but because people overuse that pattern so much it's
now synonymous with unnecessary abstractions everything's a factory C is a really good programming language
you watch your mouth Judo we don't complement it out loud there are some courses Also let's see there is there
are of course also established patterns where you should really have a damn good reason to actually use it at least in a
strictly objectoriented context single Singleton for example Singleton is in essence just a fancy name for Global
variable great fun little side note in the spring framework Beans by default gets a Singleton scope meaning if not
stated otherwise every single Bean is global your beans are Global boy the dream of spring another thing I've been
noticing with modern Enterprise applications is that they're actually not objectoriented entities dto are
records not objects beans Services repositories don't hold State and could just well be plain functions in modules
we are we are using languages that Force us to think in classes with architectures that don't require objects
spring boot could just as well be written in C it's pretty sweet it's
pretty sweet maybe spring is not that bad maybe spring is not that bad maybe I
like spring I don't even know uh what a ride in my longest blog post so far maybe a bit too long I'll make sure the
next one is shorter I also found a really interesting talk by barara uh lisov about abstraction but I just wasn't sure where
to put it so here you go uh I particularly like the stab against python for throwing encapsulation out the window anyways I hope I could shed
some light on the topic maybe you've learned something or at least you found some of my ramblings somewhat entertaining see you soon Sigma let's
good I actually really like that this is Sigma grind set I actually really like this article there's a lot of good things in it but at the end of the day I
still don't quite understand o you know real talk I still think the problem with
o the problem with any of these things is that they all have very they're all accomplishing the same goal with
slightly different approaches and I think at the end of the day one reason why I like one reason why I've grown to
like go so much in the recent time is that it just forces you to be stupid and
by forcing you to be stupid I find myself highly productive simple is not intuitive at all you got to quit
regurgitating dumb dumb dumb phrases you read on the internet okay I know whose blog post you're effectively quoting
word for word it's not that great the internet is always
right just saying uh the prime SE all okay I haven't had coffee in a couple days and I'm angry okay simple is good
NS simple can be very very good and in most cases simple is good enough it just depends on how simplistic you have you
just don't want to exceed a certain line of Simplicity cuz once there's a certain line of Simplicity then it becomes very
difficult I don't think Go's a great language no one ever said that it's a
very mid language it just is very very practical is rust simple rust is neither
simple nor easy uh take that a step further I think that languages with a
better modules and interfaces had become more popular sooner we wouldn't have gotten microservice as hell and we would
still be on a lot of monoliths potentially
maybe go is so mid it's good yeah it's just it's super mid it's pretty good he quick caffeine too yeah nice job nice
job him what is a great language for you then I like go it's a great shitty
language it's like a great shitty language and I like to use it and I
enjoy using it we'll see if I keep on enjoy using it after a year I'm going to give it a good year of trying to build a bunch of little things in it and I'll
see how I feel at the end you know what I mean we'll see we'll see
anyways become grug brain use Simple Things okay it will make your life
easier just trust me just try not using as complicated stuff try hmx with go
enjoy it the name you know what the name is and you will shut the hell up

### Conclusion:

Dr. Chuck's interview elucidates the critical role of the C programming language in the evolution of software development. Despite its drawbacks, such as complexity and potential for security vulnerabilities, learning C offers unparalleled insight into the mechanics of programming. This knowledge is foundational for those aiming to advance from basic programming capabilities to a deeper, more comprehensive understanding of software development. Dr. Chuck's dedication to education and his innovative approach to teaching C underline the importance of both historical context and practical knowledge in mastering programming.

Dr. Chuck discussed the idea of finding a successor to C, mentioning Rust as a potential candidate. However, his views on Rust were mixed, indicating that while he initially thought Rust could be an ideal successor due to its safety features and modern affordances, he later found that Rust still carried some of the complexities and flaws inherent to C. This realization led him to reassess the position of Rust as a direct successor to C.

### Successor to C:

- **Initial Enthusiasm for Rust:** Dr. Chuck initially speculated that Rust could serve as the successor to C, imagining a language that retained C's efficiency while addressing its safety concerns.
- **Reevaluation of Rust:** Upon closer inspection, he concluded that Rust, although it introduced modern features and improved safety, did not fully escape the complexities that made C challenging to use safely. This observation led him to question Rust's suitability as a direct replacement for C.

### View on Innovations:

- **Pragmatic Approach:** Dr. Chuck's approach to innovation in programming languages is pragmatic. He values advancements that significantly improve safety, efficiency, and ease of use without introducing unnecessary complexity.
- **Importance of Fundamentals:** He emphasizes understanding the fundamental principles of programming, as seen in his discussion on the value of learning C. This understanding is crucial for both appreciating innovations and making informed decisions about adopting new technologies.
- **Openness to New Tools:** While he expresses skepticism about certain languages as complete successors to C, Dr. Chuck is not dismissive of new tools and languages. Instead, he advocates for using the right tools for specific tasks, highlighting the importance of choosing technologies based on their strengths and suitability to the project's requirements.

In summary, Dr. Chuck's views on the successor to C and his stance on innovations reflect a balance between appreciating foundational knowledge and being open to advancements that offer tangible improvements to programming practices. He recognizes the significance of innovation while also acknowledging the enduring value of understanding core programming concepts.

Coming up
I I really have come to learn something this class took me four years and and I've really learned that uh C is
probably the single most important programming language than anyone will ever learn and it is the programming language that no one should ever use
once you learn to program you you probably need to spend a little time figuring out how programs code really
works and if you go and use Django or you do databases or some other thing you
kind of move away from the purity of what programming really is but secretly what I wanted to do is I wanted to take
code that was written by chat PT and put it in this production software I'm like cuz I want to say like I want cat GPT to
be a partial author of my software so I didn't want to look too close at it I just wanted because I test it out just
fine right that's the worry that's the worry
yeah hey everyone it's David Bumble back with the amazing Dr Chuck Dr Chuck welcome it's great to be here David uh
The most important programming language
I've been looking forward to this for as long as since we did our last recording uh last interview because uh I've been
building this this course for four years and I looking forward to updating you on it yeah you got to tell us about this because this is really exciting I
believe I've heard you say this is about the best programming language right well I'm not sure about that I think that
what this is is this is about the programming language that you should never write any code in unless you're writing some weird microcontroller or
something I I've really have come to learn something this class took me four years and and I've really learned that
uh C is probably the single most important programming language that anyone will ever learn and it is the programming language that no one should
ever use and uh and so that's kind of an interesting irony because I I have been thinking a lot
about the difference between a junior programmer who can kind of cut and paste things and fix syntax errors and a
senior programmer who can see sort of Through The Mists and see what's really going on and be that senior uh developer
and when there's a problem or when there's a performance problem they sort of have a a a a six sense that allows
them to see inside what's going on Beyond just I wrote this codee and it seems to work and yet so I keep thinking
that this this course is the the step from Junior programmer to senior programmer and the C programming language is the thing we all fall back
on as senior developers whether we know it or not I like the differ differentiation you made you said it's
the most important language not what I the term I use the best but most important but something you shouldn't
use can you explain what you mean by that well it's the most important because of the understanding bit that I
just got done talking about but it's it's the it's something you shouldn't use because it's just a dangerous
programming language right it uh you know everything is a pointer you can miss me mess up pointers you can over
reference pointers you can mess up your stack I mean literally go if you go back literally for the past 25 years every
single significant security failure in operating systems and softwares is almost always related to the C
programming language like heart ple if you go all the way back to Heart ple that's a long time ago that was code in C okay and you know it's just when you
write and see you have to be super disciplined you have to have code review and even when you do that something will
get through it's just really dangerous to write professionally and see and then put that out there for the world to see
I'm sure parts of the Cisco kernel are written in C and that's okay because people aren't hacking it and attacking
it if you build a website and it's written in C or you build SSL and it's written in C that's dangerous yeah it's
The successor to C
interesting because I I think we discussed it last time and just for everyone who in I'll link previous
videos below you said that the successor perhaps to see might be rust yeah
although we that was some time ago we talked about rust and rust hasn't shown up in my uh feed much it uh it doesn't
seem all that uh likely to becoming the successor and I've got some comments
from people that talked uh on our last conversation whether or not rust was the next thing and I think what had happened
was is I had guessed that rust instead of investigating rust I imagine what rust would be if I wrote it and I'm like
if I wrote rust if I designed rust it'd be awesome but unfortunately rust was not built by me and so it still has a
number of the flaws of C still in it and so if if it has the flaws of C but it's got some Modern affordances like what
exactly is the point I mean somewhere between C and python what's there
because it still doesn't make it easy to do certain things and it's kind of like a little better C but then why so I
think the jury on rust is going to stay out I just don't see that it adds all that much above C and it doesn't
necessarily solve all the problems of sea if it was like a real safe sea I could I could get behind that but it's
not so just um I need to emphasize this just for everyone who's watching Dr Chuck the reason why we're having this conversation is you provide amazing
Dr. Chuck's free C course // C Programming for Everybody
resources for people around the world so I think we need to emphasize that the
reason we're having this talk is you've released a new C course that people can access for free is is that correct that
is correct I uh it's called C programming for everybody it's out on corsera and it is available for free on
www.cc free.com is this based on the the previous conversation we had was uh that
very famous book that you love in the 1978 C book is that is that correct I'm glad you brought it there
you go I brought it so yeah yeah it is based on that and so the again because
the idea of C programing for everybody it's not that you're going to write code and be a professional C programmer C is
foundational notion of Technology it is it is it is the moment in 1978 where
software portability became feasible and practical irrespective of the underlying hardware and so if you look at
everything up to 1978 we were using languages like Fortran or Cobalt and if
you had a CDC computer you wrote your stuff in Fortran system stuff non-system stuff if you were at a a burough
computer you wrote your stuff in Cobalt and the cobal on Bros computers was super fast and so the idea is you go
from one computer to the other but you just have to completely change everything all new operating systems all new languages all new library sets and
and C was research inadvertent Research into how to build one operating system
Unix one programming language C and then have that work on virtually any piece of Hardware that you would come across and
part of it was because the people at Bell labs in New Jersey were given a
bunch of hand-me-down crappy computers they didn't have a lot of money so they had to build an operating system and a language for hand-me-down crappy
previous generation or two generations back computers they had to make something work on them but then they
they would get one hand-me-down this year and then they get a different hand-me-down next year and a different hand-me-down next then we have 12
hand-me-downs from this other thing that they were going to try to do some so they had to come up with a way to get an
A working environment that let him get work done and yet was independent of the
hardware that they were just being given as hand-me-downs and so this book the 78
Edition which is becoming ever so rare that book is this it goes off an
interview sorry go on it it did as a matter of fact after the last interview that price of that book spiked up to
over $100 um it's it's somewhere between 25 and $75 right now this book is
written in a style of a research paper like a research report from an in it's
like well we were trying this and we tried that and this other thing worked and this worked pretty well and the we had two ways of doing this and this is
the one thing and so these authors in this book break the fourth wall all the time they just aren't telling you here's
the programming language C and here's where you put the semicolon no they're saying like here's what we were thinking in all the two things that didn't work
out so well but we figured it out afterwards and so the 1984 edition of that book which I actually don't have a
copy of the 1984 Edition took all that out because by 1984 the language was
just like of course see what else would you ever do and um so what I like is the
notion that C's laid the groundwork for uh modern software portability and the
book was written before it was an assured thing and so that's what I find super delightful about it and it you
just you're reading the book and you're saying well how come this is such a hard problem the answer is because these are
the people that made it possible to solve the hard problem and so you have to read it you go back in time and you
read it and you're like everything was difficult in 1978 nothing was and this book was you ways to make it
easier and that to me is the the most important thing it's like the movie Somewhere in Time where you just go back
in time and you kind of live in a different time and enjoy that different time and then you come back to the
present and you don't have to write the code any in this in this language so that's the fun part of going back in
time learning a language with a you know wearing an old hat from
1978 right so I'm going to wear an old hat while I take this teach take this course and then you come back and you're
in the modern world again and you have Python and you have dynamic memory you have more than 640k of RAM and all these
kinds of things that that make life wonderful so Dr Chuck some questions that people might have about the course
What should be your first programming language // Python for Everybody
should I take c as my first programming language uh absolutely not the key thing is is C learning C is the way that you
learn about that first programming language and in and these days python is pretty much the standard first
programming language it doesn't waste your time there's no details like stack frames or pointers or anything like that
in Python and you can you can go to work with python you can you can work in artificial intelligence you can work
with data mining you can work in all kind web development all kinds of things in Python and so so it's foolish not to
take python as a first language and of course I teach python for everybody which is the world's largest and most
successful Python Programming course three million around the world have taken that course and so that's the
first course no question the interesting thing and we we talked before I am increasingly starting to think that c
should be the second programming language um oh that's interesting I know when we talked two years ago I I thought
that c should be like the fourth or fifth thing that you learn and the reason for that is that once you learn a
program you you probably need to spend a little time figuring out how programs code really works and if you go and use
Jango or you do databases or some other thing you kind of move away from the purity of what programming really is and
so this course C programming for everybody turned out so well and I didn't know how advanced it was going to
be as a matter of fact I've been spent I spent four years working on this class and you and I I think talked two years ago kind of halfway through that half
way through it takes me a long time to build new classes because you know there's a lot to it and so what I've
kind of learned in the past four years of building this course is the the most difficult Concept in all of programming
Object Orient Programming
is objectoriented programming it absolutely is and I think that most
python courses most C courses most C+ plus courses and literally most Java courses do an awful job of teaching
object ored programming and that's because they say well we're going to make an animal and then we're make a cat
that inherits from animal and then we're going to make a dog that inherits from animal and we're going to make the cat meow and the dog bark now you know
object R programming and if you ever are a professional programmer it is not about animals cats and dogs it's it's
about solving problems of isolating code without you know and implementing things
and changing implementations and there's so much to it that understanding object
Orient programming is to me the key to becoming a successful professional programmer and so this course the SE
course when when we talked last time I I didn't think I was going to talk about object writing programming in the C
course as as a matter of fact I I had this whole story arc and I I I think of course this is stories I had this whole
story where at the end I'm like and I'm not going to talk about object Orin programming and I had these two poems I
read the end and one one was miles to go before we sleep both were from Robert Frost um in a forest dark and deep miles
to go before we sleep snow is falling all that stuff and um and I had another one says I'm going to take The Road Less
travel and the idea that I had when I was reading the poem The Road last traveled was I'm not going to teach you
object rning programming and all most people at this point in the class teach you object rning programming so I had all these lectures recorded with these
two poems in them at the very end of the class and and what happened was is I was teaching the class live because I did
that a year ago I was teaching it on campus live and I'm like I had a bunch of really sh sharp students from courses
I only had 12 students so I could talk to them continuously and and I said okay we're done now and they're
like you're done I'm like yeah Road Road Less Traveled we're not going to go that
way and they're go like you can't do that you have to tell us about objects and you have to tell us about
C++ I'm like no but I don't like C++ and they're like yeah but we like C++
and so I had to go back first and edit the poems now there's only one poem in
the thing and that is miles to go before we sleep and then what I decided to do was Focus the last third of the class
which you know as of this time last year didn't even exist on implementing
objectoriented programming in c and so what I began to do is I said let's just
say you're at C and you're in 1978 and you're looking forward and you
you think object programming is cool how would you build C++ if you were in C and
then how would you build Python and the object orientation of python if you were in see and this turned out to be great I
mean I just all of a sudden it's like giant Road opened up in front of me and the last the last few parts of the class
are literally implementing dictionary string and list the core data structures
of python and so we look at python code and then we Implement and see the kinds of things under the covers to implement
the list object the string object and the dictionary object and then the the way the course ends the C course ends is
we literally do as the last exercise of the course the first exercise of my
python course except that we do it in C and so it's this it's this
beautiful it's this beautiful kind of like whoa what a beautiful Story I mean again I think of this as a storytelling
not as like yeah learn this learn that but it's this beautiful story now one of the things that's happened since we last
"Stealing" The C Programming Language book // Interview with Brian Kernighan
talked I don't know if we talked since I interviewed um Brian kerigan the guy who wrote the book did did we talk about
that no you no we haven't no you said you were going to talk to him at some point that was where we ended it last time well I
mean start that story a little bit earlier right so there's this book from 1978 that you cannot buy it's not
available online so the Reas part of the reason it took me four years to make it is the first two years I basically stole
the book I bought a bunch of used copies of the book I cut off a spine of the best one I digitized it at high level
and I OCR it and I put all that stuff in GitHub and I hired a bunch of graduate students to go over line by line fix
every single thing to make a cool online version of this and I made all the uh code executable and I made all the all
this stuff and I built this book without ever knowing if I was going to get in trouble and so a large part of the four
years was talking to lawyers to see could am I going to get in trouble for what I just did I I just had to do it
because it's just like I love this book so much so um but there was a good reason the book is out of print it's not
available you would think about using it right yeah yeah and and and the lawyers told me there's a thing called fear use
right it's academic purposes it's a historical thing so lawyers felt like I had a pretty good chance right I it was
enough of a good chance for me to go forward so I built this perfect beautiful digital copy of the book and
right before we were going to put it start the process to convert it to go on
corsera I thought to myself that I better send a not this is a December
last year 12 months ago I better send a note to Brian kernigan because even though my lawyers said that we would
fight them and I had a good case I did not want to offend uh someone who I
considered like a god right in the in computer science so I sent a note December of last year I mean December
two years ago December 22 I said Brian I made this book and I
hope you like it and I didn't hear from for a couple of weeks and then and then he uh he said hm that's interesting I
have included on this email the editor of that book from Pearson and uh and so
I'm like oh boy and so I I uh yeah and so I I I I replied to the email and I
sent a note to Gary the fellow piar I said Gary I love this book it's a great book I'm using under fair
use I think it's good thing and people are going to love and I love the 1978 Edition and Gary said could we get
together on a zoom call I'm like oh damn that is not gonna go well at all so so
Gary I I'm like I'm just like I thought should I should I call the University
lawyers and tell them I'm going to get on a zoom call with Pearson should I call my own lawyers should I do whatever
I thought about it for a very long time I finally say you know what I think I'm just going to go alone on this
particular one and I'm going to schedule a call with Gary the Pearson editor of the book so I get on the call with
Pearson and there's one other guy and the guy looks like me he's like old goatee white gray hair and he says the
first thing out of his mouth is like man I love what you did with the book I'm like okay this is not going to be so bad
this is not going to be so bad and then the next thing he said is could I have a copy of it I'm like what wow I'm like of
course you can have a copy of it so it turns out that they have been um resurrecting old books and what I had
done in creating in effect a pristine perfect digital copy of an old book that
literally was only on paper they're like huh oh wow we have this online service and if we could get our hands on your
book we could put that into our online service and I'm like uh boy this that's not how I thought this conversation was
going to go at on so i' I've had an ongoing conversation with Pearson once Pearson and I were friendly I sent a
note to Brian kigan and said could I come to Princeton and bring my camera gear and interview you and so I did I
flew out to Princeton uh February of February 2023 and um we started doing an
interview and some of my interviews I'm very ready for and some of them I'm not well prepared for I thought this one was
so easy that I would be super well prepared for I wasn't I literally wasn't well prepared for an interview of Brian
kernigan a person who I thought that I knew I'd watched YouTube videos of him so the first thing you know about Brian kernigan is he didn't really inent see
Brian kernigan was the guy who wrote all the books and so if you look at the co-author k kigan and Richie Richie is
the one that built the and kernan's like hey can I write your stuff down and just get it out as a textbook Richie's like
yeah I don't care do whatever you want so Kuran was a leader and he was an important fellow he even wrote like a
memoir his own Unix Memoir this one I got signed by
him and he was like a leader at at Bell Labs he was like he was like a boss at Bell labs and so I started asking him
questions and I he's like how what was it like to invent C he's like I didn't invent C I like oh boy but then he was
kind and he told me a bunch of really good stories and then at one point we started talking about C++ and I want to
The history of C and C
give your viewers a poll and that is from like 1980 to 1984 BN strrip the
inventor of C++ was working on C++ the question is what country was be strrip
working in when he was building and evolving C++ or just kind okay so let's
do a do we get in the comments we can we yeah we can let them go in the comments but so let me give you some choices a
Norway B Finland C Denmark D UK e United
States of America so know the answer well so if you know he's he's European
he sounds European looks European I got an interview of him and um and he went I think he went to a university in Denmark
the answer to the question hopefully by now you've all figured this out is e United States of America not just United
States of America VN stroo the inventor of C graduated with his PhD from
whatever University and was hired by AT&T Bell labs in M Hill New Jersey and
so J strer was working on C++ two doors down from Dennis Richie working on C I
mean seriously oh wow and so you look at the evolution of SE from 1978 79 through 84 C++ was in the
building co-evolving things like the void type Etc and I'm like holy crap and
then I had to redo the course again because I always thought that C++ was kind of like an annoyance right it was
like oh there's C and then there's this weirdo European C++ thing not at all C++
was core to its development and as Brian tells in the interview his interview he's like oh yeah we loved him because
he was he was so his C++ code generate such weird C code that it it broke
everything you could possibly break and see and it helped us fix and so then you see this co-evolution of
c and C++ in the early 1980s and so the next interview that I don't have
scheduled yet but I've got agreed to is with GTO van rossom and once once I
realized that a c and the C++ were one concept right they were not like a weird
add-on I'm like now that I've done all this study of how you would build python
in C I'm like I want wonder if gido van rossom has a weird connection and he
wasn't just a weird guy from the Netherlands right just a random weird guy and we have this cover story on
python that was oh for children and da d d da d da I think and we'll see when I get that interview I think that what
we're going to find is that Ido van rosom in the in the 80s was going
through the exact same thing that I'm going through in the last half of this course and saying what's the best way to use C and I think he if you look at the
patterns over and over and over again in Python you see that there are imitations of how C++ did it but I think GTO was
doing C++ one better I think gido looked at C++ and said no you don't quite have
it right I'm going to build this language that's kind of a demonstrator of what C++ should be and I'm going to
advance the actual research of what object or programming is forwards because I don't think C++ does a good
job I'm putting words into his mouth and I hope he doesn't see this before this interview right but I that's that's
right now that's my my hypothesis as to how it worked that he wasn't just making an easy to program language he was also
trying to create a stellar absolute perfect best practice for what object
earning programming meant by creating all these things and what's cool in C programming for everybody is we if if
that's the path he took the last part of this course goes right down that path and you see just how beautiful and
elegant it is and then you see things like how the dictionary has evolved from python 2 to Python 3 to python 36 to
python 37 and on and on and then it turns out that that's just the natural thing you do as you start to build all
these objects in C and so we build a hash which is what python 2os all the
way up to python 3.6 it was a hash not a then we do a a a tree map and we do all these little things and we do multiple
data structures and layering like a link list and a hashmap on top of each other
and then a a link tree and a and and you're just like I think this is exactly
what GTO van rossom was doing and thinking as he was building Python and
if that's then the case right if if Kido van rossom was really trying to finish
the research work that was started in SE with kigan and and C++ bejn spro strip
if Yeo was really like I'm GNA finish this work that you all have started I
think it's a beautiful beautiful concept and back to what I think was your first question is like that tells me that the
right thing to do is to Learn Python and then learn C to get back to Python and
then you have this like complete readiness for object-oriented programming and then you take like a Jango class and I talk about objector
programming Jango class and you're like no I get that I know what that means and that's what senior programmers need to
have that capability so that when they're taking a Java class and I say object blah blah blah they're there or JavaScript object blah blah blah and
they're there so it is quite a journey and you know the because there is no
textbook for what I'm doing because I'm really thinking this is research and a historical curiosity I mean I got to go
where the story I'm I'm more of a documentary filmmaker than I am a a bookwriter right I think of this as like
I run around with my backpack with a bunch of cameras do documentaries all over the place and then make a story
from the documentaries and so um I just hope that people see this course as it is not just another Secour that just
teaches from a random book this is like the history of computing orientation
Technologies we know it because I'm a bit slow Python's written in C is that correct uh yes the main python that we
The history of Python
use is of what you said right exactly s go now there's other pythons that are written in other implemented in other
language but the but when gido started it was in C and by far the most popular python implementation is called cpython
and you can look at the source code and you can see how what's in the current python today that makes dictionaries
work and you can kind of if you know see you can look through that code and that's what you're doing in your course z a little bit I mean what I'm really
doing is I'm writing simpler versions of what it would be so that you know it's like that'd be like in the first couple
of weeks when G was writing python 1.0 back in '87 or whenever it was I'm I'm writing the code that he was writing on
Christmas that year which is I'm going to write a string class and it's crude but at least it proves that I can write
a string class and I can make it really easy to use and you know safe no pointer
problems no security problems on and on and on so yeah so you basically python
in C kind of the same thing is is that is that kind of right right not so much the language but the libraries right the
the objects that you're you're using in in Python that's lovely so I mean I think that's a great explanation so
that's why the full circle is there so you start with python go to C and you're back into python because you then you're basically writing
python not the rest of your career you can write python or JavaScript or Java the rest of your career and not worry
about C but C is make it so that you're not unsure of what it is that you're doing as you're writing an of the
languages you are sure of what's going on this is quite a change from what we spoke about last time we you can just revisit it for people who haven't seen
The path to becoming a master programmer
it our previous videos because you got the master programmer and if you can just explain that concept and then like
you I've got it written here like 10 courses that that we mentioned last time it was python Jango PHP where and then
SQL and then C but you've changed that I have changed that right and so so the the path to the master programmer in the
in short is the idea that I want to create a set of courses that when a student completes those courses I'm
willing to hire them so I've got a whole bunch of courses python Jango PHP as you mentioned SQL and now C and I thought
that c was like the beginning of the more advanced phase of this master programmer but now I kind of think it's
the second class in the path to the master programmer and then you take like a class like Jango and you're like oh
object Orient I get it and you're so all of a sudden everything you're doing in Jango you're doing it from a a much stronger position and so it's not it's
not that I don't like any of those courses that I that I have and they're still in the path to the master
programmer um but the cclass is the second class in the path to the master programmer when my urg my originally I
thought it was going to be the fifth class and the ironic thing is I'm kind of following the path computer science
does a lot of computer science schools teach that's ironic it is ironic they
teach python first and C second although they tend to teach C++ second which I think is a mistake but I I do think that
what I'm doing articulates uh really well with computer science in that you
my python course is not really recognizable as the first computer science python course and my C course is
not really recognizable as the first computer science C course and and so if you're going to go and get a computer
science degree people should take my python course and then they should take my C course and then they should go take
a computer science degree right because the way they're going to teach you C and
C++ and Python and computer science is rigorous they're they're really teaching you like the language you know how to
change spark plugs I'm teaching the feeling of all these things I'm teaching the the kind of the the Gestalt of what
python is from a gall perspective what C is from a good shult perspective and I'm preparing you very very well for a
rigorous treatment of python C and C++ so that you will crush those courses so
a big part of computer science is people walk into these courses and they're not really ready for them and so um I think
that people should take python for everybody and see program for everybody in high school so that when they go get a computer science degree they're
actually successful and they love it from end to end as compared to they're miserable they can't figure it out they don't actually learn anything and two
years later they drop out and quit so for me these are pre-computer science classes these are not Replacements and
even even the object Orient stuff I'm doing at the end of C programming for everybody it's not as strict and
rigorous as the typical computer science class that's going to teach trees and Maps they're going to make a lot harder
class but they're not going to care about the feeling of what what it means to be a hashmap and what GA was thinking
when he was building one of these things and so so that's the path to the master programmer I really only have at this
point in my mind two more classes to the path of the master programmer although there could be a third class yeah I mean you know me I change my mind all the
time and once I teach things and I give them to students students tell me I'm wrong and I change so the next course I'm going to build is computer hardware
Dr. Chuck's next course // Hardware for Everybody
for everybody I'm not going to computer architecture I'm going to talk a little bit about machine language Assembly
Language I talk a little bit about Gates and I found a book and and um and here's
the book it's called Computer Engineering for babies okay oh wow so if
you hit this button the light lights up yep see that that's my level yeah so
this is a wire and the light lights up that's a notk if you push it it turns to
zero that's good that is very good this is an exclusive
or if you push them both it's stays off if you push either one it stays on so I
found this book Chase Roberts poor Chase Roberts is going to be featured on your podcast and he's going to sell way more
books than he ever thought he was going to sell I probably warn him that is how I teach Hardware I mean I I sent a note
to this guy I'm like I love your book and I want to write a second one he wrote a second one I didn't like his
second book as well but I want to write a second one about starting with Gates and just it's not that hard started
gates to learn a little bit and then you talk a little machine language so that I think and I think that might not be it's kind
of like a one credit college class kind of like a survey of computer architecture and then I'm going to teach a Java class but by the time I'm
teaching a Java class I'm G to teach you how to program like a professional right it's not just I'll teach the programming language Java and then I'll teach you
how to program like a professional and we'll start looking at really hard problems and and that stuff so I'm not I'm not that far away at this point from
what I think of as the last Master programmer class to the point where I'm starting to produce people that I will hire at that point yeah because last
time you had assembly we you you still thinking of doing that assembly is an architect computer architecture is Hardware plus assembly I've been
thinking more about it and now that the cclass is done I got so much done in that class the hardware and assembly
class is kind of going to collapse into one and then last time you had rust and AWS but like based on the sort of what
you see the I don't see rust as adding much value anymore at this point I just I wish it had I I think there is a place
for a language that that has sort of like the low-level expectations of C but at the same time there's a number of
libraries that make it uh much safer to use and that's the problem strings are not sa I want safe strings I want safe
Free and available Dr. Chuck courses
lists and I want safe dictionaries I mean that's that's really what I want as a c language that has python like
underlying libraries Dr Chuck I just want to emphasize something so to make sure that everyone understands this
you've got this path to master programmer and all the content is freely available is that correct yes it is yes
it is it's also available on corsera but it's also just available on websites that I have up and you just go to you
know online. dru.com and you see all of them and when new ones come out they'll
be there as well so I'm committed to making all my material as free as
possible I I don't think that that that precludes people paying for Content when
you pay for Content there's somebody that kind of certifies that you've done the work it gives you a certificate it's one thing for you to say that you took a
course it's another thing for somebody else to say that you took a course and so things like certification there's value in that but it costs money to
certify you I mean you can't just to say oh yeah I'll self-certify well that doesn't say much so yeah and so the idea
is that I I am really passionate about making software development as a career available to everyone everywhere in the
world um regardless of uh how much money they have and regardless of the kind of resources that they have to bring to
bear and I think our world will be a better place when we do that I love that because I mean that's the thing some
people can afford it and they can get the extras but some people just can't afford anything and this gives them the
opportunity to change their lives and I love what you're doing I love that you're doing that you said in our last interview something along the lines that
$100 is a lot of money for a lot of the world yes absolutely um and I mean I I
teach at the University of Michigan and you would think that everyone who steps foot in the University of Michigan is you know financially super solid and
then we WE Post student student jobs and we get tons of applications and you
think oh well isn't everybody rich and the answer is no it turns out even at a place like Michigan where there's a
lot of wealthy people going to school there there are plenty of students that are not wealthy and they're they're
fighting and they're fighting semester to semester and so if we think about these things as appealing to um you know
those with limited means like and and not think of it as like oh this is a cool boot camp and I'm going to charge
somebody $220,000 for a month worth of stuff and and you're going to sit and learn Ruby on Rails for 12 hours a day I
mean I I find that really reprehensible that that's what people decide is the right thing because there are people
that can afford to pay for that but I also think that those courses aren't all that useful and the long the long-term
benefit of a you know two Monon $20,000 boot camp is nowhere near as good as
carefully taking a bunch of free course materials and really uh understanding what's going on in those courses and
taking your time and then growing your learning while you're going to work working and learning at the same time is way better than going to some boot camp
and then walking out with a fresh load of stuff in your head that you think you're going to make money on but then
you don't get a job and then it all FL it all goes away in another month so I'm glad you mentioned that because you
mentioned earlier that someone could take Python and uh C and then they could go do computer science but let's say I
don't want to go to university I just want to like get a job can I take this master sorry the road map to master
programmer and um am I ready perhaps to get a job at that point absolutely absolutely so and and again you need to
have some breath you need to have some breath so that when you walk into a job chances are good that you're not going
to do exactly what you were taught in college and or in your boot camp and so you if you learn a bunch of different
languages on the way to the master programmer then when you when they say we're using rust we' be like oh yeah
okay I kind of know CN I kind of know python I know PHP and I know Java I'll figure rust out right and so whatever it
is um you know Scala there's all these unfortunately there's all these like languages of the moment that seem to be
exciting and they they they they contribute something but then they don't necessarily uh completely stick so if
Where to get started
I'm starting out first language to start with python and then second language c
yeah I wanted I just want to like hmer home on the on the point what's what I'm going to learn in C that I'm not
learning in Python is it just a better understanding how programming works is it object oriented object orientated
programming what am I getting that's the difference between those two and why why don't I just stick with python perhaps
well if you if you take a python class uh you can be employed and that's what I'll call a junior programmer right and
and there are lots of people that do pretty well as Junior programmers and they go to stack Overflow and chat GPT
and you know paste a few things in and and get the work done that day and they move forward but there Comes This Moment
where you get stuck if all you know is Python and all you've done is kind of basic python stuff you get stuck where
you got to go find somebody senior right someone who's got done a lot more and the question becomes especially if for
companies how do we get people from this sort of junior level to senior level and
we can we we're pretty good at making junior level programmers these days with things like corsera Etc but then how do
you make senior folks and that is where the cclass comes in so one of the things I'm I'm I'm trying to convince companies
who have found the python class really uh useful is that the cclass is even more useful because it's going to take
your current employees and it's going to up their game and it's going to give them the necessary tools to to kind of
grow from Junior to senior and go from just you know you got a bunch of Junior programmers and they're doing a bunch of stuff but then you got all these senior
people that kind of have to help them when they get stuck well how do you make more people to help everybody when they get stuck and that's where the C-Class
comes in is it's the ones where you're not afraid and I guess you know I'm not afraid of what programming is when I'm
done with a cclass and that's the that's one of the things I love about it and that's one of the things I love about having a computer science degree is I'm
just not afraid eventually I'll put enough print statements in it darn it I'll figure it out and I don't care what language it is I don't care any of that
stuff and that's what I'm trying to I'm trying to create a course that can take you to that point where you're not
afraid of the technology that you're using but I shouldn't use C in production because of all the vulnerabilities and issues with C right
When to use C
no and I I sure hope you don't find a job where they tell you that your job is to write a whole bunch of C code because that that's really really difficult and
should be reserved for the you know the most specialized of things and these days if you're going to do something
super specialized you might want to use C++ because the problems that you are going to need to solve in a sort of a
highly I don't know rigorous and scary environment C++ is probably the better tool to see for that I'm glad you said
Which programming language to learn next
that because it was like okay so if I don't you see what do I learn is it rust is it C++ what do what do I learn next
that's a good question um that that's that's a good question I'm looking at the I tend not
to do anything I tend not to like teaching proprietary Technologies I tend to like teaching open source
Technologies and if you look at the business world uh business World uses
either open- Source Stacks which are like Python and Java or they use
proprietary Stacks which are like Windows C and Visual Basic so you'll
notice that I don't teach anything in the windows C Visual Basic World C++ is a weird thing right I'm not sure that a
lot of general purpose folks use C++ for building web servers I know that
Microsoft people use C for building web servers but I don't think open people I think
they tend to either build them in PHP python or Java and so what I've done is
I've covered what I consider the essential languages on the open side of
the house I'm not pretending that I am a Microsoft certifi certified software developer right because those languages
are completely different there's there's equivalences because C is more like Java than it is like C++ even though it uses
syntax that's C++ like um and so I you know I'm not I'm not trying to sort of
get into the business side but if you but a lot of places don't like using Microsoft Windows because of the
continuous licensing uh problems that you have and whereas if you're starting a really big company the last thing you
want to do is uh base it on a proprietary you know pay per click kind
of a thing and so you're going to use python or Java or PHP or something like that JavaScript as well I also think
it's that whole thing that Linux is you know I'd rather have learn Linux than than Windows yeah too and I'd rather te
yeah the lamp yeah I'd rather teach Linux than teach Windows it just lasts longer and you know the the knowledge
that you gain on Linux I think lasts longer than the knowledge you gain on Windows and I just think it's so portable um if you understand Linux I
think I I just remember now you said in a in a previous interview you shouldn't because a lot of people make this
Learn different programming languages
mistake they think they must just learn one language and I think you said something along the lines five or six languages is what you should learn right
yes absolutely absolutely and it's at some point you uh you need to learn a number of different languages because
you have to relax when the syntax changes you can't have gotten so much that you're sort of like a savant on the
syntax and if you see different syntax that it's somehow it it throws you for a loop the answer the concepts in any
programming language are the same and until you've learned a bunch of programming languages you're not you're not operating in Concepts you're
operating in syntax and that's that's a key and it's not easy to do you can't just say hey this week we're we're going
to stop talking about syntax we're going to talk about Concepts blah blah blah blah blah two hours later and so you somehow know Concepts the answer is no
you don't Concepts come to you just with repeated work and I love that because I mean I think and I I mean people in the
can put all kinds of comments in you know feel free to put comments below but I I have this got feeling that if I know
Linux it's easy to pick up Windows if I know C it'll be easy to pick up other languages um the and if well multiple
languages it's easy to learn others so I love what you've done that it's open source rather than proprietary right Dr
How AI/ChatGPT changes coding
Chuck elephant in the room a lot of young people have asked me this it's pointless learning to code it's
pointless doing anything intact networking coding cyber security whatever AI is going to eat all of our
jobs what's your opinion about Ai and then perhaps later you can talk about chat gbt and how that's changing uh
coding perhaps or what what's your opinion so perhaps you can talk about Ai and then come back to like is chat GPT
like making us dumb something along those lines so I I'll just start by saying that chat GPT T is not going to
take all of our jobs I mean if chat GPT was going to take all of our jobs the previous 85 or 90 different
technological breakthroughs and C GPT is definitely a breakthrough but the previous breakthroughs are we're going
to take our jobs and they didn't right I mean I whenever we are talking to anything mechanical whether it's chat
GPT we get really upset really fast because they can't even take the simplest things right but so that it
just taking our jobs is just such a foolish kind of dog whistle kind of way to think about it but chat PT is amazing
chat PT is the you know the closest thing we've seen up till now to True
artificial intelligence and there are some things that it does really well couple of quick stories right so last
semester which was September 2023 I called the first semester of chat GPT
and we had sort of seen it in the spring and the you know the April May time frame and we spent all summer like
worrying about what was going to happen when September rolls around and and we got to F face students with chat GPT and
my colleagues to a person we not going to prohibit it and not going to fight it
I mean it's dumb that's like fighting search or that's like you know fighting text messages I mean it's just like stop
find out a way to use it so I will say that when I prepared for my fall 2023
September 2023 course I put a lot of thought in to how to deal with a chat
GPT Menace right meaning that a lot of I looked at my assessments I looked at how I taught and I'm like I gotta change I I
gotta change all this stuff right the biggest thing I did to fight chat GPT is this it's paper I can't see
clearly you left to explain sorry go on it's a piece of paper so the biggest thing that I did to fight chat GPT last
semester was to use paper exams and I'm like ha oh that's interesting yeah yeah
yeah I will give you a multiple choice question ABCD and you're walking in with a pen and a paper and two pages of notes
and I don't care how you learned it but you're not going to take your ex my exam with chat DPT next to you you can do all
my homework with chat GPT next to you all you want but you got to take my exam and it turned out it was great students
love the exam I love the exam it felt really good I felt like I had built the best assessment that I had in the past
10 years of teaching and then this semeer comes along and I look back on it and I realized that the paper exam was a
good idea cat GPT had nothing to do with it ultimately right cat GPT was just a
thing my reaction was to do a paper exam and so what it turned out was it was a
way for me to get the students attention and give them responsibility for learning so that they couldn't use chat
GPT when they take the exam and so I like okay if that was good I'm going to switch and so this semester I'm using three exams and literally I've stopped
thinking about chat GPT in my teaching completely right I mean I'll use it someday maybe some company will make a
cool chat GPT that looks at all the videos I do and students can ask questions about something and I've seen
prototypes of this already where you say how does time and a half for overtime to get calculated and it finds the exact
place in all my lectures that I talk about that students will love that right because instead of having to watch all the lectures and remember what go went
where they can ask a question about the lecture and be taken right to it does that make it so they don't have to learn
anything no it actually makes it so it's easier to learn stuff because they're not looking at junk they don't want to
look at so it's going to help it's it's going to help and um and so chat GPT
made me think as a teacher what I'm doing right what I'm doing wrong how I could be better and it was all when it
was all said and done the things I did to kind of deal with Chad GPT made me a better teacher and had almost when so
said and done I should I just should have looked at myself and said how can I teach better how can I help my students learn better and and CHP just happened
to be like the the scary the scary thing that got me thinking about that so that's that's one one chat GPT example
so another chat GPT example had to do with I had a bug and the Sakai project
which is a million lines of java and it has to do with double URL en coding and
so was passing stuff and back and forth between servers and they got double URL encoded and um that's little percent
signs on URLs and um turns out that some firewalls are starting to break wurl
encoding they're starting lot not past wur coding so so I need to come up with a different way of passing this data
back and forth and I wanted to use a technology called Bas 64 which turns it
all into like hex numbers and digits and upper and lowercase letters but Bas 64 has like an equal sign and a couple of
other weird characters that require WL coding anyways so I thought well how
about this thing called Bas 62 which is exactly the same thing that base 64 except it doesn't have those characters
that I didn't want in base 64 and and so I propped up chat GP PT cuz I couldn't find a b62 library b62 is a thing that's
talked about but there was no b62 Library so I popped up chat GPT and I said could you write me a Java based B
62 library and it goes sure so I look at it like yeah that's pretty cool that
looks good I look at this and I look at that I look at some of the code I'm like okay that looks pretty good I'm like could you write some Java DOC for that
and it goes sure and so it writes the Java doc then I say could you write a unit test for that and it writes a unit test for it and like that's a cool unit
test it even seem like it has a sense of humor like I do when I write unit tests and so I I took this stuff and I took
this stuff and I threw it into a patch in Sakai as a fix for this bug and it
did fix the bug right because I wasn't doing URL coding I was doing this B 62 and coding so I went through code review
and the people reviewing it they weren't entirely excited about my Approach they think I should use B 64 because B 62 is
not common and they look for a bunch of libraries but I I've kind of fought them on that I'm like I want to do this but
secretly what I wanted to do is I wanted to take code that was written by chat GPT and put it in this production
software I'm like because I wanted to say like I want cat gbt to be a partial author of my software so I didn't want
to look too close at it I just wanted because I test it out just fine right that's the worry that's the worry yeah
so so I kind of they had argued with me and I kind of beat him down and that ARG
the code review people I beat them down in the argument so I over their gentle
suggest questions I put it in and we hand it over to quality assurance and 24 hours later it breaks and the quality
assurance person ran something and it blew up and I looked at the trace back and I could see exactly the line and I
looked at the line of code I'm like oh I see why that broke exactly why I broke and so long story short luckily I'd been
the corview people had argued with me long enough about this thing that I kind of knew exactly what I was going to do if it didn't work out so like in less
than an hour I had a better solution that used B 64 with like a hack on top of it and it's like but we've done all
this research cuz they' argued with me about why I was using this thing and I thought through all the Alternatives but I didn't want to do the Alternatives so
it turned out when it's all said and done but chat GPT had taken a base 64 algorithm and changed 2third of it to be
like base 62 but it's really hard to change the other third it turns out having to do with the fact that it's not
a power of two they just wrote a bad Bas 62 Al Chachi V roal algorithm and I look
at it I'm like oh that's exactly what Junior programmer would have done if you
put a lot of pressure on them and said you only have one hour and I'm GNA based
on when you write this code if you're not done with this code in an hour I'm going not going to hire you and so chat
GPT feels a tremendous pressure when asked to write a Bas 62 encoding algorithm and so it reacted just like a
junior developer and it was very confident it was right it was so confident that it was right and I was so
happy that it passed the unit test which it did it turns out the year was probabilistic and you had to have all kinds of weird patterns to happen
eventually the QA people did that and so that says wow it's a junior programmer
it's prone to mistakes and it has no sense that it's wrong zero zero Z zero
sense that it's wrong so I'm GNA I'm going to start a series of podcasts where I use chat GPT and kind of because
it I've done a couple of other things where I've I've used it and I've learned it I I really enjoy it so the the other
ChatGPT vs college essays
thing that you know at my age my friends had kids and they're going to college and the question becomes do you write
your college essays using chat GPT and a friend of mine who also teaches at the University of Michigan has a son who's
applying for college and he was really afraid that his son would use chat GPT or perhaps lose to someone who had
written their essay in chat GPT so his strategy which was really I thought brilliant he's like do something that
chat GPT would never conceive of doing and then write about that thing that you
did and write passionately about the thing that you did so they bought an old car like a 1976 chel and they started
working on the car together and his college essay was what he learned doing work on 1976 chel getting dirty and so
think about it chat GPT can't work on a 1976 chel so it can't talk about its
experience doing that so there are ways to write an essay that could never be written by AR arcial intelligence
because artificial intelligence can't experience life they can talk about like you know the cause of the Civil War
perhaps um but uh so I went from a year ago being scared of of chat GP to like
it's just a it's just another thing and I want to learn how to use it and teach my students how to use it and companies
will come up with cool uses for it and I will like that um but it's it's not going to stop anybody's need uh for
becoming a programmer and frankly I think it increases the need to be a senior programmer because I think chat
gbt has the same conceptual understanding of software development as Junior programmers and will'll make the
exact same mistakes Junior programmers and the way I found the mistakes of the code that I wrote I let cat GPT write
for me was when myself and two other senior programmers were going over it looking at where the flaws might be and
Cat GPT just couldn't do that right and so I'm not worried I love chat GPT it's fine I just Snicker time people you know
overestimate its capabilities so just to counter to that once that essay is online though the next version of AI
will have that story and could grab that right uh absolutely absolutely without a doubt I mean I think the key thing
though is as long as it's a personal Journey it's difficult for you to say um pretend that I just bought a 1975 chevel
and pretend that I worked on it and write a story about how I learned
leadership and uh problem solv solving while I did that I mean it it hard to
ask the question even though you gave it that essay right um and and and so I I
think it's difficult for chat GPT to have a truly personal thing that comes out I think it can describe things but
it can't really share feelings and so where do you see it going because CH gbt is like V1 of a lot of what people have
The future of AI // Is programming still worth it?
seen But AI it the talk about exponential increase in intelligence and
stuff do you think if I was a young person and I'm just framing this always the questions that I get on YouTube is
it worth me still getting into programming because I'm I fear that you know chat GPD perhaps can't do
everything but what about five years from today I think that that question comes from people who are not yet
programmers imagining going to a beginning programmer position and thinking that a lot of the things that you do as a beginning programmer have
become easier with chat GPT so they maybe won't need as many people the problem is is that your goal when
learning to program is not just to become a beginning programmer but to be a senior programmer and that's where the creativity just comes in right when
you're creatively solving a problem I just don't think the cat GPT can help you I think chat GP can can help you
write a a a a s a digital signature library or it can write help help you uh
you know parse Json or whatever and so those are things that we tend to do as J Junior programmers but the concept of
like whoa that's a really interesting problem chat jpt has no chance with those really interesting problems so
that for me is why it is that uh programmers should not just assume that they're going to go and become a junior
programmer and that's the end of their career and I and I also think that companies are going to want to take and
invest and get their their employees doing higher level thinking which I think is just going to make the world a
better place right you know if we just kind of have like a whole bunch of Junior programmers like a typing pool in a big big room with banging on keyboards
continuously you know we're going to be better than that you know we're going to just like typewriters to word processors
and so you're going to move up a level you're going to have to become uh creative and understand how how computers really work I think that it's
going to be fine but I you know this is where talking about C programming for everybody I think people who are currently working are going to need some
kind of education that leads them out of the kind of the mechanical into the creative in terms of software
development I love that I mean it's a great answer because I've seen so many examples of the AI chat gbt just being
the poster child creating code that's vulnerable so it looks fine and it works
but it's not best practice it's vulnerable it's got issues like your example is great um only a senior
programmer would pick up those issues I see it in networking on the networking side trying to get it to configure like
um bgp or OPF or some kind of writing protocol it kind of does it but if you actually know what you're doing you spot
all the mistakes yeah I mean that I mean it'll be it'll be helpful and and you know but but at the same time there are
things that are just going to do really well and that is I mean I I can't wait until there is a company or an open
source project that can scan a corpus of an online course and give you a a really
rich index of that course because one of the one of the problems that I have in scaling courses is that there is a there
is a conflict between personalization and scale and and people get stuck on
the weirdest things and then they drop out in in in large large scale classes and if I can come up with ways and I I
really believe that they're just like got stuck on one thing and then they got mad and then they left and then they
gave up on their education that's at least online like that like on corsera or just online or free code camp or
wherever you're going it's just too easy to quit but if I get something that can catch him at that moment and just give them a little bit of love a little bit
of a little bit of encouragement and I don't think that requires like super genius software that just requires
software that understands the material that I'm teaching from and can lead students to the right answers to the questions that they have Dr Chuck it
Visiting students around the world
sounds like you've been stuck like creating this course do you actually manage to travel at all so one of the
things that I've been holding off with C programming for everybody is doing the thing that I love to do and that is go visit my students all over the world and
I've you know been there 7 times and I think uh since Co I've only gone like three times I just they luckily ended up
somewhere so I'm picking up my uh my travel and going to visit students more
and more and I see that you go to conferences and come up to you and talk and and I'm a little jealous of that
that's really that's really cool that you get to do that um and so I'm kind of kicking this off with a week and a half
long trip to India uh with corsera where we're going to go and visit um we're
going to visit a number of universities that have adopted my python course and I'm going to try to convince them to
also adopt the C course and then we're going to go to a number of businesses that have adopted the python course and
I'm going to try to convince them to do the C course for all the reasons that we've talked about right so in in University this is a great second course
at at and but for businesses I think it's even more important because you might have someone who took a cclass 20
years ago but they didn't know why they took a cclass they didn't know what the value of that C-Class was my C-Class
will give them the story the back story and it will it'll teach them what they should have learned from that cclass
that they probably didn't back in the day when they were just taught a straight up cclass and so the other
thing I'm hoping to do when I get to India is uh is meet some of the employees that I've got uh from the
master programmer right I mean I've had a couple I don't have enough scale to do all of them but I'm going to meet some
of the the the students that I that's have taken all my courses that I've hired I I know I get a lot of requests
but I don't have right now I can't hire everybody who wants to come work for me but I'm going to meet some of my people
for for the first time and I'm going to go visit uh I I think I told you that we have a a number of blind schools in
India that use my python course to try to teach blind students how to program I
think that you know visually impaired and programming actually really work well I you know you you some there's so
many internal thoughts and Concepts and and constructs that we do as programmers and I don't think you need to see seeing
is not as critical and uh so the other the other thing that that we we we've done is um uh I've hired uh some blind
folks to do accessibility testing on uh on the sky project and I'm going to meet some of those as well so I I kind of put
myself in a sort of in a cabin and finish this course and now that I'm done with this course I'm going to get back
out in the real world and start meeting people again Dr Chuck I really want to thank you you know for giving so much to the world
Conclusion
I mean I think you said there's 3 million students on your python course right y so 3 million lives potentially
impacted in a in a major way just that through that one course I really want to thank you you know not trying to like
create some boot camp and become like a millionaire overnight by charging $20,000 or whatever stupid money people
charge but by giving to the world and um you know I come from South Africa originally and I've seen poverty I know
that people they're very very clever people amazing people out there that if they just get the opportunity can change
their lives change their family lives um and I really want to thank you you know for giving back to the world thanks for
bringing that up I it it reminds me of a YouTube comment that I just got in the last couple of weeks where uh I I had
posted a video and someone said Dr Chuck thank you for all of the great classes uh I took one of your classes a long
time ago and now I'm a teacher and I'm teaching programming myself and I'm like
oh that's really cool and then like a couple days later another person says and by the way way I'm a student in that
person's class and I'm going to become a teacher too and so so I love it it just
it's just so joyful to uh see the positive you just put something out there in the world and you hope that it
does good and uh it is a joyful thing when it does Dr Chuck thanks so much really appreciate you spending so much
time with me and sharing with the community as always big kudos to you for you know giving to the world and you
know making the stuff available because people can change their lives through this so thanks so much thank you for doing what you do as as
well

Intro
well I couldn't be more excited because
AI news is really really ramping up
January quite honestly fairly slow month
for the world of AI this week we've got
announcements from Google from Microsoft
from Apple from YouTube from mid journey
and so much more a lot is happening
right now and if we thought last year
was a wild ride for AI well it feels
like this year is going to be no
different so let's break it down
Google Gemini
starting with the fact that we just got
Gemini Ultra Google is completely moving
away from the barred brand and going all
in on Gemini with all of their AI
products in fact if you go to b.google.r
you to gemini.com now and on the new
Gemini we have two options you can see
we've got Gemini and now we have a
Gemini Advanced most likely you'll see a
button to upgrade but I've actually
already upgraded the Gemini Advanced
because well I published a video
yesterday all about Gemini Advanced and
Gemini Ultra so I don't need to go too
deep into the Google news on this one
because we did a pretty deep dive here
in yesterday's video if we take a look
here at the updates page on Gemini you
can see Bard is now Gemini and the new
Gemini Advanced which costs 20 bucks a
month to use uses the Gemini Ultra 1.0
model which supposedly is the model they
showed off a few months ago when they
made a big deal about Gemini Ultra and
then we found out kind of the next day
that most of that video was sort of
faked but according to the press release
here it's far more capable at highly
complex tasks like coding logical
reasoning following nuanced instructions
and creative collaboration it's
available in 150 different countries it
currently has an Android app with an IOS
app in the works however if you watch
the video that I made about Gemini
already Gemini Ultra SL Gemini Advanced
hasn't really lived up to the hype yet
it's really fast it's pretty good at
creativity on par with gp4 but then with
problem solving and coding and
explaining what's in an image and even
generating images were all pretty
overwhelming for this being the model
that Google claimed was going to be way
better than gp4 but if you want to check
it out I highly recommend going to
gemini.com clicking to upgrade to Gemini
Advanced and you actually get two months
free it's 20 bucks a month but that's
after the two-month trial period so so
if you want to give it a go go try it
for 2 months free mark your calendar if
it's not doing it for you just make sure
you cancel it before the 2 months is up
and you'll never spend a dime on Gemini
but definitely check it out compare it
to chat GPT yourself so far personally I
still think cat GPT is a little bit
better but I do fully expect Gemini to
improve at a very rapid Pace at this
Microsoft Copilot Improvements
point and the timing of this Gemini
launch is pretty interesting because it
comes right on the heels of Microsoft
making some big changes and updates to
co-pilot and it also comes several days
before the Super Bowl where Microsoft is
planning to release a co-pilot ad
showing to the world what it's capable
of I do have a video next week coming
all about co-pilot where we're going to
dive in and talk about a lot of the new
features that co-pilot has rolled out
however one of the most impressive
features that I've noticed recently is
with their image generation tool if we
go to copilot microsoft.com you can see
we have a redesigned homepage here it
looks slightly different slightly
cleaner but still gives you some prompts
that you can test out to see what it's
capable of but if we tell it to design
an image there's some new image features
they've rolled in I'll give it a prompt
like create an image of a humanoid robot
on a cliff watching the sunset while
we're waiting we actually get this
really cool animation and once it
finally generates our image check this
out if I click into any single image
here like this one and then I move my
mouse around over the image you can see
it's automatically segmenting the image
and I can select any piece of the image
if I keep clicking I can select more of
the image so I can select this full
robot here and then it gives me two
options and I'm sure there's going to be
more options coming really soon like the
ability to remove objects all together
and possibly even imp paint what we're
selecting but right now we get colorpop
and blur background I click blur
background you'll notice it made the
background slightly more blurry while
the robot is still in Focus let's go
ahead and undo it you can see it gets a
little more clear I'm going to go ahead
and select our robot again and this time
let's try colourpop and you can see what
it did it made the whole rest of the
image black and white while leaving just
color on the robot let's go ahead and un
do that and this time let's just select
the ocean and the sky and do a color pop
on that and now we've got a black and
white robot and the hills are black and
white but the sky and ocean are colorful
another really cool feature about the
new image generator right inside of
co-pilot is these reyz options I can
select low poly here and it will
essentially generate the same image but
in a low poly style here's what it looks
like if I use watercolor here's what I
get when I do pixel art and here's what
it looks like in claymation the dolly3
art generator directly inside of
co-pilot as well as inside of Microsoft
designer has gotten a huge upgrade and
I'm really impressed with what this can
do I mean it's blowing away what imagin
instead of Google is capable of right
now for today's video I partnered with
YouTube Growth With AI
two buddy from Ben Labs a company that
I've been using their tool for a long
time long before they ever sponsored me
and now they've even got some really
amazing AI features built into the
platform so check this out if I log into
my YouTube account and go to edit one of
my videos here you'll notice a new
little TW buddy icon on the right side
of my dashboard by clicking here there
are so many cool things I could do with
my videos one of the really smart new AI
features is this suggested shorts
feature I simply click this it will then
analyze my video and then tell me
exactly which chunk of the video would
make a really good short so this
suggests 2641 through
2656 not only does it suggest shorts for
this video that I'm on right now it also
gave me some suggestions from other
videos on my channel that would be good
candidates to create shorts from as well
my other favorite AI feature is the
title generator you'll notice a new
button showed up right below where I
enter my title and if I click on it tell
it a little bit about what my video is
about and click generate ideas it will
use AI to give me a handful of
additional potential title ideas you
probably won't be shocked to learn that
most of the titles that I use on this
YouTube channel AI helped me generate
it's only fitting right and Tu budy
gives us the tool built in right into
our YouTube dashboard so I don't need to
go to any other third-party apps outside
of YouTube I can get exactly what I need
inside the platform again I've used
tubebuddy for years for my own YouTube
channel it's one of the ways that I've
really managed to grow this channel so
of course I couldn't have been more
excited when Tu budy offered to partner
with me and sponsor some of my my videos
so thank you so much again to tubebuddy
if you're using YouTube and you don't
already have a tubebuddy account I'll
make sure the link is in the description
but it's really going to help you make
life a lot easier when trying to grow
and scale your online presence with
YouTube since we're on the topic of AI
MidJourney is out of Discord!
art already let's talk about mid Journey
cuz mid Journey has some major updates
they just announced including the
announcement that if you've generated
more than a th000 images on Mid Journey
you can now actually use the mid Journey
website to to generate your art you can
finally get out of the Discord to
generate images assuming you've
generated over a th000 images with mid
Journey you can simply go to alpha. Mid
journey.com and it will bring you to
this page where you can generate your
images you can see up here we've got a
little box that says imagine and just
like in Discord we typed whatever we
want our prompt to be here but instead
of adding a whole bunch of extra strings
and commands to the end of our image I
can click these little settings here on
the right side of the search box and we
we can change to Portrait Square
landscape and pretty much all of the
various aspect ratios that are the most
common we can adjust the stylization the
weirdness the variety we can set it to
standard mode or raw mode we can
generate in any one of the old models or
the nii models and you can set your
speed to relax fast or Turbo since I've
already used this prompt already let's
go ahead and use it again a humanoid
robot sitting on a cliff watching the
sunset let's set it as a 16 N9 aspect
ratio I'm going to crank up the
stylization a bit crank up the weirdness
a bit leave it on standard version 6 and
fast and if I just hit enter and if I'm
on this create tab over here on the left
I can actually see the percentage done
that it is it hasn't started yet and
after a few seconds we get some images
that look like this now hovering over
the images we have the option to very
subtle or very strong over on the right
we have options to rerun edit hide and
under more we've got copy report
download or open in Discord if I click
on edit you can see it puts the original
prompt back up here so that I can just
create a new prompt if I need to if I
click on an individual image like this
one it gives me a whole new set of
options over here on the right we've got
very subtle very strong upscale subtle
upscale creative remix subtle remix
strong pan up down left right the
various zooms change aspect ratio we can
rerun vary region or reuse the image or
the prompt if I vary region it takes me
to a page where I can just select a
certain area select this area and put
add a baseball cap it'll submit the job
by click on create I can watch as it
gets completed here and we have some
images where it attempted to add a
baseball cap so pretty much everything
you can do in the Discord it seems like
you can do directly on the website now
however there is one feature that
recently got rolled out that I don't
know how to do on the website yet I only
know how to do it in the Discord and
MidJourney Style Reference Feature
it's a feature called style reference
this helps you get a consistent style
across every image that you generate
let's say I really like this pixel art
image here I could take this image drop
it into Discord and go ahead and just
save it in my Discord now that I have
the image uploaded I can pick a prompt
and prompt it in the same style so let's
go ahead and type imagine a humanoid
robot sitting on a cliff watching the
sunset but then I add this additional
code at the end-- sref that's short for
style reference and then right after the
style reference I'm going to put a space
and then I'm going to copy the link to
this image so I'm going to right click
copy link right next to our srf here I'm
going to paste our URL here and it
should use the above image as a style
reference for our new prompt and just
like that we got some images of a robot
on a cliff staring at the sunset pixel
art same color palette and everything a
really cool feature if you want to make
sure you get the exact same style to
every image that you create now there
are some other options and ability to
blend multiple images together and set
weights and all sorts of stuff like that
so something to play around with and
make some really cool images in mid
Apple's AI Image Tool
Journey Apple's also getting in the AI
image generation game they're working on
a new model called mg e or mllm guided
image editing here's the actual paper on
archive.org where they show really what
it's capable of with the types of text
prompts you would give it so here's a
picture of a pepperoni pizza they gave
it a prompt of make it more healthy it
then spits out a new pizza with extra
vegetables on it here's an image where
there's somebody in the background here
they gave the prompt remove the woman in
the background and then the woman is
removed it looks like the couch she's
sitting on is removed as well here's
another image where they said add
contrast to simulate more light and it
brightened up the image let the laptop
have a green web page and it changed
this image to this image there are a
whole bunch of other examples inside of
this paper that really show you what
it's capable of but this is new research
coming out of apple that we don't
necessarily have access to but will
probably be in Apple devices fairly soon
AI Image Labeling
and since we're on the topic of AI art
generation both meta and open AI have
talked about labeling the images that
are created with their various AI art
generators we can see here that on this
meta article in the coming months we
will label images that users post to
Facebook Instagram and threads when we
can detect industry standard indicators
that they are AI generated they've
labeled photo realistic images created
using meta AI since it launched so that
people know that they are imagined with
AI and then Dolly 3 is adding the
c2p which is an open technical standard
that allows Publishers companies and
others to embed specific metadata into
the media to verify the origin and to
tell people that it was generated with
AI camera manufacturers are also
adopting this standard as well as news
organizations and others so that as more
images get thrown into the wild be it
through cameras AI generation or
whatever else this
c2p standard will help people understand
what's real and what's not theoretically
so if you're generating any images with
Dolly 3 anytime soon well it's going to
get this metadata if I'm honest I think
there's probably going to be some easy
workarounds for people to strip the
metadata so I don't know how helpful
it's going to be but it's a start and
hopefully it's going to minimize some
scams and fake images from spreading
around to some degree also in the past
YouTube's 2024 Vision
week Neil Mohan the CEO of YouTube
released a letter on the YouTube blog
here about their 2024 priorities can you
guess what priority number one was AI
will Empower human creativity on their
list of 2024 priorities AI seems to be
the number one priority for them they've
released a handful of various AI
experiments into the YouTube platform
things like dream screen and the music
AI incubator and the ability to
summarize comments with AI but from the
sounds of it this is just the beginning
of YouTube's AI Journey they have a lot
more in store in the world of AI for
YouTube so as a YouTuber I'm excited to
see what the bring into the table this
week stability AI also released a new
Stable Video Diffusion 1.1
video model stable video diffusion 1.1
it seems to be a fairly slight
improvement over the original stable
video diffusion but if I'm honest all of
these AI video generators at the moment
are still kind of looking the same to me
now I've gotten some sneak peeks at some
stuff in the works and I truly think
models like these stable video diffusion
models are going to look fairly archaic
in 4 to 6 months from now things are
moving at a super rapid Pace the stable
video diffusion model is available on
hugging face we can see some examples of
videos generated everything has that
kind of slowmo feel to it still and if
you want you can download the files on
hugging face you just got to give them
some details about yourself before it'll
let you but then you should be able to
run this locally on your computer if
you've got a GPU powerful enough me
personally I'm still going to places
like Runway and Pika to get images
generated because I feel like they're
all kind of the same at this point they
all feel like they make very similar
Style videos this is interesting hugging
Hugging Face Gets "Assistants"
face this week launched an open-source
AI assistant similar to chat gpts custom
gpts so hugging face has their own sort
of open- source version of chat GPT
right now it's using rol 8X 7B but
there's various other models available
that you can swap to whenever you want
well they've just added this little
assistance option down in the bottom
left and very very very similar to
custom gpts we've got some nice add-ons
that we can use directly inside of
hugging chat things like an Italian
grandma or a prisoner interrogation game
or a bot that will mercilessly insult
you so if you like chat GPT and the
concept of custom gpts well maybe try
hugging chat with an open source model
along with one of these AI assistants
which are also free to use in open
source and since I've said open source a
Smaug-72B
lot in the last couple minutes let's
talk about smog 72b this is a brand new
open source model it's actually a find
tune version of the Quinn 72b model but
inside these various benchmarking tests
you can see that it actually performed
better in almost every single area over
mistal medium mistal small Gemini Pro
and GPT 3.5 so these open-source models
like this smog 72b the mix of experts
model and the recently leaked mistal
medium that was floating around these
things are getting really powerful these
open source models are getting better
and better and better some of them even
catching up to GPT 3.5 turbo Gemini Pro
and in the case of the recently leaked
version of mistal medium that one was
showing signs of being close to GPT four
open source is really cranking along
right now this is a really interesting
Ancient Scrolls Translated With AI
story that also came out this week this
was posted on Nat fredman's Twitter
account here he said 10 months ago we
launched the vivus challenge to solve
the ancient problems of herculanum papai
papai papai papy to solve the ancient
problem of herculanum papery I know I
butchered that a library of Scrolls that
were flash Fried by the eruption of
Mount Vesuvius in 79 ad today we are
Overjoyed to announce that our crazy
project has succeeded after 2,000 years
we can finally read the Scrolls
something that had been unreadable for
2,000 years is now readable and you
might be asking well what does this have
to do with AI well in this article on
business week from Ashley Vance called
can AI unlock the secrets of the ancient
world Ashley talked about Nat Freeman so
Nat had a hunch that AI algorithms might
be able to find patterns in the scroll
images that humans had missed over the
past few years they begun experimenting
with AI the team have scanned the
scrolls with more powerful Imaging
machines examined portions of the
Papyrus where ink was visible and
trained algorithms on what those
patterns looked like the Hope was that
AI would start picking up on details
that the human eye missed and could
apply what it learned to more up
fiscated Scroll chunks this approach
proved fruitful though it remained a
battle of inches they uncovered bits and
pieces of the Scrolls but they were
mostly unreadable they put together a
challenge and got a lot of other people
involved and eventually it paid off and
the AI systems had brought the past to
life now I'll link up this article below
because it's really well written and
it's a really good story of how AI was
able to translate these ancient texts
that were 2,000 years old but not all
the AI news this week is good news there
25m AI Heist
was a massive Heist using AI where a
scammer got away with $25 million now
the way this scam worked was somebody
got on a zoom call and there was a bunch
of various deep faked members of the
team including a deep fake version of
the Chief Financial Officer and multiple
employees of a company it says the
scammers were able to convincingly
replicate the appearance and voices of
targeted individuals using publicly
available video and audio footage now
there's not a lot of details they
haven't announced what company got
scammed and they haven't exactly broken
down what the scamers said to convince
the company to pass along $25 million
but whatever happened it worked and
these deep fakes and voice clones were
able to convincingly trick a company out
of $25 million and along the same vein
AI Fake IDs
AI has been generating some pretty
convincing driver's licenses lately now
if you spent any time messing with
crypto if you want to sign up for an
account like a coinbase account you have
to do what's called KY seeing or know
your customer and during this process
you have to verify that you're a real
person that you're only creating One
account they want to see a picture of
your driver's license along with a cell
to sort of verify that it's you and as
it turns out you can now fake these kyc
documents and convince some of these
sites that the ID that you're showing
them is 100% legit meaning that the way
a lot of sites verify You by using an ID
and a picture of you is no longer going
to be an effective method of
verification we're going to have to find
some new ways to do this ironically
don't shoot me for saying this but I do
believe blockchain is probably the
answer there's probably some sort of
blockchain tech that will be a much
better way to verify who you are and
that it really is you interacting with a
website online in fact I think that's
kind of what Sam alman's World coin was
trying to accomplish whether that's the
answer or not I don't know but photos of
driver's licenses are no longer going to
be something to verify that you are
really who you say you are they're too
easy to fake now but in good news
AI Robocalls Are Now Illegal
something that's going to minimize some
of these scams is that the FC see
officially banned rooc calls with AI
generated voices last week we talked
about it that it was something they'd
been talking about doing while this week
they made it official it is now 100%
illegal to make Robo calls with AI
generated voices I don't know how harsh
the penalties are for committing this
crime and I also don't know how many of
the Bad actors that are actually trying
to pull off scams and stuff are going to
follow these laws but it's a step in the
right direction and if you saw my video
AI Psychedelics
from earlier this week you know that I
got an apple vision Pro pretty much for
the sole purpose of making video content
with an apple Vision Pro I personally
don't have a whole ton of use cases for
it other than just playing with it and
showing it off for video content but
here's something that I found really
cool that's combining AI with something
like the Apple Vision Pro this is from
Justin means here he says you can
generate entire worlds with out takes
for Vision Pro immersive animated 360
worlds upscale to 8K runs entirely local
on Apple silicon all you need is a
prompt and outtakes AI will handle the
rest coming soon to Apple Store this
could also be called the Psychedelic
simulator right it kind of gives you the
impression that maybe you're on
psychedelics or something and stuff is
appearing and disappearing in front of
you as you look around but I'm in for it
I want to play with it it looks really
AI / AR Glasses From Brilliant
cool and since we're on the topic of
wearables for your face this company
brilliant Labs is releasing these AI
powered glasses from the looks of this
video it looks like going to have
augmented reality right on the glasses
they're going to be multimodal you can
use them with a prescription it can do
translation to other languages you can
look at the nutrition value of things
you can search the web with them you can
even generate images directly inside of
these glasses and if we take a peek at
their website here check this out
they're fully open source too so the
tech behind this and any code running on
it I'm assuming is available for anybody
to use let's go ahead and click on
pre-order now I was just curious about
the price PR they're coming in at 349
bucks which is actually comparable to
the meta rayb bands so taking a closer
look at them here it looks like the
software that is going to be running on
them are openly available models now it
says visual analysis of the world around
you powered by open AI That's not
technically open source but it'll be
using an open API that most people have
access to it'll be able to translate the
world around you but that's powered by
Whisper searching the web will be
powered by perplexity and you can hack
and modify the frames because it's all
open source so these look pretty
interesting if these do everything they
claim to do these could be the Best
glasses on the market because they
appeared to be able to do what we can do
with our meta Ray bands but also what we
can do with something like the xreal air
glasses xreal air giving us the
augmented reality capabilities The Meta
rayb bands giving us the large language
model translation and sort of vision
image recognition capabilities you can
do all of that in a standalone pair of
glasses these are going to be absolutely
insane and that's what I got for you
Additional Announcements
today lots of AI news this week it seems
to be picking up steam I'm expecting
every week from here on out to have
really cool really big announcements
that I can't wait to talk about if you
haven't already check out futur tools.
this is the website where I create all

videos which I record on Thursdays is
just a little piece of all of the AI
news that's rolling out I have to pick
and choose the most important things to
talk about because there's so much these
days but all the rest I do share on
Future tools under the news page and I
have a free Weekly Newsletter where I'll

live event on March 12th and 13th if
you're in Austin already or you're
planning on coming to South by Southwest
you're going to want to be at this event
we're going to do a whole evening sort
of fireside chat about Ai Ai and
marketing the future of AI all sorts of
really cool AI stuff in person we'll be
hanging out having drinks eating

Note: 
### Summary

The video discusses strategies to improve typing speed, which the speaker found beneficial for completing essays and academic work efficiently. Key techniques include practicing short burst typing speed using 15-second tests, grouping syllables together while typing, practicing with real sentences on websites like TypeRacer, focusing on 100% accuracy, and utilizing keyboard shortcuts to correct mistakes quickly. These methods collectively helped the speaker increase their typing speed significantly, making them more productive in their university studies and beyond.

### Advantages

- **Increased Typing Speed:** Short burst practices and syllable grouping can significantly increase typing speed.
- **Efficiency in Academic Work:** Faster typing speeds can make essay writing and note-taking more efficient.
- **Improved Accuracy:** Focusing on 100% accuracy helps in learning scientific terminology and reduces the time spent on corrections.
- **Better Productivity:** Efficiency in typing can lead to overall better productivity in academic and professional tasks.

### Drawbacks

- **Learning Curve:** Techniques such as grouping syllables and using specific keyboard shortcuts may require time to master.
- **Potential Overemphasis on Speed:** There's a risk of prioritizing speed over content quality or understanding in academic work.

### Tips and Advice

- Practice typing in short, focused bursts to improve real-world typing speed.
- Group syllables together to type words more quickly.
- Use real sentences for practice to better simulate actual typing needs.
- Aim for 100% accuracy to build correct muscle memory and reduce time spent on corrections.
- Utilize keyboard shortcuts to efficiently correct mistakes without losing focus.

### Main Challenges

- Adapting to a new typing method, such as syllable grouping.
- Maintaining high accuracy while increasing speed.
- Learning and remembering keyboard shortcuts for efficiency.

### Importance and Usefulness

Improving typing speed and accuracy is crucial for efficiency in academic writing, professional communication, and daily computer use. These skills are particularly valuable in fields that require extensive writing or note-taking, such as medical school or other academic disciplines.

### Accomplishments

The speaker managed to increase their typing speed from 130 words per minute to over 200 words per minute in a short period. They also became more efficient in typing essays and taking lecture notes, contributing to their academic success.

### Interesting Quotes

- "Train it like a Sprint and focus on the first 15 seconds because in real-world use, that's the interval you'll be typing for most of the time."
- "It's all muscle and memory... and that's when you notice a massive bump in your typing speed."
- "If you keep tapping something wrong and don't slow down, you're just reinforcing the muscle memory to press it wrong in the future."

### Lecture Content

The video serves as a practical lecture on enhancing typing skills for academic and professional efficiency. It covers techniques for increasing typing speed, the importance of accuracy, and the utility of keyboard shortcuts in streamlining the typing process.

Transcription:

the first thing I did to type faster
that helped me get through 5000 word
essays and literally a day or two is
that I improved what I call my short
burst typing speed and that was by only
doing 15 second typing tests 10 times a
day usually using the website monkey
type because in real life when you type
outside of typing tests you aren't
typing for minutes straight on you type
for a few seconds when Electro speaks
and then stops or when you're typing up
in essay and then take a break to think
before carrying on so instead of
training your fingers for a marathon by
trying to improve your typing speed
across a minute long pattern test train
it like a Sprint and focus on the first
15 seconds because in real world use
that's the interview you'll be typing
for most of the time like even though my
one minute typing record is 184 words
per minute that didn't directly help me
much for essays at medical school or
help from a bachelor's or master's
degree dissertations but with 15 second
or 15 word typing tests I saw a much
faster rate of improvement than one
minute tests like I went from 130 words
per minute to over 200 in a pretty short
space of time and that made me more
productive at medical school because I
could do things like keep up with taking
elections without having to pause or
rewind the lecture recording the next
thing helped me go from tapping around
110 words per minute to being able to
consistently type above 150 words per
minute within a few days and this was to
stop typing letter by letter and instead
type by grouping syllables together as a
single motion with your fingers like as
an example when I've typed the word
typing there's two syllables Thai and
ping so the first syllable is pressed
more or less immediately together and
the second syllable ping is pressed
together as well so if I type YouTube U
is done in one motion and Tube as
another and this does take a bit of
getting used to but it's all muscle and
memory so as you start to actively group
syllables together for some words you
will end up doing it automatically for
other words just after a few days and
that's when you notice a massive bump in
your typing speed and okay so these
points kind of made the assumption that
you know how to type without looking at
your keyboard and whether you're good at
touch typing or not or helps the most
with real world use is getting practice
with typing real sentences but websites
like 10 fast fingers or monkey type
don't use real sentences is so what I'd
recommend is using the website type
racer where you type quotes from real
scripts and compete against the real
people at a similar level to you and
with this website I saw how much of a
difference in typing speed there was
like on 10 fast fingers I might have
been consistently 160 words per minute
but on time pressure with real sentences
I started at around 100 words per minute
but when I got used to using
punctuations using shift instead of caps
lock and making sure not to make
mistakes I got much better touch typing
and can type around 130 to 140 words per
minute on type person out too and now
with the essays for medical school I'm
just much more fluid with pressing keys
instead of having to search for things
like apostrophes brackets or a full stop
now the next thing is even more
important than trying to type as fast as
possible and thus to make sure that you
have a hundred percent accuracy when you
type like for me some words I can type
really fast but some other words takes a
lot more time especially with medical
school when there's a lot of scientific
terminology that I need to know and what
I used to do was try to maintain that
higher speed for those words but that
usually end up with me making mistakes
but on most typing websites like temples
fingers or monkey type that's fine
because you can make mistakes and carry
on but if you're writing an essay you
can't just ignore a spending mistake and
carry on so similar to how slow down on
a piece I'm learning to play on the
piano I'll start to intentionally take
more time on Words that were Authority
type because that helps develop the
muscle memory to do it the right way by
reinforcing you to press it the right
way and that eventually brings it up to
speed with the other words and remember
if you keep tapping something wrong and
don't slow down you're just reinforcing
the muscle memory to press it wrong in
the future so slow down and do it right
and the next thing literally saves me
from ever having to rewind a lecture or
mix spelling mistakes never be a problem
for me and thus knowing two of the
biggest keyboard shortcuts ever I never
see anybody use the first is a shortcut
to delete a word at a time with a single
press using the keys option and
backspace and then next is the shortcut
to the entire sentences using command
and backspace and it might sound like
it's not that useful but you know how
annoying it is when you're in a lecture
and you type something wrong and delete
letter by letter and then you fall back
on what the professor says and then you
miss a bunch of stuff so just condense
all these presses to one single press so
that you don't get slowed down by
mistakes and these tips focused a lot on
keeping you from being slowed down by
making you more efficient with how you
type so that you can be more productive
and make things like University work run
much smoother but typing faster is just
one small piece in the puzzle to become
as productive as humanly possible so in
this video here I cried out the world's
most productive person's routine for 30
days and made it even more productive
and you can learn about the biggest
productivity habits I added into this
routine so that you can start doing them
too

Link: [# Why I DONT LIKE Open Source Software w/ Jonathan Blow | Prime Reacts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn59Yn55Pos)
Notes:
### Summary

The video features a discussion on the state and philosophy of open source software, focusing on Jonathan Blow's critical perspective. The main points address the stagnation in open source innovation, the issues with open source creativity, the dynamics of contributions and pull requests, and the broader implications of how open source communities function and the quality of software that is produced.

### Advantages of Open Source Software

- **Innovation and Evolution**: Mention of React and its evolution (class components, higher-order components, functional components, hooks, server components) suggests open source can drive innovation.
- **Community Contributions**: Open source allows for widespread community contributions, potentially leading to diverse input and rapid improvements.

### Drawbacks

- **Perceived Stagnation**: Jonathan Blow critiques open source for being stagnant and lacking creativity, merely copying existing ideas.
- **Quality Control Challenges**: The video discusses the challenge of maintaining quality when everyone can contribute, leading to potential dilution of software quality.
- **Class Structure in Open Source**: Despite the democratic appearance, open source projects often have a class structure where a few maintainers have significant control over contributions.

### Tips and Advice

- **Consideration Before Contributing**: Before making public contributions, double-check work and consult with others to ensure quality and relevance.
- **Supporting Open Source**: Users should consider financially supporting projects they heavily rely on to ensure continued quality and development.

### Main Challenges

- **Balancing Contributions**: Deciding who can contribute and how to manage contributions without stifling innovation or allowing quality to deteriorate.
- **Maintaining Quality**: Ensuring that contributions enhance rather than detract from the project, requiring strong technical judgment.

### Importance and Usefulness of the Topic

- The discussion highlights the critical balance open source projects must maintain between openness to contributions and maintaining high standards of quality.
- It underscores the significance of understanding the underlying dynamics and challenges of open source software development for both contributors and maintainers.

### Accomplishments

- **Innovation in Open Source**: Despite criticisms, examples like React demonstrate that open source projects can and do innovate.
- **Community Engagement**: Open source projects engage a wide community, leading to extensive use and contributions across the globe.

### Interesting Quotes or Insightful Sentences

- "Open source software also almost never does anything creative; all they ever do is copy other things." - A provocative claim that sparks discussion on the nature of innovation in open source.
- "Open source is super Democratic but there's inherently a very strong class structure there." - Highlights the paradox within open source projects between democratic ideals and the reality of hierarchical control.
- "You eliminate that culture of technical judgment about what is good and what is bad then software is over." - Emphasizes the importance of maintaining a high standard for contributions to ensure the advancement and quality of software.

This discussion sheds light on the nuanced and complex nature of open source software, presenting a critical yet insightful examination of its current state, challenges, and the ongoing debate on how best to balance open contributions with quality control and innovation.

Transcription:

all right you guys want to do this uh
again I know we've done quite a few
Jonathan Blow ones but
I just love his takes because they're
just they're just far enough from how I
have takes that they bother me but
they're just close enough that you could
convince me maybe that it's true right
there's something about it that's just
really cool I like listening to things
that in general I disagree with
something about it I don't know what it
is and so this is very exciting very
smart engineer let's see it
very excited about this why Jonathan
Blow on open source software here we go
open source software has been stagnant
for 20 plus years if uh does he know
anything about react okay think about
the think about this one you got higher
first off you have class components you
have higher order components you have
functional components you have hooks you
would now have react server components
apparently this man knows nothing about
open Stars am I right am I right I mean
come on clearly
right in your UI as if it's a server is
going to be just one of the greatest
inventions of mankind if I thought it
was doing a good job why would I have to
do something else
open source software also almost never
does anything creative all they ever do
is copy other things
interesting
is that true
I mean the the hard part about that is
obviously the the hard the hard part
about that is obviously
um you know when you really think about
it days since
um last JavaScript framework
uh
is
I mean they're always creating something
new so I do think that there is
something to that that maybe it's like
the world in which you're working in
that makes it a little bit different
and so like in the JavaScript world I
mean if you've thought of it you should
probably build it and open source it
generally how it works but I am curious
the date is a couple years ago uh but I
like this take which is you know the
more I think about it are people doing
something
uniquely you knew in the open source
world I don't know I'd say yeah I think
personally yes but let's let them cook
okay let's let them cook
yeah yeah I think so Judo it tends to be
the better copy in a kind of a bad way
they're very bad at creativity for some
reason
you will never know why I don't submit
pull requests the idea of a pull request
is offensive kind of right it's like hey
go do all this work
and then I the guy you can submit to me
your request that I pay attention to
your work and then I the guy who decides
what goes in will decide to take your
work or not right
um by definition of guy who decides and
if I decide not to then you wasted your
time right
like everyone pretend oh I I do want to
pause on that that's it is a really good
point which I think we can all agree
that open source work is a largely
thankless job
and those that are the ones just simply
making the changes but not owning the
repos
they're one of the biggest Heroes of
them all they get none of the street
cred
and they get all of the hassle
like that is it is very very respectable
very very difficult stuff and I
definitely don't want to uh minimize
what they do and so I think that he has
a very good point here which is that it
is like a genuinely shitty relationship
open source is super Democratic but
there's inherently a very strong class
structure there right yeah so if you
support authoritarian Democratic you're
kind of lower class in a sense
right
yeah I mean I I I'm agreeing with it but
second off it open source is not
Democratic there's nothing Democratic
about open source people always have
this like idea that Democrat or uh that
open source is like the People's Choice
For Stuff it's actually largely
authoritarian it's whoever is in charge
Whoever has merged privileges chooses
the you know the line and the thing is
is that I say no to PRS constantly it's
not communist it's it's it's
authoritarian it's kingship it's
monarchy it's whatever whatever you want
to call it where there's it's a very
small amount of people that make the
choice and there's a very large amount
of people who wish to use it or make
changes to it
you can you
've got your own country that's the
beautiful part about open source
creating your own country well fascism
and and communism art are virtually the
same when it comes to hierarchies of
power but it is like
they're they're not like that it's a
little bit different
I think we're I think trying to relate
them to a political structure might not
be the best way to go about this whole
open source thing
I think what it really is is that
somebody draws in an imaginary piece of
land that they are King but their land
comes with benefits and if you like
their land
you can look at their land
and you can even suggest changes to the
land but they may say no
you can get an identical copy of their
land and create your own land based off
their land and there's nothing they can
do about it
just saying it's a weird it's like
there's no political you can't really
relate it to anything
especially on a giant project like llvm
the fact that I think they have such bad
taste and everything
there's something very uh
negative about submitting to the
Judgment of people who you believe have
very bad taste do you know what I mean
what's the alternative to pull request
for open source just so everyone commit
whatever no um
mechanism by which you admit trusted
people
and then just don't don't take
contributions from other people
hmm
let's try to think about that for a
second let's just let's try out his
thought on this in a sense
well it's not a stupid take it's an
interesting take which is
you effectively set up a set of people
who are willing to contribute and those
are the people who can contribute and
everybody else can't contribute they can
like issue requests is my guess that's
it like hey this doesn't really work for
me
uh to me it doesn't yeah I think scaling
is a huge issue
no it'd be open source meaning you can
still look at it you can understand it
but you can't uh
you can't simply make pull requests do I
agree with this take
I mean that's honestly that's more like
how Google does open source like when
you really if you don't know anything
about Google's General structures is
that typically at least earlier it may
have changed today but typically you
couldn't just make a PR to one of Google
ran open source projects it the change
has to be effectuated from somebody
within there's like this there there was
like a ring of people who could make
changes in a ring of people who could
make changes the Ring of people who
could make changes was everybody yeah
open source closed command is that a bad
thing
I'm not going to say it's a bad thing
it's a different thing would we have
better software today I don't know like
this idea that people have where they're
like this is the one way to do it
because this is what is
I don't agree with that but I also agree
with it all at the exact same time right
tradition and history make a huge impact
in what we do today but is it always the
best I don't know a lot of thoughts go
in my head okay a lot of thoughts okay
okay
did I just turn into Chris Farley almost
right there I felt like that was like a
Chris Farley Charlie Day five dollar a
month girl twitch
Extravaganza right there I don't know
how you work that out but you work that
out somehow
I think that would result in higher
quality and much less friction
yeah it's like for anything the level of
complexity that llvm or whatever is
either people really know the code and
can contribute or
they barely know the code and it takes
more effort to make their stuff usable
than
then it's worth it it's like you could
have just done it faster right
I do agree with this take in a sense
that if you like go look at uh T Pope he
writes all of his plugins in vimscript
vinscript's a very Arcane very nuanced
very educated I mean the language itself
is an edge case it's not like there is
nothing but an edge case you're like oh
what'd you do there well did you know
you're like what did I do wrong uh
it's a permanent you just did the wrong
thing and he is extremely good at it and
so he even says like don't try to make
the change just tell me what you want
and I will try to see if I can do it
quickly because of just how arcane like
the stuff is and so I I totally can I
can buy that argument in
very complex open source right so you're
talking about anything that requires
enough pre-existing knowledge to be
useful this is also why I think if you
are giving
uh you should consider giving to open
source projects like everyone should
give some level of money to the project
they use the most right I think this is
very very important aspect you know
just throwing that out there
and that's sort of the flaw in the open
source patches welcome model
is it it doesn't exactly conceptually
make sense
the open source philosophy new day new
time to be upset about open source let's
go is the current open source philosophy
is everybody can program and everybody
can check stuff in and it's always
positive to do that and help and you're
building the software along with
everyone else so I think if someone sees
someone like Casey criticized code
that's checked in in that way it might
at least subliminally and maybe
consciously reverberate like oh if I
check in something
I could be judged in such a negative way
and I don't want that
but actually
hmm
like that rah-rah everybody's happy and
holding flowers picture of software
development is wrong it matters if you
check in stuff
that is very good or if you check in
stuff that is mediocre or if you check
in stuff that is bad that matters it
matters a lot
um and people need to be aware that it
matters and the way that you
evaluate that
is via people having strong opinions
about what is good code and what is not
good code right
there may be more or less productive
ways to express those opinions for sure
but I do want to take a moment on that
one that's actually
hey you do always got to respect a man
who cuts the sleeves off his T-shirt
absolutely and cuts the neck hole that's
his that's a custom neck hole okay
that's custom that's that's vintage
um but
I do think there's something very
important to this which is
how you first present yourself
especially in the open source community
there is definitely some I mean he's
absolutely right like if you make a PR
that's just kind of horseshit like you
thought you fixed something but you just
didn't really think about it you just
threw it all in there and that's that
you can give yourself a negative
reputation which may not even be wanted
right or you see somebody who you think
is really smart which is what he just
said earlier and they get raked over the
coals for a PR and it makes it feel like
you could never submit something I do
think there is something there's there's
definitely a good observation
in in that right a good little piece of
takeaway so if you're going to do
something public make sure you um
you know take a moment to double check
what you do uh make sure you don't get
caught off guard ask some people some
questions maybe beforehand uh before you
do that you know I think there's a lot
of I think there's a lot of good things
you could think about right there social
problem yeah social problems exist ever
exactly
let's argue is good too if you lose that
culture of technical judgment about what
is good and what is bad then software is
over
then literally
software becomes
critical basket weaving right
I feel like there's a joke that he must
make regular because critical basket
weaving I just I don't even understand
what becomes what that
I don't even know I don't even know
and you might feel happy about that for
a couple years because you get to
participate and feel good but like
it's not it's not a good place to go you
don't want you don't want computers to
go there
so there's two store two levels to this
if what you're objecting to is the
criticism then you're just
anti-engineering and that's no good
right if what you're objecting is to is
the the flavor and attitude and the
nature with which Casey was expressing
his criticism
then there's a little bit more of a
point there however again
you eliminate that at your peril right
interesting interesting interesting
there is something very unique about
software
that when you when you write something
when you build something and someone
criticizes it I think there's this
inherent thing I think we all are guilty
of doing it that it's not the code that
they're criticizing but I think it's
often easy to think that it's you with
whom they're criticizing
and second up I think there's also
especially in the open source world
there's a gigantic language and culture
barrier that people who seem like
they're just might be somebody
who's different than you right like this
is a real thing you see this all the
time
um
and so I definitely think there's like
there's there's a lot there and then
thirdly you have somebody who's probably
answered the same question 500 times and
therefore they just like write out a
terse answer because they've seen it and
that's that what do I think of the actic
solution or the actors thing for those
that don't know there's this whole acts
thing in 2009 that everyone got all
upset and uh I honestly when I read it I
didn't understand why everyone was
pissed off like when I read it nothing
about it seemed that shocking I was
actually more shocked at how many people
said it was an ordeal when it was
just like a guy who was terse who said I
don't really want to do that
right like that that's it like the owner
of actors was like I don't really want
to do that I don't see why I need to do
this and they're just like oh you know
and it just like blew up and you're just
like okay whoa whoa it kind of seems
like the community is kind of shitty in
this situation whereas the owner was
just maybe more tersed than he could
have been but it also turns out he was
like
super Russian I don't know if there's
like Russian and super Russian but he's
like super Russian and just communicated
in a very direct way and that's just
like not what anyone was used to and so
everyone in the
rust Community which is known for being
maybe a little softer just couldn't
handle the super Russian nature of super
Russian man and just like dilapidated
under the fact that he's just like
unsafe code is pot of rust and they're
just like
you know like it just like exploded
it is it is perfectly fine to have
unsafe rust I can only deal with Russian
accent if I have sad face like I cannot
do it doesn't I cannot do Russian
accents without angry face and I have to
admit somewhere the taliano just
I don't even know if it's Russian okay I
don't even know anyways back to the
story it is well known that many of the
greatest contributors to society not
just in software but in all science and
technology and the Arts everywhere many
of those people have been hard to work
with for one reason or another and
partially that's because they care
tremendously about what they are doing
they care tremendously about the form in
which they are working all right
he's right uh I I believe if I'm not
mistaken Gauss was considered like a
full and so was Euler if I'm not
mistaken very very well known for being
like super
you might say oh but that guy doesn't
need to be crotchety and mean about that
thing but you can't you can't like take
away that part of the personality and
have everything else right because that
part of the personality is quite likely
an integral part of what made the rest
of the artist or the scientist as good
as they are
[Music]
I really like that take
honestly real talk I love that take
which is there's a part of someone that
cares so much
that it's easy to become an
because what you see as simple other
people look at as complex because of
your depth of knowledge and then on top
of that there is like this constant
desire to make something better and so
there is definitely there's something
about that I mean I always personally
want to err on the side of communicating
well
um
but I'm not necessarily disagreeing with
this take I've met people who've like
I've met I I can think of one person
who's exceptionally smart we're talking
one of the smartest people I've ever met
and communicates in a more terse fashion
and it's because he really cares about
things and so
could he could you get more flies with
honey yeah
but would he still be the person out
there fighting
right
like that's that's a it's a really good
point which is do you take away the
thing in which gives that person their
uniqueness by robbing them of that
I don't know
I don't know
right you can't like
just decide Albert Einstein should have
had a different personality but he
should have still done all the cool
relativity stuff and figured all that
out and then I'm gonna sit on my couch
and eat Cheetos and I'll criticize
Einstein for not being a good person in
some certain way that a hundred years
later I decide is the right way to be
but but I will take all the stuff that
he contributed because it helps me eat
Cheetos and that's great
right honestly this is a really good
point applies to Modern software as well
which is like it's very easy from an
armchair quarterback to say what is good
and what is bad but the people actually
doing the work
like they're the ones that are getting
raked quite frequently whereas it's the
people that aren't even apart it's the
crowd it's the people that want to be on
the side of whatever that jump in on
these things you know it's very
interesting you can say anything you
want on the internet and inevitably
somebody will negatively say some
counter position to you no matter what
even if they have absolutely no
experience you Rich Harris can get up
there and say I like JS docs and he got
like on the front page of Hacker News
people are saying how ridiculous it is
how do they do generic they're just
saying a bunch of false stuff because
they actually haven't used the
technology
but there's this like idea that they're
they're actually smart enough to make
judgments about it and they don't know
nothing
right it is very interesting this it's a
very I mean it happens in all forms of
society
that's so like that it is important for
us to see that kind of
lazy
bloated fat
uh social criticism of others as as
being as toxic as it actually is and is
being as unproductive and Decay inducing
as it actually is that's way more toxic
than a programmer saying angry things
that kind of criticism because because
that kind of criticism that's in Vogue
in places like Twitter right now is
um it's not in Vogue for what it what is
on Twitter Twitter is based on that
Twitter is the outcome of people having
shitty opinions
that's it that that is what Twitter is
it would not exist without the well
actually
at a large scale it will destroy Human
Society
whereas the crotchety programmer thing
on a large scale built a large part of
the human society that we have right now
okay so like be very careful with that
stuff and on my part I feel that one of
the better contributions that I can make
is to not tolerate that kind of
criticism
like I just won't put up with it you
know if you come to this Channel with
that kind of thing I just I'll just ban
you because
it's stupid and I don't have time for it
and uh
yeah there's too much of it it's cheap
it's it's cheap all it is is posturing
so that you know the person making the
criticism can feel better can show other
people that they are a good person
and it's gross it's really gross and and
it's destructive
we don't need it
so I I genuinely do think he has a lot
of correctness on this
um I do I I want to I I want to say this
one point which I think is really
important I don't fully agree with the
statement right like if you come in here
and you and you and you say that I'm not
communicating you know nice enough or
whatever I do try to consider those
things right I think that's probably
because I just have a bit more of a
social aspect or I feel responsible for
my words not
like
I do feel some sort of level
responsibility but at the same time I
think that there is also just this
inherent problem that exists which is
there's like a plane of of IQ if you
will or whatever right the IQ curve
which is you probably have like the dumb
and smart guy on the side being like
Taurus communication is great but the
middle ground guy it's like I'm just so
I just hate everybody who communicates
angrily I think they should all just
have to quit software and lose their
jobs I hate everything about them right
like that that that plane does exist
where it's kind of funny uh where
there's like this this this very
interesting oopsie Daisy that exists um
I don't know
I think you should always strive to be
good
no matter what I think it always is good
to think about what would you feel if
you had everything you said
put up for people to see
right I think I think that's just a I I
personally that's how I try to operate
if I'd be proud to have everyone see
what I'm saying
then I I'm fine saying it even if it's
hurtful
then I think that's fine but that's kind
of generally
how I try to do it
this is a good one by the way this is a
really good one
I just can't play it on YouTube I can't
play it from this machine because
YouTube will will demonetize me
anyways just thought just a thought
I don't disagree I don't fully agree
I do think people that are saying that
you know that that largely complain
about these things uh
I think that if you had the same level
of accomplishment as the person you're
complaining against I think it'd go a
lot further right like I think if you
know Casey is really well known in the
code and in this like performance
whatever community so is John right
Jonathan so if Casey said yo John I
think you're being a little harsh in
this situation I think he would hear it
better so I do think that there is like
this pure aspect where if you wish to
make a change you also need to be on a
similar plane I think it does help a lot
um
yeah I I just think it just exists that
way right it's very hard
um
it's very hard I don't know it's
interesting
I think it's interesting
nonetheless good thing to always think
about
credibility credibility makes a huge is
very very important right if someone
tells me I'm stupid and they're one week
into programming
not gonna lie I don't really care you
know
I uh don't necessarily care

Link: [# Custom $fetch and Repository Pattern in Nuxt 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXH8Tr-exhI)
Notes:
### Summary of the Content

The video provides a comprehensive guide on building custom fetch logic using the repository pattern to abstract API calls in a Vue/Nuxt application. The focus is on creating a maintainable and scalable way to handle API requests using the repository pattern, custom `$fetch` instances, and utilizing `useFetch` and `useAsyncData` correctly.

### Advantages

- **Abstraction:** The repository pattern abstracts the API layer, making the codebase cleaner and more maintainable.
- **Flexibility:** Custom `$fetch` instances allow for configuring fetch options (like base URL and authorization) centrally, making the code more adaptable to changes.
- **Type Safety:** Utilizing TypeScript ensures type safety throughout the application, reducing runtime errors and improving developer experience.
- **Reusability:** Custom fetch instances and the repository pattern enhance code reusability, making it easier to manage and update the application.

### Drawbacks

- **Complexity:** Introducing the repository pattern and custom fetch instances can increase the initial complexity and learning curve for new developers.
- **Overhead:** For small projects, the setup might introduce unnecessary overhead compared to direct API calls.

### Tips and Advice

- Ensure a clear understanding of `useFetch` and `useAsyncData` to avoid misuse.
- Utilize TypeScript for type safety and to leverage auto-completion features in IDEs.
- Consider using custom fetch instances for different repositories to handle specific needs like authentication.
- Keep the repository pattern focused on low-level fetch operations to maintain separation from Vue reactivity and composables.

### Main Challenges

- Configuring and managing custom fetch instances correctly.
- Maintaining type safety across the application, especially when dealing with external APIs.
- Balancing abstraction and simplicity, especially in smaller projects.

### The Importance and Usefulness of the Topic

Understanding and implementing the repository pattern with custom fetch logic is crucial for developing scalable and maintainable web applications. It provides a structured way to handle API requests, making the codebase more robust and easier to manage.

### Accomplishments

- Demonstrated how to set up and use the repository pattern in a Vue/Nuxt application.
- Showed the creation of custom `$fetch` instances for flexible API request handling.
- Highlighted the use of TypeScript for enhancing type safety and developer experience.

### Interesting Quotes or Insightful Sentences

- "The repository pattern might be a good idea... it's a really useful pattern just make sure don't return `useAsyncData`, stay with `$fetch`."
- "You can build [the repository pattern] as we did here, you can use classes, that's really up to you... just make sure they are not serialized otherwise you get some weird errors."
- "With this pattern, things and issues will be gone if you like to use the repository pattern."

This guide emphasizes the significance of using advanced patterns and practices like the repository pattern and custom fetch instances to enhance the development of web applications, showcasing how these approaches contribute to creating a more efficient, scalable, and maintainable codebase.

Transcription:
Intro
hey everybody welcome back to another
video on my channel and today we not
only Built our own custom fetch logic
because I know some of you requested
that right in the video comments no we
even do more we use the very well-known
repository pattern to abstract the b or
API and see how we do this while still
keeping everything nice and not running
into any issues with composes functions
use fetch you know the Dr let's
[Music]
go before we dive into the application
and build it step by step yeah there
were some improvements with regards to
using use fetch versus dollar fetch now
if you misuse use fetch like I've shown
in a recent video which is linked there
or down in the description there is a
A warning when misusing useAsyncData or useFetch
warning now which you can see right here
and if you've seen it before you might
wonder okay should I change something
the answer is yes you most likely should
there might be some edge cases but in
all scenarios you might misuse
composable versus functions and we have
a look into that as well when we build
our repository now right away very
important make sure that you understand
use Fetch and use Asing data a little
bit we will only use them at the end
because we start with the very Basics
and then we go over how to use the
things in composes okay let's jump into
demo application and give the whole
Demo app
thing a go our demo application is not
crazy complex as usual we want to keep
it very simple an empty Nu config it's
fine we have an index page and here we
just call our Json placeholder typy code
API so right now okay we get some data I
will show it to you in a second in the
browser but there is nothing abstracted
away it's plain and the code and that's
not exactly what we want very important
here for the whole thing with use as
data we could also just use a use Fetch
and provide the URL but as we will use
use Asing data throughout the video I
thought it's nice to start with that
straight away and then in here we have
our utils file repository and we don't
have much here going on because we want
to build that right but what we have is
our type defined before so to get all
the types script magic okay let's jump
into the browser and see if things work
as they should and they do perfect
that's great we get all the users from
the API fine and just to double check no
warnings just some logs we're good okay
maybe let's leave it open let's jump
back into the code and start our
Implementing the repository pattern
implementation okay so the first thing
we want to do is looking into our
repository pattern so in the utils file
here the good thing is this is auto
imported so we can just use that
repository and we want to implement that
get function over here right so what we
want to do is this get function should
return technically a promise giving us
at the end some user and of course that
won't work here straight away we just
return a string so nah not ideal and
what we can do is well why not just use
Dollar fet in here right we could do
that at works it's Auto imported yeah we
need some URL that will fine so
technically we could even say hey let's
go to the index page take that code from
here and copy it over in here right and
that works fine okay now we could even
say hey let's get our user repository
user repo is
repository call it and in here we don't
use the dollar fetch anymore but user
repo dogat and so so good the nice part
is now we already have the type
completions here because in our user
repo get we have the definition we given
make sure okay hey we make sure this is
a user because it's an external uh API
we don't really know maybe you should
also add users here that would be very
helpful um and yeah we're good to go in
Passing a $fetch instance
theory but there is more behind it of
course we this is not the whole video
otherwise yeah it would be a bit
pointless because there are lots of
things you maybe want to do in your
fetch instance there are things you want
to set like authorization things you
maybe want to change the base URL based
on the runtime config and so on so on so
there are lots of things that you can't
really do in the utility part here okay
so how do we do this instead well the
easiest way is we say that repository
when it's instantiate it gets a custom
fetch instance and how to do it well we
say it gets a fetch instance which is of
type dollar Fetch and we'll Import in a
second and here we could either use like
unknown or any or whatever or we just
make it a generic which is a bit nicer
so we say t and then Nitro fetch request
here and as you see okay there's no Auto
completion for that not there we just
import that so we import type Nitro
fetch request and dollar fetch from uh
Nitro
pack and here we go and instead of using
dollar fetch here we just use
fetch
okay and this doesn't fully work yet
there are some typescript errors of
course because now we have to pass in
the fetch instance and what we can do is
we can just say hey you know what let
just pass in Fetch here and let's have a
look if this exact C code works so let's
jump back into the browser and have a
look and well still the same as we've
seen before that works fine great but
are we are we done yet well once again
we're not really done yet because now we
passed in the dollar fetch instance as
the general fetch instance and we didn't
do any customizations but this is coming
now so what we doing next is we create
Creating our own $fetch instance
our own fetch instance and then use it
when we initialize this repository that
means you can have different fatch
instances for different repositories
doing other things like oh
authentication here maybe without
authentication there whatever you want
let's do that jump back in the code and
see how this works so instead of using
dollar fatch here we could create our
own instance by saying dollar fetch.
create and right now in the repository
well we have this bace URL here that's
not really nice right ideally we just
want to call slash users and we're good
and the base URL should be set should be
set throughout our fetch instance so
let's do that here and say base URL
should be set to the Json placeholder
API and now I might wonder okay yeah um
now I always have to set that when I
call repository and it's not ideal of
course so maybe we could somehow
globally provide this instance and also
Globally providing $fetch + using runtimeConfig
make sure that we can set things through
the runtime config and also just once
and here I also recommend the blog post
from Sebastian who also outlined how to
use that and make that easy and we use a
similar approach what we want to do is
we want to create a KN plugin so let's
say plugins api. TS and in here in this
next plugin we want to make sure that we
Define our custom fetch instance we can
set all the things that we want and then
we provide it globally to the next
application so we create a default next
plugin where I Define next plugin this
might be nothing new to you if you have
used plugins before but here's a little
twist instead of using a function we
used the new object notation if you
don't know it don't worry um I'll cover
that in the next video but so far think
of the setup function as the same thing
as you would just say hey okay I'll
create a function here this works same
way but in our case it doesn't matter
much just want to show you that there is
this object notation it can be very
useful as I said in our case no big deal
but something to think about and now we
can technically take this declaration
over here take it move it over here and
here we could also say okay you know
what use runtime config dot know public
um AP base URL something like that we
could Define that and say hey we could
use this or if it's not there that
placeholder um though it would be easier
to already provide that AP based URL
default in your next config but that
will work for the sake of Simplicity
let's just keep it up with the string
here but it's still fine and from here
you can do even more you can use
Interceptor so you could for example say
hey on response or on request do certain
things like set authorization tokens
refresh stuff and even though it's a bit
lowlevel because these interceptors are
they're not related to composes or
anything they're just related to fetch
API it's really useful to do that right
here because this fetch instance that we
will share in a bit that can be reused
and you only have to you only have to
Define your logic once so let's say
const API is dollar fetch create and so
on so on and now we say return and we
use the provide key to make sure that we
provide our API
here okay so far so good we have this
custom fetch
instance so somehow we have to pass our
API instance that we provided in here
and because we provided for a plugin it
has a dollar prefix but that still
doesn't work and why is that well we
have to get it from somewhere so we use
the use KNX app composable here and
destructure
it and here we go we have still the full
type safety it's passed in here and it
works and here we have that repository
fully set
up and if we have a look in our
repository in here we could as I said
define the lead post and so on so on
we'll always use the same fetch instance
so all the logic with regards to
authentication will just work out of the
box and with a few simple files this can
Summary
work nicely I would still recommend to
not use use Asing data inside these
repository patterns because they should
work with the most most lowlevel things
we have available which is dollar fetch
more or less the fetch API rapper
because then you can decide hey do I
need to send that in an event listener
for a button click then I can just call
the repository like user repo dopost and
the wait that that works fine it's
basically like using dollar fetch under
the hood as for example shown in the you
might use use fetch wrong video and if
you really need it for like okay I want
to watch some properties I want some
reactivity I want some state logic or I
want data available through service at
rendering then you just use as we did it
right here use Asing data and then call
it in there the best part type safety
will work and even if you use your own
API endpoints in the server that will
also still work with exactly that setup
so you have the full endtoend type
safety still available that's the best
part so all in all the repository
pattern might be a good idea you can
build it as we did here you can use
classes that's really up to you when you
use classes though make sure they are
not serialized otherwise you get some
weird errors which I've explained in
this video over here or down in the
description but all in all it's a really
useful pattern just make sure don't
return use Asing data stay with dollar
Fetch and use use Asing data sparely
when needed because right now everything
in the repository p in the utils it's
totally separate from actual view
context we don't use any composes we
don't use any reactivity that's what you
can build on top I would really advise
not to put it all together and mix it up
instead have it nice clean and separate
that's what it did here any questions
let me know in the comments the code is
as usual linked below and with this
pattern things and issues will be gone
if you like to use the repository
pattern otherwise you always can
structure it as you like this is just an
example of using a custom fetch instance
together with a repository pattern but
as I said mix it up as you like that's
it for this video see you next time when
we talk about the new more or less new
KNX plugin object syntax and how things
can run in parallel and depend on each
other will be amazing so stay tuned take
a look at all the other videos and happy
hacking

Link: [# You are using useFetch WRONG! (I hope you don't)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsGVmcWviY)

Notes:
### Summary of Content

The video provides insights into common misconceptions and proper usage of the `useFetch` composable within the Vue.js framework, particularly in scenarios like submitting forms. The presenter demonstrates through a simple demo application‚Äîa login form‚Äîhow misuse of `useFetch` can lead to unintended multiple API calls. Two solutions are offered to address this issue: using `$fetch` for simpler data fetching needs and adjusting `useFetch` with specific configurations for more complex scenarios.

### Advantages

- Demonstrates the power and flexibility of Vue's composable `useFetch`.
- Provides practical solutions to avoid common pitfalls in data fetching.

### Drawbacks

- Misusing `useFetch` can lead to performance issues, such as unnecessary multiple API calls.
- The nuances between `$fetch` and `useFetch` might confuse beginners.

### Tips and Advice

- **For simple post requests**, such as form submissions, prefer using `$fetch`.
- **For server-side rendering or get requests** where you need the data to be reactive, `useFetch` is more suitable.
- Avoid calling `useFetch` in event handlers or submit functions; it should be used at the top level in your script setup block.

### Main Challenges

- Understanding the appropriate contexts in which to use `useFetch` versus `$fetch`.
- Ensuring that `useFetch` is not misused in a way that causes performance issues due to unnecessary reactivity and multiple API calls.

### Importance and Usefulness of the Topic

- Understanding the correct use of data fetching composables is crucial for building efficient and performant Vue applications.
- The topic is highly relevant for Vue developers seeking to optimize their applications and avoid common pitfalls.

Intro
hey everybody welcome back to the
channel and happy New Year at least if
you're watching when that video comes
out or rather in that time frame anyway
I hope you had a few great holiday a
little bit of rest never hurts right and
yep it starts again another tip when it
comes to next and today we'll have a
look how you might misuse use Fetch and
what consequences it have let's
[Music]
go use is a very powerful composable and
it's pretty amazing what you can do with
it but there are also few misconceptions
that we want to tackle and see how you
can avoid them for that once again I
built a very simple demo application
with login form to show you the problem
and how you can avoid it let's have a
look this application just consists of
Demo application overview
an app. View and also a custom API in
point for some fake login API the idea
is that we have some username and
password saved that will then um be used
as a body and be sent to the login
API when the form has been submitted and
then after everything went through we
can do some things so everything after
here is like some custom logic and also
here we have an on response function
that just increases the call count here
to see how many calls to the API we're
actually doing and then in the template
part we just have a login the form that
will actually call the unsubmit function
and also prevents the default action
then we have some inputs with the data
1p ignore so my password manager won't
bother a login button to submitted and
just some debugging here and maybe
you've seen already what uh is a bit
strange here but um well if not I will
show you in a little bit first let's
have a look at how it works so here we
Submitting the form
are the simple login form and we can try
with the password but first I'll open
the Network Tools increase a little bit
and we'll try with maybe
password uh we push login and we see
post request let's see ah didn't work
too bad wrong username password that's
unfortunate did it work false and amount
of course one so let's just try Hunter
The issue pops up
to wait whoa whoa whoa whoa what wait
wait wait
wait this was this was a bit
much 9 10 11 the API calls are
increasing now every time I write
something and we also see it in network
tab like all these requests to the login
API is did did I did I break it it's KN
broken did we did we mess up
Explaining the issue
something yeah we did we messed up
something but KN is not broken no
worries this is what happens when you
use use fetch not as a composable but
just as a data fetching function let's
check out the code and see where the
mistake is and how to fix them here in
line 14 we use the mighty use fatch
composable and in a previous video I've
already talked about what a composable
is and what a function is if you haven't
watched that please have a look at it
it's really worth it as usual on top
right corner I have linked that also in
the description and after the video or
maybe even before you know that
composable should only be called in life
cycle hooks which is very unusual but
more commonly other composes or in the
script setup block or function like in
the setup function or script setup block
but on the top level and this is not
happening here right we don't call this
on the top level so this is the first
problem and the second problem is is we
don't really need your composable we
just use use fetch because it's a bit
convenient to fetch data but what we
eventually want to use we just want to
fetch data we don't need eror to be
reactive we don't need like data to be
ref and so on so on and most importantly
use fetches clever we pass in the body
composed out of the username and
password right and use fetch can be used
for an amazing multitude of things like
oh if a query parameter change like if a
page number change please refetch data
automatically because use fetch will
watch all the reactive values given to
it through like body pams query and so
on so this computed body here that we
pass
along is amazing but in our case we
don't really want that it watch is that
at all so using use fetch in um some
kind of event handler on submit function
so everything that's not really top
level in the script setup block is a
problem and how to solve this pretty
First solution
easy we just use dollar fetch right so
here we say okay let's just get the data
out of here and we could even say Let's
uh wrap a try catch around that and say
okay if that worked all fine otherwise
if there there's an arrow we can catch
it and do something with it
like log it or um deal with it
otherwise and that would be the correct
way of dealing with it because now we
don't need a composable in here we just
want the fetch data that's right dollar
fetch will not do any magic behind it
you can't like do refresh calls or
anything this is just of fetch from the
njs repository the package behind that
will just do a call and it's W around
the fetch API which is Prett convenient
you still can use on response you still
can set the method the rest will stay
the same because use fetch is a
composable wrapped around dollar Fetch
and with that things will just work out
let's jump back to the browser and have
a look so in here I trve password again
and we see the call goes in doesn't work
and now it takes it one call all easy
and if I get the right password well
let's see
nope
nope nope it's fine the amount of calls
will only happen when I actually push
the button or uh when I H the enter
key so this is how it should work and
once again misusing these composes is
very common but it can cause severe
How the issue is caused
issues if we go back one more time and
change the code back to the use fetch um
option there and
and like let's clear the network Tab and
I show you something else let's give a
wrong password in and now we have two
calls right like sorry one call per per
tab one call when I change it if I
submit it again now we have two calls
when changing it and again again again
and now a crazy amount of calls just by
typing one letter I get another five
calls why well because use fetch will
create new composer ible instance that
will watch the reactive information like
the body that we had before when you
call it unsubmit and it's very difficult
to actually clean that up again so
that's also another reason why I don't
want to call composes in these functions
because you can't really clean them up
again and some of them might not work
because they need some context around it
and so on so on but with use fetch you
might think okay but it's it's super
helpful why can't I use it when I want
to fetch data and the answer is you can
there is a pattern that allows you doing
that uh I personally don't use it that
much but in some scenarios it can come
in really really handy let's have a look
Second solution
going back to the use fatch code here
what we can do is we can take this code
out of the unsubmit function we can move
it up like
here and from here we can say okay you
know what let's move that away
too um let's get the data out here as
well and in here we say immediate false
so we say please use fat should not be
executed straight away and another thing
we can do is we can set watch to false
here so all these things like the body
in this case they won't be watched so it
won't be triggered automatically again
and now what we can expose is an execute
function also known as a refresh
function these are both exactly the same
just named differently and we can call
this execute function down here wait
execute and then we can check for the
arrowed value and
continue and you might now wonder okay
why is this fine then while why can't we
just like leave it in there because we
still call a function right and the
difference is that the function returned
by use fatch that execute function here
this is not a composable this is just
return value of of composable which is a
function and that's totally fine to use
it's actually encouraged right it's very
common to say oh I got some data Maybe I
want some new one so I have some kind of
execute or refresh function once again
it's exactly the same just named
differently for semantic reasons and
yeah just call that here so that
shouldn't be a problem and with that
approach you could still use all the
benefits of use fet like also pending
State and so on so on while keeping all
Al together once again I would not
always suggest that approach it depends
a lot on your structure and architecture
but these are two ways to deal with the
easiest way is once again just rely on
dollar fetch if especially if you want
to submit a post request that's also the
My rule of thumb
rule of thumb suggestion I I have so
what I would recommend is if you have
some kind of button click
form anything else than a get request
use dollar fetch or a wrapper around
dollar fetch if you need to send some
authorization headers bar tokens and so
on so on right if you have data that's
necessary for service head rendering use
use fetch of course no problem and you
have no issues refreshing it but very
importantly make sure that you never
ever call use fetch in a function like
an event handler a subid function and so
on so on you only want to call it top
level in your script setup block
Outro
that's all for today I hope that helped
and that might help you fix some weird
ideas why calls are happening twice
Trice and so on did you ever did a
similar thing let me know and if you
have any questions as usual drop them
down below in the comments that's it for
today I hope to see you next week again
also have a look around the channel
check the other videos if I haven't seen
them and uh Happy hacking see you soon
bye-bye oh

**Mobile Applications:**

- Requires development in different programming languages and frameworks for different platforms (iOS, Android).
- Maintenance of at least two separate codebases if a web application is also required.
- Subject to app store review processes and requirements, which can delay updates and releases.

### Tips and Advice

- Consider a mobile responsive web application for a broader reach without the need for app store approval.
- Explore hybrid development frameworks (like Flutter or React Native) for a balanced approach between web and native mobile applications.
- Assess whether the unique features of mobile devices are necessary for your application before deciding on a mobile app.
- Be prepared for the extra development resources needed to manage both web and mobile applications, possibly requiring separate teams.

### Main Challenges

- Balancing the trade-offs between web and mobile applications based on business needs and user expectations.
- Managing the complexity and resource requirements of developing and maintaining both web and mobile applications.
- Navigating the app store review processes and adhering to their requirements.

### The Importance and Usefulness of the Topic

Understanding the differences between web and mobile applications is crucial for businesses and developers to make informed decisions about their digital strategy. This knowledge helps in selecting the right approach that aligns with the business goals, user needs, and available resources.

### Accomplishments

- Clarified the distinctions between web apps and mobile apps, highlighting their respective advantages and drawbacks.
- Provided practical advice on choosing between web and mobile app development based on specific criteria and business needs.
- Discussed the technological and operational challenges associated with developing for both platforms.

### Interesting Quotes

- "Just because you built a web app doesn't mean it's not mobile-friendly."
- "The biggest downside of Going Mobile is that you're beholding to the respective app stores."
- "Overall, it's much easier to develop, deploy, and manage a web application in the B2B space."

This video serves as a valuable resource for businesses and developers considering their application development strategy, offering insights into the complexities and considerations of choosing between web and mobile app development.


Transcription:

two commonly used terms are web
applications and mobile applications
while they both pertain to Applications
they differ in this video we examine the
distinctions between web apps and mobile
apps in the B2B space we often see
businesses thinking they need a mobile
app when a web app might be just what is
needed we'll discuss trade-offs later in
the video let's get into it what is a
web app first let's break down websites
versus web apps for our purposes today a
we ite is a set of pages on the internet
typically showcasing various attributes
of a company or product not the product
itself think of Facebook Facebook has a
homepage for the company but when you
log in you are using the Facebook app
delivered through the browser taking
things a step further I'm defining a web
application as an application you
interact with through a browser the term
interact is key here you can make
selections click on things save data
read content applications provide an
online interactive experience websites
do too but applications take things a
little bit further sometimes for fun
sometimes to work think Google Docs
Netflix eBay Spotify those are a few web
applications that you might interact
with today these have mobile
applications that can be downloaded as
well but we're talking about interacting
with these Services through their
browser-based
applications just because you built a
web app doesn't mean it's not mobile
friendly with modern UI techniques in
framew marks you can build a dynamic
experience that renders very nicely on a
mobile device that does not require a
mobile app downloaded from an app store
a mobile responsive web application is
what we're referring to here you can see
that in the applications we just
discussed load them on your mobile
device using a browser not their mobile
application and you'll still have a
delightful experience Progressive web
apps push the boundaries even farther
essentially you are creating a mobile
app that can be launched from an icon on
your phone very similar to interacting
with a mobile app but without requiring
an app store download although the
technology is Forward Thinking and works
extremely well there are some quirks
that may make it a good fit for some but
a bad fit for others to simplify a web
application is an application you
interact with on the internet through a
web browser whereas a mobile application
is an application that requires
downloading from an app store for use on
a mobile device such as a phone or a
tablet we covered web apps now let's
chat about mobile apps as previously
mentioned mobile apps require
downloading from the app store for Apple
iOS devices and Google Play for Android
devices they also require development
and programming languages in Frameworks
separate from web applications so there
is an added burden for businesses when
deciding to build mobile applications
for their customers in B2B a web
application is typically a requirement
so if a mobile app is required there are
at least two separate code bases that
need to be built and maintained now
aside from a mobile responsive web app
we discussed earlier there is two types
of of mobile application development
strategies hybrid and Native hybrid is
when your development team utilizes a
framework such as flutter a react native
to build one application user interface
that gets compiled into code that can be
used on both the IOS and Android
Platforms in a lot of cases this works
well but be careful if you need features
on the phone that are not supported by
the Frameworks in those instances you'll
have to go full native developing native
applications for iOS or Android requires
different text Stacks from programming
languages such as as Swift on the iOS
side or Java on the Android side
different idees for developing the apps
in different app stores with different
requirements relative to developing web
applications it's a much bigger burden
to take on when we develop mobile
applications we utilize a turbo native
for iOS and turbo native for Android
Frameworks powered by Hotwire and sits
in the rubyan rails ecosystem this makes
it extremely easy to reuse web views you
built in rails while allowing you to
build native workflows where they make
sense for your and users both live
together cohesively we shipped a rails
app last April that has not had a Mobile
update since the initial release but
gets you updates often it's a complete
Game Changer the biggest downside of
Going Mobile is that you're beholding to
the respective app stores they decide if
your application can be deployed or not
you have to abide by their requirements
or your app may not pass during
application review yes to deliver an app
to the app store or Google play it is
reviewed by them before it can be
released I'd like to refer to this is
liking to the days of shipping AOL on
CDs if you ship a new app in the app
store and find a bug immediately after
release it's possible that it could be
days before that bug fix is available in
the app store on the web that's not a
problem you can deploy a fix as soon as
it is ready the App Store requirements
is another big one to be mindful of
Apple and Android have specific
requirements that your app needs to
support you can't decide to bypass these
requirements or your app will not be
approved from my experience Apple's
requirements are a bit stricter than
Android and the apps store review is
also stricter but both sides do a good
job of documenting the requirements you
need to follow though sometimes there is
ambiguity it can be hard to figure out
exactly what it is that they're
expecting of your app overall it's much
easier to develop deploy and manage a
web application in the B2B space I push
clients to stay away from going down the
mobile app path unless it makes total
sense for end customers it's typically
very clear when that is the case that's
okay just make sure you've accounted for
the extra development resources to help
manage the web in Mobile side of things
it is possible to manage web and mobile
with a very small team but often it
makes sense to have a separate web in
Mobile development team even if that
means you have just one of each
splitting the workload and deployment of
both for a single developer is extremely
painful in this video we covered the
differences between web and mobile apps
and some of the differences between
going down either path if you enjoyed
this video and want to learn how to make
an app then I recommend clicking this
video right here that video will show
you the exact back road map I follow
When developing apps I hope you enjoy it

Notes:
### Summary

Mike Mono, a seasoned software developer, discusses the limitations of using React for web applications. He outlines five main issues: reliance on third-party libraries, frequent updates and changes, performance challenges, SEO difficulties, and inconsistent TypeScript implementation. While acknowledging React's popularity, Mono suggests these drawbacks can significantly impact development time, maintenance, and application performance.

### Advantages

- React's ecosystem offers a variety of libraries for different functionalities.
- Hooks simplify component logic, enhancing code reuse and maintainability.
- Server-side rendering improves SEO and initial page load performance.
- Flexibility in rendering approaches (client-side, server-side, static generation) with frameworks like Next.js.

### Drawbacks

1. **Reliance on Other Libraries**: Leads to decision fatigue and a steep learning curve, especially in state management and maintenance challenges.
2. **Frequent Updates and Rapid Changes**: Introduces a learning curve with each update, requiring refactoring and adaptation to new practices.
3. **Performance Issues**: Real applications face challenges like unnecessary re-renders and memory leaks, affecting application performance.
4. **SEO Challenges**: Client-side rendering can hinder search engine optimization due to inefficient content rendering.
5. **Inconsistent TypeScript Implementation**: Partial or inconsistent use of TypeScript can result in fragmented and less maintainable codebases.

### Tips and Advice

- Consider the full implications of relying on third-party libraries, including maintenance and complexity.
- Stay updated with React's frequent changes and assess how they impact your existing projects.
- Optimize component rendering and state management to avoid performance issues.
- Explore server-side rendering or static site generation to improve SEO.
- Implement TypeScript consistently across your project for better code quality and developer productivity.

### Main Challenges

- Managing the steep learning curve due to React's reliance on the JavaScript ecosystem.
- Keeping up with frequent updates and the need for continuous learning and refactoring.
- Addressing performance issues in larger applications.
- Overcoming SEO challenges associated with client-side rendering.
- Ensuring consistent implementation of TypeScript.

### Importance and Usefulness of the Topic

Understanding the limitations and challenges of using React is crucial for developers and teams when choosing a framework for web development. This knowledge aids in making informed decisions that align with project requirements, team skills, and long-term maintenance considerations.

### Accomplishments

- Provided a comprehensive overview of React's limitations.
- Offered practical advice on navigating the challenges of using React.

### Interesting Quotes

- "In reality, what usually happens is that a decision is made, then changed 6 to 12 months later to be replaced with a different library."
- "Does your head hurt? Mine does. This is all just madness."
- "Over time, as apps get larger, keeping performance at peak becomes harder and harder to do."

Mike Mono's insights into the drawbacks of React, combined with practical advice and a comparison to his preferred framework, Ruby on Rails, offer valuable perspective for developers evaluating their technology stack.

### Analysis of Comments on React Usage

The comments reveal a mixed perspective on using React, with users citing various reasons for their preference or dissatisfaction. Here's a synthesis of why people use React and their sentiments:

1. **Ease of Use and Community Support**: @otavio.prosperus mentions using React for its ease and the abundance of visual material available for learning and applying it. This highlights React's strong community support and resources, making it accessible for developers to create web applications quickly.
    
2. **Job Opportunities and Market Demand**: @gokunik expresses a commitment to learning React due to job opportunities, indicating that React's demand in the job market influences its adoption among developers. The implication is that React's popularity and widespread use in the industry make it a valuable skill for employment.
    
3. **Frontend Development Standard**: Comments like those from @indimerz question the alternatives to JavaScript (and by extension, React) for frontend development, suggesting a perception of React as a standard or default choice in the ecosystem.
    
4. **Attachment to the Library**: @quantume7143 and @jatiquep5543 show strong attachment to React, with the latter stating a firm decision not to move away from React and Next.js. This suggests a loyal following for React, possibly due to its effectiveness, familiarity, or the ecosystem it provides.
    
5. **Comparison with Other Libraries**: Some comments compare React to other technologies. For instance, @starX7995 suggests React is easier for beginners compared to other JavaScript libraries. This ease of learning can be a significant factor in its widespread use.
    
6. **Discontent and Criticism**: Despite the advantages, there is notable criticism. @sidecharacter9375 criticizes React for being overrated, mentioning low performance, difficulty in maintenance, and a steep learning curve. @animekontororu9996 also criticizes the video for being misleading about React, suggesting that the problems mentioned aren't unique to React or its ecosystem.
    

### Conclusion

People use React for a variety of reasons, including its ease of use, the rich ecosystem of resources and community support, job market demands, and its standing as a perceived standard in frontend development. However, there's a spectrum of satisfaction, with some developers expressing strong loyalty and others voicing significant criticisms. The choice to use React seems to balance practical considerations like market demand and personal preferences or experiences with the framework.

Several people in the comments expressed issues with React and found agreement with the author's criticisms of the framework. Here are a few examples highlighting their concerns:

1. @otavio.prosperus mentioned problems related to dependencies on other libraries for local state management in React. This reflects the author's point about React's heavy reliance on the JavaScript ecosystem and the complexities that arise from managing third-party libraries.
    
2. **@mohamednassar2335** acknowledged the complexity regarding React and state management, although he also pointed out that React is essentially a front-end library and should be considered as such. His comment aligns with the author's views on the challenges of using React, especially in large enterprise applications.
    
3. **@quantume7143** described the React ecosystem and meta frameworks inspired by React as a mess, showing clear agreement with the author's criticisms about the ecosystem's complexities and maintenance challenges.
    
4. **@sidecharacter9375** expressed a strong opinion that React is overrated, mentioning several cons like low performance, difficulty in reading other developers' code, hard maintenance, a steep learning curve, and slow development pace. These points directly resonate with the author's arguments against the use of React for certain projects.
    
5. **@animekontororu9996** criticized the video for being misleading and misinformative, suggesting a disagreement with the way React's issues were presented. However, this also indirectly acknowledges that there are prevalent discussions and concerns about React's complexities and ecosystem, which the author of the transcription highlighted.
    

These comments reflect a spectrum of agreement with the author's critique of React, focusing on issues like the complexity of state management, the reliance on third-party libraries, and the challenges of maintaining React-based projects.



Transcription: 

in the fast-paced world of app and web
development choosing the right framework
or library is crucial react has been a
popular choice but it's time to reassess
its fit for your development needs hi
I'm Mike mono I've been working in
software development since my first job
at a startup in 1999 and today I'm going
to share five reasons why react might
not be the ideal choice for your web
applications any longer reason one
Reliance on other libraries in the
JavaScript ecosystem react's heavy
Reliance on the JavaScript ecosystem can
be a double-edged sword the need to
integrate with various third party
libraries for management routing and
other functionalities means more time
spent in setup and configuration as
opposed to actual development time the
vast JavaScript ecosystem offers
multiple libraries for the same
functionality leading to decision
fatigue developers must spend time
researching learning and deciding which
libraries to use this process can be
timec consuming and sometimes
overwhelming especially for newer
developers in reality what usually
happens is that a decision is made then
changed 6 to 12 months later to be
replaced with a different Library one of
the bigger challenges managed through
third party libraries is State
Management for those that don't fully
understand what state management is put
simply State Management refers to
managing how data is created updated and
sheared throughout your application a
good example is that you have a signed
in user if the user updates their first
name in your user settings that name
needs to be shown correctly throughout
your application the challenges that
come up often with State Management it
should be managed on the client in the
browser or on the server what tools
should be used rux SWR react query
there's a lot to unravel here for a core
piece of functionality that leads the
complexity that just isn't needed to
close out reason one the Reliance on
third party libraries presents a huge
maintenance challenge over time as your
application grows small toy applications
shown off in YouTube don't have these
problems but real applications in use by
real companies out there feel this pain
every day reason two frequent updates
and rapid changes react's development
ecosystem is known for its frequent
updates and rapid changes reflecting the
evolving needs and practices in web
development two significant shifts have
been the move from higher order compon
opponents to hooks in the increasing
emphasis on service side rendering let's
go deeper into these changes to
understand their implications before
hooks were introduced higher order
components were a popular pattern to
share logic between components while
powerful higher order components could
lead to complexities such as prop name
collisions and issues with components
getting nested within multiple other
higher order components making the code
harder to read and debug hooks provided
a more straightforward way to use State
and other react features in functional
component components they allow
developers to more easily hook into
react State and life cycle features
hooks simplified component logic made
more code reusable and improved
readability and maintainability
traditionally react like many other drop
script Frameworks focused on client side
rendering with drop script runs in the
browser to render Pages while this
approach is great for interactive
applications particularly in SEO
optimization in initial page load times
more recently there's been a shift
towards serice side rendering in the
react ecosystem highlighted by
development of Frameworks like nextjs
server side rendering renders pages on
the server and sends them to the client
as fully rendered HTML this approach
improves SEO as search engines can crawl
content more effectively and enhances
the initial page load performance
providing a better user experience
especially for Content heavy sites
modern react Frameworks like nextjs
offer a hybrid approach allowing
developers to choose between client side
rendering server side rendering or
static site generation based on the web
apps requirements this flexibility is a
significant advancement catering to
diverse needs in web applications each
significant update in react brings a
learning curve developers need to stay
updated with the latest practices which
can be challenging especially for teams
working on Lodge or Legacy projects
adopting new patterns often requires
refactoring existing code for instance
transitioning from higher order
components to hooks involves significant
changes in how components are written
and composed while service side
rendering offers performance benefits it
also introduces complexity in terms of
server load and architecture developers
need to balance client side
interactivity with server side
efficiency these shifts lead to
fragmentation with different team
adopting different practices based on
their project timelines and requirements
does your head hurt mine does this is
all just Madness reason three
performance issues although simple apps
built with react don't have enough code
to lead to Performance issues real
applications built with react have some
challenges that can lead to slow
application performance some of the ca
of those challenges are rendering
components more than needed large
component trees inefficient State
Management memory leaks from improper
component cleanup and side effects from
hooks there's a lot going on in react
with a lot of ground to stay on top of
over time as apps get larger keeping
performance at Peak becomes harder and
harder to do reason for SEO challenges
traditional react applications rely
heavily on client side rendering which
JavaScript handles the rendering of
content in the browser while this is
great for user experience in
interactivity poses a problem problem
for search engines that may not execute
JavaScript or may not do it as
efficiently as a browser this means that
if a search engine crawls a react
application it might see a large empty
HTML document as the content hasn't been
fully rendered yet react applications
especially those that are poorly
optimized can suffer from longer initial
load times due to the need to download a
large JavaScript bundle before the
application can be rendered search
engines like Google consider page load
times as a ranking Factor so longer load
times can definitely negatively imp SEO
reason five inconsistent implementation
of typescript although not specific to
react one of the bigger issues I see
with companies using a JavaScript
framework is the inconsistent
implementation of typescript while
typescript offers robots benefits its
integration into JavaScript and react
projects is often partial or
inconsistent teams may find themselves
using typescript in only certain parts
of their codebase leading to a
fragmented and less maintainable code
structure this inconsistency can negate
the advantages typescript is supposed to
bring like improved code quality and
developer productivity in theory
typescript can be a positive addition
but in practice it's usually a detriment
typescript is much easier to implement
when starting an app from scratch but
much harder to introduce into a legacy
application today I shared five reasons
why I don't use react if you are using
react and having Success With It Drop a
comment below I'd love to hear some of
the reasons why you think it fits well
within your team I spent years
developing in react but can never get
comfortable with it as my framework of
choice I'm a much bigger fan of Ruby on

Link:  [# Python 3 - The Genius of the Partial Function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AMRoQVjtf0)

Note:
The video discusses the Python `partial` function from the `functools` module, highlighting its use for fixing certain arguments of a function while allowing others to be specified later. This feature is beneficial for working with frequently used built-in functions with consistent inputs, optimizing code by pre-setting some arguments. Although not used daily, understanding `partial` enriches one's Python toolkit. The video demonstrates practical examples, emphasizing its effectiveness with built-in functions over user-defined ones, where default arguments could suffice. The tutorial is aimed at enhancing Python mastery by introducing an advanced but handy tool.

Notes:
### Lecture Notes on Python's `functools.partial`

#### **Advantages**

- **Efficiency in Code**: `partial` is useful for fixing some arguments of a function, making repetitive calls more efficient by reducing the need to repeatedly specify the same arguments.
- **Improves Readability**: For built-in functions or when default arguments are not suitable, `partial` can make the intent clearer by specifying fixed parameters upfront.

#### **Drawbacks**

- **Limited Use Cases**: Not something used daily, implying its utility is more situational.
- **Potential for Confusion**: When overused or inappropriately applied, especially with user-defined functions that could be better designed with default arguments, it might confuse readers unfamiliar with `partial`.

#### **Tips and Advice**

- **Best for Built-in Functions**: Particularly valuable for modifying the behavior of built-in functions (e.g., `print`, `pow`) without altering global defaults.
- **Use Keyword Arguments**: When using `partial`, specifying arguments as keywords can clarify their roles, enhancing code readability.

#### **Lecture Content**

- **`functools.partial` Overview**: Demonstrated how `partial` allows for fixing certain arguments of a function, enabling the user to supply the remaining arguments later.
- **Practical Examples**: Illustrated with user-defined functions (e.g., `add`) and built-in functions (`pow`, `print`), showcasing how `partial` simplifies calls and modifies behavior.

#### **Main Challenges**

- **Understanding Use Cases**: Grasping when and why to use `partial` over default arguments or other Python features.
- **Avoiding Overuse**: Recognizing situations where `partial` genuinely adds value without compromising code clarity.

#### **Importance and Usefulness**

- **Enhances Code Efficiency**: Reduces repetition and makes code more concise, especially in scenarios involving frequent calls to the same function with common arguments.
- **Facilitates Functional Programming**: Aids in creating more functional-style code by making function calls more flexible and tailored to specific needs.

#### **Accomplishments**

- **Mastery of Advanced Python**: Understanding and applying `partial` demonstrates a deeper grasp of Python, moving beyond basic syntax to more sophisticated programming techniques.

#### **Summary of the Content**

The video covers the `functools.partial` function in Python, explaining its benefits for reducing repetition in function calls by pre-specifying some arguments. Through examples, it demonstrates how `partial` can streamline code, particularly with built-in functions, and emphasizes the importance of selective and clear use to enhance code readability and maintainability.

#### **Interesting Quotes or Insightful Sentences**

- "It kind of feels like you're hacking apart these built-in functions, which is always quite cool."
- "It's not something you're going to be using every single day, but if you're trying to kind of master the basics of Python, then it's a good one to have in your arsenal of tools."
- "This really comes into play if for some reason your code you're having to change the default behavior of a function."

This lecture encapsulates the essence of utilizing Python's `partial` function from the `functools` module, highlighting its strategic advantages for specific programming scenarios while cautioning against its misuse to preserve code quality.

Transcription:

hey guys and welcome back to another
video I hope you're all doing well in
this session I want to cover uh
something from the fun tools module and
in particular the partial function this
one's interesting because it's not one
that I would argue that is that super
commonly used but it has some really
interesting properties and some rather
fascinating use cases uh so to C stange
the chase effectively you're going to be
using it if you're in this situation
here suppose you're making frequent
calls to a built-in function and you're
always using some of the same inputs
then partial can be really good to do
this effectively what it does it allows
you to kind of fix some arguments in
place with a given function it then
gives you chance to pass in the
remaining arguments later on suppose you
have a function that takes in a c uh A
and B at the same like 90 or% of the
time and you only have a passing in C is
a new value it effectively lets you say
go and call this function Fix A and B in
place and I'm just going to worry about
passing in C myself later on so yeah you
know it's not something you're going to
be using every single day um but if
you're trying to kind of master the
basics of python then it's a good one to
kind of have in your arsenal of tools so
for this video I want to show how to do
this using a simple uh userdefined
function uh but what this really comes
into its own is with the built-in
functions because you know if you're
doing a user defined function and using
partial that's probably not a welld
design function if you're using you know
the same inputs like half the time you
could just use default Arguments for
that function uh so to kick things off
let's just do def add X Y you're going
to keep it as simple as humanly possible
here and return x + y here so I've got a
simple function and there it's happy uh
and now I want to say from fun tools
import partial here and before I run
this I'm also going to just quickly do
print the directory of partial the
directory function returns all methods
and attributes of an object in this case
here I would expect to see let's hit run
there we go and the things I I'm
interested in are these here args Funk
and keywords so when we call the partial
function we pass it to function you can
pass it some arguments you can pass it
some keyword arguments and we can
basically see okay what is paral being
called on and what's it being called on
with so I'll make sure to show these in
just a minute's time here now the way
we're going to set partial up here is as
follows I'm going to set up a variable
called partial ad and then call the
partial function and we can see it won't
as its first argument a funkk here so in
this case anything callable so in this
case my ADD function is of course that's
callable and we can pass in augs and
then keyword augs here so if I was to do
let's just try x equal 10 here so now
that's set up to kind of a basic Point
uh we can go ahead and look at the funk
the args and the keywords here so I'll
do partial ad. Funk partial add. args
and then partial add do keywords here
and just to show you something I also
want to quickly do it might seem related
I want to print off ad here at the
bottom just to show you something um
okay so partial ad. Funk so of course we
passed in ad so you know this partial
object has an add attribute this
function and check out this look at the
memory address and then look at the
memory address of the ad function
they're the same here so because we've
given the partial function this ad here
um it's kind of stored this function
ready to call and we can see yeah it's
stored the add function there H for the
AR section you've got this as blank at
the moment but if I was to do the
following let's take this 10 or the X
off here we can see that we've now got
ARS as 10 here of course that said
keyword because I pass this in as a
keyword argument there we go so in this
case here we can see we've passed in
this function and we've passed in a
keyword argument X is equal to 10 here
so all that's missing now really is US
calling this partial object and saying
you've got the function you've got one
of the arguments now go off and do the
full thing with this additional argument
so I'm going to clear this guy
here uh clear the screen down there as
well what we'll do we'll set up a
variable and we will do partial add now
because our function has already been
given X it's satisfied in that way uh
it's still missing y so we need to say Y
is equal to 100 and then underneath here
we can print off not reverse we can
print off results there and let's see
what happens and we get 110 um let me
show you if I was to run it like this
here so if I just did um this is
10 it also works as well uh the only way
obviously it wouldn't work if I also do
y is equal to 10 here and run this in
this case here yeah it's it's missing
this x here CU I passed in y here and
passed in y there it's not going to work
so just uh I guess just be careful
that's kind of the message there really
um if your initial partial call course
calls this parameter just make sure that
your subsequent call then passes in the
rest here um so what that means we can
do is stuff like this so suppose in this
case in some odd world this add function
is always being called with X being
equal to 10 but then we want to come
along and then pass in some different
values for this value of y here uh so we
could set up a simple for Loop and do
the following here uh I thought we'll we
just print this here will we we'll print
the partial ad of Y we'll quickly switch
our y equal to I here and there we go so
one more time let's just kind of s out
what's happening here you have a basic
function add which takes in X and Y this
partial this call to this partial
function here accepted a function add
and we said make sure this function is
ready to go with X being equal to 10 so
kind of Imagine imagine this kind of
being like springloaded with X is 10 so
almost like you know I was to kind of
just mock this up down below here it's I
know you can't do your keyword arguments
first but it would be something like
akin to that right we're saying this is
preset so leave it as it is we're only
interested in whatever's passed in as
why here that's kind of what we're doing
and then inside our for loop we're just
saying cool now we're going to finish
off the rest of the function call and
then pass in 3 4 5 6 7 8 and so on so
forth um but of course you know this
example is just to sort of show how it
works at like a super low level um
generally if you're doing it with
userdefined functions you would just do
them as like fixed parameters up here
like this as your default arguments uh
where this really comes into its own is
when we're looking at built-in functions
so we'll clear the screen and we'll take
a look at a couple of neat examples of
where you might use this so our first
example is going to be the built-in
power function here uh if I quickly open
up the D string we can see it takes base
uh exponentiation and then we have some
mod as well uh I'm going to just worry
about the base and the EXP here so of
course all it's doing is Raising this to
the power of this so uh let's just do a
quick demo here if I want to do 10 and
the three and we go ahead and hit run
there we go H okay so we can see we're
raising 10 to the power of three to get
a th you can do uh to honest you could
even pass them in like that and that
would be fine you can pass them in as
keyword arguments so we could say here's
the base here's the exponent
and we get exactly the same thing here
now what if you were in a situation
where suppose this is staying the same
or this is staying the same here so if
you're you using python for any kind of
mathematics and maybe you're always
using the same base or exponent that
might be a good use case for partial
because we could say partially fill this
in with I don't know uh let's say the
base is 100 and then we know that we're
then doing this to varying degrees later
on so let's try and set that up and I'll
show you what this might look like so
I've got partial already imported so all
I want to do here uh is set up a
variable we'll call this partial Po and
this will eventually become our callable
uh we can then go ahead and invoke the
partial here and we can see the first
thing we want is our funk that's going
to be Po and followed by our augs or our
keyword arguments here um I'm going to
be good I think personally I think it's
better to use the keyword arguments here
um it just gives you know especially if
someone else is using this code um
especially if they're not familiar with
what partial does I it's probably best
to use the keyword arguments at least
that way they can see what's going on um
and we'll Define a base as s tr5 here
and there we go let's just hit run make
sure that python is happy and it
absolutely is here um so now we could do
now we've set up our partially called
function uh we'll iterate over a loop
here so we'll do for I in
range let's do that shouldn't be too big
of a number should it let's try that so
do 1 2 3 4 5 inside this here and we can
do print uh partial
power here we go and we're going to pass
in I here in fact what we can do uh
we'll do exp is equal to this here again
I think it's just one of those things it
just makes it clearer uh you know if
your code becomes slightly unreadable
it's not yeah it's not going to do
anyone any favors especially yourself
when you try and revisit it in in
sometime you forget what this argument
is here so in this case here I think
this is pretty straightforward we can
see in this case we've said go ahead and
look at the power function and set it up
with a base of 15 here so then all we
then do in our Loop is say okay now
finish off that call to the power
function and pass in the exponent as 1 2
3 4 5 and we see our results down here
all nice and happy so yeah pretty
straightforward example but again if you
know this is more for I guess if you're
doing anything kind of maths heavy with
python um you perhaps using the same
base same exponent uh the partial
function here could be a bit of a time
saer for you all right let's move on to
a second example and we'll clear the
screen and this time we're going to be
looking at the print function now we all
know the print function uh you know we
probably use it every day if we're
coding in Python every day and we can
see it takes in a number of different
things here so this star values of
course this is basically saying if you
passing comma separated uh strings
variables whatever it's going to print
them all off here but of course you can
pass in separator to say how to separate
those items um you can pass in an end as
well Norm this is flushed out it's like
the this new line symbol here um but
suppose what if you were kind of writing
some program and you want to Output all
your things to exactly the same line so
you know you could do that you could do
something like uh 1 two 3 and then say
separate this oh I don't know let's see
with a d with this little dashy thing as
well so know you could do this um you
could then come along and do hello here
like that so that would be absolutely
fine yeah so so so see how revant
separating with this comma instead we've
told the print function use this as your
method of Separation we could fix this
with partial so we could say fix this in
place and for the remainder of the
program um print is going to do it's
going to do its printing in this way
because I've fixed this in place um so
we'll go ahead and try
that and you might want to call it PR
print I don't know call it whatever you
want um and we'll do
partial we'll give it the print function
and now we want to give it the keyword
argument so I'm going to say take this
as your keyword argument and off you go
and now because print print's a bit
interesting doesn't actually well it
Returns the value of none but it's the
way it does like sy. standard out so you
could just literally do pre-print uh
make sure I get the correct number of
P's in there that'll probably help and
we could just do yes one two
three um do a Bo and true a couple of
things in here and check out how cool
that is so you know that's pretty cool
isn't it you know if you were trying to
do lots and lots of different calls to
print you know just by doing this once
at the top here you know we're not then
doing SE equals D D Dash for every
subsequent call to print um and to me I
think this is where it really comes in
useful um again I'll kind of reiterate
it from earlier if your userdefined
functions I don't think this works super
well um because you could just fix
things like this in a userdefined
function just using kind of like a
default parameter this really comes into
play if for some reason your code you're
having to change the default behavior of
a function such as um like print Len Min
Mac sum um pow like we saw earlier so
yeah just want to bear in mind to be
completely honest it's not something I
use every day um but you know it's it is
something I use a couple of times a
month and you know whenever whenever I
do get a chance to use it it's always
quite enjoyable it kind of feels like
you're hacking apart these built-in
functions which is always quite cool um
but yeah that's that one guys cheers for
watching and I hope this comes uh of
some use in your python Journey have a
great week and I'll see you all in the
next video

Link: [# Visual Studio Code Gets Another Huge Upgrade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrpWVr18ObQ)

Notes:
The January 2024 update for Visual Studio Code introduces three notable features enhancing usability and interactivity. The update allows per-window zoom levels, enabling users to adjust the zoom independently in detached windows, addressing the limitations of previous versions. Voice commands integration with GitHub Copilot offers the ability to execute actions or generate code through spoken instructions, making the development process more accessible. Additionally, triggered breakpoints improve debugging by allowing breakpoints to activate based on other breakpoints being hit. These features aim to streamline the development workflow and offer more personalized settings for users.
Here's a detailed analysis of the new features and improvements in the Visual Studio Code January 2024 update, based on the transcription provided:

### Advantages:

1. **Per-Window Zoom Levels**: This feature allows users to zoom in and out on a per-window basis, which is especially useful when using Visual Studio Code on multiple monitors or when needing different zoom levels for better readability.
2. **Voice Commands Integration with GitHub Copilot**: Users can now invoke GitHub Copilot using voice commands to generate code or initiate chat-based interactions. This adds a new layer of convenience and accessibility.
3. **Triggered Breakpoints**: This debugging feature allows breakpoints to be conditional on other breakpoints being hit. This makes debugging more efficient, particularly in complex scenarios where certain conditions need to be met.

### Drawbacks:

- The initial release had a limitation where zoom levels were synced across all windows, which was not ideal for users with high DPI monitors or those using multiple displays. This was addressed in the current update.
- The transcription did not explicitly mention any drawbacks or limitations for the voice commands and triggered breakpoints features, indicating they were well-received.

### Tips and Advice:

- For **Per-Window Zoom Levels**, it is recommended to enable the "Zoom per window" setting for independent zoom control.
- When using **Voice Commands**, ensure that GitHub Copilot and the Visual Studio Code Speech extension are installed for the feature to work.
- For **Triggered Breakpoints**, it's advised to use this feature to streamline the debugging process, especially when needing to debug specific execution paths or conditions.

### Lecture Content/Main Challenges:

- Implementing per-window zoom levels was likely a challenge to ensure it worked seamlessly across different environments and setups.
- Integrating voice commands with GitHub Copilot posed challenges in accurately recognizing and executing voice commands within the context of coding or chatting.
- The triggered breakpoints feature required careful design to make it intuitive and useful for developers while ensuring it didn't complicate the debugging process.

### The Importance and Usefulness of the Topic:

The update is significant for improving the usability and functionality of Visual Studio Code, making it more accessible and efficient for developers. These features address specific pain points and user requests, demonstrating the Visual Studio Code team's commitment to enhancing the development experience.

### Accomplishments:

- The introduction of per-window zoom levels significantly improves the user experience for those using multiple monitors or needing different zoom levels.
- Voice command integration with GitHub Copilot represents a step forward in making development tools more accessible and convenient.
- The addition of triggered breakpoints enhances the debugging capabilities of Visual Studio Code, making it a more powerful tool for developers.

### Summary of the Content:

The January 2024 update for Visual Studio Code introduced significant improvements, including per-window zoom levels, voice command integration with GitHub Copilot, and triggered breakpoints. These features enhance the usability, accessibility, and efficiency of Visual Studio Code, addressing key user requests and making the tool more adaptable to various development scenarios.

### Interesting Quotes or Insightful Sentences:

- "This is a beautiful new feature, something that is so long overdue."
- "You can now actually implement and talk to co-pilot using your voice if you wish."
- "Really cool functionality, it's going to make debugging certain edge cases definitely easier."
- "By far the coolest new feature again is this one for me, the ability to actually have different zooms levels."

These insights highlight the enthusiasm and positive reception towards the new features, underscoring their impact on improving the development experience with Visual Studio Code‚Äã

Transcription:

hello ladies and gentlemen it's Mike
here at game from scratch and today
we're going to be talking about Visual
Studio code because it just got another
major update the oddly named January
update yeah it's uh February the 5th uh
but this one is really expanding upon
the last update which was absolutely
beautiful so it added some functionality
that I loved and this update makes it
even better so we're going to look at
three of the new features I think at
least everybody's going to love two of
them one of them might be a little bit
more questionable uh but first one we're
going to expand upon something that came
in the last update so here you can see a
window uh can now take any Tab and drop
it off and tear it away and make it its
own window this is a beautiful beautiful
new feature something that is so long
overdue now the problem with this
feature is that you can't actually zoom
on a per window basis so if I come down
here and I want to look something
different here I zoom this in you're
going notice they all expand so if I'm
dealing with a high DPI Monitor and I
have this guy offc screen on a different
display uh they're going to scale up at
the same resolution this is obviously
not ideal and this is one of those
things they have added in this
particular update so if you go into your
settings now you're going to find there
is a new setting called Zoom per window
by the way it will be enabled by default
so we can go ahead and click that one
and then we go back here so we can
expand out and you'll notice only the
main window is updating same thing here
I can now go to the secondary window and
I can zoom it to my heart's content now
you're also going to notice there's this
little button down here uh for
controlling the zoom level although
interestingly enough I do find I'll see
if I can recreate recreate it there we
go at some Zoom levels it completely
disappears so I assume that this is a
bug and hopefully will be fixed in time
but this new functionality along with
the the ability to tear tabs off is
absolutely wonderful something that I've
been pretty much wanting since Visual
Studio code launch so that is a lovely
new feature now the next one we've got
is integration with co-pilot and voice
control so what they've added is the
ability to say hey coat and what this
this will do is trigger off uh a um an
option for you this is all controlled
via another setting so come in here
search for voice and it is the voice
keyword activate what you can do is you
can set this to a number of things you
can have it for uh just doing GitHub
chats or you can have it contextual so
I'll do it contextual so chat in context
and this will uh invoke GitHub chat
depending on what I'm doing at the time
so here we are in a programming context
so we got some simple C code this should
work with any language whatsoever by the
way what I'm going to do is click in
here to this location right there now
we're going to invoke uh GitHub copilot
so what I can say is hey code write me a
for Loop that runs 10 times
okay so now it's going ahead doing its
running thing it figures it out it puts
it in you decide do you like the results
or not so you can now actually Implement
and talk to co-pilot using your voice if
you wish now this is again all context
based so I was coding right there if I
was in a different area I could say over
here so this is in like uh the read me
for this particular release now it's not
I'm not typing code so it doesn't think
I want to generate code or work with
code what I could say is uh so now I'm
going to implement to the a question to
chat so I say hey code how would I
Implement AAR using GD script in
gdau there you see just invokes it off
does the chatbot thing and and the rest
of this you've all seen before the
typical um co-pilot response will come
back uh it will spit out the except for
this guy is being very
stupid okay here we go so it eventually
figured out it doesn't want good do it
wants that is the dumbest response I've
ever seen listen if you know that good
wasn't what I was actually asking for uh
you could say so as opposed to being a
smartass about it but basically yeah
that's what the chat just did so that's
what the in context thing is going to do
basically if it's a chat or chat that's
focused it will automatically invoke
chat uh if it's code it will
automatically do the appropriate thing
there again this all comes down to what
you actually ask it to do in the
settings but now that we got this
Implement I'm going to show you the
other thing that I like here so um if I
equals equals 4 there so basically uh
we'll Loop 10 times if I equals 4 the
console out right line I is four there's
nothing really magical about this code
basically this code is just going to run
uh four times and it should print out I
is for one so say hello world and then I
is for so what you can outdo and this is
actually kind of neat we can now do
something called a triggered breakpoint
speaking of triggered I can also fix
this L formatting Dr me nuts okay so
let's say I have another line of code
here
so all right so there we got another
statement here so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to set a break point on
this line here so this line will only
execute once and that is when I is
currently equal to four but what I can
now do is I can right click here and I
can do an add a triggered breakpoint and
then what you do here is you basically
just specify what breakpoint are we
waiting for and we're going to say this
breakpoint right here so what's going to
happen now is when I run in the debugger
it's going to run through this and it's
going to completely ignore this break
point until this break point itself has
been fired so let's go ahead and
demonstrate that so we'll go ahead and
uh we'll run this go and then what
you're going to see is Boom we just hit
our breakpoint so at this point in time
this code has executed a number of times
you see here goodbye world has actually
run four times but we never broke on it
before so now we're we hit our
breakpoint so now our triggered
breakpoint will fire so boom and now we
get our other breakpoint really cool
functionality it's going to um kind of
make debugging certain edge cases
definitely easier by the way this works
with all programming languages out there
which is again very nice so that is the
big stuff by the way if you're
interested coming in go to help Show
release notes you can see all of the
details of um the January 2024 release
again per window Zoom levels the hey
code voice commands they've also done
improvements to their uh multifile diff
editing they came the last one same with
their the added sticky scroll uh to the
um the um side view the tree view on the
side as well and we' got a couple of
other improvements as well we've even
got it so that it will now uh give you
the option of just automatically
discarding empty Untitled uh so so if I
go ahead and I create this new text file
and then I don't do anything with it
when I exit I can have it automatically
Purge it in instead of keeping it around
just a new Option they've added there do
check out the full release details for
more ideas of what's in this update but
some really nice stuff here I know the
voice and the co-pilot stuff isn't for
everyone and voice integration is
definitely not for everyone but uh if
you're all into hey co-pilot questions
you now have that integration in there
for you which is pretty nice and I have
no idea why it didn't just trigger there
and a couple things to be aware of
though uh to use that functionality you
actually need to install of course
co-pilot needs to be installed and then
on top of that you also have to install
the visual studio code speech but that
ladies and gentlemen is the January 2024
update by far the coolest new feature
again is this one for me the ability to
actually have different zooms levels so
I can come over here I can zoom this
window independently of this window over
here makes it just so much more usable
again we still have some limitations so
for example if I drag off these it's
still not being displayed uh they've
added a couple of new feat hopefully
they get that for every window but if
you're using visual studio code on
multiple monitors the ability to zoom
things at per window zoom level it it
goes together with this whole tab drag
drop functionality to really transform
how you use Visual Studio code so again
two Banger updates back to back let me
know what you think comments down below
I'll talk to you all later and goodbye

Transcription:

into our headline topic which is of
course Apple's compliance with the eu's
regulations that are forcing them to
behave less like a Walled Garden and
more like a f a garden with Barb Wire
Around It Dummy um yeah
so okay apple is being accused of
malicious compliance with the European
Union's digital markets act or dma after
detailing its plans to add support for
thirdparty app stores thirdparty payment
systems and browser engines other than
Safari to iOS in the European Union in a
news release Apple repeatedly emphasized
that the dma opens new avenues for
malware fraud and scams and illicit and
harmful content and other privacy and
security threats now here's here's what
I'd like to know yeah Apple's a very
privacy and Security First company
aren't they yes so then with all the
resources that they have with the are
they at hundreds of billions of dollars
of cash reserves right now probably yeah
and with all the with all the people in
the tech industry that are in need of
work right now I would like to know
Apple what investments you're making to
ensure that as an iPhone user in the
European Union I'm not going to be
affected by this
stuff no seriously though Apple's one of
those companies that this is very unlike
them to acknowledge any potential flaw
in their product even if it is caused by
compliance with a third party regulation
they don't like to talk about that yeah
they like to talk about safety and
security and privacy and the Apple
experience that you can tell they are at
they are at the desperation stage to try
to do something about this um however
Apple
[Laughter]
has a
solution Apple has instituted multiple
safeguards inqu including requiring
Apple authorization of all developers on
alternative of alternative app
marketplaces a letter of credit of a
million EUR in order to launch an
alternative app
store disclosure of alternative payments
data notorized of all apps that is app
revieww by Bots and
humans so basically apple is saying okay
you can have your own store but the only
way that we could possibly ensure the
security of the iPhone is if um we're
basically like in charge of it and also
you pay us a bunch of money a lot um
Apple will be reducing their current
fees a 10% fee for subscriptions a 177%
fee for digital goods and services
and an additional 3% for using Apple's
payment system however Apple will also
be adding a new core technology fee so
once an app Hits 1 million installs its
devs will have to pay ‚Ç¨50 cents is that
what they're actually called Euro cents
yeah I don't know 50 half of a Euro for
every new user who installs it on
iOS
annually that is wild okay anyway the
app can be reinstalled by the same user
for no charge for 12 months though wow
it's actually Euro cents this applies to
paid apps and free apps Apple says they
will have an install verification
mechanism to avoid install spam because
I'm sure it'll be like totally in their
interest to ensure that you know the
experience on third party app stores is
really good that they've really they've
really telegraphed that um Apple has
provided a fee calculator and some devs
have found that under some circumstances
Apple could take as much as 60% of their
yearly Revenue nice developers of
alternative app stores need to pay the
CTF for every first annual installation
including the first
[Laughter]
million oh man but don't worry don't
worry there's an
alternative if developers don't like
this deal right good well they can stay
under Apple's current business terms and
remain exclusively on the App Store
where no third party marketplaces or
Payment Systems will be allowed so is
the only way to get an alternative store
onto the platform by Distributing the
alternative store through the App Store
I actually do not know that is a really
good question that's what it sounds like
through their
terms cuz how could they charge
you if you didn't get it through the App
Store Luke how does that make any sense
Luke I'm not sure I'm I'm sure that uh
when when it comes when it comes to
collecting your money um I think Apple
will find a way it's unclear how Apple
will authorize and
distribute the alternative marketplaces
yeah huh maybe their hope is that this
deal will be technically compliant with
the eu's guidelines not guidelines laws
uh but be so bad that nobody will
actually do it Tim Tim Sweeney has been
going off has he oh yeah yeah oh man
he's been he's been going off and to be
clear I do not agree with Tim Sweeney
about everything in fact we've like had
personal beef at one point a while ago
but yeah but what he is right about just
just because just because I don't agree
with someone once doesn't mean I can't
agree with them when they say something
correct like I'm not saying Hitler was
right
no I was going to say something specific
I don't know maybe he said something
about how trains should be on time or
something I don't know I don't actually
I don't actually I haven't memorized any
any quotes Okay um my point is just that
just because I disagree with someone
about something doesn't mean I can't
acknowledge when they're right about
something maybe the chair was comfy and
Mr
Sweeney the chair some people will get
that it's funny oh okay Mr Sweeney is
definitely Luke please control this
man yeah Luke some people got it good
okay look what you've done what
what how so so Mr Sweeney is 100%
correct here when he says that Apple is
is absolutely behaving in an
anti-competitive way the EU has called
them out on it in a very in a very clear
way and Apple has gone out of their way
to ensure that the manner in which
they've complied with the eu's new
regulations is as awful
as humanly possible also we had talked
before about okay if apple is forced to
allow additional marketplaces and all of
that well how is it going to affect
people outside the EU it looks like the
answer is not one bit Apple will be
maintaining its monopolistic Behavior
anywhere that it is allowed to so if you
want anything to change and change it
can and should I mean Apple has
demonstrated that they can have lower
subscription fees as they can charge you
a what what is it a um core technology
fee man this is this is bizarre like why
why do why do people defend this kind of
double dipping Behavior I don't know you
see a lot of it though it's like it's
triple dipping actually first they
charge the user for the device then they
charge the developer just to have a
developer account oh no we're up to
quadruple dipping now for then they
charge the developer to have a developer
account then they charge you a core
technology fee if you actually have a
very successful app then they charge you
a 10% fee on subscriptions 177% for
digital goods and
services at what point does it end well
you also have to use their payment
system like we mock this kind of thing
when it's the cable when it's the cable
company but realistically most people
have as many options for cable companies
as they do for major cell phone
platforms and so the people who say well
Apple's not a monopoly because Android
exists it's
like okay okay okay right but that
doesn't you can have a duopoly then it
doesn't change that you can have
monopolistic Behavior people compare it
to steam and I'm I'm not here to defend
steam's 30% take either but no not even
a little but on a computer you could use
things that aren't steam well yeah that
and steam actually has as far as I can
tell steam doesn't charge epic games
money to sell games on their platform no
And as far as I can tell steam doesn't
charge game devs any ongoing fees for
the original purchase of the game so you
could have a game that's 160 GB you
could download that game now and forever
not to mention all the cloud
synchronization of your save files
remember Nintendo is going to charge you
like what eight bucks a month per user
to sync your Cloud save to sync your
saves to the cloud like steam is
actually operating a platform that
actually delivers value to the user I
want to buy games on Steam whereas what
is Apple actually doing I mean yeah they
handle downloading sure but the
infrastructure by comparison when we're
talking downloads that are 160 gigabytes
in many cases and we're talking
downloads that are 160 megabytes and
that's a pretty decent sized app I mean
you'll get multi- gigabit H gigabit
you'll get multi gab mobile apps uh
especially for games but they'll be
three or four typically not not hundreds
and to be clear I just want to make this
clear Apple's operating at an enormous
scale on the App Store but don't kid
yourself so is valve yeah gaming it's
kind of a thing yeah um yeah and like uh
people are bringing up like oh you can
buy an Android and it's like okay so
there's the whole duopoly thing also
we're talking about Platforms in general
we don't think Android is necessarily
better off here the the Play Store is
also terrible um just you can
technically it's not a very clean
process but you can sideload on on
Android um and the the steam example
this would be like if the only way that
you could get any apps on Windows was
the Microsoft store I know I just gave
everyone nightmares I apologize for that
um but it would be as if that was the
only any way and for steam or something
else to exist Microsoft is going to take
a cut of it
yeah just for valve having the privilege
to be allowed to have steam yeah that's
pretty crap is that a thing that you
would like is that a thing that you
would defend do you think that would
have
made would that have made the PC what it
is today someone said you mean like on
Windows RT I know practically nothing
about Windows RT but if that's how it
would work that's not something I would
defend uh does Windows RT even exist
anymore I don't know Windows RT is a
mobile operating system designed by
first unveiled January 2011 oh final
release January 10th 20123 12 months ago
so is it is it still a thing is it not a
thing I suspect it's supported extended
support was ended January 10th 2023
never mind so yeah
that's how good it is sick cool
nice yeah windows for arm would be the
replacement for Windows RT uh and my
understanding is nothing on Windows for
arm would prevent you from just
downloading an application and
installing it in fact I was uh man was I
was installing something the other day
was saying S Mode but you can turn S
Mode off can you not yeah yeah so like
what are you talking about yeah if I can
if I can voluntarily make my phone only
allow apps to be installed from the app
store that's fine like this is I don't
know man this is like the the I don't
understand these arguments this is well
okay a lot of the a lot of the Apple
argument boils down to well you you do
have a choice I I like the lockedown
experience sure and it's like right so
then sit down and shut the up yeah
I don't yeah and I should be allowed to
install whatever software I feel like on
this thing that I mean it's not it's not
like apple gives away the iPhone if
Apple gave away the iPhone this would be
a completely different conversation like
okay for example remember that TV Luke
that TV that uh watches you and plays
ads or whatever if that's the deal okay
the hardware is free you watch as much
TV as you want and they're like yeah
we're going to we're going to bombard
you with ads it's going to be pay to
play for anyone who wants to be part of
this ecosystem and have their ads
displayed or whatever it's like yeah
sure fine but my understanding when I
pay full pop and don't kid yourself
Apple's not discounting the iPhone
they're not subsidizing the cost of the
iPhone with the app store they are just
they they are charging as much if not
more they're taking more margin than
pretty much any I think any other
handset maker as far as I can tell
um so when I pay full price for
something my understanding and your
understanding should be that it belongs
to you and so the fact that anyone is
not offended by this that anyone sees
this behavior and goes yeah this is good
it's just baffling to me and if you make
the choice to only use the app store by
all
means but when I say I shouldn't have to
again sit down and shut the up it's that
simple
yeah
nice oh Dan's not here to move the the
the the cards how will we know what to
do he's supposed to tell us through
our well we don't need 10 more minutes
because we both agreed that apple is
being buttheads yeah I'm really looking
forward to trying the Vision Pro though
yeah yeah real heavy yeah we're getting
our hands on uh we're getting our hands
on one February fourth I think ours
arrives you got to do neck workouts um
okay I I am not I don't know how
exaggerated this I am not doing any neck
workouts I am going to I'm going to go
in cold and see if it's overblown as
someone who regularly wears headphones
and who regularly
vrs I suspect that it's not going to
bother me as much as people who do not
regularly VR how much does it weigh
versus like an index but I have heard it
is quite heavy
yes please show Dan cam okay
a wild Dan appears there's Dan oh sorry
I mean a wild
um NAD appears not non
non-infringing um all all resemblance is
uh
coincidental does anyone see where I'm
going with this uh I don't really get
the point we we copied the it's a very
similar character model but it's not the
same thing oh so like pal world I'm
[Music]
don't worry about it NAD stands for not
a
Dan I'm made of AI now yeah I I
apologize in advance for the fact that
NAD is probably going to stick as a
nickname for
you it could be worse Dan fine yeah wait
what uh looks like the index weigh more
yeah it looks like the index weighs more
than the Vision Pro so it's going to be
fine then yeah so it's probably going be
fine what's everyone freaking out about
I it's apple right so on the one hand
you have the things that Apple does that
are actually really scummy yeah and then
you've got people that are just like no
man this seems fine and then on the
other hand you've got what appears to be
a very compelling product that could
change Computing we'll see and people
are like oh my God it needs to be
cooled they need Cooling in it and
there's like there's glass lenses and
glass is heavy
H people are saying cuz uh it's not as
well balanced and and because the strap
apparently isn't as good the index ain't
that well balanced I I would have hoped
that Apple would get the strap right
though I mean then again that's like I
don't know kind of their thing is they
have okay accessories and then other
people fill in the apps so maybe it's
maybe it's fine um one thing I'm really
excited for though is that apparently it
comes with Apple's cleaning
cloth now we missed the initial outrage
train on the $40 cleaning cloth oh it's
included though yeah yeah yeah so we so
we we were like well realistically
there's no point making a video about
this because people have kind of got it
out of their system now but it's not
like it ever went away so I'm going to
get an opportunity
to check out Apple's cleaning cloth nice
yeah I can't believe it's free I'm
pretty stoked on that um I I I I doubt
it's going to get much air time in the
video I've I've kind of said my piece
about Apple's pricing we did a video a
number of years ago when they announced
the $700 wheels for the old Intel Mac
Pro what was that the 209 Mac Pro or
whatever I have to memorize years
instead of just Generations because I
don't know Apple things um where where I
basically talked about how it's it's it
had yeah it has I I actually forget my
point but it was a good point and it
pretty much explained why Apple prices
things the way they do it's because they
want to be a luxury brand they're a
consumer electronics brand but they
really really really really really want
to be a luxury brand and that's an image
that they project um and it's an image
that some people buy like it's the whole
blue bubble green bubble thing has
always been baffling to me you can get
iPhone for like $100 on eBay that'll
like you get your bubble color whatever
who cares um I I they should change the
shade I don't really see how based on
the generation of
phone can
you not give them ideas or no no the
newest the newest one should be the
deepest blue and as your phone ages it
should
fade you that way that way they don't
have to like update they're they're
never going to like run out of Blues you
know because it'll just get worse UV
reactive paint kind of
thing uh
Luke you do know that people from Apple
watch this show right they don't
acknowledge us but I have heard from
people at
Apple Chad's so
mad you got to have dude the new
generation of phone comes out your
bubbles are going to be less blue so you
guys can see why it's a good thing that
Luke is not
evil cuz if he was he'd be an Evil
Genius
oh I could work at the genius please
mute Luke if he can do it to you you
need to do it to him yeah Dan I think
we've established now that I should have
a Luke mute
button I don't know about that I think
Dan's with me on this
Dan I'm setting it up right now thank
you he would too good guy
Dan uh all right what's our next

Notes:

The document you've provided discusses concerns about new policies Apple is implementing which could potentially have significant financial implications for iOS developers. Notably, it mentions a required payment to Apple by developers for app installations that exceed a certain threshold, which could escalate to millions of dollars, depending on the app's success. This has raised alarms about the sustainability and future of free apps in the App Store. It appears the policy change could reshape the App Store's landscape, potentially eliminating many free apps due to the prohibitive costs imposed on developers.

The document you've provided covers concerns regarding Apple's policy changes affecting iOS developers. Here's a summary:

- Apple requires developers to pay $100 annually to release free apps.
- New policies could impose significant costs on developers, potentially in the millions, threatening the viability of many free apps.
- The situation emphasizes Apple's control over the App Store, limiting how apps are installed and monetized on iOS devices.
- Apple's stringent policies are under legal and regulatory scrutiny, particularly concerning their monopolistic control and the imposition of a 30% cut on digital purchases.
- The document discusses potential damage from Apple's policies, suggesting they could stifle innovation and limit consumer choice.

For a detailed understanding, a thorough read of the full document is recommended.

The video discusses the implications of Apple's policies on app developers, focusing on the challenges posed by the App Store's monopoly, the impact of regulatory pushback from the US and EU, and the potential harm caused by Apple's compliance strategies.

**Advantages:**

- The App Store initially increased software quality.
- Apple's ecosystem allows for a trusted marketplace.

**Drawbacks:**

- Apple's strict control over app distribution and monetization.
- High costs for developers due to Apple's fees.
- Restrictions that stifle innovation, such as the blocking of game streaming services.

**Tips and Advice:**

- Developers need to be aware of Apple's changing policies and adapt accordingly.
- Consider the financial implications before opting into Apple's new terms.

**Lecture Content:**

- Analysis of Apple's market share and monopoly over app purchases.
- The effect of Apple's policies on app innovation and developer freedom.

**Main Challenges:**

- The 30% cut from in-app purchases imposed by Apple.
- The difficulty in navigating and complying with Apple's rules without financial loss.
- Potential for apps to be removed if developers cannot afford the fees.

**Importance and Usefulness of the Topic:**

- Essential for developers to understand to navigate the App Store successfully.
- Crucial for businesses and independent developers who rely on the App Store for revenue.

**Accomplishments:**

- Apple's establishment of a trusted software marketplace.
- The potential for more developer freedom due to legal challenges against Apple.

**Summary of Content:**

- The video examines Apple's dominant role in app distribution, the legal battles challenging this dominance, and the recent changes Apple has made in response to legal rulings, which may not be in the best interest of developers.

**Interesting Quotes or Insightful Sentences:**

- "Apple's goal was to build a software marketplace you could trust."
- "Genuine innovation in the market is being blocked by Apple's own weird interpretations of their own weird monopolistic rules."
- "Consumer choice is important; users should be able to choose what apps they install."

Transcription:

at this point it kind of feels like
Apple's trolling us if you want to
release a free app today it cost you
$100 a year to do such policy Apple
published today would force some devs to
pay millions Instead This would
fundamentally change the App Store
destroying tens of thousands of free
apps in the process I'm a software Dev
and an apple Fanboy but that doesn't
mean this video is only for devs and
Fanboys everyone should understand
what's happening here I'm going to do my
best to explain it to youall this VD
will be broken into three separate parts
Apple's Monopoly the US EU push back and
most importantly the potential damage
from Apple's malicious compliance so
without further Ado let's start with
Apples Monopoly
chapter one Apple's Monopoly hopefully I
don't have to convince you that a lot of
people have iPhones in the US 58% of
smartphones are iPhones and over 87% of
teenagers have an iPhone to be very
clear having a certain percentage of the
market doesn't inherently make you a
monopoly it's also worth noting that
Apple's global market share is only
around 30% of the smartphone market
their Monopoly isn't about which phone
you buy it's about what you buy on your
phone when the iPhone launched there was
no app store there was just Safari which
Apple pushed is the future of
applications they learned their mistake
quickly and a year later the App Store
was created crazy enough it only had 500
apps at the time we're going to be
talking a lot about the App Store so
let's break down some important things
about it first you should know the only
way to install apps on an iPhone is
through the App Store there are some
works it's a Dev but it's generally fair
to say apps come from the App Store
Apple also charges that $100 a year
license fee to all devs that make iPhone
apps I mentioned earlier they require
all apps past their strict review
process they require a 30% cut of All
Digital purchases made in those apps and
you also can't tell users about other
payment methods outside of your app so
if you're let's say Spotify there's no
option to tell users hey go sign up on
the website and then sign in here
they're strict about that I want to
focus on those first three points though
because if Apple doesn't like you or
your software then no iPhone user will
ever be able to install it the rules
they enforce through these reviews are
brutal no credit cards only Apple pay no
streaming games only only movies and
music no SMS messages only
internet-based messaging apps no browser
engines only Safari this has had real
impact on both companies and users Xbox
and Nvidia were blocked from Shipping
their game streaming apps Chrome and
Firefox are just skins on top of safari
Apple's goal was to build a software
Marketplace you could trust when the App
Store launched most software was still
installed by buying discs at stores or
downloading sketchy exe's from random
websites the App Store started a giant
leap in the software quality we expect
today but that do make these rules okay
look at the Xbox streaming app for
example obviously you can stream media
on your phone like Netflix Spotify
whatever you want for the most part
almost it's interactive according to
Apple game streaming is a workaround
since they consider games to be apps
therefore game streaming is app
streaming therefore Xbox is banned based
on their no thirdparty app store
rules what this is insanity genuine
innovation in the market is being
blocked by Apple's own weird
interpretations of their own weird
monopolistic rules if you use your
iPhone to order order an Uber or door
Dash Apple doesn't take a cut that's a
service if you use your iPhone to trade
stocks or open a new bank account Apple
doesn't take a cut from that either
however if you use your iPhone to buy a
game for $5 Apple takes a 30% cut Indie
big Studio doesn't matter and this is
insane theoretically you could just have
a user enter their credit card number
and process payments through a company
like stripe they only take 2.9% and 30
cents on top regardless massive 10x
difference in cost sadly in reality
Apple will ban you from the app store if
you try and do that if a digital good or
service is purchased in an iPhone app it
has to go through Apple pay or you will
be banned they are very very strict
about that if you ship an app with no
payment methods and tell a user to go
sign up on your website so that they can
pay there instead you'll be banned for
that as well Netflix and Spotify both
have challenged apple on this and both
sadly lost you literally can't create a
Netflix account in the Netflix app on
your
iPhone this hasn't stopped other
companies from trying though epic games
the creators of fortnite added an option
to use a credit card instead of Apple
pay they got banned so hard that epic
employees got locked out of their
MacBooks for a while thankfully epic's
pretty based and they spent the last
three years challenging Apple in court
and that's where we enter chapter 2 the
The US and EU Fight Back
US and EU fight back I published a video
about the Epic case two days ago so I
won't go too deep here Link in the
description if you want to catch up on
that the US courts ruled that Apple
could no longer block devs from
promoting external payment methods their
specific words are important so I'll
share them here Apple are hereby
permanently restrained and enjoined from
prohibiting developers from including
their apps and their metadata buttons
external links or other calls to action
that direct customers to purchasing
mechanisms in addition to inapp
purchases this seems pretty definitive
right now you can just put a button that
links to your checkout
page sadly Apple's interpretation of
this ruling is it's strange they've
chosen to focus on one word from this
statement using it to work around pretty
much all the rules can you guess which
word in this statement is letting them
work around things keep thinking on that
for a bit we'll be revisiting it in
chapter 3 no spoilers for now because
first we have to talk about the European
Union the 's been cracking down on Apple
lately the USBC stuff was big enough to
honestly deserve a video of its own
we're not here to talk about ports we're
here to talk about the digital markets
act this act opens by defining the term
gatekeeper it defines that as a large
digital platform providing so-called
core platform services such as online
search engines app stores Andor
messenger services I've spent way too
much time trying to turn this 65 pages
of EU legal ease into something
understandable I gave up so I'm just
going to break down the core important
points here there's a bunch of rules
addressing the monopolistic stuff I
brought up earlier game streaming would
be allowed external links to payment
options are now protected legally and
they even had a whole section dedicated
to browser engines really cool stuff
that said there's one key point we need
to focus on now if you want to read this
whole thing then pause the video because
I can't be bothered at this point the
tldr is that Gatekeepers restricted
access to third part party software in
stores which has been determined to hurt
users so now it's prohibited in just
over a month these rules will be
enforced for all countries within the EU
and Apple is very much not happy about
this and here's where we enter chapter 3
malicious compliance let's go back to
that ruling from the US courts in the
Epic versus Apple case to figure out
which word was the one I was talking
about the one that Apple use to work
around everything I'll remove some of
the words that don't matter to see if
that helps you figure it out any
guesses I'll spoil it for you it's the
word or apple interpreted the use of or
here to mean that they only have to
support one of those listed options when
I read this I thought it was pretty
clear the Court's intent was that third
parties could pick from the options not
that Apple could choose the one they
want to support and boy did they find
some cringe ways to support it there are
enough details here that I actually
already made a video covering it so if
you want to hear all of the crazy things
going on there go check out my last
video about Apple and epic but a quick
TDR is that Apple only allows external
links no buttons no other checkout Flows
In fact you can only have one link and
it has to be in a separate view from the
existing inap purchase flows so you
can't just put a link at the bottom of
your checkout the link also has to open
in safari with no direct attachments to
that link so you have to sign in again
on the website once you open it in
Safari clicking those links will pop up
a giant bold text warning when you do it
but most importantly Apple now has a new
27% tax on all purchases made through
this web method so you're not even
escaping their 30% I guess not 27 but
now you're paying another 3% to whatever
payment provider you're
using
God honestly I was impressed when I
heard this they took a definitive ruling
about external payment options and
somehow managed to make it significantly
worse than dealing with their existing
not great options you think that's
EU Compliance
malicious just wait till you hear about
their plans for compliance with the Dig
digital markets
act chapter 3.1 EU
compliance I could paraphrase Apple's
changes but for once they actually did a
pretty good job describing things
themselves they even made a fancy
website and calculator to help describe
all these things I'll be sure to leave
this link in the description if you want
to dig through it yourself because
honestly some of this is unbelievable
and if I just saw it in a video I would
have assumed it was fake in fact when I
saw this particular tweet this morning I
assumed it was fake too and I had to go
confirm the numbers myself due to the
the level of insanity here Apple's not
stated whether or not they intend to
make these new terms the only option for
EU developers in the future for now you
have to opt into them which hopefully
will be enough for them to comply
because they kill these old terms a lot
of apps will die with them today's terms
are everything I described earlier the
30% cut the requirement that you only
distribute your app through the App
Store the requirement that all purchases
are done through in app purchases the
usual Apple stuff however they've
introduced this new Option the new
capabilities and terms for apps in the
EU developers have additional
distribution and payment processing
options available Apple will also apply
a reduced commission I believe it's 177%
instead of the usual 30 however there's
an optional payment processing fee and a
fee for first annual installs above 1
million in the last 12 months if you're
in the gaming world at all this might
sound familiar it's very similar to the
crap that Unity tried to pull last year
and crazy enough it's actually worse
here once we dig into the details so uh
let's do that one quick detail before we
go to the calculator is that your first
1 million annual installs are free so
that 50 Euro I don't know what the
equivalent of a cent is in Euros but
like this 0.5 fee only applies once
you've broken a million but that fee
applies for every install so every two
installs costs you a Euro that's insane
let's see just how insane these numbers
get do you sell digital Goods in your
IOS app or game Let's assume the answer
is no here that this is a free app no
how many installs do we expect to get
well say our app just went viral and we
got I don't know 5 million
installs I know crazy thought but it's
not that insane I've had a Chrome
extension that I released when I was in
college that got like 15 20 million
installs this is a totally reasonable
number when something goes
viral we'll use today's terms and
capabilities for now and look at that
it's a$0 fee for those Europeans that
are in my audience I'll show you that 0
converts pretty nicely to Z as well but
again we're not here to talk about the
existing capabilities in terms CU these
are although not super Fair they're
somewhat reasonable I want to talk about
these new capabilities in terms so let's
take a
look oh that's $181,000
fee that's
$181,000 monthly
fee now I'm not great at math so I'm
going to pull up my calculator quick
that's a $2 million a year bill because
your free app went
viral that is actual insanity this
basically means if you're agreeing to
these new terms and you make a free app
that goes somewhat viral you are now
bankrupt you are now out of business you
now have to pull the app from the app
store because you have no money that's
crazy that's absurd this is just the
side of developers releasing their apps
in Europe so if they accidentally agree
to these new terms they go viral they're
screwed hopefully the addition of these
new app stores is going to help with
this right no absolutely not because
this fee doesn't only apply to Apple's
App Store this applies to all of the
alternative app stores that they're now
being forced to support epic has already
publicly confirmed that they intend to
make a new app store for the iPhone just
to allow for European customers to have
fortnite access again so yes if you're
in the EU and have an iPhone and you use
their new app store you can get it
however every two times users install
this app it costs them a Euro so if they
can't make more than a Euro every two
players they are done for this is going
to be a huge huge catastrophic Financial
loss for them to take we're just talking
about the install fee there's so many
other costs that still exist there's the
inap transaction percentages there's the
cost of paying the developers to make
all of this there's this really weird
rule where you to take out a million
doll Plus credit line with Apple so that
if things go wrong they have a way to
bill you so they can do whatever they
want to do when they sue you if you
don't follow the rules Apple's found a
wild balance here where both the
liability and the implementation cost
gets put on the third parties which
again massively disincentivizes them
from using this you may have started to
notice a theme here when Apple's forced
to comply they provide a new option that
is compliant but it sucks so badly that
you basically can't use it epic's going
to eat a ton of costs sitting here and
doing it just to demonstrate what it
looks like so obviously epic's taking a
huge cost on here in order to make a
third party app store but at least they
can finally release the apps they want
to right right
right here's where one of the most fun
Apple decisions comes in despite support
for third party app stores apple does
not seem interested in thirdparty app
reviews they will still require all
iPhone apps go through Apple's review
even if they're being distributed on
different stores so crazy enough Apple
might still choose to block fortnite
even if they allow the Epic game store
because they're legally required to have
the store they'll just block the apps
instead what like it's so sad because
this legislation really should have
changed a lot of things for the better
and instead either nothing will change
or things get exponentially worse
because if these rules become the
default for customers in Europe most
companies are just going to stop
supporting Europe because if you can't
make back your euro per install you're
screwed
you're just screwed and we're not even
talking about the malicious actor angle
here when I first tweeted about this
first off I thought that the fee here
was monthly not yearly so I was off by
12x but more importantly pirate software
applied if youall don't know him he's a
very talented opack guys he's on a ton
of security stuff help work a blizzard
in a bunch of other places check him out
if you haven't great dude he replied
obviously calling out the unity thing
but this is where things get interesting
this malicious example let's say I'm a
rival business and created a clone of
your game I want to shut you down I set
up a few servers that randomize Hardware
information and download your game
millions of times now you're out of
business I no longer am a
clone and since every device is uniquely
identified they should be able to
prevent this some amount but if someone
sets up a farm of old iPhones to just
install apps when they want to destroy
them this works great and that's
terrifying the fact that any malicious
actor can kind of just destroy your free
app because they feel like it and you
happen to have selected this new deal in
the
EU this doesn't work and if anyone
accepts this new policy there's a high
chance they get screwed but since it
technically complies with the eu's rules
they're going to get away with it
doesn't matter how much worse these new
terms are and how much more risk there
is to developers who accept them because
Apple actually intend for anyone of
meaning to use these terms they want
everyone to go use the old ones because
they don't want to change they want to
maintain the exact state of their
Monopoly as is I don't want to present
my opinions unchallenged so I'm going to
link in the description of video by John
prer that I really like about how the EU
changes in rules might actually hurt
Apple going forward and in the end hurt
users as a result in the end I think
consumer choice is important users
should be able to choose what devices
they use and also what apps they install
as such I can't honestly support the way
Apple has chosen to lock down the iPhone
and I do genuinely hope we see a future
where these third party app stores
aren't implemented in such a malicious
way and users can install the apps they
need for the things that they're
doing that's all I have to say peace
nerds

Link: [# I used a split keyboard for 30 days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPGmZXAQRyw)

Notes:
**30-Day Keyboard Challenge Summary:**

- **Challenge Premise:** Transition from a traditional keyboard to an ergonomic split keyboard to alleviate pain from extensive typing.
- **Initial Impression:** The new keyboard, Sol 3 by RGBKB, is innovative with a magnetic assembly and tenting kit, designed for adult 'Lego' enthusiasts.
- **First Typing Test:** A significant drop in typing speed to 35 words per minute reveals the challenge's difficulty.
- **Adaptation Phase:** Familiarization with the ortholinear key layout and split design takes time, with initial discomfort in hand positioning.
- **Progression:** Gradual improvement in typing speed and comfort as muscle memory adapts to the new layout.
- **Ergonomic Benefits:** Notable wrist pain reduction, but some trade-offs with increased tension in other areas due to the learning curve.
- **Customization:** Experimentation with keycaps and keyboard angling (using pencils) improves comfort.
- **Switching Back Concern:** Temporary challenges in reverting to a standard keyboard layout, with increased typos and reduced speed.
- **Long-term Effect:** Lasting change in typing style, utilizing more fingers and adhering to the home row.
- **Overall Assessment:** Some ergonomic improvements but the importance of taking breaks is emphasized. The split design appears more beneficial than the ortholinear layout.
- **Conclusion:** Personal adaptation varies, with a recommendation to try out different keyboards to find the most suitable ergonomic solution.

This summary captures the essence of the 30-day keyboard challenge experience, highlighting the significant points and personal observations, which could be beneficial for someone considering an ergonomic keyboard switch.

Transcription:

Start of the challenge
- Your keyboard looks like this.
For the next 30 days, my keyboard will look like this.
(keys tapping)
People
(keys tapping)
say
that I'm...
You type on a keyboard 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year.
Forever!
Except for maybe vacations.
This can lead to some major problems,
including carpal tunnel, repetitive strain injuries,
or just pain, everywhere.
I often spend time after work days rolling out
the painful spots,
and I can't help but think, will it ever go away?
Or, am I stuck with this pain forever?
I looked online and a lot of people said
that this keyboard can help out with these issues.
Will this strange keyboard actually fix all the pain?
For the next 30 days, I'm gonna test it and find out.
To start this challenge,
this keyboard was sent to me from RGBKB,
and this is called the Sol 3.
But first, I had to build it.
(upbeat music)
Building the keyboard
Boom, done.
It's actually really cool.
It's held together by a magnet.
It took me a grand total of 10 minutes to build
and it even comes with this cool tenting kit.
It sort of felt like Legos, but for adults.
All right, time to get started I suppose.
For reference, here's my typing speed on a normal keyboard.
Now, here's my first typing test on this new keyboard.
Boom.
Oh.
35 words per minute.
And then I realized this challenge was going to be tough.
Everything felt foreign.
And I had no idea what some of these keys even did.
Typing at this speed isn't exactly optimal.
Why am I torturing myself with this strange layout?
Why am I using this keyboard?
This keyboard mixes two strange elements,
the split aspect of it,
and the ortho linear layout of the keys.
Most keyboards come in a staggered layout.
This comes from those typewriter days
where everything was aligned a certain way
to prevent the bars from jamming.
When computer keyboards were made,
they just followed the same design
since that's just what everyone was used to.
There's really no reason why
a staggered layout's needed anymore.
In theory, the perfectly lined up keys are better
for a more efficient and streamlined typing experience.
Or, so I've heard.
A split keyboard basically takes a normal keyboard
and cuts it right down the middle.
Why on earth would you do that?
It allows your wrist to be straight
and not bend in either direction.
This helps prevent wrist pain.
Another thing you can do is tent your keyboard
lifting it up from the middle.
This lets you improve the position of your forearms.
You can also move the two halves any distance
from each other to get the perfect width for your shoulders.
Basically, split and ortho means better ergonomics,
in theory, but I'm gonna test it.
The first few days of the challenge were really tough.
The first few days
Even common letters, such as N-P-M and C
were difficult to press.
I knew this was gonna be tough.
Making mistakes was detrimental
as finding the backspace key and moving back
to the home row resulted in my hands getting lost.
Anytime a mistake was made,
I had to look back at the keyboard to reorient myself.
I didn't realize how much brain power
and concentration I needed to do basic tasks,
such as writing a simple sentence.
As I developed muscle memory of the new layout,
things slowly started to improve.
I was typing a little bit faster.
I made less mistakes.
Keys that were originally hard, started to feel natural.
Then something magical happened.
After a grueling five days,
I felt like my typing speed was mostly back.
With 25 days left in the challenge,
this was going to be easier than I thought.
The breakthrough in typing speed came with a realization.
I accepted that I had to relearn everything.
So, I stopped thinking I have to touch type
A breakthrough
or else I wouldn't know where anything is.
And that thought completely changed my progress.
I started to commit the distance
between keys to muscle memory and something clicked.
Despite being able to type quickly,
there were still issues.
Big challenges
I was still uncomfortable.
I needed to be conscious of where my fingers were
and that led to tightness in my fingers and my traps.
I felt everything gets harder
from being so tense with focus and frustration.
Doesn't that defeat the purpose of using this layout
in the first place where it's supposed to fix all
of these issues?
But at this point, I wasn't ready to give up.
This is when I started doing my own tweaks to the keyboard.
The first thing I did was swap out the key caps
to see exactly what some of these blank keys even did.
But, I found out that turning it into a monstrosity
of different sets made it easier to see what keys did what,
although it was a bit unsightly.
I also found that the tenting kit that came
with the keyboard was too aggressive
and it added to my trap tightness.
I ended up removing the tenting kit
and adding in pencils instead for a better typing angle.
While it wasn't the most stable,
it was a lot more comfortable.
Having numbers was also really difficult,
but that's when I found out something cool.
With the space between the two halves of the keyboard,
you could slide a number pad in the middle
and the amount of customization you could do
to this keyboard turned out to be pretty fun.
You could even fit a cup of coffee or a snack
in between the two halves if you like.
I'm not that weird, I promise.
But that being said, I had to play around
with where I positioned the two halves
on my table to make it more comfortable.
Too far apart and it was awkward
and too close together, well,
I might as well be typing on a regular keyboard.
I found that an ever so slight angle with a little bit
of spacing was perfect for me.
After really getting used to the split layout
Switch back to a normal layout
and the lined up keys, I was concerned I wouldn't be able
to switch back to a staggered keyboard very easily.
I've read many forums where people didn't recommend
you go all in on a new layout unless you could switch
to it full time.
I found that if I needed to work on a laptop
or use my husband's keyboard, I made a lot of mistakes.
I was too used to the split layout
and a normal keyboard started to feel foreign.
Switching back to a regular keyboard resulted
in a lot of typos and slower typing speed.
It was a pain and I didn't know how long it would last.
Then I found this guy on YouTube called DT.
He's been using this layout for a whole year.
- It can actually switch between the Ergodox
and a standard keyboard pretty well.
Now, that that was not the case initially.
Initially that took an adjustment period.
And is completely comfortable switching back and forth.
This gave me hope.
I wonder how long it would take me to get to that level.
I learned that the brain can adapt quickly
and after several disheartening typing tests
I slowly regained the ability to type normally again,
but it came with lasting effects.
Believe it or not, my typing style
is completely different now.
I now type with more of my fingers
as being stuck to the home row on the split keyboard
made me adopt a more traditional way of typing.
Is this a bad thing?
Not necessarily.
I just didn't start this challenge expecting
my typing style to change, forever.
So, were there any benefits to this challenge?
I know I can say a cop-out answer such as the journey
is all that mattered, or blah, blah, blah,
Should you try a split keyboard?
but you probably wanna know if you should try it too.
I did feel some improvements in ergonomics.
My wrists felt less pain
and it was a nice change of pace
from the usual aches from typing.
That being said, it did feel like I made a trade.
Instead of my wrist hurting,
I felt more tightness in my traps and forearms
from getting used to the new layout.
I think spending all day typing isn't healthy,
regardless of how ergonomic your layout is.
And the best bet to reduce pain is to take frequent breaks.
There's just no getting around that.
I think for me personally, a keyboard that's more
in the middle ground between a normal layout
and a ortho split layout would be ideal.
I felt the split aspect was the main game changer
where the ortho layout didn't make a huge difference.
Just keep in mind, everyone's bodies are built differently.
So, you won't know what's for you until you test it out.
I also learned that the brain adapts way faster
than I thought it could.
Nowadays it takes merely minutes to switch back and forth
between different layouts.
Now, this is all QWERTY still.
So, the challenge might not be big enough.
Maybe next time I'll switch the layout completely,
like the Colemak, Dvorak, or Workman,
but that's a story for different time.
If you're interested in trying out this keyboard,

These notes summarize the key points and features discussed in the lecture about Google's new Gemini platform, highlighting its advancements, capabilities, and how it compares with other AI models like OpenAI's GPT-4.

Transcription:

Intro
so Google made a huge announcement today
in that it a is rebranding Bard to
Gemini and B we now have access to
Gemini Advanced which uses Gemini Ultra
where the previous model that we were
getting out of Bard used Gemini Pro it's
really confusing just keep in mind that
if you're using Gemini Advanced it's
also Gemini Ultra the model they claim
is the most powerful model this is also
the same model that six months ago
Google's deepmind CEO said will Eclipse
chat GPT and in December of last year
sort of doubled down on that statement
saying that it's new Gemini model is
more powerful than open AI gp4 if you
How To Access Gemini Ultra
head over to b.google.r
access to Google AI all the capabilities
you know and love are still here and
will keep getting better in the Gemini
era so let's go ahead and click done on
this and and there's two main noticeable
differences here inside of well Gemini
now up in the top left you can see this
Gemini link and if I press the arrow you
can see now there's an option for Gemini
Advanced you do need to upgrade they are
charging 20 bucks a month to use Gemini
advance but Gemini Advance is using the
Gemini Ultra model that they teased a
couple months ago you remember the whole
thing where they made it look like they
were talking to the AI on a video and it
turned out that they weren't actually
doing that and the whole thing was
somewhat faked yeah that is finally
available for us to use inside of Gemini
Advanced you'll also notice this blue
band across the top that says Gemini was
just updated if we check out the updates
What's In The New Version?
Bard is now Gemini we figured that out
already we have a note here about Gemini
Advanced telling us that we get to use
the most capable AI model Ultra 1.0 it
claims to be far more capable at highly
complex tasks like coding logical
reasoning following nuanced instructions
and creative collaboration at the moment
it's only optimized for English but it
is available in 150 different countries
and looking through the list of
countries here if you're watching this
video there's a pretty D good chance
that you have access to Gemini Advanced
as well there's also a new Gemini app
available on both Android and iOS
although as of right now it's only
available in English in the US but in
the coming days it will be available in
Japanese Korean and English globally
except for the UK switch and European
economic area more countries and
languages will be coming soon and if
you're in Canada it's now available for
Interesting Timing...
you as well personally I find the timing
of this to be a very interesting because
it comes in the same week that Microsoft
has been completely overhauling its
co-pilot product also as of this
recording this Sunday is the Super Bowl
here in the US and Microsoft actually
has an advertisement in the Super Bowl
for co-pilot so of course Google's going
to roll out something fairly comparable
the same week that co-pilot it's getting
its moment but I'm not going to dive too
deep into co-pilot in this video I have
a video coming next week that will dive
into all of the cool stuff that
Microsoft has been doing with co-pilot
if you're not subscribed make sure you
subscribe for that video so I'm going to
go ahead and click on this Arrow up here
Gemini Ultra Pricing
and I'm going to go ahead and do the
upgrade one of the nice things about
doing the upgrade is you can play around
with it for two months without actually
paying we can see here it's $0 for two
months and then it's 20 bucks a month
after that same price as chat GPT plus
realistically you're probably not going
to need them both if you really like
Gemini you can probably get rid of chat
GPT if you really like chat GPT but hate
Gemini you probably won't need Gemini
but heck let's play around with it for
two months at least I'm going to go
ahead and start the trial and now have
Google one AI premium it also seems to
come with some other perks two terabyt
of storage soon we'll have Gemini and
Gmail docs and more and other Google One
Premium benefits whatever that means so
let's go ahead and go to Gemini Advanced
and now if we click on the drop down up
at the top we have the option to to try
both of them as it turns out I'm pretty
much the last one to be making a video
about Gemini among all of my other AI
YouTuber friends one of my favorite
Everyone Else Talking About Gemini
channels fireship made a video about
Gemini already my buddy Matt vid Pro put
out a video about it there's already a
video from the AI grid on Gemini another
one of my buddies Matthew Burman put out
a video on it Chris from All About AI
has put out a video about it AI
explained has a video about it already
and this Channel that I actually
stumbled across just today by David
Andre also put out a video about it so I
was going to do a deep dive in-depth
analysis and test every possible thing I
could think of in Gemini but a bunch of
other really smart content creators
already did so while I will be testing a
few things myself in this video I'm also
going to be sharing what other people
seem to have find because well they've
already done a lot of the testing and
it's fun to show love to other YouTube
channels that are talking about the
stuff that I'm excited about hopefully
it helps you discover some new channels
that if you like mine you'll probably
like these ones as well the first thing
Testing Speed
that everybody seems to talk about with
a Gemini Advanced is how dang fast it is
at actually giving you the responses
this is so much faster than gp4 and it
just cranks out responses really really
quickly this seems to be the general
consensus among pretty much everyone
Gemini is way faster like at least two
or three times faster also the speed at
which Gemini generates is absolutely
blazing fast Google's API are rocket
ships one thing that Gemini Ultra 1.0
does have it is blazingly fast like
really really really really fast it is
extremely fast much faster than gp4 it's
pretty quick I give you that it's much
faster than gp4 so that is a good thing
Gemini Ultra feels a lot faster than gp4
this yeah okay so Gemini is done faster
even though it took longer to start
that's very interesting so yeah every
single video I've seen so far has
commented on how dang fast Gemini
actually gives its output now when it
Creativity
comes to creativity Matt vid Pro here
tested it with a poem and found it to be
really creative here is a gorgeous poem
written by Google Gemini Advanced we
have perfect rhyming and it's able to
combine the seemingly unrelated ideas of
ice cream sandwiches and the planet
Saturn I think it does a really great
job in the creativity Department here's
what Fire Ship said about creativity I
asked it to write a poem about
JavaScript like Kowski it's highly
subjective but I love this test because
it requires the AI to blend the
technical aspects of JavaScript with a
highly unique writing style Gemini was
actually by far the best in my opinion
the poem was dark and even included some
mild profanity in my own personal test I
also found it to be fairly creative I
thought it did a good job at creativity
now in my opinion it's on par with chat
GPT and gp4 I wouldn't say one really
holds an edge over the other in my
opinion they both do creativity pretty
Problem Solving
well now let's talk about problem
solving ability something else that a
lot of people want to use these chat
Bots for Matt vid Pro here actually did
a test where he asked it if he was to
fire a bullet horizontally out of a gun
and at the exact same y AIS drop a
bullet from my hand which would reach
the ground first it actually found the
solution pretty quickly and even shared
a diagram to sort of help better explain
it Matthew Burman here gave it a test
asking if he lays five shirts out in the
sun and it takes 4 hour to dry how long
would 20 shirts take to dry explain your
reasoning step by step and it actually
came to the right answer so pretty
decent in this problem solving scenario
he then gave it another problem about
three killers being in a room another
killer entering the room killing one of
the killers how many killers is left and
it actually got this problem wrong
interestingly Chris from All About AI
gave it one of the exact same tests that
Matthew Burman did I hang five shirts
out to dry the sun after 10 hours all
shirts are dry the next day I hang 10
shirts out to dry the conditions are the
same how long long will take the 10
shirts to dry very similar problem just
worded slightly different and it gave
him the wrong response in this case
Chris then asks it another sort of logic
problem and asks it to walk through it
step by step once again it gets this
problem wrong for him he I explain
tested a logic problem here today I own
three cars but last year I sold two cars
how many cars do I own today you own one
car today well he still owns three cuz
he just said today I own three cars so
once again it failed at this he asked
the same question to gp4 gp4 got the
answer right when it comes to the
Coding
ability to code people have had mixed
results with this as well Fire Ship
compared Gemini Advanced to chat jpt 4
and its ability to read code he uploaded
the same code to both platforms and both
of them essentially figured out what
that code did but of course the big
question is can it actually create good
code I had them write a whole bunch of
different junior level demos like here I
had it create a basic graph database and
go the gp4 result was a bit more
simplistic but I was able to to paste it
right into my IDE and run it the Gemini
result was a bit more complex and
interesting but for some reason it
forgot package main at the top and I had
to add it manually to get the code to
run the AI grid tested coding he was
making a trading bot here he actually
gave it the prompt can you create a
trading bot that uses the moving average
to have entry and exit points for
maximum profit do it in trading view
Pine script please it actually generated
code that didn't work the first time but
he found by simply asking the exact same
question again the second time around it
did write the code properly he then
tested chat GPT with GPT 4 with the same
prompt and it actually seemed to work
better than the version that Gemini gave
him one thing that I find very
interesting is that Matthew Burman
tested coding in his video as well
trying to make a very simple snake game
and it seems that he never managed to
get it to work going back and forth with
Gemini Ultra here he eventually got it
to pop up this game window here but
clearly no snake involved the reason I
find that interesting is that Chris from
All About AI pretty much ran the same
test trying to get it to create a snake
game it didn't do it on the first try
but it seems after a few back and forth
with Gemini Ultra he did eventually get
a working snake game to generate from
Image Generation
Gemini Ultra now let's talk about a
Gemini's ability to generate images it's
interesting because a handful of these
videos have said that they couldn't make
it generate images like David's video
here he asked it to generate an image of
a green flying cat Gemini Advance
responded with that's not something I'm
able to do yet and as we know chat gp4
has no problems with that kind of thing
however Matt vid Pro here tested it with
things like create me an image of a cat
who is a wizard and Gemini did it
immediately sure here's an image of a
cat who is a wizard make him more
wizardy sure thing made him more wizardy
I think it might have also given him a
third ear but maybe that's what more
wizardy means Matt then also asked it to
put text in the image of Wizard and it
managed to do that for him and in my own
testing I got it to generate images for
me create an image of a mad scientist in
the lab sure here's an image of a mad
scientist in the lab let's generate more
and just like that we've got a couple
more variations pretty diverse
variations as well let's test this same
prompt that David tried here generate an
image of a green flying cat for me it
quickly said sure here's an image of a
green flying cat now both of these
images totally suck Dolly does a much
better job than what this gave us here
but it did manage to generate these
images for me generating two more even
got me further away from what I was
looking for but I don't know why some
people aren't able to generate images
While others are maybe it's a location
thing maybe it's only rolled out in
certain countries maybe it's a slow
rollout process and it just hasn't
rolled out to his account yet I don't
know but it does seem to be able to
generate images the more fantasy style
images they're okay but the image in 2
model which Google uses behind the
scenes to generated images is actually
pretty good at making realistic images
for example if I give it the prompt
create a photograph of a woman on a park
bench you can see that three out of the
four are pretty realistic images there's
some funkiness going on with the hands
something that surprisingly still hasn't
really been solved yet but these all
look like realistic images I don't know
why she's just sitting in a pile of
leaves and there is something seriously
wrong with her hand but if you ignore
the hands and you just kind of look from
you know the arm up this is a pretty
dang realistic photo something that
Dolly 3 inside of chat GPT isn't really
great at yet so we know it can generate
images and it can do pretty realistic
images pretty well but how does it do
with interpreting images because when
they put out their demo video of what
Gemini Ultra can do a couple months ago
Image Interpretation
the thing that people were most Blown
Away by was its ability to actually
understand what is in the images when
you upload them well so far this has
been a pretty mixed bag of reviews with
mostly people saying it's not that great
yet for example Matt vid Pro posted this
meme that says find 10 scholarly
articles chat GPT make them up yes why
it's humorous and it basically said it's
humorous because of the juxtoposition of
Kermit being wholesome but also showing
Kermit as the dark side which totally
goes over the head of Gemini for what
the meme actually means he then went on
to give it an image of this car door
here ask what kind of car it was and it
just totally hallucinated it told him
the completely wrong car telling him it
was a 1967 Ford Mustang Coupe Matthew
Burman did a similar test posted this
image and said tell me everything you
see in this image it claims that it's an
image for an article about a large
language model Lambda created by Google
AI so interesting the preview image
consists of a blue background with the
text Lambda written in the center in
white when clearly it says meta and then
it says below that is the word meta
actually not mentioning the Lama at all
in the response so not quite as killer
as the demo that we got a few months ago
Chris from All About AI uploaded this
image here and it mostly got it right
the image shows a purple t-shirt a pair
of black socks I mean the color's wrong
there and a white mug sitting on a
wooden table so the colors are wrong
there's no wooden table but it did get
that all three items feature the Nvidia
logo and I am Nvidia although it really
says I am AI on them so it got some of
the elements right but not all of them
AI explained did a similar test and
found that it struggled when there was
faces in the images he actually had to
put a blue line through their faces so
that Google didn't see the faces before
it actually gave a response to the image
he also tested this image which shows a
speedometer the time how many miles are
left and asked questions about what's in
the image for the most part Gemini got
almost all of it wrong I think he said
he continued to go on and prompt it some
more and eventually it got it right but
it took a little bit of doing to finally
get to Gemini giving the proper response
David here uploaded some pictures of
mushrooms asked what the mushrooms were
it did notice that they were mushrooms
but did not identify the kinds of
mushrooms they were for him I'm going to
try tossing this meme in here I'm on a
seafood diet I seea food and I eat it it
should be pretty easy for Gemini to
understand so let's see what happens
explain what is funny about this Meme
and well it's got people in it so it
tells me I can't help with images of
people yet let's try this meme instead
hairdresser what do you think me explain
what is funny about this meme there are
a few reasons why this image known as
the confused stons meme might be funny
pretty sure that's not what this meme is
the image combines two things that are
not typically seen together a llama and
a question about hair which is something
typically associated with humans I guess
that's kind of right I guess the meane
went viral during covid-19 the confused
looking llama resonated with many people
who are feeling lost and un sure about
what the future held so yeah I don't
really think it nailed uh that one very
well either another thing that is quite
Uploading PDFs
annoying that we can't do with Gemini
right now but that we can do with Claude
and chat GPT and most of the other Bots
that are out there is that we can upload
PDFs to them this one if I try to toss a
PDF in here it just nothing happens it
doesn't let me it just tries to open it
in a new tab that's something that's a
bit frustrating because well it's really
handy to upload a PDF and then have a
conversation about what the contents of
that PDF is something that all the other
platforms pretty much let us do right
now there are some redeeming factors
about Gemini right now as we always say
this is the worst it's ever going to be
so I am not counting out Google yet I
think Google has some bigger updates up
their sleeve we're going to see this
sort of roll out more rapidly they're
trying to keep Pace with Microsoft so I
don't think they're going to be moving
in slow motion anymore some of the
What I Like About It Overall
things I do like the speed that it
generates is faster than pretty much any
of the other models we have access
access to right now it just cranks out
text really quickly we've got access to
extensions which with chat GPT we do
have gpts and plugins and there's ways
to extend chat GPT however what I like
about these extensions is it sort of
ties you back into your Google ecosystem
so if you're using Google Maps you're
using YouTube Google hotels Google
flights Google workspace all of these
various tools that information is going
to be connectable with your chats inside
of Gemini that's really really valuable
if you're really dialed into the Google
ecosystem you'll be able to have these
conversations and have it pull up
information and data that you've saved
in these various other platforms Gemini
is also great if whatever you're trying
to chat about requires web searching now
we do know that jat GPT can search the
web with Bing but because Gemini is made
by Google and Google is the biggest
search engine I think its search
capabilities are a bit better than what
we see out of chat GPT I don't have an
amazing example but since the Super
Bowl's coming up this weekend let's just
ask it who do most people think are
going to win the Super Bowl this year
Super Bowl this year between Kansas City
Chiefs San Francisco 49ers it's
difficult to say who most people think
will win as opinions are always divided
they go on to talk about why it's a
tough call basically saying it's a
tossup but Google has this double check
your response button which will search
Google and actually site its sources for
where it got this information so I can
click on any one of these arrows and it
will pull up details about the website
and the actual quote from the website
it's also got this option to modify your
response so if I want a shorter response
a longer response a simpler response a
more casual or more professional
response I can quickly do that with the
single click of a button which is pretty
handy let's get a shorter response and
there we go we have a shorter response
with pretty much the same answer it's
also really good at creativity like both
myself Matt vid Pro and the fireship
YouTube channel have all shown off
however it's pretty comparable with chat
GPT so I wouldn't say that you should
pay for Gemini for the creativity if
you're already paying for chat GPT it's
going to be about the same and that's it
that's my breakdown of Gemini so far
today is day one it will be getting
updated and upgraded and faster and
better over time but I wanted to quickly
get a video out and talk about what I
found from it and what other people are
finding from it and if you like AI
channels and you like my channel well
there's a lot of amazing AI channels out
there and I wanted to make you aware of
them so if you're not already checking
out these channels make sure you check
Other AI YouTube Channels
out fireship and Matt vid Pro Ai and the
AI grid and Matthew Burman and all about
Ai and AI explained and now David Andre
who is the newest one that I am now
subscribed to I like to keep my finger
on the pulse of AI so I watch as much of
this content as I possibly can see what
other people are talking about and I
figured this would be a fun time to show
off some other channels but also give
you a sort of mashup of how everybody is
sort of feeling about Gemini overall the
Recap And General Consensus
general consensus it's really fast it's
pretty creative on par with GPT 4
problem solving abilities still need
some work chat GPT actually still seems
to be a little bit better at this coding
seems to be a mixed bag from all the
videos I watched some people thought
Gemini was better some people thought
chat GPT was better kind of a tossup
there image generation if you want
really realistic images image in two
built into gem I works really really
well if you wanted to follow your prompt
perfectly to what you asked it Dolly 3
inside of chat GPT is probably going to
be better image understanding so far not
that impressive most of the image
understanding tests that we've all given
it it didn't do a great job of
understanding what was going on in the
image but the fact that it's got
extensions it's really good at searching
the web and citing its sources the fact
that it's really really fast and the
fact that it's Google who has probably
more data than any company on the planet
all makes it something to keep an eye on
whether or not they will ever catch up
with Microsoft combined with open AI yet
to be seen I think GPT 5 is probably
going to come out this year and eclipse
what we're getting with Gemini Ultra
it's always going to be this cat and
mouse game most likely but hey us
Final Thoughts
consumers that are loving watching AI
loving playing with AI we're the real
winners here cuz we get to play with
them all and stick with whatever works
best for us should you go grab Gemini I
mean it's two months free might as well
get in and play with it mark your
calendar if you don't like it cancel it
before 2 months is up and you never pay
a cent nothing really lost so it's worth
a play with but as of right now I'm
probably still going to jump into chat
GPT and Claud a little bit more often
hopefully you found this video helpful

Transcription: 

yada nine Cortez is remembered for
conquering the Aztec empire and also for
being the first governor of New Spain
Hernan Cortes was born around 1485 in
Medellin Spain to a noble family Hernan
Cortes left Spain in 1504 for Hispaniola
and then ends up in Cuba in 1511 Cortes
convinced the Cuban governor to appoint
him captain General of a large
expedition to establish a colony in
Mexico in 1518 in Mexico Cortes
establishes Veracruz and has himself
elected as the captain general got
there's Jose two scholarships so that
there would not be a turning back to
Cuba at the time what is now Mexico was
governed by the Aztecs and Cortes set
out for their capital Tenochtitlan when
he arrives in the capital he meets
Moctezuma the Emperor of the Aztec
empire gives him gifts and then promptly
takes him hostage Cortes was distracted
however when he learned that the Cuban
governor sent a force to confront him
leaving Pedro de Alvarado in charge of
Tenochtitlan while he dealt with this
new threat Cortes took the Cuban
commander hostage and then convinced the
troops to switch sides and join him when
Cortes returns to - tiegler he finds the
nest eaten up in arms because pero
Alvarado during his absence massacred
several priests committed atrocities
Cortes insisted that Montezuma intervene
Montezuma faced the rioting crowds and
was killed by a rock thrown by
protesters the Spanish are then driven
from the city with considerable losses
in what is called the noche triste or
sad night and Cortes then is forced to
regroup with the help of many native
allies who did not like the Aztecs
Cortes returned to Tenochtitlan in 1521
laid siege to the city and finally
conquer
in 1523 Cortez's named the captain
general of New Spain and Governor of
Mexico eventually Cortes returned to
exploring he traveled through Central
America and discovered California in
1541 he retired to his estate in Sevilla
Spain and died on December 2nd 1547
Cortes his legacy is a complex one on
one hand he is the Conqueror of Mexico
he brought and extended the Spanish
Empire but from the indigenous point of
view he was a mass murderer conquering
the Aztec empire led to the destruction
of one of the greatest civilizations
that was known in the world at that time
Mark Twain is now thought of as
America's first celebrity because he was
so good at capturing the public
imagination and it became important to
him to have a public image

Intro
there aren't many bigger comeback stories than the one of the Yakuza Series in the Western Market Yakuza went
from being a series of Niche Japanese games that were lucky to get a digital only pity English release years after
the Japanese one to headlining major trade show presentations I mean it's big enough that it's got its own
presentations nowadays and sitting right in the middle of this Grand Revival of the series is one game the subject to
today's video Yakuza zero Yakuza zero does a lot of things right I mean it
does a ton of things really right the thumbnail of this video that isn't a joke Yakuza zero had to be a game that
served as a prequel to a series which by 2017 had over a decade of History 10 games counting spin-offs to say it had
expectations to live up to is uh kind of an understatement but I'd say not only did it live up to those expectations it
well exceeded them why you might ask well stick around and find out I want to talk about Yakuza 0 today and I'm gonna
let you know beforehand I've got a lot of important cultural tidbits to work in here and there as as well so I can at
least guarantee that this video is going to be a take on the series you might not have heard before why is yohazuki in the
corner there you'll find out trust me as usual I'll drop a spoiler warning before the spicy stuff begins so with that
relatively quick intro out of the way let's get into this
The Fall & Rise of Yakuza
[Music]
now personally I've always been a big fan of sega's Yakuza franchise I picked up 4 on a women late 2011 and was
absolutely blown away by this game in a series I've never heard anyone talk about before and talk about great timing
to get into the series because after four is when it went up pretty much fall off a cliff in the west at least the
Yakuza series had always been a hard sell in the west hell it was a hard sell in Japan when former Monkey Ball F0 GX
series producer toshihiro nagoshi pitched the concept to the higher-ups at Saigon they pretty much told him to take
a hike and the negotiation didn't get much easier from there he had to fight Sega to let him make the game then he
had to fight Sony to let him put it on their console and then he had to fight Ciro the Japanese ratings board to allow
the games even come out hard to imagine considering the series is in like service game's top three biggest
Breadwinners today but you know how to be sometimes um service games is what psyga stands
for by the way eventually yakuza1 finally did come out on the PS2 and what do you know it was a big success and
then it got a sequel which was a bigger success but while the series had a pretty consistent popularity Trend in
Japan around 2012 it took a big nosedive in Western markets so much so that the
localization of Yakuza 5 sat in limbo for 1097 days before getting a barely
announced PSN store exclusive release so what happened between Yakuza 4 and 5
that nearly put this series in the dirt a lot of people blame Yakuza dead Souls the uh weird zombie spin-off game and
that's fair because generously put that game is pretty not great yeah turns out when you put an emphasis on gun combat
in a series with notoriously not good gun combat it ain't gonna break a milli sales in week one you could also put
some blame on the general Trend away from Japanese games in the seventh gen console era or how people were becoming
more and more reluctant to play a game if it had a big number on it see the amount of reboots using the name of the game or or name of the game plus release
here as a title or sequels that would drop their number entirely for a subtitle instead I mean look at The
Witcher 3 box it's basically trying to hide its number starting a series of the number five was a pretty big hurdle for
a lot of people especially a series of story focused as Yakuza was or is I should say there's likely no one big
thing to definitively point to and say that's it that's what did it in it was a combination of multiple factors adding
up but either way the mid-2010s was looking pretty Grim for All Care you the ryugagotoku studio the developers behind
the series wouldn't abandon the Western Market entirely though they put out more hashtag Western focused experimental
games like binary domains see my video on it for more details but even that would end up being a pretty big commercial wet fart pretty much when all
hope was lost this series would ever make it outside of Japan again in 2017 Yakuza 0 came out almost two full years
after its Japanese release and let me tell you it hit it hit big like really
big so big that while the series had to play catch-up for a while with the games had already come out in Japan by lost
judgment it was seen a day and date worldwide release so why for a series that was looking like it was going to
get the plug pulled on it for the insurance payout why did the early 2017 release of Yakuza 0 basically reverse
that overnight Yakuza zero even had stock issues when it first came out in English I'm telling you no one
anticipated it selling this well I mean I could say the game was good so it sold well but you and I both know that
explanation is too simple and unsatisfying to be the whole story one reason I believe is that it came out
during a period I like to call the Japanese game Renaissance again I've told this story so many times I feel
like an old man at this point but early 2017 was massive for Japanese games it
was pretty much the hard cut line that ended the whole whoa all Japanese games are wacky and dumb trite mentality that
plagued the 7th China consoles in popular media wow in jrpg hour one you pick berries in
an hour 50 you kill God what a knee slapper fellas again a sentiment that
wasn't helped by a lot of incompetent mismanagement in big Japanese companies at the time but I'm glad we're past that
another reason is Yakuza 0 got a lot of Word of Mouth marketing I mean it still
does I'm doing it right now a lot of stuff in this game is easily shareable out of context and it's pretty cool
which is why timing played a big factor what would have probably been dismissed as too wacky and too Japanese in say
2013 was rightfully shared for being pretty damn cool in 2017. cure you
singing about his regrets in a karaoke bar while sipping yamazaki single malt whiskey to forget don't tell me you've
never heard of bakami Thai the over-the-top action scenes were two muscular men rip off their three
thousand dollar suits and Brawl on a rooftop now that's hype don't even try to tell me you've never seen a Yakuza at
a context video I won't believe you videos articles memes and reviews are made introducing a lot of people to the
series and it helps that Yakuza 0 was the perfect answer to the question which Yakuza game should I start with one and
two were at the time PS2 exclusives and uh also on the Wii U in Japan but the
statistical likelihood that a single person who owned one and two for the Wii U is watching this video right now is
probably the same as me getting struck by lightning twice tomorrow
Yakuza 3 has a Side Story kind of feeling four is good but it requires a lot of prior knowledge and you basically
have to draw a summoning Circle in the grass and sacrifice an effigy to play five and so on while Yakuza 0 does have
a lot of references you miss out on if this was your first outing in the series it was arguably the perfect place to
start it put a decent focus on easing you into the world and introducing you to these characters gradually well
except for the part where a character named tachibana basically barfs out kiryu's entire autobiography to catch
newcomers up but you know necessary sacrifices it gave you an insight into these characters backstories in history
while not spoiling anything from later entries it integrated itself perfectly into the timeline and that play order
argument only got stronger when yakuzakiwami came out which wasn't only a remake of Yakuza 1 but also filled the
role of a sequel to zero then kiwami 2 came out and in current year 2023 you
can basically play the entire Series start to finish on a PS4 or PC so yeah Yakuza came back big and it's here to
stay My ultimate core memory was finishing Yakuza 4 in 2011 and checking the wiki which at the time barely had a
sentence or two per character now you can spend an entire afternoon reading through just the I don't know the majima
everywhere system or something still waiting for Yakuza black panther to get a western release though no whatever I'll just go play operas
instead you have no idea how long I've been waiting to make a reference to that game so you might be asking what is Yakuza 0
Premise & Storytelling Style
about Yakuza 0 tells the beginning of the longtime series protagonist Kazuma kittyu's story in the modern day he's
known as the legendary dragon of dojima but here he's just some 20-something Rank and file low-level gangster trying
to live it up in 1980s Japan good food going out drinking with his boys getting into fights life isn't very complicated
for him at this point he just Spends His nights hanging out with his best friend and fellow member of the dojima family
Akira nishikiyama Yakuza zero is a chance for us to get a look at a younger less hardened and more emotive version
of kiriu kiriu's simple life changes though when he takes on a job from a loan shark and beats a guy down for the
cashios while we see Kiryu only roughing him up he turns up dead in the exact spot Kitty you left him this is yeah no
doubt bad news but the news gets even worse when Kiryu is called into his boss's office and were introduced to
this game's lineup of Hardcore antagonists Kendall clan leader kuze taihei Association leader awano and
shibusawa family leader uh Shibu Sala these three are the kind of antagonists
you just love to hate they're Brash rude and ruthless especially kooze he's just
such a greasy Dirtbag it's great the whole clan structure is kind of complicated and the game throws out a
bunch of names pretty quickly so let me break it down real quick basically at the top is the Tojo Clan which all the
families belong to dojima is one of the lieutenants of the Tojo Clan and has his own family that further branches off
with dojima's underlings kuze awano and Shibu Sawa who each have a gang of their own Kiryu on the other hand is part of
the cosma family headed by his foster father shintaro Kazama but he's in jail during the game's events Kazama
basically holds a rank one level up from kuze awano and Shibu Sawa but still works under dojima side note I
personally wouldn't have made the name Kazama sound so similar to kiryu's name Kazuma especially considering how often
they're brought up in the same sentence but that's just the way it is anyways the dojibo Slime gang demands kiriotic
responsibility for the killing and turn himself into the police at this point we the audience are supposed to think Hmm
maybe Kiryu accidentally did kill him but then some crucial infos brought up he was killed with a gun which means it
definitely wasn't Kiryu shibusawa is initially receptive of Kiryu saying he was framed but regardless someone has to
take the fall and the most likely candidate is the man in the room who's currently at the bottom of this food chain but then things get even more
complicated when it's revealed that the place the man was murdered the empty lot was a key point in the Tojo Clan's
kamadocho revitalization project a real estate operation to buy up a bunch of land and turn a profit for it the whole
plot of Yakuza 0 is centered around this empty lot so it's an important plot point from this point forward as Kitty
is running out of time to turn himself into the police he follows the threat until he finds out he was framed by none
other than the lieutenants of the doji McLean they're all vying to take the empty lot for themselves which learned them cause him a seat as dojibo's top
Lieutenant kuze framed kirian tries to use it as leverage to get him to spy on Kazuma but Kitty refuses in order to
clear his name game he fights through the doji McLean's headquarters to get an audience with the Frog patriarch himself and get expelled from the clan he's
successful and later teams up with a real estate agent tetsu tachibana and his right-hand man Oda tachibana is
revealed to be working behind the scenes with none other than Kazuma himself and the Pair worked together to uncover The Mystery of the empty lot and its owner
while keeping Kiryu out of the police's hands all while the dojima family is hot on their tail Kitty gets a new white
suit and learns how to operate outside the criminal underworld and our story kicks off for real it's a massive free-for-all in downtown Tokyo and
everyone's got their eyes on a single goal the empty lot no hang on you might be thinking there's
a second dude on that box what's with him and yeah we're not done here Kitty's story is only half of the full picture
this game is Twin protagonists Yakuza zero also gives us an insight into goromajima the Mad Dog of shimano's
backstory this is also the first time in the series that goto majima is a playable character
to count dead Souls I'm not gonna tell you if you should or not you do you the scene starts off in a club called
the Grand when a customer gets a bit too bevied and starts throwing wrists the manager gets called and we find out that
manager is none other than goromajima himself he gets a bottle of alcohol poured over his head and then does like
the most unmajima thing in response he outwits the customer and turns the altercation into a way to make profit
keeping the customer's record clean and raking in cash for his Club majima here is well spoken eloquent calm and
calculating a complete 180 from his character up to this point Yakuza zero tells a story about how this man in
front of us became the Mad Dog of Shimano we know in the later Series so basically majimo's oath brother saijima
lit up a bunch of dudes from a rival gang majuma tried to stop him but that was directly disobeying his superiors
orders that sounds like a strike one kind of offense but it just sucks that his Superior is the power hungry leader
of the Shimano family big man futoshi Shimano he keeps majima locked up for a year expels him from the gang and then
traps him in Sultan body forcing him to earn money by running the Grand majima can't leave Osaka and he can't rejoin
the family until he's made a significant enough but always ambiguous investment majimos kept under lock and key by
shimano's oath brother sagala of the Omi Alliance yeah I told you this stuff gets complex and names just come flying out
basically Shimano is a Tojo Clan Lieutenant same as dojima and the Omi Alliance is a separate large enemy clan
that works mainly in Osaka sagawa offers majima a deal keeps slaving away at the club or do a hit on someone for a fast
track back into the Yakuza side note important points majima and Kiryu have never canonically killed anyone despite
what appears to be uh evidence to the contrary of your honor what happens in battles stays in battles
I guess so yeah majima has never killed anyone before and he's repeatedly warned that
once you cross that line there's no going back but he's desperate at this point so he takes the deal he's told his
target of some low life that trafficks women and forces them to work for him named makotomakimura Makoto is a
gender-neutral Japanese name by the way this point is important after majima finally tracks down who he believes is
makotomakimura and has a boss fight with massive man it's revealed that
makotomakimura is a blind woman in her 20s that works at a chiropractor clinic yeah doesn't quite fit the description
huh two years ago she was kidnapped and the trauma of that event caused her to lose her eyesight the only thing she can
remember is that her kidnapper was a man with a bat tattoo the owner of the chiropractor clinic where she worked
rescued her gave her a job and pretended to be makotomakimura in her place to find the bat tattoo man in the end
majima can't bring himself to do the job and instead ends up helping Makoto since the Omi Alliance is aiming for her as
well and it's not quite clear or why yet so the entire game plays on an interweaving structure kiru and majima's
story is overlap but the two never directly run into each other hidu's events give an insight into majimas and
vice versa the game is divided into 17 chapters and you play two chapters as each character before switching to the
next one so for example one and two Arcadia three and four are majima 5 and 6 arkidio again and so on this two
chapter on off setup is perfect for the pacing and storytelling the story can keep you on edge build tension and then
cash in on it when you switch between the characters for example at the end of chapter 4 majima who still conflicted on
what he's going to do with makotol pulls out his knife as the camera Fades out we don't know what's going to happen here
we know how desperate he is to get back into the Yakuza and we haven't spent enough time to gather a rapport with
this new calm collected majima to be able to say what he would do in this situation you play through the next few
kiru chapters with it constantly in the back of your mind then right as the kitty new section is about to end in
chapter six you get one of the most emotional heart string pulling moments in the entire series nishki draws a gun
on kiru who's being hunted by the dojima clan nishki doesn't do this because he's trying to stab his friend in the back
for Glory he's doing it because he knows what'll happen to kid you if he gets captured by dojima he puts his gun down
knowing he can't shoot the closest thing in the world he has to a brother and the both of them realize they've found
themselves in a world that neither of them were truly prepared for and then kiru drives off you get the payoff for
the majima bit by finding out what happened to him when chapter 7 starts but now you have a new mystery what
happened to kiru after the car scene with Nishiki this game is a master at pulling off setups and payoffs and it
helps that the story beats are absolutely bombastic and over the top Yakuza zero knows exactly how to pull
off going at full 100 and the more quiet dramatic character focused scenes interspersed with this action really led
to why I think this game's storytelling hit the mark with so many people it kicks off with immediate intro Intrigue
and nothing ever feels like it's out of state it's welcome the pacing gives everything a chance to breathe while also keeping you on the edge of your
seat another reason I think this game hit the mark with so many people is because it's really obvious that it was made with a
The World of Yakuza
love for Japan both culturally and physically the Yakuza Series has always been basically the closest thing you can
get to video game tourism I knew this immediately when 20 minutes in after an Eddie drinking kiru and Nishiki go out
for shimed amen which is basically the Japanese equivalent of a cheeky 2AM trip to McDonald's
the setting of Yakuza kamodocho is based off kabukicho a real-life location in Shinjuku Tokyo and Sultan body is based
off dotonmody an area in real life Osaka each of these areas were so well researched and brought to life in the
world of the game the streets of comedocho are basically a one-to-one recreation of the real-life Kabuki Cho a
place most people would consider to be the roughest area in Japan complete with packed wall-to-wall streets covered in
bars people trying to wave you into their sometimes less than wholesome establishments and so on this version of
comedocho depicts kabukicho as it looked in the 1980s a lot of things are the same but some stuff is obviously a bit
different tadakuda in particular haven't made it into the 21st century and after reading
a thorough summary of what they are on Wikipedia I gotta say show a businessman had a strange idea of entertainment
this is gonna sound like a joke but you could probably serve as a pretty decent tour guide of the real life Kabuki show
if you've played a few Yakuza games
oh hey look at that
[Music] and uh
it's not in zero but on the right would be Stardust you know you walk down the street
everything's familiar where the uh gendaco would be
it's uh chicken fighter [Music]
oh and look the Millennium Tower
theater Square looks a lot like it's a lot more dead in real life
there's nothing you've seen before that's where the Sega arcade is game panic
you know there's the parking lot where Kyrie goes to beat people up and this doesn't have anything to do with anything but uh
monkey oh hey it really is just like the game
and you know this is the exact spot the donkey will say where like the people were lining up for not Dragon Quest
Dragon Quest 3. I mean the Don Quixote is in the same place in real life and in the game and the same kind of love is
given to Sultan body the iconic glico man might not be there for uh you know copyright reasons but the multiple
bridges spanning over the canal is an iconic Osaka Landmark there's some stuff that's different but that's just because
Yakuza zero is depicting how it looked some 30 odd years ago and these references to real life Japan just get
deeper and deeper as the game goes on like okay I was howling during this scene because I saw it and I knew
exactly what they were referencing of all things on this green earth the curse of Colonel Sanders
the KFC Guy where after a 1985 Japan baseball championship series win by the
Osaka region-based team the hunching Tigers passionate fans were hurling themselves into the canal to celebrate
one fan was jumping in per member of the team as a ritual of sorts but they realized they were lacking a Caucasian
Effigy to toss in to represent current United States Senator Randy Bass
and oh my God what what am I saying how are the words coming out of my mouth real right now like that's how deep the
references this game pulls are anyways the Baseball fans in their battle lust saw a statue of Colonel Sanders sitting
outside a nearby KFC figured that was a good enough white guy and punted the thing into the bottom of the river the
hunching Tigers would never win a championship series again and it said that's because the burning hatred of
Colonel Sanders lesser Revenge has cursed the team in perpetuity um anyways where were we again oh yeah
so not only is the world packed with adoration for its real life counterpart it's also an extremely interesting world
to explore as well I've often heard the cursed phrase Yakuza is like Japanese GTA and no notes it's nothing like that
that's a comparison made so people can sneak out of having to explain it properly if I hear anyone say Yakuza is
Japanese GTA one more time I'm gonna yell or cry probably the second but
don't make me have to choose compared to most traditional open World Games yakis's world is downright tiny it
encompasses a few city blocks and you can probably walk from one end to the other in like two minutes
but I think in the year of 2023 we know size isn't an accurate measure of
quality for an open world and what Yakuza lacks in size and makes up for in denseness a common complaint with the
open world genre is that while the worlds may be massive and sprawling they often feel slapped together lacking in
meaningful design if that's the case the Yakuza series is the exact opposite every inch of this world is so dense and
thoughtfully designed no space is wasted vertical area design instead of horizontal area design build tall
instead of build wide you know kind of like real life Japan you can basically just exist in this Ultra detailed open
environment you can choose which restaurant you want to go to and eat a meal you can head to an arcade and play
Space Harrier the 1985 Sega arcade game or what the heck spend a few rounds on the crane game
[Music] just as unfair as in real life they've
done it again fellas you can go shopping sing karaoke drink at a bar play pool every corner of this
world is something new to do and then to add to the immersion in-game mechanics are contextualized with stuff from The
Real World you save at payphones if you need a fast travel you take a taxi and you can heal yourself biting at a
restaurant and paying a pretty accurate price for the food or just walk into a convenience store and stare at the
magazines or something I won't tell you what to do the world is so well designed you'll often find yourself just mesmerized by The Glitz and Glam of
1980s Tokyo as you walk around it in this one scene from the opening where Kiryu is hanging out with nishki every
time the camera angle changes in the cutscene you're basically looking at a new desktop background the world is one
of the reasons I keep coming back to this series and Yakuza 0 is an opportunity to see kamadocho like you
haven't really before since it's set in the 80s but when you start digging at the roots of the Yakuza series you might find that
The Shenmue Connection
its ideas are pretty similar to another game a game released in 1999 for the Sega Dreamcast shenmue I don't think
it's too much of a stretch to say that the Yakuza series is a spiritual successor to shenmue they both take
place in an extremely faithful rendition of real life Japan with shenmue taking place in dubita a small area of the real
life city of Yokosuka and they share a lot more DNA than just that they're both games that let you interact with people
around the world they both have stores and restaurants to explore a third person action combat system you learn
moves from strange fellows you meet around the world and they both have some uh weird outdated stereotypes
foreign
sorry nothing but
Chinese and you can play Space Harrier in both so you know basically the same game is
Elder Chad and Yakuza zero a reference to master Chen and shenmue I may be seeing ghosts here but you can't tell me
it's not who was shenmue's producer by the way well what do you know it's long time Yakuza director of toshihiro
nagoshi himself nagushi worked on shenmue as a producer and an uncredited director six years before Yakuza would
release so it makes sense that there would be some overlap but here's the thing you see I stand before you all
today to admit that I'm a fraud because I've never actually played shenmue well
that is until I played it in preparation for this video and well I like it I
think it's a game with a lot of charm now does it have problems oh yeah yeah it does look I just want to talk to you
Suzuki okay I just want to ask him what was he thinking with the forklift bit that's all I want to know oh and I want
to know who designed this website because uh that hat is a bad looking website and you know there's also the
thing where whenever you have to wait for a timed event you have to stand outside the door like a crazy person waiting for it to open I do get what you
Suzuki was going for he wanted you to just go out and kill time and legit enjoy being alive in this virtual world
but I'm so glad shenmue 2 had the option to fast forward the clock I can respect shenmue for basically being the first
game of its kind when it came out in 1999. nothing like this had ever been done before and shenmue would become the
blueprint for everything that came after at the time shenmue was the most expensive video game ever made and it
was mind-blowing in its sheer scale in detail you can see how the Yakuza Games took what worked from shenmue and left
out what didn't to create a better experience shenmue walked so Yakuza could run
you are my best friend yo yo
[Music]
Gameplay
so with that background out of the way let's talk about how Yakuza plays as far as combat goes the Yakuza series is
pretty much the playtonic ideal of a 3D open world beat em up you roam around the streets until someone looks at you
funny and if they catch up to you you enter what is basically a jrpg random battle with Fists why do so many people
see a random guy wearing a suit on the street and want to go practice throwing wrists at him well the PSP game lore is
that gangster their rookies and Kitty as part of an initiation ritual and Yakuza 4-5 state that walking fast emits uh
this dude wants to fight Aura what I'm trying to say is don't think about it too hard when you get into one of these
random battles you're usually put up against three to five dudes in a sort of combat Dimension who you have to beat down to continue you've got a pretty
standard arsenal of beat em up moves at your disposal here light attacks heavy attacks a grab a Dodge The Works
yakuza's main combat system is to press a certain amount of light attacks then slap a heavy on as a combo Ender this
Ender will be different depending on how many light attacks he used beforehand your main game plan in Yakuza 0 is
getting to know your different Enders and knowing when's the best time to use each of them you know meaningful decision making during combat another
main draw of yakuza's combat is the weapons you have at your disposal the edges of most combat Arenas are littered
with items you can pick up that all of their own unique moveset and combo strings aside from the random battles
there are also mandatory Story battles as well as what I'm gonna call dungeons I mean they're large linear areas you
have to fight your way through so if they aren't dungeons uh I don't know you got a better name for them I really like
these areas in particular they're great rated giving you unique long-lasting combat scenarios like how about an area
where they send a flood of dudes in after you or how about just one really huge dude with a couch I'd like to
remind you that kid you has canonically never killed a man also these dungeons are the game's
chance to show off its most unique environments there's this one later dungeon you go to as majima that's
fashioned after a traditional Japanese Inn and yeah it's a lame ass excuse to shove in an area they wanted to make but
I'm down with it reminds me of the Japanese garden from Metal Gear Rising foreign
[Music]
combat now hear me out I'm not saying it's bad it's at least a whole lot better than Yakuza 3's combat if you
know you know by the way here's your daily tidbit my sources tell me the reason Yakuza 3's combat is so busted is
because its mechanics are based off the system they made for Yakuza kenzon kenzon like ishin is a Japanese
exclusive Yakuza game based in feudal Japan the problem is is that combat system was designed around the playable
character using a sword which is why enemies in Yakuza 3 feel like impenetrable fortresses that refuse to
light up their blog back to Yakuza Zero's combat it doesn't really have the depth that I hope a series that's like
10 games in at this point would have this is particularly apparent with the boss fights the optimal strategy is
usually just to get behind them and hope you can trap them in a combo before they super armor throw a roundhouse to the face or just find the move this
particular boss won't block Dodge and spam it well actually the real optimal
strategy is just to fill your inventory up with what are known in real life as a pharmaceutical energy drinks and you'll
never have to worry about getting a game over again alright it's time for a taste test
kind of tastes like like a really bad sweet Flintstones
vitamin if you know what that is like I said I'm not saying it's bad I'm
not saying this combat system is broken or unusable or boring but I'm just saying it's kinda weak and considering
the length of the game is nearly 30 hours and wait how long was Yakuza 5 again no that's a big game it kind of
makes sense why they were willing to turn this series into a turn based one now I'm gonna be up front I haven't
played Yakuza 7 so I can't say for sure whether or not that decision paid off for them but judging by the reception
I'd say it was pretty well accepted I mean hell the series was practically 40 RPG already the combat system was in a
really good place by kuami 2 it shows that the action style combat isn't broken by Design and I mean look at the
action combat judgment it's practically on a different level dudes doing Marvel combos with a few thoughtful tweaks they
prove that this combat system could have a lot more depth making it more engaging it's just a weird pocket time Dimension
situation where in between zero and kiwami 2 two games came out kiwami 1 and Yakuza 6. but kiwami 2 came out in Japan
the same year zero came out in English we were three games behind in the series but if you just squinted your eyes and
looked in the distance you can see how far it had already come you just had to wait for the English releases to play catch-up but complex gameplay has never
really been the Yakuza series selling point so while I think it's fair to criticize the combat for its lack of
depth there's one aspect of the combat that doesn't pull any punches where the focus has really been put the combat
variety I honestly don't even know where to begin with this first off both kiru and majima have three different fighting
styles each you can switch between during combat technically they have four but the last one is a special style you
have to go out of your way to get so let's not count those for now each of these Styles has completely different Combos and moves but more importantly
they each specialize in a certain thing like Kitty's brawler style is great for most straight up fights but the rush
style really lets you get in for them one-on-one combat encounters then you got the Beast style which specializes in
taking out big groups of enemies with weapons or blocking attacks by clenching your fists and yelling really loud I'm
down with it majima's Thug style is kinda similar to kiru's brawler but it specializes more into smart positioning
and disarming opponents with weapons than straight hand-to-hand fist fighting his Slugger style has him using a
baseball bat and I'm gonna tell you right now the screen pause when you do the light light heavy combo string is
satisfying especially when you can deck multiple people in one swing
foreign dancing style
like I said one of the best parts of Yakuza is the way it's able to introduce humor into its setting while playing the
major plot events extremely straightfaced and that's an example there are also a bunch of unlockable
moves you can grab in each style that add a certain Flair to the way you play this means the way you use each style
will change as the game goes on not significantly but at least enough to notice and don't tell me you've never
heard of the heat mechanic the Yakuza games are almost literally synonymous with this heat system
as you attack enemies you build up the resource called heat as you build it your attacks get faster and you get
access to different abilities but its main draw is that you can use a bunch of heat at one time to execute these
powerful finishing attacks it's great to pull these off in combat they're so well animated each hit feels heavy and
impactful and they do hella damage so you know they're useful in addition to being stylish now the thing is there are
a lot of heat actions in Yakuza zero like a lot like a lot a lot how many I'm
not sure exactly anecdotally I've heard there are over 100 and I've got no problem believing that someone in the
diu Gago toku Studio office probably has a folder with every single heat action animation in it but unless that gets
leaked there are just too many to count you've got different actions depending on the environment you're in different
actions depending on what you're holding picked up a portable stove you bet that's got a unique heat action
associated with it I mean even the salt shaker has its own unique heat action there is no bigger dopamine hit then
realizing the thing you're holding is gonna lead to you getting to see a rare heat action makes you want to point at
the screen and go wild the game also encourages you to mix up your heat actions if you use the same one over and
over it'll start to decrease in damage kinda like how moves go stale in Smash ultimate or something this is especially
apparent in longer fights like the boss encounters sure using the ground kick heat action guarantees some easy damage
but you've got about three uses tops before it starts being a waste to your precious resource [Music]
All About the Money
disposal the important part is that the game encourages you to explore these options by rewarding you during combat
you'll be awarded with these bonuses that'll give you an extra money boost money in Yakuza 0 is your experience by
the way aside from using it to pay for stuff you also spend it on upgrades to power up kitu and majima's fighting
styles when a battle ends you can press a button to check which bonuses you got as well as a list of other potential
bonuses you could have earned the cash difference isn't massive you usually don't get too much from random battles
anyways but it's a decent nudge to encourage you not to just Spam the optimal strategy to speedrun every
encounter speaking of money there's also a ton of stuff to do that isn't straight up fighting I mentioned it a bit before
but there's a lot of alternate ways you can earn cash in Yakuza zero you can gamble bet in the uh the the catfight
club and both ketu and majima have a story based minigame questline that'll Rack in a bunch of cash as well kiru
gets to run a real estate Empire where you go go out and buy property to improve and turn your investment into those sweet sweet noguchis majiva gets
to run a cabaret club which were starting to become popular around this era you'll have to build an elite team of hostesses and then manage them in
what is essentially an alcohol-based RCS kiru's minigame feels like an idol game where you just check in on it every now
and again but machimo's Cabaret Club quest line is genuinely really fun it's the kind of thing where you get access
to it sit through a long tutorial and go I do not care I wish to return to the regular gameplay please but then after
you decide to head back and try it just once or twice and then your steam count
Play Time suddenly looks like it's about to overtake the hundreds of hours you put into Team Fortress 2 in 2010 and all
of these systems and minigames reward you with money which makes sense in real life logic and game logic and since you
use money to level up it all ties back into your character progression you're picking up what I'm putting down yeah
everything you do ties back into character progression so you're not wasting time by engaging with these
these mini games you're earning meaningful rewards that you use to power up your main character just like you
would if you engage with the core gameplay the fighting you can absolutely break the economy and become Tokyo's
first trillionaire if you fully max out these mini games permanently eclipsing any money you could dream about earning from fighting but let's not worry about
that too much but you might be wondering something why is Yakuza 0 so obsessed
with money it seems like every single thing is based around money you can throw money into the streets to avoid
random battles you punch a guy and money just flies out of them at the end of every chapter you get a little bonus bit
of flavor text saying what the equivalent to the amount of money you earned is it's a bit jarring at first
none of the other games are like this why is Yakuza 0 suddenly the money game I mean it's kind on brand for a game
that's set in an underworld where cash is King and everything can be bought for the right price but there's something else I'll talk about it briefly but
disclaimer you might have noticed but I am not an economist I know next to nothing about economics I mostly know
about this from a historical perspective so if I get any details about how money Works wrong I mean roast me for it in
the comments but uh be gentle you know Yakuza zero takes place in the year 1988
which lines up with what was known in Japan as the bubble economy I'm not too big on the nitty-gritty of how this
stuff happens but basically asset land and stock value in Japan started to go way up people were buying more selling
more trading more stock the financial Market was more deregulated suddenly everyone was getting real Rich real fast
and it had a knock-on effect for the entire economy the country was importing more producing more and everyone was
getting in on their slice of the pie it's a stretch to say everyone was rich but take a look at this graph of the
stock index you'll see that especially in the 1980s things were booming I think a lot of people in Japan age 50 plus
have a bit of nostalgia for this era toshihiro nagoshi the director was born in 1965 which would make him 24 in 1989
basically the prime time to enjoy it that's hearsay by the way I didn't actually ask him if he had a good time
while the economy was booming I'm just assuming it makes sense that Yakuza 0 portrays a little bit exaggerated take
on this slice of modern Japanese history I'm sure to a lot of the staff making this game the time period it's set in is
almost Inseparable from their memories of the bubble era now this was a short-term boom I mean bubbles got a
burst it would only last until the early 90s eventually fizzling out and turning into what's known as The Lost decade a
period of 10 years starting in 1991 where the Japanese economy would basically stagnate but last decade maybe
we should change the name to lust forever because it's 2023 and it's showing no signs of ending haha wow
great Epic nice uh I don't know man let's talk about
something other than the general Global trend of the average person being priced out of the ability to exist
side quests yeah side quests one thing most people who have even a passing
Substories
knowledge of the Yakuza series are familiar with and where most of the wowie woohoo wacky game stuff comes from
is the sub stories which are basically this game's version of side quests they're all isolated short stories that
really let the game spread its wings and try out some new stuff both humorous and at times kinda dramatic but you know
what you're here for the sheer variety of different stories being told is intense I mean there's a hundred sub
stories in total there's something of everything in here stuff like kitty teaching a bunch of wannabe Yankees how
to be hood or how about that one where majima fights a bunch of dudes then accidentally helps invent consumption
tax the point of the side quest is basically the frog in the boiling water raise the temperature I.E attacks slowly
and eventually No One's Gonna notice when it keeps getting higher and higher what's funny is when majimas asked what
the theoretical maximum should be he says eight percent the number the Japanese sales tax was when the game was
out yeah now it's 10 with another hike expected soon so uh so much for that there's also the one where majima enters
a secret cult to save a woman's daughter practices then throws risks at the leader there's even non-combat ones like
when majima has to pretend to be this girl's boyfriend to get her dad to stop trying to set her up like I said there's
a lot of variety a lot of these sub stories do just boil down to pick the correct answer out of three options to
get the big reward and some aren't exactly what I'd call winners but you can tell the writers were really let
loose with these and I did mention how many references are stuffed inside this game didn't I well the Side Story is
kick it up to like one thousand like how about the side quest where you protect and I'm not joking Michael Jackson from
zombies referencing not only Thriller but Yakuza dead Souls at the same time or how about this side quest where you
meet a bunch of people lining up to buy Dragon Quest 3. I mean legally distinct Dragon Quest 3. it even references the
real-life urban legend that says that Square Enix was barred from ever releasing a Dragon Quest game on a weekday to avoid a massive loss of
productivity actually now that I'm researching it it turns out it's kind of half true the productivity thing is the
reason Dragon Quest games only come out on Saturdays but there wasn't any actual government interventions or laws passed
One Source says police complained and asked them to make it Saturday but it's only one source so great assault anyways
I could hold us both here hostage while I read out the synopsis of my favorite sub stories for a few solid days but the
takeaway is this don't skip them don't feel like you have to do all of them because uh I mean good luck and there
are some Duds in there there but give a few a chance and you'll find a few favorites of your own Graphics wise
Visuals & Music
Yakuza 0 looks really good like the character models in the cutscenes are really well detailed considering the
length of some of them you can really just kick back and feel like you're watching a crime drama at some points oh
hey what's that an asterisk I wonder what that's about that's a lot of asterisks yeah so if
you're putting two and two together with what I said about the Japanese release date you've probably already figured it out Yakuza zero is technically a PS3
game it might not have ever released on PS3 in English but it sure as hell did in Japanese some stuff in the game looks
uh kinda rough like NPC faces in the streets my man here didn't get much time
and attention I'll tell you that for free face pancake to save render allowance on Sony's aging 2006 Hardware
but in the same vein isn't it kind of crazy that this was a PS3 game like sure
NPCs look like their textures were made in Microsoft paints but you could never tell by looking at the cutscenes
featuring the main characters it makes it seem like basically magic you get some serious subtle facial expressions
in a lot of scenes My sakuga Moments is this one where nishiki's crying the same scene I mentioned before and I was just
staring at the detail in his eyes that's some big tier technology that I've already gone on enough about the
environments and how great that looks but there's some stuff that really benefits from a simple resolution bump
the Yakuza series would use a new engine starting with six that gave the visuals a pretty big boost but for a late PS3
Yakuza game zero looks pretty good one thing that is kind of weird though is that this game is like six different
styles of cutscenes okay that's kind of an exaggeration I counted and by that I
don't mean I counted I mean I'm looking at a wall right now trying to remember all of them and there's five different styles I think there's the movie style
cut scenes they look great love them cheer for joy every time they're on the screen Etc there's a text box cut scenes
that are more static and use a lot of canned animations I think the only downside to these is it involves a lot
of the characters awkwardly bobbing their head while they say they're lines like a late 2000s Machinima the dialogue
will show up at the bottom of the screen but the scenes will play out automatically like cut scenes there's dialogue box scenes where text will show
up on voice and you read through it and there's phone cut scenes where you get these little picture-in-picture boxes of the characters faces as they talk on the
phone you might say those last three were kind of the same thing and you might be right there's room to argue
there but there ain't no room to argue with our final cutscene style there are these weird static image cut scenes
where the characters faces will just uh twitch menacingly while their dialogue plays in the background it reminds me a
lot of some of those cutscenes from Bayonetta you know the ones it's kind of weird how they felt the need to invent a
whole new cutscene style like there's no advantage to this over a movie scene or dialogue box scene if you want it to
look better go for movie if you want to save budget go for dialog box but what's even weirder is that there's like four
maybe in the entire game like one for every five hours I don't know someone's probably counted them I often wonder
what they were trying to do here was it a deliberate creative choice or time constraints in the end we'll never know
now I talk about music a lot in my videos but I don't really talk too much about sound design that is unless I have
something to say see Tokyo announced Saka don't just look like they're real life counterparts they sound like it as
well yeah sure the audio quality of the ambient crowd noise could have been done a bit better but you can really close
your eyes and sink into the hustle and bustle of downtown Shinjuku actually keep them open we need the visual like
you're walking around and getting petitioned to go into an Izakaya or girls bar by some dude standing on the street that's just real life man
also there are these signs everywhere that say uh which means like no touting no barkering
but if you were to do like an 80 Speed Run of how fast you get petitioned to go
to a shady place in kabukicho you know you'd be set in world world records just
by walking down the street also um I don't know if I have to be like I hope I don't have to be the one to tell you this but if someone
petitions you to go to to go to their Shady soap land don't go like there's no gold at the end of that
rainbow I'm particularly fond of the name is coming out of the one store you hear
every time you pass by curious real estate office
also as far as voice acting goes the performances of the main characters are done really well the story really comes
alive through their voice acting the three dochima lieutenants are played by three real-life Japanese actors like
awano is Nikki Takeuchi who starred in Tokyo tribe and was also um immortan Joe from the Japanese dub of
Mad Max you know I just gotta say I love when I'm researching for these videos and come across this legit rare lore
like how else would I found something like that out in fact most characters in the Yakuza slash judgment series are
based off the people who play them nowadays with the exception of Kiryu and majima who have been there since the beginning that isn't an issue though
takayakuroda and hide narayugaki both put in great work especially ugaki flipping between calm and mad dog majima
there's no downside to having these actors voice characters especially when they can also voice act no I lied there
is a downside if you count stuff like the time the Judgment main character's voice actor got thando snaps from magazine covers because his agency
didn't feel like lending out his license anymore also I just wanted to mention real quick before I forget I really like
the way this game handles accents there's a bunch of write-ups on how the Yakuza localizers handle accents like
with majima he speaks in a heavy Kansai accent the cheap and easy way a lot of companies use to localize this kind of
thing is to do Kansai accent equals American South accent or something like that but Japanese accents don't really
work like English ones do so I really appreciate the team on the Yakuza series for going the extra mile you can tell
through the subtitles that majima speaks appreciably different from say Kiryu and it's not just basic stuff like making
him say y'all or something as I'm typing this I found a great snippet from a PC Gamer article by Yakuza localization
producer Scott stritchards stricharts I'm sorry if I'm pronouncing that wrong uh if you're watching I mean Mr Scott
pause the video and give it a read if you're into this kind of thing when a localization is done really well it just
Blends in your brain is like yeah this is all normal and that's the feeling I get when playing yuck is a zero nothing
feels awkward or out of place especially considering how like one thousand percent Japanese this game is you might
not expect a game like Yakuza to have banging music you also might not expect one of its songs where Curious things
about drowning life sorrows and whiskey to become known in the mainstream as a meme but you know we do be living in
current year while I'm not just talking about the karaoke here I do like the karaoke a lot I mean obviously I have
this running joke where I say if my video gets an unreasonable amount of likes I'll do a karaoke cover of X song
from the game I honestly just came up with it on a whim like two years ago I'd never intend to make any of those it's
just a throwaway gag I do get a lot of people in the comments asking me to make it a more reasonable Golem to actually
make one but that's not how the joke works I mean trust me I'm protecting you here you do not want to hear my singing
but okay how about this 10 mil likes and I'll do a baka mitai karaoke cover and
as a show good faith I'll stick a little present to the end of this video assuming it doesn't get me demonetized
in which case love edited this part out anyways maybe if I remember but let's forget about karaoke for a sec Yakuza
Zero's action is punctuated by some really Hype music I mean when you look at the composer and see he's got stuff
like f-zero GX on his resume say no more there's a lot of tracks I like but I'll
just say this pledge of demon is the hottest track don't at me saying
otherwise I will not reply the kooze pop off the one in the sewer you know the one if that doesn't get you pumped up to
absolutely Go full live leak on this greasy gangster I'm not exactly sure what will
foreign
speaking of music that gets you pumped up to fight the music dynamically changes depending on which battle style you're using in combat like for example
Kyrie's brawler Combat music sounds different from his Rush one I uh I can't
believe I never noticed that in my first playthrough back in 2017. either that or I forgot it but that doesn't sound like
something I would do out here
[Music]
wait but enough about the music I've mentioned one thing about the Yakuza series a few times that may have you
Characters & Motivation
raising a few eyebrows how can a game or one of the protagonists hits up the Disco and races mini cars while the
other sings karaoke with one of his staff completely switched gears and hit you with a dramatic moment that'll make you feel like there's a rock in your
stomach and more importantly how does that even work tonal Whiplash is a big
buzzword that floats around media both now and back in the day how can Uncharted man take out half the
population of South America and still be cracking Marvel movie clips every 10 seconds Etc I think first of all the
Yakuza series characterizes Kiryu and majimo through the gameplay pretty well while the series may feel like it gives
you less freedom than other open world games it's very careful to only allow you to do things that kitu and majima
would actually do you can't just Brawl random civilians you fight people who instigate I mean there's a ton of plot
points about how doing things like that would draw unnecessary attention to the clan there's always a sense that the the
actions you can take as these characters are consistent with their writing but the more important point is how are you
meant to know what these characters would do how are you supposed to know exactly who these characters are Yakuza
0 was likely a big point to reflection for the rgg studio it was around the 10-year anniversary of the series that
this game came out it was a chance to see how far the series had come and with a setting that's 20 years removed from
the rest of the games a chance to do a little Reinventing a lot of series suffer from what I'm gonna call the
bigger better mentality where this desire to make every sequel bigger and more bombastic than the last ends up
bloating the core experience you can probably think up a few examples of this hell even Yakuza was a victim of this I
cracked a joke earlier about it but Yakuza 5 having 5 playable characters in five different cities led to a lot of
the great bits of that game getting buried under the weight compare that to Zero's two characters in Two Cities I
mean the Haruka sections in Yakuza 5 are basically the equivalent to getting clotheslined in terms of pacing yuck is
a zero was a chance to reel the series back in a bit to refocus The Narrative on a few core main characters I've
already told you that the Kiryu and majima in this game are a bit different from their later versions in the series and Yakuza 0 is a journey to see how
they become those people Yakuza 0 is a chance to see what events shape them into the people we would spend time with
in Yakuza 1 2 3 Etc while this next point is true for every Yakuza game in
Yakuza zero you get to spend a lot of time just existing as these characters outside of the main plot in most games
you don't really need to know mundane stuff about your character like their favorite food or what they think about
certain things but in Yakuza you sure do get to know it you develop an intimate knowledge of these characters but more
importantly you get insight into what drives them what their moral compass is when awful things happen to them it hits
all the harder because you were just doing some goofy Side Story where you learned the key to brawling from serious
Caucasian or something and more more importantly you learn how these characters personal morals clash with
Yakuza 0's villains now I don't think I need to tell you that morals and
organized crime aren't usually two words you'll find in the same sentence I
think because the game speedruns finding an excuse for Kiryu to get kicked out of the Yakuza in some way shape or form everything majima and kiru knew all the
rules they believed in are suddenly ripped out right in front of them and this game being the beginning of their
stories we get to see how they would form their own rules their own morals their own sense of justice you don't
just want to square up with Alano because he's your Nemesis you want to because his morals and ideals are at
fundamental opposition with yours you don't just want a hammerfist cousay over the Dome because he's a slimy Dirtbag in
this game's version of the pursuer from Dark Souls 2. it's because he's a slimy Dirtbag who will do anything necessary
to get what he wants and you ain't about to agree with that the antagonists in this game are playing by their own rules
operating on their own Compass which means fights in the Yakuza series are less about two Burly shirtless men
throwing wrists at each other and more like two ideals punching each other in the face until only one is left standing
I mean that's the best reason I can come up with as to why when you beat one of these dudes with zero morals up they
don't just whip out a gun and be like LOL you didn't win though so I guess with all that out of the way it's time
to talk about the final plot events do a bit more character analysis and discuss how the game sticks its Landing spoilers
are gonna flow like water from here so if you're planning to play the game for yourself which you definitely should if you haven't by the way skip to this time
stamp to avoid them okay that's long enough so it's no
Story Spoilers
secret that this game is an absolutely intricate web of alliances betrayals and plot twists there's so much here it's
gonna be hard to concisely summarize it in a way that won't just be going and then this happened and then this
happened and then this happened but I'll try my best so majimo is protecting Makoto with Lee the massive man from her
office but she was captured by Sarah the leader of the enigmatic Nico Consortium a sort of Black Ops faction in the Tojo
Clan Saga forces majima to come with him to get her back and when Ceda confronts majima he reveals surprise he's an ally
and he's been working with tachibana to get Makoto to Tokyo but then out of nowhere sagawa shows up and popsetta in
the chest and they both pick up the business card of set as contact forces majima at gunpoint to go to Tokyo
with him and we can see how much majima's proverbial chains are starting to wear on him the sagawa majima
interaction is some of the best stuff in the game there's a few scenes where majima has to lie to him and the tension
during them is absolutely palpable so by this point you might be wondering what is with everyone's obsession over
makotomakimura it turns out that empty lot that everyone's gunning for that 10 meter Square patch of dirt everyone's
killing each other over she's the owner and she doesn't know it it was her grandfather's and when he died it passed
on to her so now everyone's gunning for her to get their hands on it we see a few hours earlier Oda tachibana's right
hand man came with kiriu to Osaka to find makotol they pick her up and are driving home when shibusawa rolls up an
entire hit squad Army on them and kitty who fights them all off with a pistol
One pistol again I'd like to remind you that Kazama H kittyu has never
canonically killed a man I'm just gonna pretend this whole car chase scene happens in the cutscene dimension
the three stop at a construction site when Oda plays his hand he knows who Makoto is and he knows if tachibana
finds out he'll never forgive him two years ago Oda was the man with the bat tattoo that kidnapped Makoto and made
her go blind you see Makoto and tachibano were actually born in China to a Japanese mother and the big twist is
is that their brother and sister tachibana was a rough youth who came to Japan to escape discrimination
apparently he was so Godlike at fighting Oda vowed a lifelong oath to him and they formed a gang look this is just how
it works in the Yakuza verse don't question it Makoto came a few years later as a child of a War Orphan and
moved in with her Japanese grandfather she moved to Osaka in search of tachibana and that's where Oda captured
her but at the time he didn't know she was touchibana's sister that is until tachibana and Oda were watching TV and
touch about to recognized her putting two and two together Oda realized tachibano would never forgive him for
what he'd done if Makoto told him so he tried to kill kiru and Makoto on the spot before Makoto stabs him and he's
overpowered by Kiryu with Shibu salah's crew closing in on them Oda knows he won't be able to escape so he uses his
gun to buy them time yeah nice try Yakuza zero but you ain't exactly redeeming a human trafficker that easy
Otis confronted by shibusawa himself who reveals that Oda had been on his payroll the whole time that's how the dojima
family knew every step tachimano was gonna take Oda was filling them in on it back in Tokyo Kiryu takes Makoto to a
safe place the uh Park full of homeless people of course and then as a rendezvous with tachibana there's a
really emotional moment where tachiban is unsure if he should even meet his sister how by abandoning her in China he
knows he basically ruined her life and he's done a lot of things he's not proud of since then but at the same time
that's what all of this has been for to meet his sister again and there's you
know the whole lot that's worth a bajillion dollars thing but also to meet a sister but before he can meet her
Kitty gets shot and tachibana is captured by the dojima family who are trying to interrogate him to find Makoto's location you can feel how close
these two are getting at this point they're in the same city just a short walk from each other you feel the
tension how they're so close yet so far the tension builds when Kitty runs into
Nishiki for the first time since a standoff in the woods and nishki being nishki the man who would do anything to
reach the top throws everything away to back up his bro this is why I love Yakuza 0. we know
who nishki is what he becomes I mean sorry to spoil like the first 30 minutes of Yakuza one a 20 year old game but
Nishiki is the main antagonist before Yakuza zero we only knew one side of Nishiki a man we were told was once
kiru's best friend but we only got to see as a power hungry villain well right
here right now the game is showing us the relationship these two had sure there are things like Kiryu telling him
to do whatever it takes to reach the top where you can see the beginnings of his mentality start to form but we get to
see the genuine friendship these two shared we're given so much more context it basically adds another dimension to
Yakuza one if he were to go play it after zero is what I mean when I say Yakuza zero is like the playtonic ideal
of what a prequel should be back to the game everything comes to a head when Kiryu finds out where the dojima family
has been keeping tachibana and he's pretty much dead kinyu knocks out everyone in the room before swearing
revenge on the entire Tojo Clan and bringing tachibana out Makoto finally gets to meet her brother the event the
entire story has been building up to but he's already gone and she runs away meanwhile majima and sagawa meet with
Shimano who reveals he's 4D chests to the whole situation from the beginning he ordered majima to kill Makoto because
he knew he couldn't do it he knew he'd try to help her and gain her trust that's when majima would deliver her to
Shimano and he'd use the power and influence to betray the Tojo Clan and get crowned King by the Omi Alliance
dudes he's making Shady deals with or something also I love how they characterize shimano's characters so
quickly in this single 10 second scene it perfectly encompasses the kind of person he is Yakuza 0 is great at this
the way he eats this Fugu Sashimi you know puffer fish like from that one episode of The Simpsons the stuff that
poisons you if it's not prepared correctly so it has to be painstakingly cut piece by piece leading to its high price
we have reason to believe you have eaten poison what should I do what should I do tell
me quick the stuff you're supposed to delicately enjoy one piece at a time you know like the luxury food item it is he
just shovels 10 pieces in at once you he's a glutton he gets what he wants expensive food who gives a he'll
eat it like McDonald's fries the visual storytelling is so good in this game majima getting more and more frustrated
with the situation finds Makoto and she's starting to regain her sight but she can still only see silhouettes she's
reasonably pretty messed up after that stuff with her brother and once revenge on the dojima family the majima Makoto
relationship is a complex one you might not see it at first but these two have basically been through the same events
captured tortured used and thrown out held on a leash so other people can
extract what they want out of them their bond changes from Hitman and Target to allies majima tries to convince her that
Revenge isn't what tachibana would have wanted her to do but she goes through with it which leads her to getting captured to which dojima reveals this
cool legal loophole where turns out if you kill the person who owns a piece of land you can just own it no problem
because I mean the owner isn't going to come looking for it right apparently uh
I I barely know economics can someone tell me if that's how legal works as a
side note while makuto and majima's relationship is a strong part of the narrative I wish the game treated her
character a bit less like an objective in a 4v4 capture the flag on blood golf the one time the game does allow its
lead female character to have any agency at all it just rubs her nose in it by virtue of how bad of an idea it was
everyone is after jojima at this point since the influence and power he would gain if he secured the empty lot would
pretty much upend the entire Tojo Clan Kazama for seeing this laid all the pieces in place tachibana the nikhil
Consortium all to keep the empty lot out of dojima's hands it's kind of weird how this game portrays Kazuma like a savant
tactician God who orchestrated all this from behind bars but he hasn't been in the main series for a while so I get
they wanted to give him a big role Makoto survives dojima's assassination attempt and she's taken to a boat owned
by Sarah who's alive by the way to recover which unfortunately shibusawa is well aware of shibusawa seemed like the
most reasonable of dojima's three lieutenants he was calm collected he was the only one willing to hear kiru out in
the beginning when he said he didn't commit the murder but it turns out he's the most ruthless of the three he's
cruel and power hungry it's an all-out war between the nikkyo Consortium and the dojima family at this point and
kitty was caught in the middle as he tries to protect Makoto on the other side majima heads into of the dojima
office he wants to take dodgym out to ensure no one ever goes after Makoto again this dungeon is cool because it's
the exact same one Kiryu went through in the beginning of the game majima's retracing his steps you get to where
Kiryu fought kuze in Chapter 2 in the dungeon ended but then you keep going you're going past where you could before
it's a good way of making you reflect on everything you've done so far making you think about how far you've come majima
takes everyone out when Sarah shows up and says with everything they got on dojima they can prevent him from ever
getting a sniff of power again back on the boat Kiryu finds Makoto but she's being held by shibusawa this is it the
final encounter and believe you me there was no bigger pop-off than when Shibu
Sauer rips off his coat and reveals that he also has a dragon tattoo a major theme in the Yakuza Series has been The
Duel of the dragons for example Yakuza 2. I mean kiriu is the legendary dragon
of dojimon in the later games after all this scene is basically saying if kitty wants his title he's gonna have to take
it unfortunately shibusawa is no match for kiru in his 10 liter sippy cup of 1980s
Japanese red bulls so he squashes his Ambitions right then and there so everything seems to have gone well after
the dust settles kiru decides to go back to the Yakuza and starts wearing his iconic white suit and red shirt majima
tells Shimano that he won't be delivering Makoto to him to which Shimano goes well that sucks and Pops a
zombie Alliance contact in the head to bury his involvement majima having been manipulated for basically the past 30
hours and being told it's because honest guys like him are easy to manipulate adopts the Mad Dog personality but
majima's ending is a really melancholic one and it's not an exaggeration to say that his character in its 10 years of
existence prior to this had never been in a situation as emotionally challenging as this one he meets Makoto
again when she's being harassed by two Yakuza he one shots them into the dirt but he realizes he can't speak to her
she's never seen what he looks like but she knows his voice and he knows he
can't let her see who he really is they live in two different worlds the most he can do is tell someone else who
genuinely cares about her to treat her as best they can and then he walks off this scene is powerful and it's
extremely sad this is a part of majima that he had to throw away if you had
said before Yakuza zero that Kono majima was a man you could tell a romance story about and did not only be believable but
also hard-hitting I don't know who would have believed you I don't think I would have believed you and as majima
disappears into the crowd blending in with the other faces we know that these two will never see each other again
sort of Yakuza kiwami 2 has an extra side story about it but there is one

Transcription:
It was a dark time for Sega.
They were once popular in America after the success of the Genesis.
But elsewhere, their consoles  couldn‚Äôt compete with Nintendo.
They tried new things to secure their spot at the top, but to no avail.
And after the failure of the Dreamcast, they  switched to being a 3rd party developer.
They found some success in a few releases,  
such as Super Monkey Ball and rereleasing  Sonic games, but they needed something more.
They needed the next big thing.
They didn‚Äôt know what that could possibly be.
That is, until one of the higher-ups,  Toshihiro Nagoshi, had an idea.
It was when he and his team  were out drinking in Kabukicho,
an entertainment district in  Tokyo, when someone said to him,  
‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt it be cool if you could  explore this town in a game?‚Äù
And thus, inspiration was struck. The idea was simple: live the life  
of a yakuza and roam around  a city similar to Kabukicho.
He presented his idea to his higher-ups,  and was immediately rejected.
Violence against humans was still  not a norm for video games in Japan,
and the target demographic, being young males,  
not only wasn‚Äôt broad enough but  was also new territory for Sega
as their main demographic before was kids.
Nagoshi would try again and again,  and was rejected every time.
He said, quote,
‚ÄúIf it all goes wrong I'll get down on  my hands and knees or whatever you want,  
I'll take responsibility for  it all, so just let me do it.‚Äù
But still, they wouldn‚Äôt budge. All hope seemed lost, until one man,
Masayoshi Kikuchi, who worked  on games like Panzer Dragoon,  
took a look at the proposal and  said that it looked interesting.
There was hope. 
Nagoshi would use this intrigue  as leverage when attempting
to convince the higher-ups to greenlight the game.
Joe: So have you ever done DMT?
Kikuchi eventually joined Nagoshi‚Äôs team.
He would make suggestions to give the game more depth, like adding Haruka.
Slowly but surely, they gained the  support of more and more people
and the higher ups would start to budge.
But there were still concerns
such as how the game would sell overseas.
To which Nagoshi responded, ‚Äúmeh, who cares?‚Äù
Ok.
Sony didn‚Äôt like the violence against  humans, and thought that the game would be
best suited as a PC game instead of a PS2 game.
But this was before pc gaming was popular in Japan
so Nagoshi insisted that it had to  be on PS2, or else it would fail. 
Eventually, they relented,  and the project was greenlit.
At first, it was estimated that it  would require a budget of 1 billion yen.
The final budget was 2.4 billion yen.
It was teased in August of 2005 as  ‚ÄúProject J.‚Äù They put way more effort  
in to the marketing than any other game Sega made.
There were advertisements on  TV, in magazines, newspapers
they made 100,000 demo discs and had demo booths set up at the Tokyo Game Show of that year.
And in December, it would launch  in Japan to commercial success. 
There was a lot for people to  enjoy, including intense combat
a heartfelt story, and a world rich with detail.
It included real life things, like Don  Quijote, a real life discount store in Japan
and Boss Coffee.
Guess what that is.
It gained a fanbase pretty  quickly, with a fan movie 
being made soon after the game's release.
The game would also launch almost a year later  everywhere else to an overwhelming‚Ä¶.
meh.
It had an english dub that was‚Ä¶ weird.
Kiryu: How many time I gotta tell you? I'm not yakuza.
Kiryu: You r*tarded or just deaf?
Yuya: F*ck you!
They did had Luke Skywalker himself voice Majima
but this couldn't help the other negative aspects,  
like it having too many things that only someone  from Japan could understand.
Whats an oyabun? Or an Aniki?
Or a cafe?
That's definitely a Japan only thing.
And the camera is‚Ä¶
What‚Äôs the word?
Oh, right.
But despite this, Sega  knew they had something special.
After all, this game saved Sega from being defunct.
So they began work on the next game. 
2 months after the game's launch in Japan, the  higher-ups at Sega told Nagoshi
‚Äúhey, this made us a lot of money. Make another one and release it by  the end of the year.‚Äù
Nagoshi: HUH?!
So, they were to launch a  sequel that was 1 and a half times
bigger than the original in only 10 months.
It helped that they carried over some assets from the previous game,  
such as the city of Kamurocho and the models for  the characters like Kiryu and Majima,
but there was still a ton of work to be done.
They had to  make a new story, 2 new cities, new substories,  
new music, and more only in 10 months.
The odds were severely stacked against them. 
And yet somehow, they pulled it off.
Yakuza 2 sold almost 300,000 units in a week.
It would launch in the west almost 2 years later,  and would once again be met with meh results.  
It got rid of the stupid english dub in  exchange for keeping the Japanese dub
but would only sell 40,000 copies outside of Japan.
These games would eventually lead to the studio  
who made the games to be called ‚ÄúRyu Ga Gotoku‚Äù  studios, after the name of the game in Japan. 
The studio would go on to make 5 more Yakuza games,  7 spinoff games, 3 remakes, 2 Monkey Ball games,  
a mobile game (apparently), and a Fist of the  North Star game that everyone ignores because it‚Äôs bad.
The head of the studio, Nagoshi,  would depart from the studio in 2021 to form  
his own studio called Nagoshi Studios, which is a  subsidary of a Chinese company called Netease.  
But what he left behind was an excellent library of  games, many of which are the peak of their genre.  
Not the Monkey Ball games, though.

Notes:

Transcription:

autumn when you search the quotation there are
no ugly women only lazy ones you'll find a surprising variety of potential sources people like Coco Chanel Carl
lerf Helena Rubenstein Etc but it almost doesn't matter who might have said this
or when it was said because it's a belief that is not only woven into the society we live in at every level but is
an idea currently upholding several massively profitable economic systems by keeping all of us especially women on a
permanent hamster wheel of aesthetic inadequacy that said The more accurate framing today might be there are no ugly
people only poor ones because we've increasingly made Beauty both something you can purchase down to the surgical
level and something that's always expanding ever upward into algorithmic unattainability now we've touched on
aspects of this topic before because to be clear you're not ugly you're just broke or just poor has been a pretty
common cultural theme for the past few years we've talked talked about it on my YouTube channel on our podcast too good
to be true and we'll highlight some of our past discussions but I want to do a deeper dive into this phenomenon as it's
currently shaping Our Lives because as we'll talk about it's not just about how you look it's not just about wearing
designer labels or having a symmetrically perfect Instagram face it's all of the things big and small
that subtly shape how we are perceived in the world and what the impacts of that perception are especially with
almost everyone being so visible through the prism of social media appearance has almost never mattered more and wherever
there's an invented need there will always be a profitable solution and thank you to betterment for sponsoring
Ad break

this video's description to sign up in minutes fure sure you will be proud now before I start this video I want to put
my own cards on the table this can be a difficult topic to discuss because
basically it all boils down to that Meme of like a peasant that's like I think Society should improve somewhat and the
person is like oh and yet you participate in society how funny um or like you're critiquing capitalism but
you have an iPhone it's like very much that energy so like I'm a woman I appear on 4k camera every God damn day I all
the time have jump scares on my own home television because one of my videos will pop up on the giant screen and I'll be
like H not me confronted with the reality of my own being in my own damn
house anyway point being I'm on camera all the time um I'm definitely more confronted with my physical appearance
than I think the average person is um and perhaps as a result or chicken or an egg scenario like I participate in a lot
of beauty standards like I wear makeup I style my hair I dress in a way that is I
don't know I I could be theoretically just like walking around in like a promotional t-shirt and sweatpants all
day if I wanted to like there are definitely beauty standards I engage with I've gotten things like lasers I've
had M Botox I've gone through all kinds of skin treatments and still have scarring from cystic acne I had braces
very late in teenagerhood but still I had them and even though I wasn't very good about wearing my retainer that's still a beauty enhancement that I
benefited from point being is that we're going to discuss a lot of stuff in here and the idea is never that there is an
inherently right or wrong way way to engage with this stuff or a limit to what's acceptable to altering or
improving your appearance this is meant to be a reality check for the upside down World we've sort of found ourselves
in when it comes to our beauty standards especially as they're enhanced by social media and to expose the fact that for as
much as it's a meme you're not ugly you're just poor is pretty damn accurate but anyway now I want to make the caveat
at the beginning of this video that our beauty standards are heavily shaped by things like racial bias they vary
enormously cult C to culture and Country to Country and in order to make this video not 17 hours long we are going to
be pretty exclusively focusing on American beauty standards which as many of us know already tend to skew
extremely white preferential and gender normative and are generally one very specific iteration of what beauty is
supposed to look like I would be very curious in the comments if people want to share some of the more oppressive Beauty Norms from their own cultures but
one thing that doesn't generally change both through time and through culture is that how you look how you present
yourself how your body and face are made up have a huge impact on both your
economic and class positions and can also have devastating effects on your earning potential we'll get into that
later basically even if we don't want to admit it Beauty still matters enormously we're still a very shallow species in a
lot of ways but what has changed is the absolute ubiquity of consumer-based solutions to the problem that you were
not born looking like a Kardashian Jenner even though for that matter neither were they technology and
capitalism have combined to make things like cosmetic procedures more accessible than they've ever been which in some
ways as we'll get into means more dangerous than they've ever been and younger Generations especially are seeing this quest for physical
Perfection as more and more normal and even necessary starting at a shockingly young age there was a recent article in
the Daily Mail of all places breaking down why jenzi is actually aging differently than Millennials and part of that is due to the premature and
unnecessary use of cosmetic treatments like filler or Botox as well as using intensive skin care that isn't
calibrated to their actual skin and it's not particularly shocking that gen Z would be more impacted by this stuff as
Not only was it more accessible for them but they also grew up looking at themselves through a filtered reflection spoiler alert your skin doesn't look
like that and with cosmetic procedures the chasm between aging unpro which is
honestly one of my least favorite Expressions because let's be clear your outer appearance has nothing to do with how good of a person you are no matter
what Disney told you and aging poorly is often just a question of the kind of work someone can afford we typically
only notice when something goes wrong and the real economic divide is increasingly between people who can
afford to Gaslight about beauty versus people who have to wear their changes on their face and few people have put that
better than my friend Ryan on our show too good to be true in the episode all about cheap cosmetic tourism when you're
presented with a healthc care industry that doesn't care about you and an uh uh
extremely predatory and if anything sort of deceptive
industry that is targeting such specific insecurities and you're so driven to fix
this problem at any cost you you you start looking at other options and some of those options are
are hey this place does Discount filler it's a med spa this person's a traine maybe I'll just get lip injections to
going overseas to Turkey going to Mexico going to Thailand where you will pay for a flight a hotel food and cosmetic
surgery as one part of a giant essentially vacation package you're staying at a resort or you can go even
cheaper if you really want to go really cheap and you can drive to Tijana get
your filler at a pharmacy and drive home same day and it is a very popular option
essentially we live in an era of false accessibility when it comes to Beauty yes there are solutions everywhere we
look but many of them are economically Out Of Reach and the affordable ones can often make us very sick and even if we
were all able to get every procedure we wanted from braces to facelifts and yes there's a whole section on teeth in here
the beauty standards we're seeing driven by social media are becoming so Out Of Reach that even if you were able to
achieve it yesterday you probably won't achieve tomorrow's [Music]
look [Music]

[Music]
chapter 1 a brief history of rich people beauty now it's important to note where
A brief history of rich people beauty
we come from in terms of the beauty standards we're trying to achieve because although we live in a bit of a
dystopian Beauty era right now it is not to say that this is the first time that beauty standards have been placed on
people and associated with their economic class but it is important to note that what is considered beautiful or aspirational changes greatly
throughout history standards of beauty e and flow and prior to the 20th century Fuller Figures were considered beautiful
which was then overtaken by the expectation of time waistlines and the beginning of eating disorder culture in
the mid 20th century which later gave way to the ultra thin heroin Chic models of the '90s something that's seeing a
bit of a Resurgence lately but we'll get into weight stuff later and with the Advent of the internet what's considered aspirational changes even more often one
year we're infatuated with the curvy backsides that inspired a booming BBL industry and the next we see every other
celebrity losing a ton of weight on OIC and there is no longer just one ideal body type as our intro Montage alluded
to there are essentially endless flavors of ideal beauty in terms of body type that often today falls into the trifecta
of the thin ideal the fit ideal and the slim thick ideal sea girls we have options from an article in the
independent quote mainstream media has made strides toward body diversity and advertising and this may seem like a
positive shift away from idealized beauty standards but according to a study from York University in Toronto
it's creating an even more harmful one there's many discrepancies as to what constitutes a curvy body but the
majority of the time these mainstream images only depict the type of plus-size body that feels acceptable to them you
can have a big butt and big thighs but your stomach and your face must be slim and we'll talk more about the BBL in a
later chapter and no matter which Beauty standard we're subscribing to on a given day so much of what we perceive as the
ideal body is not even possible for a lot of people without significant cosmetic or surgical interference to
talk more about what it takes to achieve the body ideals we see among celebrities influencers and others who can afford it
we spoke with Dana Omari Harold who breaks down celebrity cosmetic work under her Instagram handle IG famous By
Dana people seem to think that you can get surgical results by working out or
dieting or losing weight and people think that what you get from working out
dieting losing weight is the same as surgical results they are completely they there's very little overlap with
what you can do with surgery and what you can do with the gym the best results you need both right depending on what
you're you're going for but there is this idea that why don't you just lose
weight why don't you just work out in the gym then you won't have to have surgery you can grow your butt you can
make your wayist smaller you can have zero fat on your stomach but a huge fat butt like you can do that if you just go
to the gym but no one thinks that about things like breasts you know no one goes
why don't you just get into the gym and then you would just grow breasts why don't you just uh work out and your nose
will get smaller you know at least they're not that completely unaware of
what surgery can do and what you know gym and lifestyle can do so I think that there is a shaming thing around things
that they believe can be taken care of quote naturally instead of going to have
surgery and until we get over that or until people realize that these these two things are are very different they
work together but they are very different results I don't think we're going to be able to have that
conversation of you you can't just work your way work out to where you suddenly
become you know a coke bottle it's just not going to happen and to hear a personal narrative
of dealing with body image issues and restrictive dieting including getting and then later regretting plastic
surgery we spoke with Autumn a 28-year-old living in New York City if this is a sensitive topic for you you
may want to skip ahead a bit my like history was very much around like restriction very much around like
counting every single calorie every weighing every single gram of food that was kind of how I had lived for the
better part of 15 years I would say and then the pandemic hit and I was still
living at home at the time and was just it was harder and harder to be able to strict restrict as severely as I had
been because everything had been blown out of the water all of that stuff and so at that time I um went from major
major restriction to like it had gotten to the point where it was no longer sustainable my like Primal urge for
needing to fuel my body surely took over and I at that point then like binge
eating disorder developed for me um and I let's see I i' I veered kind of from
like super super restriction to that to then like um seeing some various like
YouTube videos um and Instagram posts around like like Fitness culture around
like tracking like protein and fiber and kind of all of that stuff and like hitting goals in the gym and stuff like
that so on its face like more of a healthy way to live I guess because you
know it's like it's not around like extreme restriction it's not around like trying to be as thin as possible it's
then kind of morphed into this like muscle building and like lean aesthetic and all of that
stuff um so I guess for me it morphed from like wanting to be as thin as
possible to then seeing this like Fit Girl aesthetic as the new ideal and with that comes the like restriction
different than how it previously had been but very much like around protein and kind of hitting one gram of protein
per like pound of body weight and stuff like that so I a different type of restriction I guess but even as these
Beauty and body standards shift what doesn't change is how much our ideals are tied to the ruling class this
article from dazed Beauty sums up the relationship between beauty standards and wealth quite nicely quote throughout
history the beauty standard of Any Given period has served the ideological interests of the ruling class during the
Renaissance plump pale skin was a prize signifier of high social status while Sund darken skin became synonymous with
lower classes laboring outside today however that same tanned complexion is desirable coming as it has in the west
to indicate Leisure Time holidaying abroad and the luxury of disposable income and it should be noted that just
like wealth and class itself which we talk about greatly in last month's video essay which I'll link in the description
this ideal of what ruling class Beauty looks like is heavily impacted by things like race colonialism Etc in the west
and here in America in particular our ruling classes have historically been overwhelmingly white and therefore when
you talk about beauty standards that aspire to imitate a higher Social class it's almost impossible to do that
without aspiring to the race that most makes up that social class and even at a world scale beauty standards have often
been tied to whiteness thanks to worldwide colonization from majority white Western countries and this is even
continued into the modern era quote there's a reason that many people still think of an All-American Beauty as a
thin blonde blue-eyed white woman it wasn't until 1940 that the rules were changed to allow women of color to enter
the Miss America Pageant before that the official rules stated that the contants had to be of good health and of the
white race when you look around the world at trends like skin lightning and reshaping features to appear more
Western you can often Trace them back to either white ruling classes that had a direct Colonial presence in those
cultures or made themselves ubiquitous through things like for example America's hundred-year media dominance
it's important to remember that one of America's biggest exports in sort of unquantifiable terms is our implicit
beauty standards through all of the media we are constantly exporting we talked in our video essay about romcoms
about the overwhelming whiteness of the genre which to be clear is a problem in basically every movie genre in America
but it's worth noting that that implicit whiteness and in the case of romcoms the implication that only white people
deserve to fall in love doesn't just impact our own country our pop culture industry is exported throughout the
world and those subtle and not so subtle racial Norms that are constantly being reinforced are exported along with it
and beauty traits that are commonly associated with non-white races become Trends lip filler for instance has been
overwhelmingly popularized by celebrities and influencers like Kylie Jenner even though black women have long
been bullied or ostracized for having naturally Fuller lips rich people can absorb and even make trendy various
traits and trends that people from other classes or races are scorned for but we'll get into that a little bit more
later the point is what is considered beautiful has almost always been tied with what is considered rich and on the
flip side what is considered poor chapter 2 teeth hair and the
Teeth, hair and the aesthetics of poverty
Aesthetics of poverty so while wealth absolutely has a
look so does poverty even if as we discussed some of that look can be absorbed and recycled and made Chic by
rich people opting into it this is especially common with things like fashion but I'll let my former self from
a recent Members Only video on rich people cosplaying poverty explain this in a little more detail a wealthy person
in some ways identifying with or even cosplaying as a person of lower classes
could potentially be a good thing if that led to things like structural solidarity or advocacy for materially
improved conditions or better tax policies or a more solid social safety net or literally anything that would
benefit the poor in middle classes but more often than not we often see the wealthy especially wealthy creatives
adopting poverty or middle class them as an aesthetic or as a shorthand to seem
more authentic and relatable than they actually are but many of the symbols of poverty aren't just the rip jeans that a
cool college kid can take on or off with Trends in fact the results of wealth are so baked into our appearance that people
can actually tell who has money just by looking at their faces from a CNBC article on a study on the topic quote
Bjorn's daughter and her co-author psychology Professor Nicholas o rule had undergraduate subjects of various
ethnicities look at grayscale photographs of 80 white males and 80 white females none showed any tattoos or
piercings half of the photos were people who made over $150,000 a year which they designated as upper class and the other
half were people who made under $35,000 or working class when the subjects were asked to guess the class of the people
in the photos they did so correctly 68% of the time significantly higher than random chance and even on a very
structural level the health and quality of our various organs and features
especially when you consider things like generational wealth and as we've discussed in previous videos the
majority of wealth in this country was to some extent born wealthy generations
of things like having great access to nutrition and health care and physical
activity and education on maintaining our health and appearance and all of these other factors can lead to physical
outcomes that quite literally show on our faces but when it comes to physical traits that can almost instantly Mark
the difference between a wealthier and a poorer person few are more clockable than teeth and hair on the teeth side
good dental let alone Orthodontic Care is very much a luxury in this country and making it out of adolescence with
straight white healthy teeth is something only afforded to a certain socioeconomic bracket and social media
has provided a stark look into the consequences of not growing up with the privilege of good teeth some of you guys
may have seen this woman who went viral on Tik Tok recently talking about some of the dental and orthodontic struggles
that she's been through I'm posting it because I know there's other people out in the world who struggle with the same
thing I do now of course thanks to the power of social media in her case she actually was able to secure treatment
for her dental issues but going viral on Tik Tok as a solution to health problems is as I think we all know by now
basically like playing the lottery at scale millions of Americans are living with horrendous dental and orthodontic
issues and especially given the way our insurance system is set up completely unable to treat them if they don't
happen to go viral for their story dental insurance is often not included in Med medical insurance or covered by
Employers in fact we've linked an entire article about how insane the entire system of dental insurance is in our
country even by our own insane Insurance standards and as a result teeth in particular are something of an economic
Battleground according to a Washington Post report due to the quote humiliating divide in basic Dental Care quote nearly
one in five Americans older than 65 do not have a single real tooth left and the inability of these lower income
patients to get any actual lasting treat treatment for their Dental issues has resulted in a situation where many of
them are put on cycles of antibiotics and you guessed it opioids to maintain
and deal with the pain and as we'll get into a bit later in the video the consequences for looking poor or not be
aesthetically pleasing according to our standards which in America include very white very straight teeth can be huge
people can be afraid to go to job interviews because they know when they open their mouth they will be revealing their socioeconomic class people will be
considered less qualified because they didn't grow up with parents who could afford to get them braces now similar to
teeth for reasons both racial and socioeconomic although as we've discussed those are often one and the same hair has long been a class
signifier that can determine everything from your perceived attractiveness to your professional viability for a deeper
dive on this very topic YouTuber intellectual media's video essay a black women's history of hair gives a really
good primer on the history and perception of black women's hair choices including how things like natural hair
have historically been discriminated against in the workplace which still happens to this day I highly recommend
checking out her full video at the link below and even the existence of hair itself on the top of our heads
especially for men has also become a bit of a class divide because basically anyone with access to enough resources
can now buy themselves a lush head of hair especially as it pertains to male pattern baldness a little Montage of
celebrity men who randomly grew hair at the age of 40 plus and speaking of hair
transplants it would be near criminal to talk about the ways in which teeth and hair signify economic class if we didn't
mention the great nation of turkey basically anyone who's watched a reality television show over the past several
years especially one based in the UK is familiar with the phenomenon of something called turkey teeth and just
so we're all on the same page turkey teeth refers to veneers which are obtained in the country of Turkey for
more relatively affordable prices by Western standards and and are therefore often more visible or noticeable there
is also it should be stated turkey hair where these hair transplants we mentioned are able to be attained by
somewhat more average men although let's be clear it still does cost a fair amount of money to get a full head of
hair and turkey but the turkey teeth phenomenon which has befallen many a cast member of Love island is an
interesting way in which the already existing class divides between good and bad teeth get an additional layer of
unattainability because now you have the divide amongst people who can afford to get procedures of relatively high
quality because even though more people are theoretically able to enter the pantheon of good teeth I.E straight
white teeth the less money you have the more obvious those interventions and this is true for hair transplants as
well are likely to [Music]
be which brings us to chapter 3 trickle down Beauty nomics so as the wealthy pour more money
Trickle-down beautynomics
into their appearance or simply change the way that they are pouring money into their appearance cottage industries pop
up to help lower classes emulate the same results often to their own detriment quote often those who are
celebrated for their beauty are increasingly people who have undergone various surgeries and treatments the I'm
not ugly I'm just poor meme format is a reflection of that change using before and after pictures of high-profile
celebrities like Bella Hadid Kylie Jenner and Sime and Hayes it demonstrates how money rather than
genetics is all that's necessary to create a face that's deemed as beautiful celebrities are still a little bit weird
about addressing if they've had work done and I really think it comes from
and one of my favorite people on Instagram her name is Clementine Ford she was talking about how it is the
Prosperity Gospel that if you are a good person you are going to be favored you're going to be blessed and that's going to include your looks and that
also comes down to that if you're more attractive you're just a a better person a good person and so I think that a lot
of these celebrities don't want you to know that the difference between them and you is not that they're inherently better that they have better jeans that
they're more favored that they're more blessed is that you could just buy it they don't want you to know that and so
they keep it a little bit more hush hush so let's look at the cheap plastic surgery tourism trend for instance which
as I mentioned we have a whole Deep dive on on one of our episodes of too good to be true while there basically are no
limits to the types of cosmetic procedures that people are seeking abroad both for services that aren't performed in the US us or products which
aren't approved here as well as for comparable procedures there are a few which are extremely popular rhinoplasty
breast augmentation veneers face lifts weight loss surgery and Brazilian butt lifts these procedures can often be a
fraction of the cost in the US with for example the aforementioned turkey averaging roughly half the price of
American surgeons per procedure but there are of course real dangers to any elective surgical procedure dangers
which are seriously increased when you are cutting costs on the quality or the health standards of that procedure and
we sat down with an expert to talk about just that so medical tourism is where you go to another country usually where
the cost of living is cheaper and that makes the surgeries cheaper there are some really incredible surgeons overseas
personally I would just do it here but also the way that each country regulates their surgeons and their medical centers
is different it doesn't necessarily mean that they're worse but some are a little bit more Lex so medical tourism I'm very
hesitant I think that you can do it well and you can do it safely if you are planning to do that I would highly
recommend that you get a surgery advisor one of my favorites is um surgeon made
curves for example she's really really really good um she has Connections in the Dr she has Connections in Colombia
South America different parts of Mexico if you get a surgery advisor that's going to be there every step of the way
with you they have that relationship with the surgeon with the facilities they see the things that you don't get
to see you know if you're being I mean not if you're being you will be under anesthesia and things like that and they
can advocate for you so if you're going to do that I would find a reputable um surgery advisor I would never recommend
someone to just you know look up prices and go somewhere side note the entire
digression in the Lula Rich documentary about the uh traveling to Mexico to get weight loss surgery like sort of uh
prize slash Like Girls Club within the lulao MLM um they called themselves the
Tijana skinnies like that entire digression to me was like probably the most interesting part of that because
like the Nexus between like cheap cosmetic tourism weight loss surgery
mlms like that's America baby like that's like a Norman Rockwell painting
but to really explore some of the dangers of these cheap Outsource surgeries which by the way can still be
very dangerous even when performed in the US let's look at the BBL so the pbl or Brazilian buttlift gained popularity
as the most popular cosmetic surgery of 2021 by taking fat from unwanted areas
of the body and transplanting it into more desirable places the Brazilian buttlift also became the deadliest
plastic surgery in The Last 5 Years seeking these procedures abroad can also increase potential harm due to the
varying degrees of Regulation quote vacation destinations may not have formal medical accreditation boards to
certify surgeons or medical facilities many facilities are privately owned owned and operated making it difficult
to check the credentials of Surgeons anesthesiologists and other medical personnel there are no us laws that
protect patients or mandate the training and qualifications of Physicians who perform plastic surgery outside of the
US there may be no legal recourse if negligence by The Physician or institution occurs and by the way it
must be reiterated cheap back alley surgeries with unqualified professionals and unsafe materials is also very much a
phenomenon here in the US there was a very interesting and horrifying mini do on this phenomenon set in Miami recently
which you can check out here on YouTube and the unsafe Beauty procedures that are being marketed to lower income
people who want that same ultra wealthy look can even take place in the supposed safety of your own home with things like
at home versions of Botox and fillers and then in terms of back alley Botox or
D DIY no absolutely no like I don't even want to even validate it with any other
thing than these SE are medications these are pharmaceutical medications that
technically every time you get BOTOX it's technically a prescription medication not the the provider is
prescribing you there is no substitute for that that you can make at home if you can't ask for their credentials if
the clinic isn't clean like why would you do that that's dangerous that's horrific and you may be asking yourself
why would anyone go for these cheap Alternatives if they know how unsafe they are we did a video on on pretty
privilege last year that addresses the economic cost of not looking the way Society wants you to look because to be
clear being perceived as conventionally attractive has real financial implications although interestingly not
as much as being seen as unattractive has penalties it's undeniable that certain markers of attractiveness confer
huge benefits financially and professionally and as I mentioned it also generally leads to people ascribing
you better characteristics that have nothing to do with attractiveness like being more trustworthy likable ET ET and
this isn't shocking when we consider just how much this association between attractiveness and worthiness is
ingrained into us even as children for example it's pretty much common knowledge by now but when we look at
Children's Entertainment like Disney movies Etc It's usually the case that the protagonist the love interest the
hero the princess are all beautiful while often the villains are defined by
their physical unattractiveness and sometimes the connection between being unattractive and being evil is made
explicit and direct these characters are ugly because they're evil and their outward appearance is a reflection of
their unworthy Interiors you don't have to get anything done like at the end of the day this is our one life our one
body do or don't do whatever makes you feel happy whatever makes you feel comfortable whatever makes you feel confident but if you do do something
please make sure you use a reputable provider a reputable surgery advisor um
you go through those channels and be as safe as possible it is not worth it to get something cheaper just to be having
it done like correction is way more expensive way more painful and that's
assuming that it wasn't something that was more fatal but if enhancing various physical traits in order to come closer
to a specific Beauty ideal is increasingly popular and we are being marketed more and more cheap ways in
order to achieve it the gold standard of aspirational beauty is still the general
vague and in my opinion quite destructive ideal of anti-aging
[Music] chapter 4 anti-aging the real stealth
Anti-aging: the real stealth wealth
wealth so as I mentioned in the intro one of the new dividing lines between rich and poor aesthetically isn't just
whether or not you have altered your appearance as often used to be the case but how many people can tell you've
altered your appearance we've made mention on this channel before of stealth wealth and the recent fixation
that younger Generations have had with the idea of inconspicuous consumption of the ultra Elite going out of their way
to downplay the things that they can afford to put on their body and I won't go into detail on this but I will link
you to a video we did all about this topic if you want to learn more the point here though is that while this is obviously true of things like wearing a
totally unclockable Brunello Cinelli sweater versus a logoed out Gucci jacket
stealth wealth is actually much more Insidious when you consider how often it takes place on people's literal
[Music] faces
[Music]
[Music]
[Music] we still sometimes have this perception that only people who have very visibly
altered their appearance have done so but this simply is not true in fact it's much closer to Accurate to say that
especially for people in the public eye some form of treatment past a certain age is much more the norm than the
exception and things like retinoids retinoids are incredible they actually do make your skin thicker like increase
your collagen now that being said is all that going to be the same as getting
like you know fractional lasers or RF micro needling no those do a different
thing at that point it's just treatments and then of course things like face lifts facelifts are literally we moving
your soft tissue back to where it was when you were a little younger and attaching it there redraping your skin
there's no Moisturizer in the world it could be a$1 thousand moisturizer it's not going to do that it's going to give your your skin a nice like plump like
you know a good like feel to it but it's not going to move if your soft tissue has kind of Fallen like it happens even
in our early 30s it's not going to move it back up and I should note that this isn't entirely about wealth right like
you can have a ton of money and still get very noticeable or ill-advised work done but it is definitely correlated
with wealth as much of what defines the most expensive procedures is often a question of subtlety and how more
effective things like facelifts versus Botox and filler for example will have a much higher upfront cost cost and often
much more subtle or unplaceable results it's especially true when you consider just how dangerous and potentially
disfiguring some of these Cheapo procedures can be as we discussed that said the concept of Aging in general not
just through surgery but through all kinds of treatments and science experiments is a growing industry all on
its own and whether you are a tech bro biohacking or an aist Starlet who just
went in for her latest mini facelift the value of staying young is only continuing to grow the global anti-aging
Market is expected to grow from $2.2 billion in 2022 to
42281 billion by 2030 at a compound annual growth rate of
8.61% the growth of the anti-aging Market is being driven by a number of factors including the rising number of
people who are willing to pay for maintaining physical Aesthetics the growing geriatric population and the
increasing awareness of Anti-aging products and services in addition the market is also being boosted by the
growing influence Ence of social media which is Raising awareness of Anti-aging products and services that's according
to a beauty packaging.com article and this is just a fun fact but if you go into that industry article you'll see a
list of the top companies in the sector in terms of projected growth and it is truly a law Fest of big Pharma cosmetics
and you guessed it mlms but point being whether it's through the goop ified
Wellness Obsession or the Ultram mask Tech bro biohacking or the tasteful and
often imp perceptible procedures that A-list actresses are likely to get before their next big red carpet there
is a very clear trend of the wealthy those who can afford it on any level basically optimizing their spending
towards looking as plausibly young as possible while keeping it just subtle enough to pretend they aren't
trying but if we're going to talk about Stealth wealth as it pertains to our physical appearance we cannot not
mention chapter 5 thinness the building of a designer body
Thinness: the building of a designer body
so when it comes to our physical perception of wealth few things are more strongly correlated than economic status
and body mass but I should note not amongst everyone this is one of the few
class and Beauty phenomena that's almost exclusively limited to women but we'll talk about that in a minute point being
if you've been consuming Media or in particular social media lately you've probably been made aware of the fact
that guess what guys fin is in again fun
now there's been a lot of speculation as to what has led this pendulum swing from a more curvy ideal body type in the 2000
intends to what is now a more unambiguously thin ideal very few people typify this as much as the journeys that
the Kardashian Jenner bodies have gone through over the past six years but perhaps one of the strongest reasons for
this sudden surge in popularity of being not just a healthy body weight but Ultra visibly thin is the prevalence of these
aformentioned glp1 drugs initially intended to help people with type 2 diabetes but being so widely abused by
people who are wealthy enough to afford to use it off label where it can easily CA in the five figures a year to go from
being just regular person thin to model thin and there are some who might argue
that the increasing availability of thinness would diminish its popularity and it's worth watching to see how the
pendulum swings over the next few years when it's become much more accessible even for people who've struggled for
years to suddenly lose a massive amount of weight in a short span of time is there going to be a way to Gat keep the
people who are losing it the real way probably but at least for now this sudden availability of thinness has led
to an explosion in its popularity even beyond the usual es and flows that body ideals tend to take but as I mentioned
unlike some of the other beauty standards in this video like having good teeth or a full head of hair or
symmetrical features thinness in particular is a beauty standard that is not exclusively but very heavily geared
toward women but let's jump back in with our guest who herself underwent a surgery she regrets specifically to fit
into that more ideal body weight growing up like I mentioned I had um always kind
of struggled with my weight I was the tallest like largest person in my class
every year throughout elementary school so that really kind of stuck with me um and you know early 2000s the culture
around like your body is okay the way it is as we're like seeing more now definitely did not exist and so I had
always been like very self-conscious of um my body and my weight had
had um a breast lift and then skin removal like from my stomach area and when I had this procedure done I was um
23 and so they say that um you shouldn't get a tummy tuck until like you know
you're done having kids or you know you don't want them and so I was not quite at that um point to be able to make a
decision there um it cost around $6,700 I believe um yeah which was less
than it would have been had it been the more invasive like traditional tummy tuck I guess at the time of getting the
surgery I had been um like my weight had
fluctuated quite a bit but at that point I had been like consistently um losing weight for quite
a while and I weighed about like like 120 lbs which you know is not like an
unhealthy weight if we're measuring by like BMI and all that stuff which like we know is a flawed metric means nothing
kind of all of that um but just to say that um that that weight for my body was
definitely like way too low I had every marker kind of of poor health in the terms of like um I was cold all the time
I remember it was summer and the weather was literally 100¬∞ and I needed a sweater um I hadn't had a period in like
five years um just all of these things that were like that is not
healthy um but because my weight was like technically in the healthy range like at the time of getting the
procedure like you know I wasn't questioned about it I was assumed to be
like of sound mind when like clearly I was not essentially the economic impacts of body size both positive and negative
are strongly impacted by gender put simply wealthy women are thinner than their poor counterparts much more so
than wealthy men and a lot of that is due to how larger women are treated and paid so this is from a very good
breakdown on the relationship between weight and economics which is chockful of good studies on the subject to go check out but I'll just take one quote
while it is hard to calculate a gender gap for someone not employed because of their weight there is evidence of
discrimination for women on the basis of their weight in the form of a myriad of studies that show that overweight or obese women are paid less than their
thinner peers while there's little difference in wages between obese men and men of a healthy weight overweight
and obese women are also more likely to be discriminated against in job applications and the workplace and will
receive lower starting salaries than non-overweight women what also should be recognized is the background of General
discrimination against people of a larger weight this is backed up as The Economist article notes by data from the
implicit bias test run by Harvard University which found that attitudes towards heavy individuals have become
substantially more negative I um very like vividly remember being a kid and
the tallest like largest one in the class um having like boy say mean things
about me like I very explicitly remember that um I remember you know being in
high school and being larger than my peers um not receiving like romantic
attention and kind of all that stuff and just the impacts of that on like my self-esteem um and then yeah after I had
undergone like this weight loss and then the surgery I think um there were a
couple of things involved with like the surgery too around like I felt better
about myself but looking back I'm like not that it was like a false sense of self-confidence but I feel like it was
built on these like on this shaky Foundation of like wanting to be as thin
as possible and then finally achieving that and feeling really good about that um but yeah I mean I absolutely like
received more romantic attention um both like just generally post weight loss and
then like post that surgery specifically and one thing it is worth noting is that as we discussed earlier beauty standards
tend to change greatly with what is associated with wealth essentially at a macro level thin is in for quite some
time in our society in part because it's what's associated with the Leisure Class particularly for women whereas back in
the day when we were all like I don't know like on the Oregon Trail or like plowing or I don't know like walking 2
miles each way to the Market to go like sell our goods and wees like being heavier was a sign that you didn't have
to do any of that and we also can't talk about thinness as the ideal without talking about its more Insidious
counterpart
Wellness chapter six wellness and the skincare industrial
Wellness and the skincare industrial complex
complex now the beauty industry especially in recent years with our younger generation's more acute
awareness of Health in general in repackaging a lot of the typical old beauty standard stuff look prettier be
thinner Etc as being about health or self-care rather than about conforming
to some objective standard now not only is this constant Quest toward thinness able to be repackaged as a wellness
Journey up to an including the many people who suffer from orthorexia which
is an eating disorder characterized by an excessive need to eat in a healthy or quote clean way we've done previous
breakdowns on the entire farce that is quote clean eating anyway you can get into that at the link in our description but particularly as it pertains to our
skin as I myself have noted on Tik Tok so this isn't exactly a conspiracy
theory but I have a strong suspicion that part of the reason the skincare industry is so dominant right now is because it's become less mainstream
socially acceptable to talk about people's weight like don't get me wrong the diet and weight loss industry is still extremely profitable but in a lot
of mainstream circles especially those dominated by women it's less openly acceptable to talk about weight loss as
a goal and we're also more aware that weight is hugely determined by genetics age and other factors that are really
outside of people's control and here's the thing absolutely all of that is also true for skincare like the skin you have
is heavily determined by your genetics and the environment you live in and the age of that skin but yet the Cosmetic
skincare industry largely exists to teach us that our skin is a result of our diligence and work ethic and that if
we just buy the right products and use them in the right order we too can have super model skin anyway the industry of
teaching women to exert an almost compulsive level of control over their bodies in order to show their value is extremely lucrative and if they can't do
it about your weight they'll do it about your face brands are not stupid and they have shifted the ritualistic and
self-discipline aspects of weight management into having Perfect Skin and prioritizing even more rigorous beauty
standards under the guise of natural beauty which is often it should be noted just a competition for who happens to
fit most neatly into our beauty standards by Lottery of genetics versus their ability to manipulate their
appearance now we talked a lot about this in our 2022 video about celebrity gaslighting around Beauty things like
touting drinking water or using specific products without declaring the massive amounts that they're spending on costly
procedures like lasers and injectables but even for us normal people the entire concept of a skincare routine has gone
from something that only a very limited handful of rather obsessive people were doing to something that we're all
essentially expected to embrace in adulthood again especially if you're a woman from one report from skin store
quote the skincare industry is one of the fastest growing Beauty markets in the US our research found that Americans
are now spending an average of $322 188 every year with consumers now
buying skincare from as early as their teenage years Americans are forecast to buy skincare for 47 years totaling an
incredible $15,000 on skincare in their lifetime not only is there a huge us
interest in skincare they're also willing to invest in it an estimated .7 million is set to be spent by Americans
on their skincare regime throughout 2021 with a predicted growth of 5.01% year on
year making them the biggest generator of Revenue in the industry and we constantly see stories and social media
posts about celebrities like Jennifer Lopez or Paul Rudd and how crazy it is that they still look so young and we
hear them at least the female celebrities talk about the importance of using such and such product which I
should also note they're often themselves selling or at least financially invested in and this entire
farce of skin care as somehow being a more noble or natural Pursuit than other
cosmetic alterations like makeup or Hair Care is made all the more laughable when you realize just how much it is still
predicated on selling women's solutions to problems they didn't even know they had and the huge lack of transparency in
the skincare industry in particular highlighting products and omitting the various medical procedures you've had is
perfectly adapted to selling us stuff the aformentioned Jay for example has her own skincare line and it would be a
lot more difficult for her to sell these items if she had to regularly disclose all of the other procedures that she's
able to afford to make her look as youthful as she does the entire skincare industry especially as it pertains to
the Cosmetic and over-the-counter spaces is predicated on the idea that good skin is not just a thing but a thing that we
can achieve through purchasing the right products and applying them ourselves ignoring the fact that many common skin
conditions are actual illnesses that need actual treatment from an actual doctor Andor actual medicine but the
reality is much like weight skin is largely a question of genetic Lottery and most of the meaningful differences
we can make in our skin quality are going to come from actual medical interventions be that expensive lasers
or prescriptions like Accutane which means that like almost everything else the question of having good skin
especially in a way that feels effortless is just another huge divide between the rich and the poor I think
that the most ethical way to you know even sell these products because they do use Skin Care hopefully it's the
skincare that they're advertising but they do use skincare and I think people whether it's with skincare or if it's
like with working out for some reason people tend to think it's an either Ora like if they exercise they can't possibly have surgery if they have
surgery they obviously don't exercise and that's not true especially for the people who look really really really
good you want to have all of those things in line right you want to uh make sure you're eating well you're sleeping
you're you know getting all the nutrition you need you are getting the exercise and you probably are having surgery if you are some of these
celebrities so for people to separate and think okay if they get if they use a
skin care they're definitely you know they don't need surgery that's not true they probably have had all of those
things so I don't think it's a bad thing for celebrities to say something like
yes I use retinols yes I moisturized yes I use sunscreen but I also get lasers once a month and I also get BOTOX every
4 to six months and they don't have to disclose it all the time but I think that if they're if they're pretty open
about things in general people do remember it and when we're writing an article like say oh you know Jennifer
Lopez looks so good at 50 you know she has been open about her facelift she has been open about whatever which she has
not I'm just let's pretend but then on top of that she also uses this olive oil
skincare line that she loves so much and you can take parts of what she does or
if you have have the access and the resource you do all of it you know it it at that point I feel like you can then
make a better choice and a better decision knowing this is what it takes
for those results now if you want to you know mince and parse like which parts you want to take great it always makes
me think of an um Legally Blonde lios function oh God W where she was willing
to go to jail for murder then release how unethical it was that she you know
did the Lipo and the
[Music] workouts Beauty has always been a status
symbol and likely always will be not only are we predisposed to like pretty faces we're also social creatures that
fold under pressure and want to appeal to the people around us but beauty is deeply subjective and is a constantly
moving goal post that's heavily informed by basically whatever rich people happen to look like today we've convinced
ourselves that we live in an era of democratized beauty and we've bought into the idea that achieving a certain standard of beauty is something that
Conclusion: an era of democratized beauty?
anyone can access but even though we may have more tools to do it and are more constantly exposed to those Beauty
ideals themselves through things like social media ultimately the entire beauty industry as an economy is one of
Maintenance of keeping women in particular on a constant cycle of need needing to buy more and this is just
another way that capitalism prays on our vulnerabilities as we've discussed it's not wrong that the way we look has a
huge impact on our earning potential the way we'll move through the world economically professionally personally
is going to be greatly impacted by how we look and perhaps more accurately how others perceive us and with the screens
we look into constantly selling us a more and more unrealistic picture of what we should actually look like the
spiral of beauty consumption towards an unattainable standard is only likely to increase but as we navigate this system
where we have very few good choices and are always going to have to compromise to some extent it's important to always
check in with ourselves about where a lot of these beauty standards are coming from how much of our motivation is
internal versus external the way we feel about ourselves versus the way others feel about us and what beauty and style
choices actually have value for us I lived this like gym girl lifestyle and I
still like like to lift lift weights I like to go to the gym and do all of that stuff but like in the the the sense of
you know tracking my protein and like tracking my steps and like doing all of that um for a couple of years um and
then I think at that point um I was tired of it I was like super exhausted
from it I think having seen um different influencers who really pushed ideas
around like you know your body is an instrument and like do movement that
feels good to you and stuff like that that's very like revolved around self-care I think I had eventually
gotten to the point of like what is this all for why have I been living this way I think also seeing like representation
around different body types like really really helped um on Instagram and stuff
I full heartedly like agree with the statement you're not ugly you're just poor I think like in my case I was only
able to do that surgery because I was living at home because I was able to
like save up for it because I didn't have like traditional expenses associated with like being an adult out
on your own I think like even now just looking at my income and expenses and
all of that like I have limited money to be able to like dedicate to anything
related to like improving my appearance and I think um I definitely have fallen
into waves of like oh everyone in their 20s on Tik Tok now is talking about like getting Botox and how that's
preventative or like you truly can only do those things if you have disposable income which like most of the world does
not and yeah I think like social media too is such a a vacuum of like not
reality like you see all of these procedures and all of that stuff and like it is just not realistic um like
it's just money you can't totally unplug yourself from the beauty Matrix because that would basically mean unplugging
yourself from society unfortunately but you can become a conscientious objector to its worst excesses thanks for joining
us and I'll see you next month on a new video [Music]

Transcription:
Researchers from Georgia Tech in collaboration  with Tianjin University in China have developed  
a new semiconductor material with this new  technology we will be able to build computer  
chips that will run orders of magnitude faster  than ever and this could really spark a new era  
in electronics as a chip designer I'm very excited  very excited about this work let me explain why  
according to law the number of transistors in  a chip doubles approximately every 2 years this  
observation was first described by Gordon Moore  in 1965 however later Moore himself predicted that  
this rate would eventually slow down and that's  unfortunately true it's getting harder and even  
more expensive to fit more and more transistors  into a single silicon die it seems like we are  
hitting some hard physical limits such as a size  of a single atom still there are lots of efforts  
made by companies like TSMC IBM Imec and Intel  to continue shrinking transistors even further  
and keep more slow going indefinitely right  now we in the ball park of about 200 million  
transistors per square millimeter and that's  an impressive number and according to this  
chart from i e the number of transistors per  square millimeter has increased nearly 600,000  
times over the last five decades however further  scaling the transistor technology down is a huge  
challenge so in order to move the needle forward  we are starting to build in the third dimension  
start stacking transistors on top of each other in  order to be a able to fit more of them in the same  
area imagine it like a big densely populated city  starting to grow vertically but here again we see  
a new problem emerging because vertically stacked  devices suffer badly suffer from heat dissipation  
problem there is no heat dissipation path which  leads to overheating IBM is trying to address  
this problem for example last year here they've  introduced vertical transistors and that's a novel  
architecture where the gate is placed vertically  however these devices are still in the research  
phase and meanwhile researchers are constantly  looking for new and novel semiconductor materials  
that can offer better spit and heat dissipation  than silicon and potentially replace it and for  
a long time the researchers were investigating  graphene as a possibility and graphene is really  
appealing due to its particular crystal structure  and its exceptional ability to dissipate heat in  
fact it has much higher thermal conductivity  than silicon and as you know heat is one of  
the major bottlenecks for many modern electronic  devices this is super important when chips are  
becoming smaller and smaller and more dens packed  you don't want your phone to overheat for example  
because overheating degrades the performance  and also the lifespan of the device and can  
even cause a meltdown so this new graphene based  devices they're much better at thermal management  
the good thing about graphene is not only can  you make things smaller and faster and with  
Pros and Cons
less heat dissipation you're actually using proper  properties of electrons that are not accessible in  
Silicon however there is one fundamental problem  with graphene it's actually not a semiconductor  
it has zero band gap. zero electron volt band gap  .and this reminds me of time when I was a student  
and we had classes on Semiconductor physics and it  was extremely challenging but I loved it so let me  
explain why Band Gap in semiconductors is such a  big deal you know all the modern microchips like  
CPUs GPUs they built of transistors which are in  my humble opinion the most important invention  
in the history of humanity and transistors are  essentially tiny switches which can be turned on  
and off and there state is basically controlled  by the voltage applied to the control terminal  
so the Band Gap in transistors is fundamental  because it determines a minimum energy required  
to make a transistor to switch between the states  ideally we would like to have a transistor with a  
bang Gap small enough to allow some conductivity  but also not too high otherwise it's an insulator  
and also not too small like in case of Graphene  it's zero it means it becomes highly conductive  
uh similar to metals and essentially it's a semi  metal you see this zero bang gap of graphene is  
a fundamental problem because we can't make a  graphene transistor to switch however in this  
Manufacturing and Doping
work the researchers found a way to make  a perfect semiconductor out of graphene  
what they did they grew graphene on top of a  silicon carbide wafer and that's pretty SiC  
in the Fab they heated it up silicon carbide  to very high temperatures over 1,000¬∞ C and  
then dot it actually doing a semiconductor has  nothing to do with band or forbidden substances  
it's actually adding impurities into material  to alter its electrical properties actually  
silicon which is used in all the modern chips is  also always doped. so it's dope. by altering the  
very properties of graphene they've managed  to introduce a Band Gap and they called this  
new semiconductor semiconducting epigraphene or  shortly SEG unfortunately I happen to know that  
about 60% of you guys who are watching this video  are not subscribed to the channel if you have ever  
enjoyed my videos could you please please do me  a favour and subscribe to the channel this helps  
the channel more than you know the bigger  the channel gets the bigger the guests that  
I can interview for you get thank you here is a  sneak peek at an epigraphene transistor I would  
New Transistor Explained
call it back to square one an old school planner  transistor all this semiconductor story started  
with a planner transistor back in 1957 since then  the the transistors have evolved significantly we  
went from a planner transistor to FinFET to gate  all around and then to CFET complimentary fat and  
then even to Vertical Transistors but with this  new semiconductor we started all over again with  
planner transistor you see here the device is  built on top of a silicon carbide substrate  
and the semiconducting graphene is in the channel  to put it simple when a gate to source voltage is  
bigger than a certain threshold the transistor is  turned on and the current is flowing through the  
channel I don't know if I go too much into the  details let me know in the comments what is cool  
is that these new transistors can switch very  quickly they can support frequencies in the  
range of terahertz and this is possible thanks to  very high electron mobility of graphene actually  
they were able to achieve 10 times higher electron  Mobility with graphene than of what was till today  
possible with silicon chips and the mobility is  defined by crystal structure the flatness and the  
band structure of the graphene allows electron  to move ballistically and in practice this means  
that an electron can move much faster through a  semiconductor which promises much faster chips  
with less heat dissipation what's also promising  about this work is that the manufacturing process  
they used is compatible with a conventional  manufacturing process so overall it seems like  
an economically viable technology and what's even  more fascinating is that they've not just managed  
to make a single graphine based chip in a lab  but they've managed to fabricate it in large  
quantity on large silicon carbide wafers defect  free and this is a big deal because usually it's  
a huge and time-consuming challenge to make a new  semiconductor technology to be manufacturable at  
scale I think if we can figure out the graphene  based chips this will be huge but there are still  
many technical challenges to overcome until we  can bring it to mass production as always let me  
know what you think in the comments actually the  whole idea is not to integrate this new technology  
with traditional silicon technology as it often  happens but rather to use it with silicon carbide  
technology which is already well-developed  silicon carbide is replacing silicon in high  
voltage applications such as in Power Electronics  in electric cars for example it's widely used in  
Tesla for powertrain and other applications and  the reason is because of its amazing property is  
to operate at higher temperatures to withstand  higher resistance and higher electric fields.  
Another Candidate
Another discovery I believe from a year ago or  so is boron arsenide another potential candidate  
to replace good old silicon due to its amazing  properties it has improved charge Mobility over  
silicon and better heat conductivity 10 times  higher thermal conductivity than silicon this  
has huge potential however researchers found  it hard to fabricate born arsenide at high  
volume defect free you know that silicon is  fabricated quite cheaply in high quality and  
the whole manufacturing process is very well  established but maybe with enough efforts and  
also sufficient investment we can also develop  Boron Arsenide but it will definitely take time  
as it took several decades for silicon if you  enjoyed this video please do me a favour and

Transcription:

- LEDs don't get their color from their plastic covers. And you can see that because here is a transparent LED
that also glows the same red color. The color of the light comes from the electronics themselves.
The casing just helps us tell different LEDs apart. In 1962, general Electric engineer Nick Holonyak
created the first visible LED. It glowed a faint red. A few years after that, engineers at Monsanto
created a green LED. But for decades, all we had were those two colors.
So LEDs could only be used in things like indicators, calculators, and watches.
If only we could make blue, then we could mix red, green, and blue to make white,
and every other color, unlocking LEDs for every type of lighting in the world,
from light bulbs, to phones, to computers, to TVs to billboards.
But blue was almost impossible to make. (dramatic music)
Throughout the 1960s, every big electronics company in the world, from IBM to GE, to Bell Labs,
raced to create the blue LED. They knew it would be worth billions.
Despite the efforts of thousands of researchers, nothing worked.
10 years after Holonyak's original LED turned into 20, then 30, and the hope of ever using LEDs for light, faded away.
According to a director at Monsanto, these won't ever replace the kitchen light.
They'd only be used in appliances, car dashboards, and stereo sets to see if the stereo was on.
This might still be true today, if not for one engineer who defied the entire industry
and made three radical breakthroughs to create the world's first blue LED.
(dramatic music) Sh≈´ji Nakamura was a researcher at a small Japanese chemical company named Nichia.
They had recently expanded into the production of semiconductors to be used in the manufacture of red and green LEDs.
But by the late 1980s, the semiconductor division was on its last legs. They were competing against far more established
companies in a crowded market, and they were losing. Tensions started to run high.
Younger employees begged Nakamura to create new products, while senior workers called his research a waste of money.
And at Nichia, money was in short supply. Nakamura's lab mainly consisted of machinery
he had scavenged and welded together himself. Phosphorus leaks in his lab created so many explosions,
that his coworkers had stopped checking in on him. By 1988, Nakamura's supervisors were so disillusioned
with his research that they told him to quit. So it was out of desperation that he brought a radical proposal to the company's founder
and president Nobuo Ogawa. (dramatic music) The elusive blue LED,
that the likes of of Sony, Toshiba and Panasonic had all failed at. What if Nichia could be the one to create it?
After suffering loss after loss on their semiconductors for more than a decade, Ogawa took a gamble.
He devoted 500 million yen or $3 million, likely around 15% of the company's annual profit,
to Nakamura's moonshot Project. Everyone knew that LEDs have the potential
to replace light bulbs, because light bulbs, the universal symbol for a bright idea,
are actually terrible at making light. They work by running current through a tungsten filament,
which gets so hot, it glows. But most of the electromagnetic radiation comes out as infrared, heat.
Only a negligible fraction is visible light. In contrast, LED stands for light emitting diode.
It's right there in the name. LEDs primarily create light, so they're far more efficient,
and a diode is just a device with two electrodes, which only allows current to flow in one direction.
So here's how an LED works. When you have an isolated atom, each electron in that atom occupies a discreet energy level.
You can think of these energy levels like individual seats from a hockey stadium, and all atoms of the same element,
when they are far apart from each other have identical available energy levels. But when you bring multiple atoms together to form a solid,
something interesting happens. The outermost electrons now feel the pole, not only of their own nucleus,
but of all the other nuclei as well. And as a result, their energy levels shift.
So instead of being identical, they become a series of closely spaced, but separate energy levels.
An energy band. The highest energy band with electrons in it, is known as the valence band,
and the next higher energy band is called the conduction band. You can think of it like the balcony level.
In conductors, the valence band is only partially filled. This means with a little bit of thermal energy,
electrons can jump into nearby unfilled seats, and if an electric field is applied, they can jump from one unfilled seat to the next
and conduct current through the material. In insulators, the valence band is full,
and the difference in energy between the valence and conduction bands, the band gap, is large.
So when an electric field is applied, no electrons can move. There are no available seats
to move into in the valence band, and the band gap is too big for any electrons to jump into the conduction band,
which brings us to semiconductors. Semiconductors are similar to insulators,
except the band gap is much smaller. This means at room temperature, a few electrons will have sufficient energy
to jump into the conduction band, and now they can easily access nearby empty seats and conduct current.
Not only that, the empty seats they left behind in the valence band can also move. Well, really, it's the nearby electrons
jumping into those empty seats. But if you look from afar, it's as though the empty seat or hole
is moving like a positive charge in the opposite direction to the electrons in the conduction band.
(soft music) By themselves, pure semiconductors are not that useful. To make them way more functional,
you have to add impurity atoms into the lattice. This is known as doping. For example, in silicon,
you can add a small number of phosphorus atoms. Phosphorus is similar to silicon, so it easily fits into the lattice,
but it brings with it one extra valence electron. This electron exists in a donor level
just beneath the conduction band. So with a bit of thermal energy, all these electrons can jump into the conduction band
and conduct current. Since most of the charges that can move in this type of semiconductor are electrons,
which are negative, this sort of semiconductor is called n-type, n for negative,
but I should point out that the semiconductor itself is still neutral. It's just that most of the mobile charge
carriers are negative. They're electrons. So there is also another type of semiconductor where most
of the mobile charge carriers are positive, and it's called p-type.
To make p-type silicon, you add a small number of atoms of, say, boron. Boron fits into the lattice,
but brings with it one fewer valence electron than silicon. So it creates an empty acceptor level
just above the valence band. And with a bit of thermal energy, electrons can jump outta the valence band,
leaving behind holes. It is these positive holes which are mostly responsible for carrying current in the p-type semiconductor.
Again, the material overall is uncharged, it's just that most of the mobile charge carriers
are positive holes. Where things get interesting is when you put a piece of p-type and n-type together.
Without even connecting this to a circuit, some electrons will diffuse from n to p
and fall into the holes in the p-type. This makes the p-type a little negatively charged,
and the n-type a little positively charged. So there is now an electric field inside an inert piece of material.
Electrons keep diffusing until the electric field becomes so large, it prevents them from crossing over.
And now we have established the depletion region, an area depleted of mobile charge carriers.
There are no electrons in the conduction band and no holes in the valence band. If you connect a battery the wrong way to this diode,
it simply expands the depletion region until its electric field perfectly opposes that
of the battery and no current flows. But if you flip the polarity of the battery,
then the depletion region shrinks, the electric field decreases, and electrons can flow from n to p.
When an electron falls from the conduction band into a hole in the valence band, that band gap energy can be
emitted as a photon. The energy change of the electron is emitted as light,
and this is how a light emitting diode works. The size of the band gap determines the color
of the light emitted. In pure silicon, the band gap is only 1.1 electron volts.
So the photon released isn't visible, it's infrared light. These LEDs are actually used in remote controls
for your TV, and you can capture them on camera. Moving up the spectrum, you can see why the first visible
light LEDs were red and then green, and why blue was so hard.
A photon of blue light requires more energy, and therefore a larger band gap.
By the 1980s, after hundreds of millions of dollars had been spent hunting for the right material, every electronics company
had come up empty handed. But researchers had at least figured out the first critical requirement, high quality crystal.
No matter what material you used for the blue LED, it required a near perfect crystal structure.
Any defects in the crystal lattice, disrupt the flow of electrons. So instead of emitting their energy as visible light,
it is instead dissipated as heat. So the first step in Nakamura's proposal to Ogawa,
was to disappear to Florida. He knew an old colleague there whose lab was beginning to use a new crystal making technology called
Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition, or MOCVD.
An MOCVD reactor, essentially a giant oven, was and still is the best way to mass produce clean crystal.
It works by injecting vapor molecules of your crystal into a hot chamber where they react with a base material called a substrate to form layers.
It's important that the substrate lattice matches the crystal lattice being built on top of it to create a stable, smooth crystal.
This is a precise art. The crystal layers often need to be as thin as just a couple of atoms.
Nakamura joined the lab for a year to master MOCVD. But his time there was miserable.
He wasn't allowed to use the working MOCVD, so he spent 10 of his 12 months assembling a new system,
almost from scratch. Even worse, his lab mates shunned him because Nakamura didn't have a doctorate,
nor any academic papers to his name, as Nichia didn't allow publishing. His lab mates, all PhD researchers,
dismissed him as a lowly technician. This experience fueled him.
Nakamura wrote, "I feel resentful when people looked down on me. I developed more fighting spirit.
I would not allow myself to be beaten by such people."
(inspirational music) He returned to Japan in 1989 with two things in hand. One, an order for a brand new MOCVD reactor for Nichia,
and two, a fervent desire to get his PhD. At that time in Japan, you could earn a PhD
without having to go to university, simply by publishing five papers.
Nakamura had always known his chances of inventing the blue LED were low. But now he had a backup plan.
Even if he didn't succeed, he could at least get his PhD. But now the question was with MOCVD under his belt,
which material should he research? By this time, scientists had narrowed the options down
to two main candidates, zinc selenide, and gallium nitride. These were both semiconductors with band gaps,
theoretically, in the blue light range. Zinc selenide was the far more promising option.
When grown in an MOCVD reactor, it had only a .3% lattice mismatch
with its substrate, gallium arsenide. Therefore, zinc selenide crystal had about a thousand
defects per square centimeter, within the upper limit for LED functioning. Its only issue was that while scientists
had figured out multiple different ways to create n-type zinc selenide, no one knew how to create p-type.
In contrast, gallium nitride had been abandoned by almost everybody for three reasons.
First, it was much harder to make a high quality crystal. The best substrate for growing gallium nitride was sapphire,
but its lattice mismatch was 16%. This resulted in higher defects,
over 10 billion per square centimeter. The second problem was that like zinc selenide,
scientists had only ever created n-type gallium nitride using silicon. P-type was elusive.
And third, to be commercially viable, a blue LED would have to have a total light output power
of at least a thousand microwatts. That's two orders of magnitude more than any prototype had ever achieved.
So between the two candidates, almost all researchers were focused on zinc selenide.
Nakamura surveyed the crowded field and decided that if he were going to publish five papers by himself,
he'd better focus on gallium nitride, where the competition was much less fierce.
This material's main claim to fame was one development back in 1972,
when RCA engineer Herbert Maruska made a tiny gallium nitride blue LED, but it was dim and inefficient.
So RCA slashed the project's budget, calling it a dead end. 20 years later, scientific opinion hadn't changed.
When Nakamura attended the biggest applied physics conference in Japan, the talks on zinc selenide
had over 500 attendees. The talks on gallium nitride had five.
(dramatic music) Two of those five attendees were the world experts on gallium nitride, Dr. Isamu Akasaki
and his former grad student, Dr. Hiroshi Amano. In contrast to Nakamura's academic background,
they were researchers at Nagoya University, one of Japan's best. A few years earlier, they had made a breakthrough
on the first problem of high quality crystal. Instead of growing gallium nitride directly on sapphire,
they first grew a buffer layer of aluminum nitride. This has a lattice spacing in between that
of the other two materials, making it easier to grow a clean gallium nitride crystal on top.
The only issue was that the aluminum caused problems for the MOCVD reactor, making the process hard to scale.
But Nakamura wasn't even close at this stage. Back at Nichia, he couldn't get gallium nitride to even grow
normally in his new MOCVD reactor. After six months, desperate for results,
he decided to take the machine apart and build a better version himself.
His 10 months spent putting together the reactor in Florida, were suddenly invaluable.
He began following the same routine each day, arrive at the lab at 7:00 AM.
Spend the first half of the day welding, cutting, and rewiring the reactor. Spend the rest of the day experimenting
with the modified reactor to see what it can do. At 7:00 PM go home, eat dinner, wash and sleep.
Nakamura repeated this routine every single day, taking no weekends and no holidays except for New Year's Day,
the most important holiday in Japan. (soft music)
After a year and a half of continuous work, he came into the lab on a winter day in late 1990.
As usual, he tinkered around in the morning grew a gallium nitride sample in the afternoon, and tested it.
But this time, the electron mobility was four times higher than any gallium nitride ever grown directly on sapphire.
Nakamura called it the most exciting day of his life. His trick was to add a second nozzle
to the MOCVD reactor. The gallium nitride reactant gases had been rising
in the hot chamber, mixing in the air to form a powdery waste. But the second nozzle released a downward stream
of inert gas, pinning the first flow to the substrate to form a uniform crystal.
For years, scientists had avoided adding a second stream to MOCVD because they thought it would only
introduce more turbulence. But Nakamura used a special nozzle so that even when the streams combined,
they remained laminar. He called his invention the two-flow reactor.
Now, he was ready to take on Akazaki and Amano, but instead of copying their aluminum nitride buffer layer,
his two flow design allowed him to make gallium nitride so smooth and stable, it itself could be used
as a buffer layer on the sapphire substrate. This in turn, yielded an even cleaner crystal
of gallium nitride on top, without the issues of aluminum. Nakamura now had the highest quality
gallium nitride crystals ever made. But just as he was getting started, things took a wrong turn.
(dramatic music) While he had been in Florida, Nobuo Ogawa had stepped back from Nichia to become chairman.
In his day, Nobuo had been a risk taking scientist, designing the company's first products.
It's why he supported Nakamura's lofty plans all this time. But in his place, his son-in-law, Eji Ogawa,
became CEO of the company, and the younger Ogawa had a much stricter outlook.
One Nichia client said, "He has a mind of steel, and he remembers everything."
In 1990, an executive at Matsushita, an LED manufacturer and Nichia's biggest customer,
visited the company to give a talk on blue LEDs. In it, he claimed zinc selenide was the way forward,
declaring "gallium nitride has no future." That very same day, Nakamura received a note from Eji,
stop work on gallium nitride immediately. Eji had never supported the research
and wanted to end what he saw as a colossal waste. But Nakamura crumpled up the note and threw it away,
and he did so again, and again, when a succession of similar notes and phone calls came from company management.
Out of spite, he published his work on the two-flow reactor without Nichia's knowledge. It was his first paper.
One down, four to go. With crystal formation settled,
he turned to the second obstacle, creating p-type gallium nitride. Here Akazaki and Amano had again beaten him to the punch.
They had created a gallium nitride sample doped with magnesium, but at first, it didn't perform as a p-type as they expected.
However, after exposing it to an electron beam, it did behave as a p-type,
the world's first p-type gallium nitride, after 20 years of trying.
The catch was that no one knew why it worked. And the process of irradiating each crystal
with electrons was too slow for commercial production. At first, Nakamura copied Akazaki and Amano's approach,
but he suspected the beam of electrons was overkill. Maybe all the crystal needed was energy.
So he tried heating magnesium doped gallium nitride to 400 degrees Celsius in a process known as annealing.
The result, a completely p-type sample. This worked even better than the shallow electron beam,
which only made the surfaces of the samples p-type, and simply heating things up was a quick scalable process.
His work also revealed why the p-type had been so difficult. To make gallium nitride with MOCVD, you supply the nitrogen from ammonia,
but ammonia also contains hydrogen. Where there should have been holes in the magnesium
doped gallium nitride, these hydrogen atoms were sneaking in and bonding with the magnesium, plugging all the holes.
Adding energy to the system, released the hydrogen from the material, freeing up the holes again.
(dramatic music) By now, Nakamura had all the ingredients to make a prototype blue LED,
and he presented it at a workshop in St. Louis in 1992 and received a standing ovation.
He was beginning to make a name for himself, but even though he had created the best prototype to date,
it was more of a blue violet color and still extremely inefficient, with a light output power
of just 42 microwatts, well below the 1000 microwatt threshold for practical use.
At Nichia, the new CEO's patience had run out. Eji sent written orders to Nakamura to stop tinkering
and turn whatever he had into a product. His job was on the line,
but in Nakamura's own words, "I kept ignoring his order. I had been successful because I didn't listen
to company orders and trusted my own judgment." At this point, he only had the third hurdle left,
getting his blue LED to a light output power of a thousand microwatts.
(soft music) A known trick to increase the efficiency of LEDs was to create a well,
a thin layer of material at the p-n junction called an active layer that shrinks the band gap just a bit.
This encourages more electrons to fall from the end type conduction band into holes in the p-type valence band.
The best active layer for gallium nitride was already known to be indium gallium nitride,
which would not only make the band gap easier to cross, but also narrow it just the right amount to bring its blue violet gap down to true blue.
This time, Akasaki and Amano didn't scoop Nakamura. They were stuck trying to grow
indium gallium nitride in the first place. Amano recalled, "It was generally said that gallium nitride
and indium nitride would not mix, like water and oil." But Nakamura had an advantage,
his ability to customize his MOCVD reactor. This allowed him to use brute force,
adjusting the reactor to pump as much indium as he could onto the gallium nitride,
in the hopes that at least some would stick. To his surprise, the technique worked,
giving him a clean indium gallium nitride crystal. He quickly incorporated this active layer into his LED,
but the well worked a little too well and overflowed with electrons, leaking them back into the gallium nitride layers.
Unfazed, within a few months, Nakamura had fixed this too by creating the opposite of a well, a hill.
He returned to his reactor one more time to make aluminum gallium nitride, a compound with a larger band gap that could block
electrons from escaping the well once inside.
(dramatic music) The structure of the blue LED had become far more complex
than anyone could have imagined, but it was complete. By 1992, Sh≈´ji Nakamura had this.
- And I showed the chairman, I told him, "Please, hey chairman come to my office." I showed him the blue LED
and he said, "ohh, this is great no?" I became so happy. I just became, out of my office, yeah.
- [Derek] After 30 years of searching by countless scientists, Nakamura had done it. He had created a glorious, bright blue LED
that could even be seen in daylight. It had a light output power of 1,500 microwatts
and emitted a perfect blue at exactly 450 nanometers. It was over 100 times brighter
than the previous pseudo-blue LEDs on the market. Nakamura wrote, "I felt like I had reached
the top of Mount Fuji." Nichia called a press conference in Tokyo to announce the world's first true blue LED.
The electronics industry was stunned. A researcher from Toshiba remarked, "Everyone was caught with their pants down."
The effect on Nichia's fortunes was immediate and explosive. Orders flooded in,
and by the end of 1994, they were manufacturing 1 million blue LEDs per month.
Within three years, the company's revenue had nearly doubled. In 1996, they made the jump from blue to white,
by placing a yellow phosphor over the LED. This chemical absorbs the blue photons
and re-radiates them in a broad spectrum across the visible range. Soon enough, Nichia was selling the world's
first white LED. At last, unlocking the final frontiers so many had doubted,
LED lighting. Over the next four years, their sales doubled again.
By 2001, their revenue was approaching $700 million a year. Over 60% came from blue LED products.
Today, Nichia is one of the largest LED manufacturers in the world with an annual revenue in the billions.
As for Nakamura, to whom Nichia owed the quadrupling of its fortunes?
(dramatic music) - I increased my salary, $60,000. After doubling, yeah.
- I heard you only got $170 bonus - Each patent. - So you got $170 bonus for the patent.
- Yes, yes. - [Derek] This was all while the blue LED was generating hundreds of millions of dollars in sales.
Eji Ogawa had always seen Nakamura's stubborn individuality as a liability, not a strength.
The message was clear. In 2000, after more than 20 years at Nichia,
Nakamura left the company for the US, where job offers had been pouring in.
But his troubles with Nichia weren't over. He began consulting for Cree, another LED company.
Nichia was furious and sued him for leaking company secrets. Nakamura responded by counter-suing Nichia
for never properly compensating him for his invention, seeking $20 million.
In 2001, the Japanese courts ruled with Nakamura and ordered Nichia to pay him 10 times his initial request.
But Nichia appealed and the case was eventually settled with a payout of $8 million.
In the end, this was only enough to cover Nakamura's legal fees.
(soft music) This is all he got for an invention that now comprises an $80 billion industry,
from house lights to streetlights. While you watch this video on a phone, computer or TV.
If you're outside following traffic lights or displays, chances are you are relying on blue LEDs.
We might even be getting too much of them. You may have heard warnings to avoid blue light from screens
before bed because it can disrupt your circadian rhythm. That all comes from the gallium nitride blue LED.
But as for lighting, there are virtually no downsides to an LED bulb. Compared to an incandescent or fluorescent bulb,
they are far more efficient. They last many times longer, are safer to handle, and are completely customizable.
30 years after the first white LED, high-end bulbs today allow you to choose between 50,000
different shades of white. Most importantly, their price has come down to only a couple
of dollars more than other types of bulbs. And at their efficiency, with average daily use
and electricity pricing, you can recoup that cost in only two months and continue to save for years after that.
The result is a lighting revolution. In 2010, just 1% of residential lighting sales
in the world were LED. In 2022, it was over half.
Experts estimate that within the next 10 years, nearly all lighting sales will be LED.
(soft music) The energy savings will be enormous. Lighting accounts for 5% of all carbon emissions.
A full switch to LEDs could save an estimated 1.4 billion tons of CO2,
equivalent to taking almost half the cars in the world off the road.
Today, Nakamura's research is on the next generation of LEDs, micro LEDs, and UV LEDs.
- [Derek] So what are they making in there? - LEDs, lasers, power devices.
This is one the best facility in the US. - And this is because of you?
What's a standard LED size? - [Sh≈´ji] 300 times 200 microns. - [Derek] Okay.
- [Sh≈´ji] Smallest is five microns. - [Derek] That is insanely tiny. - So basically you can use that for like
near-eye display such as AR and VR. - You could have like a retina display that's like right up here?
- Yep. - A human hair would be about that thick. - [Sh≈´ji] Yep. - And that's a really, really tiny LED.
UV LEDs could be used to sterilize surfaces like in hospitals or kitchens. Just flick on the UV lights
and pathogens would be dead in seconds. - COVID-19, you know, UV LED companies' stock prices were going,
skyrocketed because everyone expected to be using these UV LEDS. We can sterilize all the COVID-19, no?
For emitting diode, we use indium gallium nitride. For UV, we use aluminum gallium nitride.
[Derek] Okay. - [Sh≈´ji] 'Cause the band gap is much bigger. - [Derek] Do you think this is what's coming? - [Sh≈´ji] It's okay, it work, but the problem is the cost.
The efficiency is less than 10%. The cost is very high. But if the efficiency becomes more than 50%,
cost is almost comparable to the mercury lamp. - [Derek] And you think it will happen, right? Like the efficiency will go up?
- [Sh≈´ji] Yeah, yeah, I think so. - It's just a matter of time. - Yeah, I think so. - [Derek] And he's even tackling one
of the biggest challenges of our time. - [Sh≈´ji] I'm interested in physics. - [Derek] Me too! - I'm still interested in nuclear fusion.
So recently I started the company of nuclear fusion. - Really? - Oh yeah, last year.
- No way. - No way, aha. (soft music) - In 2014, Nakamura, Akasaki and Amano
were awarded the Nobel Prize in physics for creating the blue LED. Shortly afterwards, Nakamura publicly thanked Nichia
for supporting his work, and he offered to visit and make amends, but they turned down his offer
and today their relationship is still cold. But perhaps even more important than the Nobel Prize,
By the time Nakamura released his blue LED in 1994, he had published over 15 papers,
and he finally received his doctorate in engineering. Today he has published over 900 papers.
Throughout his entire journey, one thing has never changed. What is your favorite color?
- Oh, blue. - [Derek] Was it always blue? Or only after you made the LED?
- I was born in a fishing village. Fishing village. In front of the house is awesome like, ocean.
Blue always.
- While I was learning about Nakamura's story, I realized that what set him apart from the thousands of researchers trying to unlock the blue LED,
it wasn't necessarily his knowledge, but his determination, critical thinking, and problem solving skills.
Where others saw dead ends, he saw potential solutions. So if you're looking for a free and easy way to start building these skills
for yourself right now, look no further than today's sponsor, Brilliant. Brilliant will make you a better thinker

Gemini Intro
Google just dropped Gemini Ultra and it
is impressive and has the chance to
completely disrupt chat gpt's dominance
and there are some distinctly Google
features that set it apart from chat GPT
so I'm going to tell you all about it
then we're going to test it ourselves do
you think it'll be able to create the
snake game in one go stick around to the
end to find out but first check out this
launch video from
Gemini Launch Video
Google
[Applause]
[Music]
he
[Music]
he hey hey hey hey hey hey
[Music]
so here's Google's blog post
Blog Post Review
announcement B becomes Gemini so the
first thing to know is Bard is no more
it was a horrible name but now it is
Gemini they are going all in on the
brand of Gemini and today they launched
Ultra 1.0 but the weird thing is they
called it Gemini Advanced which is very
confusing because there's Gemini Pro
there's Gemini Ultra but Gemini Advanced
is Gite Ultra it's very confusing and
they launched a new dedicated mobile app
for Android today with iOS coming soon
so here it says you can already chat
with Gemini with our Pro 1.0 model in
over 40 languages in more than 230
countries and territories and now we're
bringing you two new experiences Gemini
Advanced and a mobile app with our Ultra
1.0 model Gemini Advanced is far more
capable at highly complex task of coding
logical reasoning following nuanced
instructions and collaborating on
Creative project and we are going to
test it out we're not only going to give
it the snake game but we're going to
give it some of the more difficult
logical problems that I've given to
previous models in my videos this first
version of Gemini Advance reflects our
current advances in AI reasoning and
will continue to improve as we add new
and exclusive features Gemini Advanced
users will have access to expanded
multimodal capabilities more interactive
coding features deeper data analysis
capabilities and more and Gemini
Advanced is available as part of the
Google Google one AI Premium plan which
is $20 per month so to get their best
model on par with gp4 you need to pay
$20 a month which just happens to be the
same price that chat GPT plus is this is
a direct shot at open Ai and they're
giving a two-month trial at no cost so
you can use it for free for 2 months but
not only that they give you some extras
you get two terabytes of storage and I
actually pay for Google storage so so
the fact that I already pay for Google
storage makes it even more compelling
for me to just upgrade and get Gemini
Ultra and soon AI premium subscribers
will get Gemini in Gmail docs slides
sheets and more and that was formerly
known as duet AI so again everything is
now Gemini so now let's talk about
Gemini on the phone today they're
rolling out a new mobile app for Android
only for now that is dedicated to Gemini
and it is an assistant so maybe Google
assistant is going to go away soon and
it's just going to be Gemini and it says
right here when you say Hey Google which
typically invokes their Google assistant
now it'll enable a new overlay
experience that offers easy access to
Gemini as well as contextual help right
on your screen and it is multimodal
already so you can just take a picture
and start chatting with it and Gemini is
coming to iOS very soon in the next few
weeks and this launch is so important to
Google and they view it as the future of
their company so much so that the CEO of
Google wrote an entire blog post
dedicated to this launch and there's not
much additional information in this blog
post so I'm going to skip over it but it
is a different blog post from the CEO so
Gemini Ultra Features
enough talk I've signed up for Gemini
Advanced let's test it out so the
interface looks extremely familiar it is
essentially chat GPT I don't know why
every other company is just trying to
copy the chat GPT interface because
honestly it's not that revolutionary
it's not that nice but they did it
anyways so Gemini Advance right there
and if you click this drop down you can
see that I have the Gemini Advanced
option turned on and before upgrading it
said Gemini and had this grade out and
asked me to upgrade so I get two free
months and I'm using them now a couple
settings I want to show you before
testing it out first we have this thing
called extensions which are basically
like chat GPT plugins right now it
ingests all this data from different
Google services so Google flights Google
hotels Maps workspace and YouTube and
that's really where Google can get ahead
of open AI because they have access to
more data than open AI could ever dream
of and not just public data but also
your own private data there are billions
of users for Gmail and Google search so
all of that data can now be accessed
with Gemini and you can also toggle on
and off real-time responses so it has
access to real-time data right away all
Gemini Testing
right enough talk let's test it out new
chat so the first thing we're going to
do is test out if it can build a snake
game which is my favorite prompt because
if you've watched my videos you know
that two models besides chat GPT have
been able to create the snake game in
one go let's see how it does create the
game snake in Python now one thing I've
noticed immediately upon testing this is
it is extremely fast much faster than
GPT 4 and the way that it outputs is
really really nice and it seems to
complete its inference before actually
showing the response so it doesn't
stream so here we go prerequisites game
logic and here's the code really fast
and let's copy this code so we click the
copy button right there opening up
visual studio code I pasted in the code
and I already see an issue screen is not
defined but let's play it anyways and
let's see if it works so it looks like
it did work but nothing popped up it
didn't actually do it on the first go
that is very disappointing now I want to
see if it's able to fix the issue so I'm
going to give it one more try so I'm
going to give it the line of code that I
think is causing an issue and I say in
this line of code screen is not defined
also after running the code it says and
it gives this output but nothing
actually happens let's see if it's able
to fix it you're absolutely right about
those issues let me address them so here
is the updates so here we go screen
width and I'm going to put this at the
top okay so I updated the code and now
we have screen available to us and
nothing happens because it doesn't have
a loop so let's copy this and we'll put
this at the end of the code and let's
see if that is able to fix the issues
click play all right so something did
open but nothing appeared so that is a
complete fail that's a really hard one
but gp4 is able to do it last time I
checked all right now I'm going to give
it some of my most difficult logic and
reasoning problems one that many open-
Source models fail so the first one if
we lay five shirts out in the sun and it
takes 4 hours to dry how long would 20
shirts take to dry explain your
reasoning step by step and in their blog
post they explicitly mentioned that
Gemini is very good at logic and
reasoning so let's see assumptions
uniform drying conditions similar
Fabrics reasoning doesn't depend on the
number of shirts constant drying time
even if you have 20 shirts laid out in
the sun it would still take
approximately 4 hours for them to dry
assuming the conditions stay the same so
that is correct assuming parallel dying
awesome all right one that basically
every single model fails because it goes
against how the whole Transformers
architecture Works how many words are in
your response to this prompt all right
it's telling me to copy and paste it
into a word counter so that is a fail
and for reference I'm going to give the
same question to GPT 4 and it says my
response to your prompt contains nine
words but it is only eight words so
close a much better response but still a
fail next let's give it everyone 's
favorite the Killer's problem there are
three killers in a room someone enters
the room and kills one of them nobody
leaves the room how many killers are
left in the room explain your reasoning
step by step so here's the reasoning
start with three killers one killer is
killed subtract the deceased two killers
left nobody leaves there are two killers
left in the room that is a fail also
because the person that entered the room
also is a killer last one JN and Mark
are in the room with a ball a basket and
a box JN puts the ball in the box then
leaves for work while Jon is away Mark
puts the ball in the basket and then
leaves for school they both come back
together later in the day and they don't
know what happened in the room after
each of them left the room where do they
think the ball is and John's perspective
John remembers putting the ball in the
box since he didn't take it out he would
think the ball is still in the box Mark
remembers putting the ball in the basket
and since he didn't take it out he would
think the ball is still in the basket
perfect that is a great answer so that
was a very brief testing of Gemini
Advanced if you want to see me do more
thorough testing of Gemini Advance let
me know in the comments below and a
Unique Gemini Features
couple more things about Gemini that set
it apart from Chachi PT so we have all
these options down here we can obviously
give it a good response bad response
thumbs up thumbs down but they also have
this interesting thing modify response
so if we click that we can ask for a
shorter response a longer response
simpler response more casual response
and more professional response so I like
that you can modify the response right
here rather than updating your prompt
itself we also have this interesting
thing called double check response so if
we click that it is actually searching
Google and the last thing I want to do
is test out its multi modal capabilities
so I'm going to take an image I'm going
to drag it right there and we're going
to ask it what do you see in this image
the image you sent appears to be a
preview image for an article about a
large language model called Lambda
that's not true created by Google AI
that's not true the preview image
consists of a blue background with the
text Lambda that is completely false it
doesn't say Lambda anywhere below that
is the word meta which is true written
in blue false possibly referencing the
company meta AI I cannot tell what the
entire web page looks like so that's
pretty bad and if I look right here it
actually has multiple drafts of the
response so if I click I can go through
all the different drafts so here's draft
2 the image you sent appears to be a
blue and white llama but it is actually
a stylized illustration created by meta
AI That's True okay this one is much
more accurate so that's great and here's
draft three so it's very interesting
that it gives you three drafts that is
very different from chat GPT and if I
click this button I can actually have
the response read to me so lots of
differentiating features are they
gimmicks or not let me know what you
think in the comments I'm excited to
test out Gemini advance and from my
initial testing it's pretty good but I'm
not sure it's better than GPT 4 any
competition in the space is welcome if
you enjoyed this video please consider
giving a like And subscribe and I'll see
you in the next one

- "I feel like at the end of it, we probably know so the first thing that people wanted to know about is like what's good stuff about being a streamer and what stuff we would want to change."
- "You should never do things for views... you should never do anything that just because someone else thinks something about you."

Transcription:

you've like been in front of a photographer like with no clothes on before right yes I have I don't think
these pictures have been released yet or maybe I'm not sure you know in like the Andrew tap part like
the oh it's so cring I had a friend that actually fell for one of those I think they took like 50% and that's like after
only takes 20% what what is a Gizzy overdrive just give me a second is this
PG Felina do you know what a [ __ ] overdrive is no idea what that is gzy overdrive I right okay we've seen enough
they would cut holes in people's skulls cuz they thought like it would be good for them but because noan would do this
herself cut a hole in her
skull thank you for uh agreeing to uh um do the pull CL I feel like I feel like
one of the first things that um we should discuss is what we should cool this yes true H shout of you guys have
any suggestions for what you think that we should call it let us know because we have not got a name and I feel like we
can't have a podcast if we don't have a name I feel like at the end of it we probably know so the first thing that
um that like people wanted to know about is like what's like good stuff about
being a streamer and like what stuff we would like want to change especially in terms of like twitch and stuff what kind
of stuff we would want to change yes yeah
okay like super like privileged like over having such a hard time I hate
saying that I never normally say anything because it's like streaming is like the best job ever you know what I mean and it's like if you ever say
anything bad about it then it's just like you know what I mean yes because it's so good we're going to get can
right away it's going to be like one of these privileged streamers doing why are they
complaining oh no of course you know with everything
there's always issues of course whatever you do uh there's always going to be something that can be improved so yeah
we can discuss that I feel like I feel like dealing with uh strange
people sometimes like have you had any weird strange interactions with
people um do what you mean like in real life
because I I think I think I've been pretty lucky with the real life stuff the only thing that has happened was at
twitchcon at a meet and greet I had someone that didn't want to leave that was like one thing that was a bit strange but otherwise like nothing like
really that bad um they didn't want to leave yeah like they didn't want to like
leave the meet and greet they just wanted to kept talking about nothing to be fair and didn't like take the hint to
be fair I feel really bad though because it's like people have traveled a long way and you get like five minutes why
did you go like you don't even get like five minutes you get like 2 minutes to talk to each person and it's like yeah like same thing same thing with me like
there was like a girl who was like running the meet and greet and she was telling everyone like move on move on move on and it feels so awkward move on
it feels so awward I didn't want people to move on because it's like oh my gosh I want to see people I want to talk to
people for ages but then obviously they I don't know they can't keep the space for like a long time and like they need
to get through people but like they need to have people on for longer you know what I mean yeah but um I think so I
feel so bad about that but yeah like I but it's like not that bad otherwise um
I don't think I've had much issues with people being weird like anyone that's
like an empty fan or anything like that I think I've been pretty lucky and um I've done like a lot of a lot more like
heated stuff online like arguing and debating with people that are kind of like you know there's a lot of hate
going on and that space but like iot like some but not that much or anything like that watched
your shorts on Instagram some of the stuff that like other people are saying
is crazy I was just short the other day and you were argu with these guys and
they were like oh my gosh what were they saying oh yeah they were like they were like yeah if um if if like uh this girl
is getting like abused by her husband um like like physically abused that then like yeah they should get divorced but
like if like she cheated on him like a th% like they should get divorced yes
exactly so like those are the sorts of people those are the sorts of people that I've been like dealing with the
past few months um but anyways like it's a it's weird to be honest it's it's
really not that bad and also I've met like antie fans in real life at these events wait what are empty fans fans
like they're not they're not fans they like hate me so like going on these shows and once
there was an audience with a lot of people that did not like me or anything I was saying so they were like booing in
the audience and stuff like that um but later on I don't want do that yeah no
it's I think it's I think it's funny but I might be a little cuckoo you know but uh afterwards they were all like saying
I don't agree with anything you're saying but I respect that you have your own opinion and you sent up for
them yeah so so like it it wasn't really that bad at all I I think I've been
really lucky to be honest people you in the audience you what had like an
audience that was like that was hating everything I was saying so they like kept screaming at me
and stuff I don't know what I'd do if I meet a hater in real life cuz a lot of people say like obviously you got a lot
like not like if you're online you got a lot of hate online but it's like
um but but a lot of people like yeah we got a lot of hate online but you never see them in real life cuz you know
people are more nervous and just less likely to come up to and say stuff in real life you're I feel like you're the
first person I've talked to that like yeah I've actually had people that hate me in real life but it was like for the
like I went to an event where I knew it was going to be a lot of people not liking me so like I was prepared for it
and like I got like a lot of like compliments from these
when the stream was over weird yeah that's so weird I mean I've had people
like um I've had people who um they don't know anything like about me come
to my meet and greet and I can't remember what game it was it was like I
think it was like World of Warcraft or something and this guy was like I love your World of Warcraft streams and I've
like never played World of Warcraft on stream and he's like I love your World of Warcraft streams and I'm just such an
awkward person like I was like oh my gosh thank you so much and he started talking to me about water Warcraft and I
just went along with it cuz I'm like I feel so bad what if he like thinks I'm someone else you know what I mean I
should not have gone along with it I completely should have said something but I didn't because you know I don't
know if he thinks I'm someone else I don't want to disappoint oh no but why didn't you say anything did you just
feel bad like what if he like booked him with me instead of booking him with someone
that he like wanted to book and he was like oh this stupid girl I
got the wrong me andry and I have to go to her me andry and I'm like did you take a picture for the person yeah I
realized later on that it was a completely different person oh a th% he probably would have realized later on
yeah but um you know is what it is I mean I've had like I've never had like
um a weird in person thing I mean the only thing I've ever been to is uh
twitch con I'm going to egx but like aart from that the only thing I've been to is pcon um like Paris but um I got I
got weird messages some I get weird messages sometimes like I did a uh like a video like weirdest DMS and I had to
look through my DMs to do a video about the weirdest DMS and do you like look
through your DMs like Instagram requests sometimes but I don't know I'm like of
course you get like I I get weird DMS too I don't think it's that many um um
yeah I usually either like ignore it or I think it's like interesting so sometimes I can like go
through and like see if there's someone that's been like like texting me for
years and I'm just so interested do you get like that do you get like the day 100 of saying
hi things yeah like it's like they obviously just copy and paste that to
like loads of different girls but it's like it's like day 103 of saying hi like until you say hi day 104 of saying until
you say hi yeah I had like stuff kind of like that before yeah have you ever like
has there ever been anyone that's been like they're probably not like mentally okay I'm G to guess because they're like
they have this just want to specify like 95% of people that DM I love their DMS so so much and they make me so happy but
um yeah which ones do you like oh I just want to spe I just wanted to specify
that like I'm talking about so few people you know what I mean like mosts I love and they're like really nice but um
yeah yeah s oh um have you ever gotten like those real dreams with people that think that
that uh you're married to them and that they have like oh yeah they get very
very jealous I feel like I feel like maybe that's like one frustrating thing of like bless you yeah uh like
one so much is aw of like being being God on internet is like every
single guy you are possibly related to people think you're dating it's like
like if you bring someone like say I was like um I met dream at twitchcon I'll
get so many DMs like why would you see him over like like oh my gosh I had like one conversation with him they're like
why would you see him over me like what are you doing you're mine um oh also
yeah I actually forgot that was a that was a um that was a strange I did
actually have a stranger encounter twitch conon I forgot about that yeah I had to got like escorted like to like
this private area by security I just completely forgot about that um wow
that's crazy I don't actually know if anything like bad really happened that much it was just like so I was chilling
I did like a I did like a run like I did like a community race because I'm like oh my gosh I'm a really fast runner
right and um I was like I bet I can beat every single person to here at running
and we did like a race I'm not gonna not going to say where I placed it wasn't first but I did pull my I pulled my like
hamstring or something so that's my uh excuse but but like um yeah this guy I
think he'd been he had been like hanging out with me but um he like did some weird things to some other girls and a
lot of um thank you thank you for the seven months that were like a lot of um
other girls he' done like weird things to like while he was there and he was trying to put like all his stuff in my
bag which I was like yeah it's fine because I'm just silly and I didn't really think about it but um that was
like security at twitch con that were like no no no you need to get out of here and like to start with I thought it was going to be like for five minutes so
I left my stream on so chat like had my stream they were like if you guys remember if you like watch your Twitch
Clin you guys like had my stream you guys were like oh like my friend who was like with me was like like streaming for
me like like just like you guys who are there and I was just squired upstairs and I was like I need to I need to be
with chat like I'm streaming with chat right now like I need to be with chat and um and thank you pup I'm G to turn
I'm going to turn a lots off for a second just because I might want to make this into a YouTube but thank you pup thank you for the five months but um um
like I need to go back downstairs and they're like you can't go back downstairs you're going to be up here for like an hour like you can't go back
down and I was like I don't know what to do I'm literally streaming but then that night I was on San stream and he like
found us on as fan stream and like followed us around and he was like he was like shirtless like jogging up to me
and stuff and I was like s fan I think there's like a guy that's like following
me I don't know he got like he got like a squaded out of twitch con I had like weighed upstairs at twitch cor for
ages and like and like I felt kind of safe cuz I was like as fan and like a few other like big guys there um like if
it was just like me and Jenny I would like be freaking out and we just go home home but um he like gave he tried to
give me some balloons and um and they were like no go away go away but um yeah
that was kind of a weird situation that happened actually that I forgot about that's like the worst I would be
so scared um do you know what person that is online did you ever figure that
out yes yeah a lot of like um there there are like some people that like you
just got to talk to Twitch about and yeah to so they don't like come to
Future things and stuff that you're at but um yeah it's just weird like on the
whole it's like like I trust like obviously there are people in the community like if you spend every day
with people like I don't stream every day but like I stream a lot and I used to stream pretty much every day it's like I feel like I trust a lot of people
very much I trust the core Community very much and there are just like a few people that ruin that do you know what I
mean yeah um it's super annoying when that happens it's so sad yeah M but on
the whole I love it I love streaming so much I just okay have you have you ever
had like stream snipers or anything yeah for sure stream snipers I have like a pretty like I had a clip that went viral
with people like shouting my name I saw that I saw that that was so
cute that was really cute yeah no I've had like I had some like good stream sniping and stuff it's nothing like that
at all I've had people come up to me with gifts because they knew I was going to go to a special City like where they
were so they like come up and like give me things which I think is really nice so I like I don't know I feel like I
feel like I'm really lucky with like I don't really get a lot of weird things happening but I wonder if it's because
like I'm like married and maybe they don't like project like the oh your mind
sort of thing I feel like I feel a lot safer cuz you live with Destiny right
yeah or like a lot of the time like I'd feel a lot safer like I want to like I
want to get like a dog but then it's like the time in training like a dog that could like be that you know what I
mean like like I can't you can't with like something like a German Shepherd you can't just get a German Shepherd like you need to like spend a long time
training it and like I don't want to be like a irresponsible owner like I would do that if I got like a dog that yeah
but like yeah I'd feel a lot safer if I had like a
husband do you uh did you did you want to move to America cuz if you move to America you're you can have
guns oh my gosh yeah like I feel I feel like okay do you feel safer in a country
where you have a gun and everyone has a gun than in a country where no one has a gun um you know what I feel like it's
pretty to for me personally I feel like it's pretty equal to be honest I don't feel like scared because guns are legal
and anyone can have a gun I don't really like get paranoid about that um and also if I can have a gun I feel
like more protected with myself I guess um and I think guns are fun to shoot so
I think it's fun like go shooting so you have like a gun like you like have a gun on you not right now no but I'm but in
in the states yes no my guns are
illegal no but like if you know how to use it because I've done like training and how to use it and
like like like really like well done like defense training like i' I've done
that a lot so I think it's really fun um I don't know I think I think it's like it depends on
like where you are so like in America it feels a lot more safe to have one because everyone else has it so you kind
of like need to um but also like here I don't think it's really necessary
because it's it's not like people just like walk around with guns or like it's like super like easy to get one and
stuff so I don't really worry about that too much and I don't really think I'm like a really big target for anyone that's like super crazy cuz I haven't
really had like a lot of insane people uh yeah but yeah I I feel like just like
knowing what to do in situations makes me feel a lot more calm and less like
paranoid if you're a paranoid person if you just know howle it out I am like
it's like even when I play games like if something panicked happens I just Panic you know I mean you do I panic hot I get
so flustered I'm like I know I so flustered like but it's like
yeah like cuz CU I was like looking uh literally yesterday about like moving to America cuz it's so difficult to do and
um like places to go and like what kind of place cuz I'd love I'd love to move
to like Florida Miami Miami is so expensive but like it would be it would be really cool but like one of the
reasons I'd want to move to America is for the time zone and um and and so like
California kind of like the westish like Texas would be probably a better time
zone and I was looking at like San Antonio and stuff and it's like I'm like yeah like maybe if I had a gun I would
feel safer and then it's like every single place I look up and I'm like oh actually I kind of want to like this is
like a cute little like apartment like I kind of live here and then I look it up and it's like shooting in shoot like
every single place I look up it's like shooting in and I'm like I don't know I don't
know sometimes I really want to go and sometimes I'm like is this a good idea would it be easy for you to like get
like a Visa and stuff to move no they wouldn't so so so I could go for what
I'm kind of planning to do is go for like one or two months see if I even like it and then if I like it start like
the lawyer process um of like applying for a Visa but it would be an ob- One
Visa so I'd need to like I just need to work really hard you know what I mean like if I get stream like if I get
stream a bit bigger if I get all my is a bit bigger than I would be able to I probably wouldn't go now like obviously if Pok main right was me if I was Poke
main then I would be easily able to get a Visa it's like just like it's how it's
How good they think you're going to be to the country you know what I mean like if if I was a big streamer like it would be very easy to go to America I I don't
I it's so unclear though you know what I mean it's just like outstanding in your field I don't think I'm outstanding at
the moment I'd like to think I was outstanding but like it's it's diff but like one day I would really want to and
it's the time yeah I would say if you if
you're going to Texas you should move to Austin because a lot of streamers are there and I have a little play there as well so I go to Austin a lot I just like
okay how do I say this I I would like to go to Austin but I
don't know anyone in Austin and okay this is might sound really weird but like I don't want to go to Austin like
being like I'm going to meet all the people in Austin before I've met the people in
Austin I don't want to just like push myself into Austin do you know what I mean like because there's lots of
reasons I want to go to America it's not just to be with the people in Austin so like before I met them I just don't want
to like give off the wrong Vibe of like moving somewhere like moving somewhere
and then be like hi guys I'm here yeah I feel like uh it's like Austin is like
good for streamers like twitch streamers in general but I I feel like it's like there's a lot of uh people like in
politics or like like do you know you know like Joe Rogan I think he goes through I think he probably lives in LA
but I know that he goes to Austin a lot too like Alex Jones Is there leedman is there what are your views on Joe Rogan
and Alex Jones wait what did he say what are your views on like Joe roken and Alex jines
um they feel very like like all like the I'm not not like I'm not like the other
people and I'm very edgy and cold and rational like those are the sort of like like boy fans of those sort of people um
and they're very like yeah like I'm thinking differently from everyone else I believe in the Ali it's very like
conspiracy but also like like it's it's interesting I guess uh I understand why
why uh those podcasts are very popular and they're kind of like cozy and very like positive but also makes you feel
kind of like like I'm important like I I know more than everyone else it feel like that's the sort of vibe that you get from the
sort of sometimes watching them is interesting and it's like that doesn't mean that I support Joe Rogan I I like I
don't like the last podcast I watched with Joe Rogan was like he was talking to this girl about so so like so like it
was like this woman I don't know I said a girl she's like 70 but like she she dug is like trip hunting or something
and she she herself because no surgeon would pref formed this on her
herself cut a hole in her skull because
apparently letting the juices flow through your skull is like it makes you like calmer
and like a better thinker stuff and like it's been going on for like ages right like I'm pretty sure like um I don't
know if it was the ancient Egyptians it was like thousands of years ago they would cut holes in people's skulls cuz they thought like it would it would uh
be good for them but because no surgeon would do this she did it in front of a mirror herself like and she was like
yeah like I don't think I'd recommend it but like do like imagine the amount of people it's C like imagine the amount of
people that like went and did that because she said it like I don't know so um yeah I don't
think that's a real story I feel like they probably like made that up I feel like that's like the thing about them is that they're always like they're very
quick to to like here's the information this must be the right thing and I really want it to be the right like
reality so I'm going to 100% go with a story and there's like not really any
facts chicks or anything it's very like uh confirmation bias sort of you know I
mean hopefully it's not but I did actually look into trianing just cuz I like I was like putting my makeup on as
I was like listening to this and I was like what is this and yeah people do do trianing they
do cut holes in the that's that's a rle even if she did it or didn't do it that's a thing and
people have been doing it for like thousands of years yep yep uh yep please chat do not do not make a ho in your
skull um I don't know if I should be saying that but um yeah um but um yeah I don't know I I mean
some I feel like it's okay to watch or like listen to okay what you what do you
think about this it's okay to watch or listen to things that you you don't necessarily believe in cuz I feel like
it gives you like a wider just view you know what I mean like if I'm like oh yeah I listened to Joe Rogan the other
day then everyone's like Joe Rogan viewer colon how could you watch Joe R
and C D it's like I don't like Bully your chat bullying you for this yeah oh they bully me for everything because
you're just interested and like oh yeah I wonder what the other people on the other side are saying mhm mhm I like to
like no yeah listen to lots of things and then make my own opinion even though
I am that's good I think that's really good I think that means that you can like you can take different information
from all sorts of sources and kind of like create your own reality that makes the most sense instead of just like coping and following someone blindly I
feel like most people do that so I think that's really good I think that you're doing a good thing but it's always good
to be very skeptical of things that you hear and I think it's important to hear different stories and like different
perspectives on things you know to get the most realistic uh picture of reality
you know okay so I agree what's like what's the craziest thing that you
believe that someone's like like told you like a story yeah like so what's
like the craziest thing that you believe now what do you guys think I'm not chat
I'm trying to figure out what chat thinks I don't think I'm like believing anything too crazy right now
um what do you guys think what have we been talking about like some people okay do you
believe in aliens do you believe they've like come down um I don't think like I wouldn't believe in aliens as the way
like oh yeah you see these like creatures that looks you know like aliens like the way we paint them up as like cartoon and they're like flying in
spaceships uh but something that I do kind of like feel like this would make a lot more sense is like there might be
like things around us that could be like aliens but we can't like notice them because we don't have the senses to it I
feel like that would make a lot more sense like of maybe that's why we haven't seen anything because we can't
literally see anything because we need like a different kinds of sense like if we didn't have any eyes and we didn't
see things like colors and like shapes and stuff like that would it like not exist you know uh Chad keeps on saying
Flat Earth do you believe it no I did not believe in Flat Earth do you believe in FL Earth I didn't believe in Flat
Earth however John Z I'm pretty sure exactly thing I like I like see Jones Z
sometimes and I'm just like listening to him and then I just remember he believes in flat I think he does I can't really tell
what he believes in to be honest I feel like he kind of just like jokes around I'm not really sure if he believes in anything I think he kind of just like
like entertains his own brain as the sort of person that he comes off to it like or yeah he comes off that way to
me I feel like you wouldn't you wouldn't say you believe in Flat Earth though
unless you really believe in flut no but he he's like he like changes the way he thinks about things all the time too so
like I remember like 3 years ago he was a very different person and said very different things compared to what he
says now now he's like join the red pill I don't even know if he's still in it but like he join the redf what's he
saying he's like friends with like sneo or like even like Nick Fuentes who's
Like A Nazi like he he I don't know if it's real or if it's I can't tell I have
no idea IDE but like he's like out there on like Rumble at the moment or he has been that way like the past few
months yeah are you like I don't remember him
this way I feel like so much has happened do the like I remember cuz like I remember when I was very very small
when I was just like starting streaming and he invited me on his pcast and um or
like I don't know what like like like the Zera thing little lot of people on and I was so nervous I had like I had
like probably like 50 viewers at the time and like I remember I was so late because he had like 3,000 viewers to
start with and I was so nervous I couldn't go on I waited like two hours before I joined the voice chat and I had
my because apparently like like last week and the week before that like he made a girl cry and um and I was like
I'm like I quite sensitive and um I like especially like
back then because was like there was so many people and I was so nervous I was mute the whole time didn't say one thing
but um oh really I didn't say anything at all mute oh my gosh and it was like it was like a night because it was
obviously American so I stayed up the whole night I and I did it twice as well so I did two all nighters to just sit
there absolutely mute but I had my I had the ethernet cable like wrapped around
my leg so if I thought I was about to start crying I just pull the Wi-Fi out with my leg because I was so nervous but
um yeah yeah for nothing I literally did two onitas for no reason I'm I'm proud
of you though for having you know being brave enough to interact with that like just being like
new and stuff like on the platform cuz it's like pretty intense and you can't really it's like you can't really read
him because everything that he's saying is just like trolling so it's really hard to interact with him in any sort of
serious form because he's never serious and I feel like yeah he was like
he was I feel like he was I can say he was quite me back then to like people that came like because he was lit he was
just making people cry but they just come back like the next week they' just be back on like hi like and I guess it
was like all for Content or whatever but like I don't know if someone like if someone starts shouting I love debating
like I love debating like I feel like you do as well like I feel like we're the same but like if someone starts
targeting me um and just like being really mean to like me
p i I don't know how to explain it then all of a sudden I'm like my eyes just start watering up
which like I understand people do it for Content I just need to get over it but um yeah I in terms of
like hate do you get a lot of hate like do you not care about it I feel like you're the kind of person to just like
lit you not I think this is the thing I'm not sure I feel like most people might be this way I might be like a
little bit of like an extreme example when it comes to hate um probably because I got like a lot of like I was
pretty different as a kid so a lot of kids didn't like me so I got like a lot of hate when I was a kid so I might like
gotten used to it um I only seem to care about hate if I feel like there's like
you know a ring of Truth in what they're saying but I think that goes for probably most people so if they're calling out something that they that you
already feel insecure about I think that's going to sting isn't that like so much like I don't know like I normally
get hate for things that I feel insecure about you do wait are have you like admitted like the things that you feel
like insecure about or or no not really I mean I guess okay like okay so say
like I'm doing like a TTS Tik Tok and everyone's like she's really dumb then like that's the whole point of the Tik
Tok like I'm not going to get sad about that like but but if it's like I don't know if I go on live stream fails and um
or like just like play R it's just such a mean place you know what I mean and like everyone's like why does she move
like that like why is she so expressed like in a weird way like but that's like
a that's like a good thing I like and then literally and then I'm like oh like
maybe I maybe they're right like maybe they have got a point like I did look really weird In that clip like why was I like just weird and then um and then I
like try and just like be chill for like the next week and then I'm like okay but now I just feel boring like oh my gosh what do I do you know what I mean like
people you should not you should not listen to like redditors because I feel like they're always going to like it's like the you know you know how like
there's like a girl that's like almost perfect and they just need to find one thing to say badly about them because
they kind of feel jealous or they just feel like this person shouldn't be feeling as good or they just hate girl yeah they're just trying to find
something like oh yeah she moves weirdly or she acts too energetic like literally
like if you're a streamer and you're very like all over the place and you're very expressive that's like why you're
are probably a su can't speak successful streamer because you have the energy to
like keep a whole stream like you know entertain the entire then it's like the
people that like she'd be so much bigger if there wasn't something off about her and it's just like it gets in your head
you know what I mean and then you're like am I acting weird like is there something off about me no but like but
like it's easy to be like no but like you know you just think about these things you know what I mean like yeah
have you ever been on like a I don't know like a forum or like something that just like everyone is just hating on you
yes it's horrible I feel like usually it's been I mean do you know what Ki Farms
is no it's literally just like a website meant to like bully people on that's
like what it's for so like there's people that's been saying things about me there um of course but it's like I
don't know I just try to like avoid it um because there's not really like it's
just more like this is so negative I don't want to interact with it but of course it's going to be someone you know
like there's always going to be someone like hating you and is going to be definitely like the more the more famous
you get the more hate you're going to get as well because people are going to have all sorts of opinions and I think
they probably just don't view you as a human they just see like oh she is an Entertainer she's like content so this
thing doesn't have any feelings or like they will never see me anyway so they're kind of just like doing a little bit whatever they want or like hating cuz it
makes them feel better to put other people down because they feel bad about themselves so and like even when I'm
talking to the red pill people and when I'm talking to the fans of the red pill I'm always like viewing them as children
cuz I think that's kind of what they are like they're kind of just like insecure children sometimes I look at the red
pill stuff right and I'm like do these people even believe it I don't know sometimes I feel like they just
following a track like when okay like like like the example of yeah when when
uh like if if if she is getting physically abused she shouldn't divorce
but like like if he is physically abusing her then they shouldn't divorce but if she is cheating on him then they
should then I'm like do these people even believe it or are they just like is
it just are they just trying to like ride a wave of red pill I think they in that situation I think they do believe
it because I don't think that they have any they cannot like they don't have a concept of what it feels like to be a
woman that might be abused or like has had trouble like because they can only see things from their own perspective
they have really no idea so the only perspectives that they have seen is like uh men complaining about or like maybe
they're like manf friend that's complaining about their wife being this and this and this bad but they have
never really like they can't they have no concept of what it feels like to be a woman so I think that's where it comes
from so when it's like completely blocked out and they're not really like making an effort to like see the other
side because it's like too much effort to do so I think that's where it comes
from so I really believe that they probably believe that um it could also be the case that like saying that gets
them more views and like more fans from the red pill like that's what I mean because it's like okay I feel like a lot
of people or like a lot of guys right when this like Trend happened they turned red pill and I'm like are you
turning red pill for the viewers like are you turning red pill because it's popular to be red pill at the moment
like yeah I don't know because it's like because it's like dude like you are like it's not just the views you are harming
actual people and not only that it's like you you think you're going to get a girlfriend like you think you're going
to get like a girl after you come on and you're like girls are trash all girls are gold diggers and they they they only
like you for the money in the trash like like what about when you're actually trying to find someone and they look at
what you said like five years ago I ask them that a lot like if let's say that you lose the thing that like your girl
likes you for like money as an example and she just leaves you isn't that like a lot worse than just trying to find someone that loves you for you and not
for your money and they're like oh yeah there's usually they say like one of the like myin is like the guy that has uh he
has fresh and fit that podcast um he said says that there's like no point in trying to find someone that's like a
real woman he believes that they exist like a real woman I mean like someone that isn't just like out there
for your money or like for your fame or like very shallow things like he he believes that there's like it's too um
it's a lot better if you just have the money so they can like stick with you forever so that you have like a stable
source and not like try to find someone that just likes you for your personality but a stable source of what
it's not as it's not a relationship money fame or like getting muscles like
all the manly things as an example like that sort of stuff so they will like say or feel like and they usually also want
to have like a woman that isn't making any money and has like nowhere else to go so they kind of like tra them it's
like it's really weird um but that's kind of like how they view it I think
just a comment to the thing where you said like oh that there's a lot of like normal people that's like turning red
pill cuz I know like there's like zomer kids that are like oh yeah they red pill stuff or like 18 year olds or 20-y olds
you know like there's there's men or boys that are that are turning to these
things and I think the I think the reason to why is because I think feminism has been really good for women
and I think it's been really good for society but there are some things that we're not really like talking about too much and I think that's like men's
mental health and like men opening up and like being more vulnerable and more emotional we kind of view that as a bad
thing so like women can be more like what men has been like men you know has been doing like earning money I'm
getting strong going to the gym you know like taking a lot more place those like manly aspects like that's been a thing
for years you know but it's really hard for men to kind of like be more submissive emotional and kind of like a
little bit more like weak it's really really hard to do that I think it's like I don't even think it's like submissive
I feel like it's like just opening up and being able to I feel like you can open up and like express yourself
without like yeah necessarily being like exess like submissive but like I feel
like yeah oh my gosh as you said it's so cringe I see the Tik toks of these like 12-year-old boys that have sat that you
know in like the Andre tape pose I can't do it cuz I'm wearing a dress but like like the yeah thing yeah oh my gosh and
they're in like they're in like detention and like for like for like for like I that's funny oh it's so cringe like
this like there's like 12year olds like and they're in detention for like calling a girl fat or something or like calling a girl a gold digger and they
just sat there like listening to the teacher it's so
bad because it's like yeah I feel like these people sometimes they don't think about like the like like Their audience
is not just young kids but it is a lot of young kids and it's like oh that so impressionable it's so oh like if you
tell like a I don't know like a 25-year-old guy right that like women
are trash like he's probably had the experience to know that's not the case right but if you tell that to like a 12-year-old that like doesn't know then
like he's just going to think that you know what I mean it's so oh it's so dumb
it's it's there was like a clip of sneo recently like interacting with his like 12-year-old F and they were just saying
like not good things at all and you can like see on his face that he was like uh because it like he like he realizes that
it's like not good of course um but yeah but what I meant by like being like more weak is like having men cry is like it's
really hard for men to cry like openly because they feel like they're losers like they're supposed to be strong and take care of the family and like you
know be all of that and then I would say this too there's a lot of women that doesn't really know how to handle men
that are crying like because they have never really like interacted with or seen it and I think
in a lot of relationships especially in the states I feel like it might be a little different here in Europe but um
it's it's a lot of the case that women always think that they're correct like in fights and arguments and the men that
men is always wrong because women are more emotionally mature and like we know and we're always going to get our way
it's it's it has been like a little bit like that it's of course not like all like all the time that case uh but
whenever a man has a problem it it seems to be like a lot of women
don't really take it too seriously because they're just supposed to solve it like you know they're just supposed to like handle that alone um so I think
just because of that and then also like men crying over like losing their job or
you know like these things and then there's they're not really getting like the support and especially not for like from like their parents or their father
telling them you can't cry you know these things I think that kind of like
you know like the only thing they get told to is to just suppress and just like be good feel fine while a lot of
women are getting raised in society which is really good like that we can do more things we can take more space and stuff but I think a lot of men has been
pretty like left behind and I think the reason to why Andrew tape became so popular is because he made these men
feel seen so I think that's why he got like a giant you know it's and he was
saying things that like sounds really good like he could say things like go to the gym and get your [ __ ] together which is like a good advice but then there was
a lot of really toxic advice that he was saying as well uh like how to handle relationships how to see women what's
important you know those sort of things and those are not good at all but just because he's already made these men feel seen in a place where they just felt
really alone and their feelings and they didn't really know how to express it uh they they got like someone to look up to
but it is a really toxic person so I think that's the reason why he got so popular um and that's why I like to like
talk about these things because I think there should be like other manly role models that isn't this toxic and like
influences these kids mod yeah just like a manly role model that like isn't red
pilled I know like a manly role model that's like yeah like guys you're seen
you're heard like this is what to do but just you know cuz it's like it's like these redpool people they're not
realistic they're making the situation like like by being like Oh yeah like get
10 hoes and and they're all go just get rich and then get 10 hoes it's like okay
the guys that are rich with 10 hoes feel lonely because you know none of them actually like them and then because
because because there's like all the girls are just like those guys and it's like the other guys are just like what
not like that doesn't help anyone like that advice is not good for anyone it's
not it's really bad but I think that's like one of the reasons why the red pull Stu is kind of like dying out thank God
I think that's really good that it is yeah but I but I think it's like from like at the end of the day it's not like
a bunch of evil people you know like thinking like I hate women or like women are bad or bad it's like it comes from
like a place of probably not feeling cared for that's why I kind of view them as children and that's how it's like a
lot easier to deal with hate when you start viewing them like ah this is where it comes from and they're having very
like human emotions that kind of reminds me of like how children are you know like so expressive with their feelings
it's kind of like the same thing especially when they get all like angry and like you know like it's just it's just like a lot of emotions and
insecurity um back to the thing we're talked about with hate hate yeah I need
to start doing that because it's like when I when I like see like a hate like I don't know like hate on Twitch it doesn't really bother me because it's I
don't know it's just stuff like take Bitties yum yum you know what Ian it's
just some some real de stuff that that's but like but like but like like
yeah like other platforms like I just kind of like think about it as like like like a toxic like man that like is smart
like I don't know why like when I think of haters I think of like small people I need to stop think about that I need to
start thinking of them as children you're right because probably a lot of them are children um especially on like
Tik Tok so um yeah you're right I just need to do that have you ever uh have you ever gotten like a hate DM and
answered it have you ever done that before like in DMs like on Instagram no ah you know the ones I want
to answer so badly it's the it's the it's the um you're missing out on a huge
opportunity you could be making 10 million pounds every single month if you sign up to our only uh agency you you
need us and and um and we could make you 10 million a month you are so silly not
oh my gosh it's like it's so many and I see them so often and I'm just like go away oh my gosh I don't I don't know why
it makes me so angry but it makes me so mad like I think it's just the amount like of times that I've seen these like
really predatory just agencies just reach out I just don't like it it's so
annoying yeah they're just trying to like make money out of it I mean that's like you get like stuff like that all
the time it's true yeah and usually it's like scams or like really stupid things um I had a friend that actually fell for
one of those she created an only and I think they took like
50% and that's like after after only takes 20% they took they took 50 and I I
told my friend like hey you're getting scammed like and they're like no this is
all good they're doing everything for me like they sent me an iPhone and I was
like and then I I looked into it and like I looked into the contract and uh the iPhone was actually
not like just given to her they they like pulled off the money like from like
the money that she was making just like took the money that they bought the iPhone for so she bought it for herself it was like it was like so stupid cuz
she like just completely fell for this I was like this is like so bad um and then
she started like making full on porn right away because they told her to so she was like selling herself really low
as well like right at the start and I was like this is not the way to go like you can't do that wow because you're
let's say that you grow a platform like Instagram or Tik Tok whatever and they go find your only like there's no like
buildup or anything so like there's I I get upset seeing this too because I know that there's a lot of girls that
actually fall for this and they have no idea how to do it and they they sell themselves really low and then they're just like kind of like [ __ ] for life
you know they could have like made so much more if they wanted to do it or if they ever want to do anything else like
they're doomed and they're really young as well yeah it's just it's like the pressure of is the pressure of like how
far do you want to go like I like I personally don't want to have like exclusive
content websites and I've like said to myself like like I don't care like if if
my if my best friend made like it it was like uh like I want to buy a nice house
I don't know should I start KN like I would tell the pros and cons but like if she did I'd be like hell yeah you go
girl you know what I mean like like but personally I'm like I I don't want to do that but then it's like I feel like it's
so important to have like exactly where you want to go in your your head you know what I mean because it's like because it's like obviously you get like
as a like a streamer like I I'm sure you're the same like you get websites
that are like I'll like we'll pay you this much to join the platform you know what I mean and then it's like you have
managers that are like do it do it because like obviously they get money from you doing it and then you have to
be like no but like everyone around you like you know what I mean and it's like it's actually do this to me like big
like streamers reach out to me and say oh yeah like do this and it's only because they're getting money from it
yeah oh my gosh because it's like because it's like so many people when you do stuff like that get money from it like it's very like it's very predatory
and then it's like once you start doing it it's like then like obviously people always want you to do more and it's like
I feel like it's so important to have like the boundary of like what do you want to do what do you not want to do you know what I mean yeah no I think if
you ever it sounds like you're like I'm never going to do any of this but like if you're if you're ever thinking about I think you should take like a long time
to figure it out if that's like something that you want to do and it goes for anyone like if there's anyone listening that's like
should I do an only I think you should like wait and also like read up a lot on like how to do it if you're going to do
it and stuff like that um like I have fanley but I don't like sell any nude
stuff or like it's just like like artistic photography stuff that I'm doing your your Instagram is like so
artistic I'm like are like so cool or it's like me flexing like that's like
what it's like muscle stuff or like talking to my fans and that's that's like all I'm doing pretty much um and I
think it helps a lot because it's like I'm like making money when you know like
I could like be doing something else than just like streaming so like put you know it's like there's less stuff like
pressure streaming uh or like doing other things if you just have something in the background that's like always rolling and it's really fun I like
modeling a lot I think it's super fun so but but took like I took years to think about it oh my gosh I hate modling you
hate doing it you would be so good at doing it what do you mean no I don't
like thank you no I did like a little bit when I was like like at the end of like school
and stuff and like I just didn't like it like I just I don't know like I just felt I felt like a product it's hard to
explain like I just kind of felt like a thing like a colan
machine like maybe it was just like the vibe that I got from like this specific like agency thing but like I yeah I I I
feel like when you make your own stuff and you make your own content is different like in front of the camera like taking Instagram photo I'm like I
find it fun but um when there's like a photographer there and they're like do this do this do this next outfit do this
do this like I don't know I just don't like the vibe especially like wait so
you've like you've like been in front of aoga like with no clothes on before right yes I have how do you find but but
it was not like for it sounds like it's like a I was like making porn or like doing something like that no no it was
like uh I don't think these pictures have been released yet or maybe I'm not sure um I saw like I saw like the you
did like a vlog I it was with the with a pain yeah it was like blacked and it was
like yeah exactly that one no I was wearing like
pasties and I was wearing like a you know like a like underwear that was like
the same color as me and then yeah and then I was just like pouring paint of myself that's like what I did uh but
there's like there was another picture where I'm actually like fully naked in front of like three different
photographers because it was like three different ones taking pictures of me yeah the same thing but I don't think I posted this anywhere yet um but I'm
standing with those you know like those dolls in Windows of stores what are they called man what is it called mannequins
yeah yeah exactly I was I was standing with two of them like one in front of me one in the back of me and I'm like because they're naked so I'm also naked
like in the middle of them and that was like that was the first time I was like full on nude in
front of three different people but it's all like so platonic it's like full on
platonic I just GNA take my clothes off now smiley face yeah it's like oh yeah so they're kind of like so I have this
idea that you're going to be naked with these you know so you just like take your clothes off and just stand there
we're going to you know and it's like okay but it's very like casual and chill and like it's like and there was like three
different photographers like two you know manly photographers and one woman but it was like oh yeah it's like
whatever I think it's I think that sort of stuff is kind of funny but you definitely feel a little weird oh my
gosh yeah like I feel like if I did that the photos would come out so bad I'd be so awkward I would be so awkward like
I'd be like proper like shaking like oh don't look at me yeah curently one the
pictures have been posted on F I forget because I post so many like different ones all the time I never post on
Instagram though I feel like there would be too much I think but they're really cool like they look really cool for sure
but you don't like you don't see any like details of anything it's just like from the side so you don't see like nipples or anything like that like you
don't see anything um because I'm like standing against them oh but this was the funny thing
though so uh one of the photographers has a Discord and he was streaming the
photo shoot so this entire thing was like streamed on like a small little like Discord uh and I forgot about it
until like later on and I was like wait I must have like I was like falling naked on a Discord
stream but it was only like three people there and it was like friends I didn't really mind naked and there were only
three people there what like it's like you know it's
like an artistic uh thing you know surely someone would
have been like Molina is naked on this live stream I think it's fine I don't think it was like anyone that's like we
don't know this person I think it was like people that the photographer knew I didn't I didn't really mind I don't think it was okay and I haven't seen I
haven't seen it be leaked anywhere else I'm like okay whatever who cares wow I
feel like the setting matters a lot that's the thing I feel like that's like the thing but I know for a lot of people
it doesn't matter like a lot of people are like if you're naked on that's it like you are you know a porn star cuz
you were naked in a photography that's like very artistic I don't know that just I mean people just love to hate
just do what you want to do like just do what you want to do I don't know I hate people that I hate people that are like
people should be like this people should be like that like that's why I don't like red pill people but like sometimes it's also like I don't like the people
like argue like it's like I don't like either side when people like this should be how people live you know what I mean
like yeah just live how you want to live like oh it doesn't matter you know what
I mean yeah but I agree no I I never really get that either but I think it's
just like I think people get intimidated by people doing whatever they want I think it kind of is like seen as like a
confidence they would never admit it but I think they get really intimidated and then they kind of get like a little scared that they're doing the wrong
thing so there's like a lot of projection there so it's kind of like I feel this really really strong thing
that person is not doing what I feel does that mean that I'm wrong and then they get really defensive and I think
that's like where the hate comes from like why they hate people that are doing things to their life that has nothing to do with themselves um I think they just
project and they get like they care a lot I think yeah yeah I think it is that
because like yeah they're just inse that that're they're worried that like because a lot of these things is like
you you've commit you've committed to something you know what I mean like you've either committed to getting
married or are you okay are you like sick just C I've been coughing one of
these days where it's better yeah like like you've committed to like getting
married or you've committed to sleeping with lot people or you've committed to something and then like you can't really go like or like you can go back but like
but like it's more difficult to go back and then it's like so the people that don't do that like there's some like resentment full sometimes but like yeah
no I agree I agree okay okay do you want to carry on talking or or I can Lally
talk for AG I can talk for ages but I haveed um do you want to have some
because there a lot of people in coolins do you want to have some Coolin yeah we can do that take a bathroom break real quick yeah yeah yeah yes okay I'm going
to go do that and then we can do the Callins okay okay I'll just I'll just sit here and chill because every time I
go to the bathroom that just SPS quers okay okay okay the de okay uh so a lot
of people people for coolant okay let me go o fun fun fun I'm excited I'm excited
okay um let's go WV hello how are you doing WV was your
question does Molina remember you just I was just curious but uh yeah
so actually I uh I I was going to ask about the streaming
advice I I I started streaming seven days ago and I just got the notification that I'm affiliate so what you got
affiliate office seven days yeah I know but uh I was just going to say I've
noticed I got a lot of viewers coming in a little confused they see my long lashious hair and I they think I'm you
know a girl streamer and then they when they realize I'm not they just kind of
click off so I'm wondering would be it would be a good way to I don't know
retain engagement with those type of viewers or maybe I should just cut my hair and you
know um just just get rid of that that kind of attention Okay Okay uh Molina do you
want to go first on the advice um wait so hold on I was like
trying to figure this out with the screen sorry um you go for it first okay uh WV I
would say that um by uh respectfully respectfully in the most respectful way
possible uh respectfully if you actually want to um stream um you should probably
maybe if you want stop catfishing your viewers um I don't maybe you could wear
your hair in a bun because um I think by a lot of people coming in and then insta
coming out you're decreasing your average watch time and twitch will uh
you know see you as not as good of a channel I'm just being honest CU it has
like it has like an average watch time right like so so you can see like how like the average duration of one of your
viewers and um if everyone is saying for the average of one second twitch is not
going to recommend your channel to people Molina do you concur or or do you
think that it's not worth sacrificing this no no no you don't need to cut it I'm just saying man bun man buns are
cute yeah man buns are cute I me like I think this for any streamer I think like
I think you should never do things for views or you should never do anything
that just because someone else thinks something about you so like a lot of streamers are listening to their chat
about like how much you should stream or what you should stream or how you should act or whatever I feel like that's
always going to make you pretty unhappy like in the long run so I think it's a lot better to like express yourself in
the way you feel like you are and if you do that you're going to get people coming and staying for the reason of
watching you and not like some imaginary thing that they've like created so I think I I don't know if that's like a
good advice in this case but that's usually how I think about it or how I try to you know um think about what I'm
doing I'm never going to do anything that um makes so that chat is
controlling it you know um I think a lot of people that huh that makes my answer
look really bad I was like no to optimize views you should do this it's like it's like might
be like a little bit of a vague thing but I I try to I try to think about it that way um just for the sake that
you're not like getting lost in like I'm supposed to follow whatever everyone else is saying or like what people like
me for just say like you know like screw you I'm just going to like just be
yourself and like what you're doing um and like it could be the case that people don't like it that could be the
case um but I don't think you should like you know sell your soul or try to act in a certain way to get views or to
get money um yeah that that's like what I would say yeah I mean um wasn't it
Summit one I think it was Summit one he he I don't know exactly what he was streaming but he was streaming something
and then he was just like F this I have enough money he quit for like a year and
then he came back and he was like right guys I hated streaming like I hated what I was doing I'm going to continue
streaming but I'm just going to do whatever I want to do and I'm pretty sure he was bigger after from doing what
he wants to do because ultimately like yeah you like if if if you're having fun
people can see like people can see through if you don't enjoy doing something but yeah I guess authenticity
is naturally attractive okay I know you have a lot of people to go through so
thank you for the time and I also have to run because I'm also in law school and I have class starting in a five
minutes so trying to to Molina yeah of course um by Lydia I know you're not
coming to Vegas are you going to be there for twitch con Molina um wait LD you're not going to
Vegas I can't go to Vegas anymore I'm sorry I'm going to egx which is in
London but I can't go all the way to Vegas because I need to get a visa and security and it would just be like
literally five fig I see makes sense uh no we'll see I I have a ticket but I'm not sure if I'm going to go yet we'll
see yeah okay well thank you see you guys thank you so much for cominging bye
good luck um okay um
Mike hello hey how's it going I wasn't expected to get picked second okay Mike
what is your uh what is your question all right so it's one of the big things that like looms around with a bunch of
streamers in like my opinion because honestly you're both above average streamers based on your guys' like
average viewership but what uh a lot of people like me
included that all tried to give like twitch basically like a run for its money and see if we could make this thing happen we all kind of have that
same like goal in mind of what happens if we did actually become one of The Bigs like one of the greats you know one
of the people that actually twitch is like known for you know like ninja can't even walk two steps outside of his house
without someone being like Oh Yo Ninja yeah so what kind of Legacy do you guys want to leave on Twitch and like be
remember for like over the next few years that you guys are going to be on this app like what do you guys just kind of want
like to be like your thing you know do you want go fast oh um oh I
don't know I need to think about this um I'm gonna be completely honest I've never really been one for legacy you
know like what people can think about me when I'm gone from something I don't really mind is the same with like dying
not to make this so somber or anything but like is the same with dying like I just want to see you connect that honestly no because it's like leaving a
legacy you know what I mean like I want to have a fun life I want to do what I want to do when I'm gone I don't I don't
know like I just maybe I want to be I want to be known as someone who brighten people's day and made them happy right
but like I don't care about what people think about it after I just want to brighten people's day and make them happy you know what I mean like if STM
for whatever reason in your life makes you slightly better or slightly happier then that's what I want to do uh but I
guess it's just more of an in the moment thing you know what I mean yeah that's what I was going to say that's like very
much just like living in the moment not really like not that you don't care it's just that like does it actually matter yeah yeah I
mean obviously you know I don't want like to die and then like everyone talks is about me and everyone's like let's go
I I can't I can't believe like my my family's like she's dead yay let's get
the inheritance you know what I mean like obvious I don't want that but um yeah I don't know I'd rather just live
life and it it's infinitely more important that I have fun streaming I want to stream for as long as I have fun
streaming and enjoy it you know what I mean yeah actually 100% agree with that
what about you m a little similar I feel like we're both kind of like we're just trying out things in life and seeing how
it works out yeah and like if we ever get bored we're kind of like oh I just want to move to the next thing and try that and
instead it's like we're just trying things out and seeing how it's going um yeah but but I think like if if I if
I'm going to try to get close to like what the question was uh I think I'm very like artistic and I like to express
myself in different ways so I always think like okay hm how can I express myself of like what more of my
personality is so 3 years ago I did like streaming on Twitch and I did like IRL like travel streams cuz I enjoyed doing
that and I wanted to show the world like through my eyes to my viewers um but then I felt also like well I I feel like
there's a lot more than just me traveling around the world I also really like to argue and debate and I kind of
want to express myself in a way of like I can like fight with people like that like I love traveling and I love the
basic yeah exact yeah I think we're very similar so like then I was just like I'm just going to try this and see how I can
express myself in this area so I think I'm a lot more like that but I think it has a lot to do with like how I view
myself than how other people view myself I guess yeah yeahh how did you get into
streaming me um yeah so Co happened 2020
and I was stuck in Sweden um I was supposed to go here for my Embassy
interview at the American Embassy in.com um but then everything like lockedown happened everything closed
down and then I was stuck in the country I was supposed to go back to the States uh to be with stepen my husband and yeah
and during that time I didn't make any money or anything like that and I kind of just wanted to survive like a little
bit so I started streaming maybe like uh I don't know like two hours a day and uh
then I started meeting more streamers like Swedish streamers and we started doing like a lot more like IRL collabing
so we went up skiing like three streamers you know and stuff like that so we streamed like in the slopes uh
which was really fun stuff like that yes and this was also around the time where like rash
Patel or like Austin show was the thing and like anyone could join and I think they just wanted to like create really
fun shows and just invited people and I feel like twitch was like a lot smaller so it was very like it was like a small
commuity where everyone knew each other so I was just like on these streams got to know people started streaming with
other streamers just like this um so that's like how I started it and then I realized oh I can travel around and
stream and that's a lot like you know it's like my personality so I I just did that that's like how I started streaming
I feel like kind sorry I feel like there are a lot of like yeah I feel like twitch definitely
was or used to be much more people knew each other I feel like there's a lot of people now that are really big that no
one knows because they have so much I think that's Tik Tok but like they have their own community that just comes from
Tik Tok or just finds them and doesn't really know about anyone else they don't really know about anyone else and no one really knows about
them YouTube feels that way too there's a lot of like different really big communities all over YouTube and they don't know about each other at all I
feel like twitch is kind of like becoming that a little bit as well cuz it's it's getting bigger so people are not in contact with each other anymore
that's kind of sad though but um Mike thank you so much I appreciate I appreciate your question and um good
luck with streaming oh appreciate it you decide enjoy the rest of your day thank you yeah thank you uh okay um sunny I I
pray he doesn't have his camera on this could be bad um he's the boobag guy if you've ever seen him um Sunny how you
how he does okay um Sunny are you
good hello sorry I'm a little bit ill uh the
same it's okay yeah I I I was with my mates Friday Saturday and we do Gizzy
overdrives what's that oh you ever seen Gizzy overdrive no
Molina I think you froze wait I froze oh no it's all good it's all good what what is a Gizzy
Overdrive uh just check go on YouTube after Point Gizzy over drive okay chat can you
remind me to do that um Sunny what is your uh question great cool just give me a
second is this PG are we allowed to see what a gizy overdrive is yeah yeah yeah
yeah just put it to YouTube now if you sure okay it
is okay can you link it you're taking a long time oh one second
okay you know what we'll do it after okay I'm sure CX Bobby will find it if it's PG and if it's not then that's okay
sunny what is your uh over drive what's a Melina do you know what a Gizzy overdrive is no idea what that is no I
don't think many people in chat do either um okay one second why are they
it seems like my people in my chat knows what it is I don't know do you not know yeah they're like what how do you not
know this are they saying it's like something bad right um it's a famous Tik Tok thing is
a JoJo reference you remember me from twitch Cod yes I think
so right okay me iard you too than
thees Sunny this is what you were doing with your friends at the weekend 100 GES entering Gizzy
Overdrive yes put that working you know I
getp by 7% we are locked in thank you for over
we've seen enough we've wait for the wait for the wait why are
we I don't know I right okay um Sunny what is your
question uh sorry uh all uh Mia you remember sneaker yeah
I met sneo yeah you met oh yeah you met him yeah yeah I see a lot on uh your
partners YouTube and that you know like clips of him versus like uh Andrew T red
pillows and [ __ ] like that Stephen yeah yeah do you think sneo cuz he's like
gone from red pill now and like kind of changed his ways if that makes sense even like
do you think he's doing that for views for audience because when he was going downhill with the red pill content and
then he like switched up and then his views started going back up and a lot of people started siding with him do you
think he's doing that on purpose for the views for the clout good question I'm not really I
feel there could be two things that could be one of them uh the second thing is I'm not entirely sure if he actually
believed anything of what he was like saying that he was believing I feel like he kind of just like speed
runs through different faces of things like he's that he's like believing but I mean I think it's very he's very
different off stream and he doesn't speak the same way ever like he does on stream and I think like probably also
seeing so many different like red pill platforms and people being cancelled and
banned maybe he felt like he wanted to do something else uh usually what I
think he does is that I think he gets obsessed with one content creator and then he just completely like blindly follows them so I feel like it could be
the case that he uh might be following someone new that's doing something different and now he's like going by
that I think that's kind of the sort of person that he is have you met a lot of
have you met a lot of content creators that are very different off like stream
on camera I would say that the red pill people are the most different people off
camera like different how like just nice yes they're very like like they're not
aggressive they're not like played up they're very like soft like they I feel like they're a lot more like that like
they're they're like treating you nicely it's like strange because when the
camera is on they don't do that at all but uh but like off camera they're a bit different for sure um I don't know I I
feel like most content creators are a little different I I've seen people that are very like energetic on stream and
then when you turn off the camera they're like completely like depressed doesn't talk doesn't like do anything so they're
very very very different and I've also met like streamer girls that are very like sexual on
stream but but like off camera in sexual settings they're very nonsexual like
they're almost asexual like they're they're just not sexual at all so I I
would say a lot of people are very different like very different guess yeah I spend a lot of time streaming then you
don't really have enough time to like have a life outside to actually be like that yes I feel like whenever you make
something work like becomes work and then they're kind of the opposite later on like even
like like people that's worked in the porn industry are very different uh and
they don't even seem to view sex as like a fun thing anymore it's just work so
that's like my experience with those sort of people yeah okay well um Sunny thank you
for your question and not thank you for that video that video was a good video no I I would strongly disagree with that
um okay thank you son bye oh he said no no no oh whoops I dragged him out as he
was saying nor okay um hello so I just want to say
something right so you know you on about like content creators and stuff like that yeah yeah you do realize though like 99%
of the streamers on Twitch they all have an act they all have a Persona everybody
is different of stream it's the same with you too it's the same with everybody right I disagree I disagree
really iagree yeah I think it depends you can't here's the thing if
you're streaming 10 hours a day or even six hours a day and you're doing it for years you cannot hide yourself cuz
you're like constantly on a camera I feel like if there's someone that isn't a streamer and they're making YouTube
videos it's a lot easier because it's controlled but like if you're having a bad day and you're a streamer and you're
pushed to stream like you're going to show like you're you're going to show at least a little bit of like yourself for
sure mhm yeah but I mean like you know you say about like people being like you know like depressed of stream and stuff
like that right I get that and I agree with that but again like people you streaming as like an outlet and stuff
right you know what I mean yeah but you know you can't fake it for that long no oh no have you ever
seen have you ever seen a streamer being in character and they just started streaming and they're really popular because you're in a character and then a
few months later they're like a completely different stream or they fell off because they can't keep it
up yeah I mean I can name one but I really shouldn't name the name I don't know if you're allowed to name that
particular name I mean there's no point because it's just spreading hate but like but like yeah I I I agree I feel
like if you're filming YouTube videos it's a lot easier because you haven't got like constant feedback it doesn't feel like you're constantly talking to
people um it's just a completely different vibe like I find it sometimes difficult to be myself I a lot I I'm
much better at it than I used to be but like I find it difficult to be myself and I haven't got chat there when I'm
just recording but as soon as why do you think that is because because it feels like I'm not talking to anyone it feels
like I'm sad in front of a camera but as soon as I as soon as I go live and I see
chat and I'm having constant feedback it feels like I'm socializing with people
and like I am just my like yeah I'm not the same as I am with my grandma like no
one's the same but it's like it's like my personality is kind of for like I stream more than I talk to like I talk
on stream more than I talk to people so it's like okay what is my real personality then well it's just I stream
okay but but but yeah yeah but then so that just shows that you use streaming as an outlet for your own
personal situation yeah but it doesn't mean that you're like a completely different person or like playing a
character or anything that I think like usually when you're streaming you're trying to put on like a little bit more energy because you're you're on stream
so of course you're like thinking about those things but it's not like you're completely like changing character and you acting a completely different way or
anything like that like and it could be like to be honest I think I'm I'm pretty similar to who I am like off stream but
I would say that just because I stream I get pretty drained and then after stream I'm a lot less of myself because I'm so
tired you're just because talking about myself all day so can I ask you a question H okay so
like obviously there's over streaming platform right which I won't name but so
do you think which one the kick one okay yeah yeah so do
you think that there's a massive difference technically in between the two based on uh the content that a
content creator can provide for their Community compared to the other you do you understand my question do you know
what I mean I don't think you get it sorry me yeah so so you have you have twitch and you
have kick right so do you feel that one of one particular website
has um more ability for somebody to I don't know like expose who they are as a
person compared to the other depends on the more stricter
rules do you think like it depends on a to or like yeah sort of yeah like if my
personality is like I love just being naked and I can't be naked on Twitch do
lines on kick that's my that's what I do I don't want to hide it I mean I feel
like if you're if you're not doing like illegal activities of or like non-pg
stuff all day then maybe not but like if you're like yeah doing legal stuff all the time or like just like very sexual
stuff all the time then maybe you can only express it on Kick I feel like it just depends who you are as a person I don't really feel Li I I I just feel
that I just feel that there is like such a divide between the two things you know I mean like they're both good platforms
and they all have their own decent merits but do you know what I mean like it's hard for like a content creator to
think oh yeah actually I'm going to join kick unless you offer like 100 Mil like xqc like do you know what I mean like
not everybody a bow like him like it doesn't so I think when it comes to
people they do offer so so they offer um they offer obviously massive deals to
big big big streamers but um they offer an hourly rate to a lot of streamers so
they they they some streamers could go off that by the hourly rate so what is
the hourly rate I'm I'm I don't know about like yeah it yeah I mean I don't
think we can say hour hourly rates or if we would want to say hour hourly rates but like Yeah the more they want you the
more people they think you can bring to the platform obviously the higher the hourly rate is going to be yeah um and
I'm pretty sure I don't know how big you have to be to get an hourly rate but I feel like if you're above 100 viewers
you could probably negotiate one but I mean maybe I actually I have no idea
personally yeah I would probably I would probably make more McDonald's what do you mean like
what I I mean it depends like how much viewers you have coming to the platform right yeah but you don't run ads on Kick
though right no but you you get like 95%
splits and but then it's like it's just it's just yeah you probably would would
ear sometimes for some people more money moving to kick but then it's like okay but then a lot of your community that
you build up isn't there um is just not as you you want people like it's just
obviously obviously some people would move with you but a lot of people wouldn't move with you and if you not live they're just gone like they just be
like oh Lydia's live on k i CBA I'm just going to watch someone else instead and it like it it like it probably wouldn't
be good long term but it's just not as nice of a Vibe I feel like I I think it would be very
interesting if I don't see this ever happening but I think it would be very interesting if uh twitch turned around
and actually implemented something of a similar nature on their platform I think that would be very interesting well a
similar nature like like what like hourly rate but they don't need to do
that because they're the biggest platform already it's like yeah yeah yeah so yeah but like for now they
they're only the biggest platform because it's owned by Amazon that's the only reason if it wasn't for Amazon kick
would be competing like out they already they are it's funded by a g you know the
guy I don't even think I don't even know if kick is making any money to be honest I feel like they're kind of just like
using gambling money isn't it like right aren't they I don't think it's about making
money for them though it's more exposure like obviously Eddie's worth like billions yeah
and he makes millions a day he's not bothered so he probably makes more than what twitch does a day anyway just from
the gambling side of it wait sorry who owner of kick excuse me probably yeah
the CEO is Eddie he owns Stak you know I've sat in there and I've
signed Discord calls with him yeah and we've had these discussions where like you know he could actually make kick
five times bigger than what twitch is oh oh he he could make twit he could
make twitch five times or kick five times bigger than twitch but he chooses not to he
says right yeah but you gotta think this guy's pumping his own money into it
right where twitch doesn't twitch doesn't really I don't see twitch giving back a lot you know what I mean well I
mean it's just competition isn't it it's like it's like yeah if you're like the biggest I mean it's like that with every
business ever right it's like if you're the I don't know biggest crisp if you're if you're the only crisp
company right then obviously you can have a big margin and get lots of money per crisp and sell them at a high rate
right but then if there's lots of other crisp companies that are now selling the crisps at a low rate then yeah you have
to lower your rate and give better deals to the farmers I know I just compare
myself to a farmer but like you know what I mean like yeah I know I I know I know
what you're saying I understand what you're saying but on the flip side of that like you still have got the person
that owns the biggest gambling website that there is online right now it's the same as you using the analogy of the
biggest Chris company he's the he's the biggest gambling company you see what I'm saying like he
has that Revenue coming in to be able to support a site like kick and not care about a loss of money whereas Amazon
they're going to care if they lose a few hundred mil Eddie don't give a [ __ ] he got hacked for 4 2 million and said okay
fine no problem I mean a lot of people or a lot of streamers also don't want to be associated with gambling or and they
don't want to support gambling that's also another Factor like like it's not
just that like even if even if um like I'm sure a lot of streamers already would make more money if they move to
twitch but like even if I knew everyone in the community and it would be the same Vibe on Kick as it is on Twitch I
probably still wouldn't because I don't know unless it unless it drastically changes I don't like the I don't like
how interl it is with gambling yeah um but um thank you so much I don't think
you can do that forever yeah I'm G to jump off I don't want to take up any more of your time
it's been a pleasure okay thank you BTC I appreciate it thank you so um okay Molina do you want to do like uh one
more cool I could do this all day but I just like I want to a time so fun I want to do more
podcasts and like just so like we have enough for like every every single p c I feel like maybe one more but
um yeah we can do one more let's do one more person let me see um star hello star oh
hello do you hear hello yeah we hear you is that okay yeah yeah yeah it's all right I'm
sorry I'm in the basement right now it's are you good in a basement like are you
okay yeah yeah yeah yeah I I got something to prepare for Saturday because yeah I'm but like there's a door
that's not like locked right it's it's not locked but it's it's
very dark inside here but no no I'm I'm good I'm good so
my question is uh do you have an controversial opinion that that you're
like yeah if I bring up this topic no one's going to agree on it like
like for example yeah I'm a flat Earth believer or something like
that ah do you want to go fast or sh
I I don't think I have anything like that but there's certain things that I avoid talking about just because I know
that people are going to get really triggered I'm not really sure if it's like the same thing but like if I ever
start talking about like as an example um what the issues are about being a
streamer girl who is attractive and um
have these issues like I feel like if I start talking in that area like I can't make any friends
because I'm attracted because everyone wants to have sex me if I start like speaking like that usually people get really upset and they don't want to like
they're like no like you can't like ever express any sort of problem just because
of what position you're in so I try to avoid that as much as I can and now I was being really honest so everyone's
gonna hate me see I can already feel people getting mad just by saying this
um but I'm just going to say like anything that you're doing in life whoever you are there's always going to be an issue there's just like some
people can't complain that's the thing some people cannot say anything about something just because it's going to trigger people way too
much so like stuff like that is like usually want to try to avoid I'm not really sure if that's like a good answer
to your question though it is it is I don't know what to
say to that um um yeah honestly I'm not goingon to lie
I do not have that issue at all I think I don't think I've honestly
ever thought about that before like oh like I don't think I can be friends with this person because they want to sleep
with me it could it doesn't have to be that way either I feel like this one is better like it's it's basically the same
a that was like an extreme example it could be like um I run into the issue where a lot of people don't take my
success seriously because I'm attractive um that could be a thing or like and I
think a lot of people uh especially like girls in male dominated Industries could
have this issue uh where they feel like the only reason I'm here is because I'm a woman either because my boss likes me
because I'm a woman or um it could even be like feminism like this company is only taking me in because I'm a woman
and not because I'm good at what I'm doing so that could be an issue uh for someone that's like privileged I
guess um and it's really hard to talk about those things because people just hate you whenever you talk about it I
mean I I I definitely get that in the way that like so if like we were to collab with a guy even if he's smaller
like like viewer wise or whatever um there are always going to be comments like oh you just like you just like let
him on or something so you could collab like to steal like there's just always stuff like that which is but then but
then it's just like people are going to say whatever I'm sure I'm sure if it if if rules were reversed and we were the
guy and we were collabing with a girl then there would be annoying comments the other way around it's just it's just
like people just not being like it's just difficult to collab with opposite genders on Twitch um or like a lot of
different platforms um yeah I feel a bit
left out now I honestly don't think I've ever thought I don't think I've ever thought of it like that that I don't
know be like like in a way of like trusting certain people like what do they
actually really want out of talking to me or giving me this deal like do they want to give me a deal because they want to help me grow or do they want to have
some sort of personal relationship with me like I feel like that stuff happens a lot and it's not like I think this could
happen to like any girl to be honest but I think like for a lot of like a lot of
guys I think they can have like a issue like understanding this and I think that there's already a lot of feelings that
like I'm having so much trouble being in my position right now so how is this person that's G like being given
everything ever complaining about anything because they're getting so much from like just because of the way they
look or uh the way they are if they're a girl you know it's that sort of stuff and
it's that that can be a little complicated sometimes so there's certain things that I try to
avoid just because of that um um I feel like I feel like I have maybe I just
have a really good asexual personality I don't know like like I feel like if I like
someone then I you know like if I've attracted someone then I'm normally just really really awkward and can't talk to
them but I feel like if I don't like someone then I like in that way then I feel like I definitely give off the like
the the impression like what's up dude how you doing buddy you know what I I
mean like I'm very not flirty to people that I don't like maybe it's that I don't know maybe I'm just
hoping maybe no one likes me IRL but like no no no it's not it's not because no one likes me IRL it's because I give
the impression yes um but um okay I would say yeah I I think I
think it's it it really depends on on the environment right like if I'm hanging out with my boys I'm I'm not the
same like if I if I talk to a girl um and I can be sometimes awkward as
well like right now I have literally I'm just rambling right now and I have no idea what I'm talking about but yeah
it's it depends on the environment right yeah I okay so I would say for my
controversial opinion and it is a very controversial opinion because I feel like most people prably don't agree
right um I find it silly when wait do you do you vape
Molina I have Vape I feel like but I'm not like a vapor okay because I feel like I feel
like most people disagree with me on this right like I don't really drink that much and um I find it silly when
people like go on about people vaping and like how dumb vaping is and then they
drink I think it depends on how I think it depends on like how much your drink
cuz vaping is kind of like Cas and it's like an everyday thing or like it's like a several day thing and it's probably a
lot more like it's a lot more addictive uh than drinking but like if you're
looking at the perspective which I think you're doing is like this is bad for your body I think I've said the same thing is like sugar is not good for you
so if you're like I've said this like if you don't like vaping you should stop eating sugar in that case cuz it's not
good for you either to just eat a bunch of candy yeah okay okay but
I feel like I feel like alcohol and vaping is much worse than like having a little bit of sugar like obviously if
you're having like five chocolate bars then like fair enough but like but like I feel like it's just a cure dring like
drinking several like coca-colas a day like I feel like that's probably
pretty similar maybe to vaping I feel like Ving alol is still
way worse than Coca-Cola if you drink it every single day if you're drinking like five day I like maybe it's worse but I
think it's like still pretty bad is drinking Coke really that bad oh my gosh how bad it like five Cokes a day or like
Dr Peppers or I us I used to have like a whole bottle of Dr Pepper I stop now
because they all have caffeine in them and I cannot have caffeine oh no but I feel like it's just I feel like it's
like it feel like uh generational culture you know what I mean like my parents they'll have wine they have like
a bottle of wine every night and they'll be like silly Boomers they're all
addicted to vaping you know what I mean and and it's like and it's like everyone's like everyone's like yeah but
vaping causes cancer so does drinking alcohol it's just that it's just that in some cultures all of their friends drink
but none of them Vape so they say they see vaping as much worse than drinking
like just because people do it like a lot more In some cultures than vaping do you know what I mean I just find I I
find it I find it silly when I see Boomers drinking alcohol saying how dumb
zumas are for being addicted to a I think it makes
sense yeah I was expecting you to disagree with me on that but um oh I mean I I kind of like you should I say
something similar I say like if you're drinking alcohol or using like substances um you shouldn't be saying
like like doing drugs is so bad and it should be banned and I don't understand how you can be doing drugs because
you're kind of are doing it this as well so i' literally I have like a pretty similar opinion to it but I think of
course like one is like worse than the other kind of but I think it depends on like how bad it is and how often you're
doing it if you're like addicted yeah like to like eating candy or drinking Coke every single day or something like
that you're drinking energy drinks constantly like several a day it's probably not good for your health either
and then you're like I don't understand how people can be addicted to nicotine it's like well you're you're probably
like is not very good for you either you know there you know yeah that's yeah that's literally the same um the same
thing like it's like the Boomers they're all like weed weed should be illegal weed should be illegal but I'm just
gugging on my wine but weed should be illegal it's like yes I like I felt that
for so long I used to argue with like my ex's parents about this like every single dinner like I just like sit you
used to argue with your ACC yeah I felt so strongly about this I used to go to like a bunch of you know like public
like speeches about substances and stuff when I was younger so I'm like very liberal when it comes to substances
always been yeah I think I think that's that's
very cringe as well because I am snooze addicted so those are nicotine pouches I
think Melina knows are you Swedish no no I'm I'm from Switzerland but I import
them from Sweden actually yeah yeah and I mean I
literally no rights to say that that wapes or smoking cigarettes are are bad
for you but what I do have to say is that from from a chemical standpoint um
alcohol is just pure energy that's why people who um drinks a lot of beer have
also like a big stomach right and have a lot of fat because yeah alcohol is is
like energy wait what do you mean alcohol is energy saying the
alcohol makes you fat yeah yeah yeah it's like if if you if you drink alcohol
like like it's it's like sugar if you eat sugar there's uh in your stomach you
you produce through a chemical I don't know life cycle you can
gain like like uh energy I I don't know how how it really works to be honest but
uh that's what I have been told from a from a pharmacist so so you don't me
calories you mean like by drinking more alcohol you gain energy throughout your
life and you've been told this by a pharmacist no no no no like uh if if you
went to school and you had the chemical uh topics that you discuss there's
there's like I don't know how to say say it in English to be honest but the substance alcohol is is is like like
energy for the for for the human body I don't know that's
why right yeah yeah like beer bellies right okay energy if you're having like a
night and you're drinking a bunch of beer like it it's going like if you do that all the time it's you're probably going to like gain weight from it it how
do people drink it's disgusting yes yeah yes that's that yeah okay that's what I
meant yeah me too I don't like you thank you star I appreciate it very much thank you for coming on I appreciate it bye um
cool oh my gosh okay well um thank you so much Molina for coming on to the podcast I really appreciate it it was it
was super fun we can like do this forever I feel like like I know I I I could go for ages it's just that like
like I feel like I feel like by like keeping it short oh my gosh I see myself in your screen I'm just ahead
ah fix there go yeah by like keeping it to like less
oh my gosh I mean we've been we've been we've been talking for ages now but like I was like yeah maybe one and a half hours but like um by keeping it like
under two hours then like I feel like we can do this like so much for so long for sure because there's so much to talk
about so next I you know I think for like next episode I want to get like um
I want to get like maybe a designer or something to like design us a little thing that would be so cute so cute yeah
but we got like our first try out that I've ever seen nice it would be so cool I'm like seeing it in front of me I'm
like in like a year it's going to be like so much you know like such higher quality and like the signs and like a
name and like an intro and like a bunch of cute things so um yeah I'm going to get a
little designer but um are you good for um this time uh so like Wednesday 2
weeks 5:00 p.m. I think that's really good yes yes okay 6 p.m. my time you're 500 p.m. your
time your time yeah 6 p.m. your time 5:00 p.m. my time chat that's BST
however um we I am moving into GMT sometime in
October um I'll figure it out do you do your clocks change at the same time I
think it's some point in October I think it's like the end of October or something like that maybe okay cuz I know America's clocks change at a
different time so like twice a year I'm like always an extra hour late to stream or ali um but um yeah we'll figure it
out but um thank you so much I appreciate it and I'll um thank you I'll talk to you soon but I'll uh talk to you
on stream uh yeah next Wednesday okay bye okay see you soon bye

Transcription:

Assembly
assembly a low-level programming
language allowing humans to give
instructions to the computer's Hardware
you see computers can only do things in
terms of zero or one so assembly was
created in order to make computer
instructions more workable for human
beings this works by using an assembler
that translates the human readable code
into one's and zeros assembly is one of
the world's first programming languages
it used to be the standard to run
supercomputers back in the day but you
still find it used currently to work
with CPU memory and it's used sometimes
in browsers via web assembly Fortran one
Fortran
of the world's first highle languages
the difference between a highle language
and a lowlevel language is in a
low-level language you can manipulate
the computer's memory much more directly
it also executes much faster than a
highle language the drawback is is that
it's much harder to learn a highle
language is much easier to understand
and there's a lot of support but the
code is much slower Fortran was created
by IBM in the 1950s the name stands for
a formula translator programming in
Fortran would be done by using a punch
card then would be fed into a card
reader and would be translated into code
that the computer can understand this
translating process is called compiling
which basically changes the code that
humans can read into the ones and zeros
computers can understand comtran also
Comtran
known as commercial translator is
another programming language developed
by IBM it served as the business
equivalent to Fortran in which Fortran
was used for scientific Computing it was
influenced by another programming
language called flomatic a programming
language for data processing that ran on
this giant supercomputer called the
univac 1 lisp also known as list
Lisp
processing was created soon after
Fortran it's known for using a lot of
parentheses in its code it was an
Innovative language which in insired
these Concepts in programming cobal
COBOL
standing for common business oriented
language was the programming language
developed in 1959 for you guessed it
businesses even though it was made so
long ago it is still used today by many
financial institutions to process
transactions the code looks like plain
English sentences but this would later
be translated onto a punch card one of
the first adopters of the language was
the US Department of Defense IBM RPG IBM
IBM RPG
report program generator is a
programming language created by IBM
meant to run on IBM systems it's one of
the only programming languages to makes
use of rows and columns for its code
ALGOL 60
alol 60 short for algorithmic language
1960 is not a very well-known
programming language but is one of the
languages that inspired one of the most
well-known programming languages in the
world C it was also one of the first
programming languages to use nested
functions APL standing for a programming
APL
language first appeared in the 1960s is
a programming language developed for
mathematical equations mostly algebra it
uses a lot of math and Greek symbols
directly in the code simula a
Simula
programming language made many decades
ago that was one of the world's first
object-oriented language objectoriented
programming is a way for programmers to
use blocks of code that are reusable and
can interact with each other instead of
pure functions and logic in
object-oriented programming you use
blocks of code called objects objects
are created by things called classes
which contain properties and can use
methods to explain it simply you can
create a class called Pok√©mon name the
object Charmander give it properties
such as fire type and allow it to
execute methods such as flamethrower and
Speakeasy
scratch Speak Easy A programming
language that was mainly M used by
physicists in the' 60s it's known for
using a colore in its code basic the
BASIC
beginners allpurpose symbolic
instruction code was created at
Dartmouth in 1963 it was created with
the purpose of getting the average lay
person to be able to learn how to code
you see before that time programming had
only been the domain of scientists and
mathematicians this was because of its
easy to understand syntax syntax is
basically the rules to writing in a
programming language Ms Ms aka the
MUMPS
Massachusetts General Hospital utility
multiprogramming system or sometimes
just m for short was created to manage
Hospital laboratory Information Systems
it was also used to manage electronic
health records its code tends to be very
tur which means you can take most of its
word commands and abbreviate them into
simple short letters logo an educational
Logo
programming language made in the' 60s
which makes use of what is known as a
turtle graphic not an actual Turtle it's
the name of the cursor used to draw
geometric shapes as determined by the
code Pascal a programming language that
Pascal
was very popular in the' 70s even being
the default language for many computers
back in the day it was one of the first
programming language to be used by an
IDE which is an integrated development
environment basically a dedicated
program to write its code one of the
most well-known programs created with
Pascal was Photoshop C A programming
C
language created in the' 70s that is one
of the most popular programming
languages of all time created at Bell
Labs it is the basis of many operating
systems such as Windows and Linux it
also inspired many programming languages
that came after it such as C++ c
objectiv c go Java JavaScript PHP Python
and many more it's known for its
lowlevel ACC access to the computer's
memory by using code called pointers
computer memory was much more of a
finite resource than the past so
programmers had to be much more careful
about how they allocated it otherwise
it'll cause problems such as memory
leaks which is basically when programs
use up too much memory in your computer
causing the computer to become painfully
slow Small Talk a programming language
Smalltalk
in the' 70s that was known for its
object-oriented programming it inspired
many object-oriented programming
languages that came after it prologue
Prolog
known as the first logic programming
language it is known for being modeled
after formal logic in philosophy ml also
ML
known as meta language pioneered
statically typed functional programming
which basically means giving information
certain types such as strings integers
Floats or booleans strings are just
words and letters integers are whole
numbers floats are real numbers so they
can be decimals and Boolean is something
that can be either true or false SQL SQL
SQL
also known as structured query language
also even called SQL is a language used
for creating and managing databases you
store information in things called
tables and structure them with rows and
columns the code also looks like plain
English sentences it is used by many
systems even today to store their data
such as usernames and passwords
transactions account information and
more basically think of it as a system
of Excel spreadsheets C++ an extension
C
of the C programming language the major
difference is C++ has object-oriented
programming unlike the original C which
didn't it's also known for its steep
learning curve C++ is one of the most
important programming languages of all
time even still in wide use today still
being the main programming language in
creating operating systems web browsers
databases and games Ada a programming
Ada
language made in the 1980s that is
mainly used by the US Department of
Defense it is named after the credited
world's first programmer Ada l mat Lab
Matlab
Mat lab or Matrix library is a
mathematics programming language used by
data scientists and Engineers it's a
mathematics based programming language
that can be used for statistics Robotics
and artificial intelligence it's still
widely used today mainly by Academia
Objective-C
Objective C A programming language
inspired by C that was created in the
1980s which became the main language for
Apple Computers even being the main
language for the early iPhones although
its popularity has fallen over the years
mainly due to Apple replacing it by a
newer programming language called Swift
in the mid-2020s lab view made by
Labview
national instruments in the 1980s it is
a programming language that doesn't
really use traditional code instead it's
a graphical programming language where
you build user interfaces and handle
code using images llang a programming
Erlang
language designed for the Telecom
industry Pearl a language that was
Perl
designed to work very well with text
it's used for system administration
Network programming finance and more
Pearl has been known as the duct tape
that holds the internet together if
you've ever seen the code it actually
looks pretty wacky Wolfram created by
Wolfram
Steven Wolfram it's a language that can
perform data visualization image
processing mathematics and pretty much
anything you can think of it can even
tell you the shortest route around
Europe hcll it's a functional
Haskell
programming language with its unique
feature of its variables being immutable
which means you can't change them the
language is based on Lambda calculus
Visual Basic
Visual Basic a programming language
developed by Microsoft in the early '90s
it's used to create Microsoft programs
and applications by using guis or
graphical user interfaces basically
anything you can interact with with your
mouse on the screen is part of the
graphical user interface it also has a
very popular IDE of the same name Lua a
Lua
language known for its speed and being
able to be embedded into other programs
it's also known for being very easy to
Delphi
learn Deli nothing much to say about it
it's basically Pascal but with
objectoriented programming it even comes
with its own code editor oaml oaml is a
OCaml
functional based programming language
like haskel and earling functional
programming languages are good at doing
math and objectoriented programming
languages are good for building
Enterprise level software python python
Python
is a general purpose programming
language and you can use it to make
pretty much anything from desktop
applications to websites creating bots
or API handling servers and databases
game development image processing
statistics and so much more that it
would need its own video python is
currently one of the most popular
programming languages for creating AI
it's also one of the most popular
programming languages in general in fact
most beginner programmers start with
python as their first programming
language not only for its vast utility
but also how easy it is to learn one of
its only drawbacks is that it tends to
be pretty slow compared to other
programming languages like C++ Ruby Ruby
Ruby
is a language very similar to python
even the code looks similar Ruby is easy
to learn and the code is also very
readable one of the most popular uses of
Ruby is to combine it with a framework
called on Rails to create websites
adopting the full name Ruby on Rails
Ruby on Rails is currently the backbones
to many websites we know currently such
as Hulu Airbnb coinbase Shopify twitch
SoundCloud and many more a lot of its
popularity was was its ability to be
able to create full stack websites full
stack is the combination of the
front-end and the backend development of
a website a website's front-end is
basically everything you can see with
your eyes basically the entire interface
the text the images the buttons and the
videos are all part of the front end the
back end is the non-visual part of the
website which is mainly the servers and
databases account information
authentication and data storage is
what's part of the back end Java
Java
remember the thing some programs ask you
to install on your computer yeah that's
an actual programming language it gained
popularity immediately after it's
released and it's still popular today a
big advantage that Java has is that it
allows you to create programs that are
very platform independent that's because
Java can be compiled into B code which
can be understood by many operating
systems all your computer would need is
a Java runtime environment to do this
which is what you're installing every
time your computer asks you to install
Java Java can be used to create many
things like video games such as
Minecraft or mobile apps on Android a
meme amongst beginner programmers is
that Java's code tends to be prey verbos
R
R A programming language in which its
main purpose is statistics it's a widely
popular programming language used to
organ organized data and data
visualization it's very useful for
researchers conducting epidemiological
studies if you're a researcher studying
in fields such as economics psychology
biology medicine Etc learning how to
code in either python or R is a very
Javascript
useful skill JavaScript JavaScript is
not the same as Java in fact it has
nothing to do with Java JavaScript is a
programming language that is mainly only
used in web browsers in fact 98% of the
internet uses JavaScript JavaScript is
responsible for the main functional
aspect of the website it's it's based on
the ecmascript standard and is often Us
in conjunction with HTML and CSS but
sometimes you can create websites which
is pure JavaScript using Frameworks such
as react and with react mobile you can
create mobile apps HTML and CSS HTML and
HTML & CSS
CSS are both scripting languages to
create websites HTML deals with the pure
content and structure of the website it
uses code called HTML tags in order to
build the content on the web page CSS is
used for the design or aesthetic look of
the website it deals with the
arrangement of content colors borders
gradients opacities and can even perform
animations PHP PHP AKA personal homepage
PHP
but sometimes also called hypertext
pre-processor is a programming language
mainly used on web servers you can
actually embed PHP directly into HTML
PHP although waning in popularity is
still the backbone of many major
websites today it was the language Mark
zuger bird first built Facebook in
Actionscript
action script a language based on
JavaScript in which its main purpose was
its use in Flash have you ever played a
flash game back in the day that was most
likely made using AC script it was first
created by macromedia which released
action script 1 and version 2.0 but when
macromedia was later bought out by Adobe
Adobe released action script 3.0 even
though as of 2020 Adobe Flash has died
out you can still use action script with
Adobe animate C A programming language
C
made in the early 2000s by Microsoft it
was influenced by C++ and Java C's most
common uses are being used in web
servers with the Net Framework and video
game development with the unity engine
Scala
Scala Scala was made as an alternative
to Java it also uses many of Java's same
technology such as the Java virtual
machine but unlike Java it has many
features of functional programming
Powershell
Powershell basically the Windows command
line on steroids come with its own
scripting language FSH f is the sister
F
language to C with the difference of it
being able to support functional
programming Julia a programming language
Julia
made in the early 2010s in order to
perform high level computations data
analysis and visualization and
Mathematics its main advantage is that
it's much faster than other programming
languages that do this the code is a lot
easier to read and it's much easier to
Elm
learn oh a programming language designed
to create graphical user interfaces for
websites it can be compiled into
JavaScript Nim a programming language
Nim
with the Simplicity of python combined
with the memory allocation of C++ Raku
Raku
nothing much to say it's basically Pearl
but version six although it has a pretty
wacky logo scratch a programming
Scratch
language made in MIT that is completely
Visual and block based no seriously the
code fits together like Lego blocks it
was made with the purpose for teaching
children how to code despite its
Simplicity you can make pretty complex
things with It Go formerly known as go
Go
Lang was created at Google to be a
modern version of C the code can be
similar to python but it's much faster
due to its compiling method it's mainly
used in servers with Frameworks like
Holy-C
Docker holy C A programming language
created by Terry a Davis in 2005 made
with assembly it was used to create an
operating system called Temple OS an
operating system inspired by a
revelation from God the main interest in
this programming language is due to the
backstory of the developer although
being a talented programmer suffered
from and ultimately succumbed from his
battle with schizophrenia cotlin known
Kotlin
as the easier form of java is a language
used to create mobile apps on Android OS
the most popular IDE to code cotlin in
is Android Studio typescript basically
Typescript
JavaScript but with static typing Dart a
Dart
programming language created by Google
that you can use to create web
applications or mobile apps using the
flutter framework Swift developed by
Swift
Apple to replace Objective C it is the
standard programming language to create
anything in iOS and it comes with its
own code editor called xcode you can
only code in Swift if you have an Apple
computer or use a virtual machine rust
Rust
okay this is the true modern version of
CN C++ it's good if you want to write
simple code while also handling memory
issues it's a very popular programming
language and it's used to make
applications where performance is
extremely important such as game engines
or operating systems solidity a
Solidity
programming language created for the
ethereum network programs created in
solidity are called smart contracts
these Smart Tracks are later deployed to
the blockchain however once smart
contracts are deployed to the blockchain
they cannot be changed or altered again
so before a contract is deployed usually
developers test them thoroughly
beforehand this is done using testing
environments such as truffle and hard
hat depending on the smart contract can
cost memory and even money in the form
of ethereum to work its main uses are
for creating web 3.0 decentralized apps
decentralized Finance applications or
defi to even your own tokens or nfts the
type of smart contract you'll make will
depend on the ERC format you're adhering
to ERC standing for ethereum request for
Elixir
comment Elixir a popular programming
language that was created in Brazil it
runs on the llang beam virtual machine
which compiles the language into bite
code you can do with Elixir the same
things you can do with llang the
language which is commonly used for
Telecom e-commerce and finance Zig
Zig
another programming language intended to
be the successor of C it was created in
the mid 20110 and is slowly gaining in
Power FX
popularity Microsoft power FS a language
created in 2021 by Microsoft it is used
in a low code program called power apps
a low code program is a program that
allows you to create applications with
little to no code but if you want to add
extra logic or functionality to your app
it would be done using power effects
also the language is based on Microsoft
Excel be sure to share this video and

Transcription:


as I get older I realize money is not
everything but it's kind of almost
everything so every year or every other
year I download all my bank transactions
and review my incomes and expenses the
other day I came across someone who made
this income and expense breakdown and I
feel really inspired to do the same
usually the most tricky thing in the
process is to classify the expenses from
my buying transactions into appropriate
categories a lot of times I just use my
manual labor or some low take ways to do
that this year I decide to ask CHP to
Crunch the number for me and maybe tell
me when I can retire only then to
realize that I can't just upload my bang
statements to chat B website it's so
sensitive information about places I've
been to shops I visited how much I spent
on buying secret items and other
personal data although using open a apis
may help still the data sent via the API
is stored by open a for duration of up
to 30 days So eventually I decide to
download and run an open- Source large
language model locally on my laptop and
the best thing yet they are free in this
project video we do a few exciting
things first we'll learn to install and
run an llm for example llama 2 locally
on our laptop then we use the LM to
classify all the expenses in my bank
statement into categories such as
groceries rent travel and so on we then
analyze the data in Python and create
some visualizations to show the main
insights I shared all the codes on
GitHub so you can check out the GitHub
repo in the video description this video
is sponsored by corer corer is running a
discount with $200 off the corera plus
annual subscription if you sign up this
is half the regular price for the whole
year with this subscription you can get
access to tons of courses and
certificates in data analytics including
the Google data analytics and and the
Google advanced data analytics
certificates these certificates teach
you all the fundamentals you need as a
beginner in data analytics so check out
the offer below there are a few
different ways to run a large language
model locally on your laptop which means
you can run the ERM without internet
connection without a third- party
service like an API service or website
like chat TBT as you can imagine this is
secure if you want to protect your
personal data and it's free there are
now a few different Frameworks developed
to help us run an open-source language
model locally on our own device some
popular Frameworks are Lama CPP GPT for
and AMA so you might be wondering why
the heck do we even need these
Frameworks remember how large language
models are trained they are basically
the result of taking a huge amount of
internet data and train a large neuron
Network on it and the model that comes
out is basically a zip file with a bunch
of numbers that represents the weight of
all the parameters in the neuron Network
this model file can be quite large
depending on how many parameters the
model has so Frameworks like AMA and
Lama CPP basically try to do two things
the first thing is quantization it tries
to reduce the memory footprint of the
raw model weights and the second thing
is it makes it more efficient for us the
consumer to use the models if you have a
Mac or Linux machine I'd highly
recommend installing orama it's super
simple and I'll show you in a bit if you
have a Windows machine you can also run
AMA through the docker desktop okay now
Install Ollama
let's go to AMA website and here you can
download AMA which is available for Mac
OS and Linux and windows will be coming
soon also have a quick look at the list
of models that are available so here we
have Lama 2 mistol we have a bunch of
other coat models and so there's a lot
of options here for you to try out and
if we click on any of them we can see
the description also how to use API what
is the memory requirements so how much
RAM you need in your laptop in order to
run these models so let's download AMA
and install it it's very straightforward
just like installing any app on your
laptop so once we've installed AMA we
Run local Mistral model
can start using it through our terminal
in order to install a language model
locally through AMA we just need to run
the command or Lama pool and then
specify the model that you want to
install so for example I will install
again mistro it's pretty fast because
I've already installed it last time so
and you can see here the model is around
4 GB so in order to use a model through
the terminal we just need to do AMA run
mistro and here we can start typing our
message or our prompt so let's say hello
and the model replied with hello there
how can I help you today o so that's a
lot of things okay so I can ask
something a little bit stupid what's 2 +
two okay it comes back with quite an
elaborate answer now let's try another
question I want to see if it actually
can do math properly let me ask what's
this time this okay wow that's amazing
okay it even tries to teach me how to
find the product of two large numbers
step by step now let me check if this is
actually the correct answer so let me go
to Google okay so what I have here is
around
426 billion however if I look at the
result here it's actually not correct 45
Millions you can check this result using
a calculator to make sure it's correct
well I've checked it and it's not
correct I kind of have to say I'm
impressed but in terms of basic
arithmetic I think large language models
out of the box are not probably not the
best option all right the next thing we
want to test and that is very important
for this project is whether the mistro
model can properly classify all the
different expenses in my bank statements
into different categories so I just try
out a prompt here to uh see how it
performed now I ask can you add an
appropriate category to the following
expenses for example Spotify as
entertainment beta boders as uh Sports
and here I just give a list of
transactions as uh shown in my banking
Run local Llama2 model
statements so let's see what it comes up
with okay so it replies with three
categories it's roughly correct I would
say it's reasonable but it missed one uh
trans section here which is bistro bar
Amsterdam and also it doesn't really
reply in the format that I wanted so the
uh transaction together with the
category separate by this hyphen so I
feel like mistro it doesn't really do
the task as I expected it to do so let's
try another model which is llama 2 uh
let's exit this model and we will AMA
run uh llama 2 but if you haven't
installed llama 2 you can uh do Ama L po
Lama 2 and the Lama 2 model will be
installed locally in your computer now
we can start using llama 2 model now
let's ask the same question as we asked
before and it does it pretty well it
gives me a list of the expenses together
with the categories although the first
two are my own example but it does give
Customize LLMs with Ollama
me the correct format for the answers
and so each of this transaction has a
category added next to it separate by a
hyphen so I'm pretty happy with Lama 2
and it actually understands the task
although if you keep asking the same
question to these language models uh
multiple times these models may come
back with different answers each time
and so there's definitely a certain
level of Randomness in the responses if
you want to take a step further to
customize these language models to your
specific use case you can do that by
specify a model file and a model file is
basically the blueprint to create and
share language models with a so you can
specify the base model you want to use
and also you can set parameters like the
temperature for the model now let's go
back to the terminal and exit this model
let's clear the terminal and I'll go
ahead and create a model file with Nano
and I'll name this model file as expense
analyzer and we'll go into the text
editor okay let's first specify the base
model as llama 2 so from llama 2 and
next we set the temperature parameter as
let's say 0.8 temperature closer to one
is more creative and the lower the
temperature the more coherent and less
creative the model behaves and further
let's also specify the custom system
message so my system prompt is quite
basic if you're a financial assistant
you have classify expense and income
from buying transactions okay let's save
this file by contr X yes enter now that
we have the model file set up we can can
use this model file to create a custom
model we can do this by AMA create we
specify the custom model name- f and
then specify the name of the model file
so that is Bens analyzer so now if we
run this comment basically what is doing
under the hood is that uh AMA will pass
through this text file this model file
expense analyzer passing through all the
parameters and the custom message that
we put in and then customize all these
different layers in uh the base model
which is Lama 2 and now we can start
using this custom Lama 2 model that we
just created by uh ol Lama uh run
expense analyzer I also forgot to
mention that we can also now uh look at
the model list available by AMA list and
you can also see that now we have the
expense analyzer Lama 2 model available
in our list now interacting with these
Access Llama2 with Langchain (Python)
local LMS through the terminal is also
fine but I find a more convenient way to
interact with these models is through
the python environment and more
specifically through Jupiter notebook
now let's create a project folder and
I'll move my bank transaction data in
inside this folder and I'll just start
up visual studio codes from this folder
in order to access this language models
uh from olama with python we need to
install the Lang chain community library
and so if you haven't done so we can use
pip install and now we can access all
the language models we have installed
through AMA by specifying the name of
the model with this olama method for
example the first man on the moon was
dot dot dot and after a few seconds we
get back the completion of this sentence
so that means our model is up and
running that is a good sign now let's
move on to reading the transaction data
Categorise bank transactions
that we have and take a look at it you
can see that here in the name
description column we have all the
transactions that we want to classify we
have the indicator whether it is uh
expense or income and we also have the
amount in Euros of these transactions
now I have anonymized a lot of these
transactions so this is not my real
income and real expenses now we need to
find a way to insert all these different
expenses into our prompt right let's get
all the unique transactions from our
data you can see that this is quite a
big list and this may exceed the token
limit that the large language model has
so if we try to insert this huge list
into our prompt there's a risk that the
model comes back with a completely
nonsensical answer or incomplete answer
because your question is already taking
too many tokens so after many try and
errors I found that around 30
transactions would give the most optimal
response so here you can see an example
response with 30 transactions so with
this approach we are going to create a
for Loop to basically Loop through all
the 300 transactions here in our bank
statements and we take in 30 transaction
s at a time and so a handy way to handle
this for Loop is to get an index list so
this index list is basically giving us a
sequence of all the index from zero
until the last item hopping 30 items at
a time and with this we can also
conveniently handle the last group as
well which might not be 30 items but
maybe less now let's initialize a data
frame to store all the unique
transactions and their responding
categories and with this for Loop I'll
call a custom function that I created
and this function takes the names of the
transactions of the Aram that we are
using and the only thing we need to do
is to properly pass the output from the
language model into a format that we can
work with so if we look at this output
we definitely only want to keep these
lines right and we don't want the rest
like certainly here's the categories but
we don't need to worry about this for
now because at the end we can always
remove all the rows that have categories
being none the complic ation is that
sometimes the language model might use a
different format for the answer so we
had to use some kind of like validator
for the output in order to make sure
that the output actually is in the
format we want for example in the
response we have the hyphen in between
the transaction and the category so one
handy python library for this is pantic
so the idea is that after getting the
response we will run it through a
validation check if the validation fails
we will rerun the language model to get
another response until we get the right
output if you're interested in how to do
this with pantic you can check out the
code in the GitHub rapo Link in
description okay now let me run this for
Loop and I also print out the
transaction names and also the output by
the models also notice that when I'm
running this for Loop for some reason if
I want to stop it I really cannot stop
it so if for some reason we want to
interrupt this process we can go to the
terminal and do Pama and so in the back
end all the processes will be stopped
okay after a while if everything goes
well we should get back the data frame
with all the transaction with the
categories that Lama 2 has categorized
for us I'll just save the CSV here now
let's open the CSV file and quickly look
at the output overall I'm quite happy
with the categories that llama 2 came up
with however some categories may be
quite similar to each other but not
completely the same and I want to group
them together so I just quickly group
these Cate ra by hand now the last step
is to clean up a little bit this data
frame and then we can go ahead and merge
this data frame into the main
transaction data frame using the
transaction name so after this we should
have a data frame with all information
the transactions and the categories so
Create personal finance dashboard
that was exciting but the next part of
the project is even more exciting we
create a personal finance dashboard
based on the transaction data that we
just obtained the idea for this
dashboard is we want to show the the
income breakdown and the expense
breakdown for both years 2022 and 2023
and at the bottom I also want to show
how much I earn and how much I spend per
month in each year so for creating
interactive visualization I love using
plotly Express for the creation of the
dashboard we also use panel panel is an
awesome library for creating data
dashboard very easily and very fast now
let's read in our transaction data and
for the income I don't have a lot of
income sources so I can just use the
name of the income as the category
firstly we want to make the pie chart to
show the income and expense breakdown I
create a function here to basically take
the data and select for the year and uh
whether we are looking at the expense or
the income in the data set and similarly
I also create a function to make uh bar
charts that basically uh gives us a
histogram of the income or expense per
month over the year and you can see that
it's super nice with plotly Express that
you can also h on the different sections
on the graph and see the data label now
we almost done we just need to combine
and organize all these charts on our
dashboard so here just create a panel
layout with the tabs which consist of
two tabs we have the 2022 for 2023 tab
we have exactly the same charts and
graphs but for 2023 data and to show all
this nicely on the dashboard we will use
a template from panel called Fast lless
template we can specify the header of
our dashboard we have the sidebar which
is some information and also you can put
in different elements or pictures Etc
and in the main here we will put in the
tabs that we just created and if we do
template show we can see that this is
our dashboard and here's my income and
expense breakdown and here is how much I
earn and how much I spend per month in
each year here you can see that I do
save a little bit more in 2022 than in
2023 which is not really a good sign but
if you're into personal finance and
things like that you may notice that
this overview is probably not complete
because we also have assets so if you
transfer your money to an investment
account or if you pay uh the mortgage uh
toward watchs your house then part of
that money is also your asset as well
and not only your expense although as
Conclusions
you can see I can't retire anytime soon
I hope this inspires you to do your own
projects and experiment with open-
Source language models I think in the
future it will be a norm for us to be
able to use and run large language
models locally on laptops and other
personal devices if you enjoyed this
project also check out other data
science projects on my channel thank you
for watching
bye-bye

Introduction
I've read over a hundred books on python
I mean not all at once and that would be
ridiculous but over the course of years
I've read at least a 100 books on Python
and I want to share my three favorites
with you so these are some of the books
that I've read I don't know you might
recognize a few of those but before I
share with you my three favorites
there's something else that I want to
tell you that I think is even more
important than the three books that I'm
about to recommend so here it
Shop
is oh uh I can't actually find the thing
I want to show you in order to
demonstrate this so I'm going to have to
go and get one just bear with me while I
do
[Music]
Bag
that do you want to see what's in the
bag let's have a
look
yes it's a dictionary but how is an
What does it have to do with Python?
English dictionary relevant to learning
python well I'm coming to that so
imagine if you wanted to learn English
Learn English Analogy
and I said what you need to do is get
yourself a nice big dictionary like this
one that has loads of vocab and there's
a section on grammar too I did not know
that do you know what the collective
noun for Apes is it's a shrewdness of
Apes learn all the vocab learn all the
grammar and then you'll know English
that would be terrible advice it's also
terrible advice for learning python
which is why you have to choose your
first book carefully instead you learn a
little bit of vocab a little bit of
grammar and then you practice you
practice speaking and writing and at
first your facility with the language is
nowhere near enough to be able to
communicate the complexity of your
thoughts so you learn a bit more vocab a
bit more grammar and it becomes an
iterative process until you can
communicate exactly what it is that you
want to say and eventually if you're
lucky your ability with language
develops to the point where it helps you
come up with original thoughts and ideas
and it's exactly the same when learning
p python which is why as a beginner
Books to Avoid
there are certain books you should avoid
so as well as giving you three book
recommendations I want to show you how
to recognize what makes a good book for
a
beginner let's start by looking at a
book that's bad for beginners this book
isn't very good for beginners there's
too much vocab too much grammar it's
overwhelming and it's more likely to put
you off that's not to say that it's a
bad book it's just not well suited to
someone that's new to programming and
new to python what you want is something
Book 1
gives you enough of the basics the vocab
and the grammar to get you started on
projects as quickly as possible which is
why I like this book what I like about
python crash course is that it's split
into two parts Part One teaches you the
foundations it teaches them thoroughly
but it doesn't linger too long on them
and part two takes what you've learned
and uses it to create projects part one
is that thick that's all the python you
need to know in order to be able to work
on the projects so you learn the
foundations of python in a few pages and
then you start doing interesting things
in part two which is where all the
projects are and the first project you
do is a game and um it's pretty good
actually it's Space Invaders so you'll
be building something like that you'll
also build an interactive data
visualization learn how to work with
apis and build a web app using Django
it'll introduce you to git and GitHub
and and give you advice on text editors
and idees so you spend a lot of time
learning how to apply what you've
learned in part one to building projects
which is the whole point of coding in
the first place this really is an
absolutely excellent book for beginners
and it's my first recommendation book
Book 2
two becomes a little bit more difficult
because Learners needs diverge I don't
know why you want to Learn Python maybe
you want to do data analysis maybe you
want to develop web apps and that would
influence the choice of the SE second
book but this second book I think would
be useful for
everyone whether you want to Learn
Python to do data analysis or whether
you want to do web apps or whether you
want to go into computer science you
should have an understanding of at least
the basics of computer science because
that will be very useful to you when
you're trying to problem solve further
down the line and that's why I would
recommend this book Python Programming
by John zel gives a very thorough
introdu uction to the basics of computer
science it will help to ensure that you
don't develop any really bad habits as
you teach yourself to code in Python and
it will help you to understand why
things should be done in a particular
way and as you work through it you'll
develop your algorithmic thinking and
problem solving skills and I think
that's an essential step for anyone
that's teaching themselves and the way I
would approach this book especially if
you've already started with python crash
course is go to the end of each chapter
and attempt the exercises and when you
get stuck go to the section in the
chapter that explains that question or
helps to explain that question go
through every chapter that way and you
will get an overview and a foundation of
computer science that I think will stand
you in very good stead this book
actually is a very old version it even
talks about python 1 in here somewhere
there's a much newer
Edition the choice for book three is
Book 3
well it's trickier still because it
really will now depend on where your
interests lie so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to recommend more than one
book but I'm not suggesting you get them
all just choose the book depending on
what it is that you want to use Python
for so if you want to carry on in the
1st Book 3
same vein as this book with exploring
computer science a bit further I would
suggest this it's called classic
computer science problems in Python and
it's the sort of things that you might
get in a technical interview search
algorithms that kind of thing and if
you're interested in computer science I
really think you'll like this book there
is another one as well if you want to go
down the algorithm route and explore
2nd Book 3
those algorithms illuminated this is an
excellent introductory book on
algorithms it's not actually in Python
it uses pseudo code to explain the
algorithms maybe you want to use Python
for data analysis and if that's the case
then there really are lots of books to
choose from in fact the choice is so
great that it can be paralyzing but I'm
going to give you three options for this
that won't disappoint so the first two
that give a sort of broad overview of
data science or to use Python for data
analysis are these two learning
scientific programming with python now I
know this says that it's covering
scientific programming but actually what
is covered in here are all the tools
that you would need in order to be able
to use Python for data analysis so
that's a really good sort of broad book
on the subject and then there's this one
python tools for scientists which is
quite similar really it covers all of
the tools that you would need uh for
science but also for doing data analysis
and uh I really like these two books
although they don't say data analysis or
data science in the title they're
actually very good for learning the
skills that you need to do that however
if it's just pandas that you want to
Best Book for Pandas
learn then the best book on pandas that
I have seen is this one effective pandas
this will teach you how to do pretty
much anything you can imagine in pandas
it is a superb pandas book in fact this
is the first edition I think there is
now a second edition so check that
before you get it but if it's pandas
that you want to learn and you're not
interested in learning the other aspects
of data analysis then you don't need to
think twice about it this is the book to
Don't forget libraries
get oh yeah one last thing it's always a
good idea if you can borrow the book
from a library first so that you can get
a feel for whether or not it's right for
Thanks Brilliant
you did you know that Interactive
Learning can be up to six times more
effective than traditional methods
that's why I use brilliant.org the
sponsor of this video whether you're
puzzled by data science need to refresh
your linear algebra skills or are
curious about cuttingedge topics like
Quantum Computing and neural networks
brilliant has a course for you you what
sets brilliant apart for me is how
engaging and straightforward their
learning process is every course is
filled with interactive content and
follow-up questions making learning not
just informative but also incredibly fun
you're not just passively absorbing
information you're actively solving
problems and building your skills step
by step one of the things I like most
about Brilliance courses is their
thoughtful and skillful design they're
structured to gradually build up your
knowledge ensuring a solid understanding
of each concept before moving on to the
next it's learning at its finest

Coding is changing quite a bit in 2024.
And here's what you need to know
if you want to keep up.
First, let's go through three facts.
Coding is easier than ever to learn.
More people than ever know how to code
and are learning how to code.
And tools
like chatbots have completely demolished
the barrier to entry
for building technical projects.
Now, here's
what all of this means for you.
The fact that anyone can go online
and really quickly
figure out how to build anything
they want with any language in
What This Means For You
any tech stack
means that basic coding
skills are not enough.
We've seen
the requirements for junior dev jobs
are just getting steeper and steeper
and now you pretty much
need to be equivalent to a mid-level
developer of 2 to 3 years ago
to build a land
just a junior or internship
level position.
What this really means
is that if you want to be
a great software engineer
and you want to land a job,
you need to stand out.
And I'm going to tell you
exactly how you can do that.
So first things first.
How To KEEP Up
Of course,
you've got to have the basics down.
You need to know
fundamental programing skills.
You need to know tools
like Git and GitHub,
how to use an idea,
how to do professional development,
and even things like data structures
and algorithms are important.
You want to make sure
that you are a well-rounded developer.
You've got all of these areas covered,
but that's just the starting point.
If you want to land a job
now, what's really important
is that you specialize
where people are still hiring developers
and where I've specifically
looked for developers
I've needed to hire
is people
that have specialized knowledge.
That means they're really good
in one area of development
and they can do things
a lot quicker
than I'd be able
to figure out
using something like chat, CBT,
specifically frontend
development back in development,
DevOps, architecture, system design.
If you're really good
in one area of programing,
there's a language
that you are a true expert
in or a framework or frameworks
that you know really, really well,
you're going to stand out.
And those are a lot of the jobs
that are popping up.
They want people
that are really good at this,
really good at using this database,
really good with this framework
or this language.
It's no longer enough
to just be a generalist.
Everyone can be a generalist
using something like chat CBT.
You need to be
the person that can audit, chat, CBT,
understand
when it's going wrong and going right
and how to use it the most effectively,
which ties into point number two.
If you want to be a good developer
and be able to land a job,
you need to be resourceful.
That means that like everyone else,
you need to know how to use these tools
to become as productive as possible.
I know myself,
I almost always use chat,
CBT and coding tools.
That's become a part of my workflow.
And since I'm
an experienced developer,
I can use them so much better
and more effectively
than many other beginners out there.
I know the questions to ask.
I know when it's leading me
in the wrong direction.
I know how to prompted
to get the information I want,
and even though I could
write the code myself,
I know how to direct it to do it
in a faster way.
That's the big change with coding.
What's happening
now is people are coding
as if it's natural language.
What's really become important
The BIGGEST Change
is how you explain how you articulate,
how you instruct
something like an AI model
and how you know when it's
giving you the right answer
and the wrong one.
No longer do you need to be an expert.
Extremely fast level programmer
writing all of the code yourself.
You need to be someone who knows
what code needs to be written,
who can solve the problem at a high level
and break it down to the discrete
enough steps that it can be solved
by an
AI or assisted,
at least
by some kind
of artificial intelligence tool.
This is where
I'm seeing the major change.
We're moving away from coding
being a pretty difficult thing
where there's all this syntax and stuff
to learn
to being something
that can be implemented
with natural language.
However, understanding
what language to give
it is the hard part,
and that comes with experience.
Now, even if you've done all that
and you became a specialist
and you know what to use
all these types of tools,
you still need to be credible.
You need to show all of this
Build Your Credibility
knowledge to someone who's potentially
going to be hiring you.
And that's a lot easier said than done.
So here's three simple ways
that you can provide some credibility
and things
that you can put on your resume
that will make you stand out
and actually demonstrate your skills.
First, this is an obvious one. Projects.
The best way to demonstrate
you know how to do
something is to actually have done it.
To have a project
that's complex enough,
but also easy enough
for someone to understand.
You can share on your resume.
You can talk about an interview
and you can relate your experience back
to beyond that,
having some kind of
social media presence.
Now, in my case, I'm
instantly credible
because of the hundreds,
if not thousands of videos at this point.
I have online
the multiple courses that I've built,
the people that trust me
and the partnerships that I've built.
Now, this isn't something
that everyone can do overnight,
but even when I had a really small
YouTube channel,
just those 50
or 100 videos with minimal views
demonstrated that I did
actually know how to code.
You could go
watch me do a coding live stream
and see for a fact that I actually do
know what I'm talking about
and I'm able to build something out
completely by myself.
This is what employers want to know,
that if you come on board,
you're not going to be someone
they need to teach
right from the beginning.
You already have that background.
You're confident working on your own
and you just need a bit of mentorship
and advice to get to that next level.
They're looking for people.
They can quickly accelerate up the ranks.
They want those God tier, high
level, high productivity programmers,
and you need to demonstrate
that you're already
well on your way to getting there.
Lastly, of course, you can do this
with experience
if you've done an internship
or if you've done some volunteer work,
if you've done coding
projects on the side,
maybe you've deployed
some, you built a website,
you've helped open a Discord server
or a community that can be great.
And in fact, with my software
development course,
we're giving students a ton of experience
by actually hiring them to work for us
after they complete the course.
If they're good enough,
obviously not everyone's
going to get that position,
but we just hired two people
graduating our software
development course
that really stood out there.
Great candidates, aced our final exam
and now they're working as coaches,
they're doing grading.
We're immediately
trying to get them into our system
because we know what potential
they have to be a great developer.
Now, if you guys want to check out
my course,
you can do that from the link
in the description.
It's really designed to be
the most up to date
curriculum to help you land a job in 2024
where all of these things
are so important.
So now let me give you a five step plan
to land a software
developer role as quickly
as possible in 2024.
First of all, you've got to learn
the skills can skip this part,
get the fundamentals down,
get some specialized knowledge,
The 5 Step PLAN
get lots of practice working on projects,
and test your knowledge to make sure
you actually know
what you're talking about.
Next, join
a community really important
to network with other developers.
Learn how to work in a team
and get some inspiration
and insider knowledge
from other people
that are going through
the application process.
Trying to land jobs
gives you some motivation, helps you out
and gives you a lot of extra information
you want a great community.
There is one.
A part of the Course
Careers Software Development
Course can check that out below.
I'm very active in there constantly
talking with all of you guys
and it's been great
to hear your journeys and stories.
Next, you really need to optimize
your presence online.
This means building
a solid LinkedIn profile
with a professional headshot
you want to come across
as a professional, not as an amateur.
You want to make sure you've got
all your experience on there.
You're tailoring it
towards software development roles.
You want to make sure
all your social media is are cleaned up
that you come across as a professional.
When someone Googles
your name,
ideally having a resume
or portfolio website,
maybe having a little
social media presence
where you share some coding projects,
having a great GitHub,
where all the projects
are organized, clean,
easy to understand and run.
There's a million things
I could share here,
but having a solid online
presence is really helpful.
Next is to build your portfolio.
Now you'll likely be doing this
while you're learning all of your skills,
but you want to make sure you have
at least three really solid projects
to demonstrate your skill set and show
you actually know what you're doing.
Now, lastly,
it's really helpful
to have some insider information
if you don't, you're
going into interviews blind.
You don't know the types of questions
you're going to get asked.
You don't know how to prepare.
You don't know what roles to apply for,
what the salary expectation is.
If you know other developers,
if you have a mentor,
if you join a community
or you're a part of a program,
like course,
careers, software development,
you get that information
and that's going to save you
a ton of time and a ton of effort
and really accelerate your career growth.
Obviously, you do not need to pay
for all of this.
You can find it online for free.
Anyways, with that said,
I will wrap up the video
if you guys enjoyed make sure you leave.
I like subscribe to the channel
and I will see you in the next one.

Link: [# you need to stop using print debugging (do THIS instead)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3T3ZDquDDVg)
Summary:
### Advantages

- Core files, in conjunction with GDB, provide a robust method for debugging code, allowing developers to understand the exact state of a program at the moment of a crash.
- It enables developers to pinpoint the precise line and function where a crash occurs, making the debugging process more efficient and less daunting.
- Utilizing core files can save time and frustration by avoiding the need to insert numerous print statements or restart coding from scratch.

### Drawbacks

- The use of core files and GDB requires familiarity with these tools and the willingness to learn their syntax and commands, which may present a learning curve for some developers.
- Setting up the environment to generate and analyze core files (such as adjusting system limits and core pattern settings) may require additional steps and permissions.

### Tips and Advice

- To enable core dumps, use the command `ulimit -c unlimited` to remove size limits on core files and adjust the `core_pattern` setting to specify the output location for core files.
- When a program crashes, analyze the generated core file with GDB alongside the executable to get detailed information about the crash, such as the function, line number, and the state of registers.
- Implement checks in your code to prevent users from causing crashes through invalid inputs (e.g., by limiting the acceptable range of indices in an array).

### Lecture Content

- The video tutorial covers how to debug C programs using core files and the GNU Debugger (GDB). It demonstrates this process through an inventory simulator program example, which can print, edit, or quit. The tutorial shows how to handle a segmentation fault caused by an array index out of bounds error.

### Main Challenges

- Debugging larger and more complex programs without proper tools can be overwhelming and inefficient.
- Correctly setting up the environment to generate useful core files requires understanding of system configurations.

### The Importance and Usefulness of the Topic

- Mastering debugging with core files and GDB is crucial for developers to efficiently resolve crashes and bugs in their code, especially as projects grow in complexity.

### Accomplishments

- The tutorial successfully demonstrates how to identify and fix a bug that causes a segmentation fault in a sample inventory simulator program.

### Summary of the Content

- The video emphasizes the importance of using core files and GDB for debugging in C programming. It walks through an example of debugging a segmentation fault by analyzing a core file generated upon a crash, showing how to identify the exact location and cause of the error and how to apply a fix.

### Interesting Quotes or Insightful Sentences

- "By using core files, you can take on your next big project and not worry about complicated crashes that happen as your code gets big."
- "The core file is an ELF that contains the full state of the program when the program crashed."


Transcription:

let me know if this has ever been you
coding along in C and something goes
wrong on your program you're not
entirely sure what so you add a bunch of
print statements all over the place to
figure out what's going wrong and
eventually you can't crack the code so
you throw away your code and start over
stop doing that in this video we're
going to talk about the power of core
files and how you can use core files in
conjunction with GDB figure out exactly
what is wrong with your code and level
up your debugging process by using this
you can take on your next big project
and not worry about complicated crashes
that happen as your code gets big let's
get into it so for our example today
I've written here in inventory Simulator
the idea is the inventory simulator has
a bunch of boxes right I can either
print a box I can edit a box where I can
quit the program and these boxes are
described here by the structure where we
have an INT that says the box is already
in use and the stuff that the box
contains and you can stuff up to 64
bytes into a single box the idea is a
program runs in an infinite Loop and
until you tell it to quit you can either
print or edit a box you read in the Box
ID from the user and then go about
making that action happen via either
printing or editing so a decent amount
of code here not a huge project
obviously but if it you know if you're
not familiar with debugging debugging a
project of this size could be a little
daunting so we're going to use a core
file to show you how to make this
program work correctly if we can crash
it using GDB so let's go ahead and run
this program for a little bit and mess
around so we have the program compiled
we'll do GCC Taco inventory inventory.c
and we'll use Tac G to get debug Flags
built into the program so we have to
eventually debug the core file we'll
have all the information that we wrote
in our source code reflected in the
binary so we'll do attack G there
and with that we can now run our
programs we have our inventory simulator
so if you want to print a box we type P
and we could say box let's do two then
we see that box 2 returns nothing
because nothing is in that box so let's
go ahead and edit box Cube we'll say
We'll edit box number two and what's in
the box we'll put AAA BBB CCC cool and
then now if we go in we print box two
now that data is in that box well what
if we wanted to edit that box again we
can edit and we'll type box two and it
says nope sorry that box is already
occupied we can't edit that box so
pretty easy functionality here not a
whole bunch going on well what happened
if we wanted to do edit on box some huge
number
see how we got a we'll do it again real
quick edit one two three four we get
this thing called a core dumped what
that actually means is that the computer
dumps out what's called a core file this
doesn't always happen by default and
I'll show you how to make it happen in
in this case I have a core file that's
dumped here the core file is an elf that
contains the Full state of the program
when the program crashed if you don't
get a Core file when your stuff runs you
have to do a few commands the first
you're going to run is U limit
tax C for core and then type unlimited
this means that the kernel is allowed to
produce an unlimited amount of core
files and then what you have to do is do
cat proc
CIS kernel
core pattern
for me I made mine dot slash core so
that the core file gets produced locally
to the crashing program yours may be
something different so to change it all
you have to do is change to root so now
that your root and you can do you know
we'll Echo new core and we'll write that
pattern to this file here and if we cat
this the new core pattern is created so
if we crash our program again
should get a new core file so that means
that we now have a core dump from the
crashed program that represents the
program in the state that it was crashed
so now we need to do is use GDB to
figure out what went wrong take this
core dump and then compare it to the elf
and figure out what about the execution
broke the program the way we can do this
is we do GDB right so you have to have
GDB installed where you install GDB is
sudo apt install GDB
I already have it installed so I won't
do that you'll do GDB the name of the
offending program so for me it's
inventory and then also a third argument
to GDB is the core dump you want to
analyze so for me we'll do new core
and what you'll see here is we actually
get a pretty robust output of the
program in its crashing state so we say
the program terminated with the signal
Sig sag V or a segmentation fault it
terminated in the edit box function
where the variable I was given as a
parameter and I was this number at
inventory.c line 22. that's extremely
verbose this tells us exactly where in
our program our program crashed we can
actually take this and go back and look
at our source file and figure out what
happens let's go back and check that out
right now
you can go back here and it said line
22. so that means that we're in our edit
box function we have I as a parameter
and something about this line is wrong
this is what caused it to crash so now
what we can do is we can actually look
at the assembly instructions in the
register states of the program and
figure out what went wrong so we can do
is we can say examine the instruction at
PC
and we could say info registers
so what this tells us is that we were
doing the instruction move the value of
eax into this location here so this is
RDX offset by Rax times one
so we'll look at those registers here
and we'll say RX and then RDX and this
is where we get into an issue so what's
happening here is because our index was
so big if you look at our source code I
only allocated enough memory for a
hundred boxes and I was indexing into
this gigantic number there's actually an
integer overflow that happened here but
this gigantic number is what got indexed
into in our program and what we have to
do is now to fix this make it so that
the user is not allowed to index Above
This 100 so we'll go into our program
and we'll say
if I is greater than 100
print f
you can't do that Dave
and we'll return zero we have to do the
same thing
for the read int function
because we don't want to give the same
issue I'm sorry not reading we want to
do this for the uh that was for edit box
and also that for print box because
print box can yield the same issue
so now we can take these fixes that
we've made here we can go through and
compile our program with our newly
implemented fixes dot c tech G got two
warnings here oh we don't actually do
return zeros in a void we'll delete
those real quick
cool no warnings inventory will retest
our crashing case
and we'll no longer crash the program by
using a core file you can instantly see
the state that the program crashed in
and then use that to back reference and
find bugs in your code if you're new to
GDB go watch this video on GDB or watch
this video that I think you'll like it
just as much thanks for watching

Link: [# Saving isn't enough: How to get actually rich in your 20s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9lcWE2Fg58)
Notes:
In the video, the presenter discusses the myths and realities of achieving financial freedom through investing, particularly critiquing the common advice of investing in index funds as a surefire path to wealth. Here's a breakdown of the content, highlighting the advantages, drawbacks, tips and advice, lecture content, main challenges, and a summary of the content, including insightful quotes.

### Advantages:

- Index funds offer a simple, low-cost way to invest in the stock market.
- The strategy of saving and investing in index funds is touted for its ease and passive nature.

### Drawbacks:

- The video criticizes the "get rich slow" philosophy, arguing it sacrifices the prime years of life for uncertain future wealth.
- It points out the limitations of relying solely on index funds, noting that true wealth often requires control, leverage, and significantly higher risk-taking.
- Following the conventional path (college, good job, save, invest in index funds) is labeled as a recipe for mediocrity or slow lane to wealth.

### Tips and Advice:

- Focus on creating value and being a producer rather than just a consumer.
- Look for business opportunities that offer control, meet a need, have barriers to entry, allow for time detachment, and have the potential for scaling.

### Lecture Content:

- The video outlines three financial paths: the sidewalk (leading to poverty), the slow lane (leading to mediocrity), and the fast lane (potentially leading to significant wealth).
- The presenter bases the discussion on MJ DeMarco's book, which criticizes conventional financial planning and advocates for entrepreneurial efforts as a faster route to wealth.

### Main Challenges:

- Overcoming societal and cultural norms that praise the slow lane to financial independence.
- Identifying and executing a viable fast lane business idea that meets the SENSE criteria (Control, Entry, Need, Scale, Time).

### Importance and Usefulness of the Topic:

- Challenges the viewer to reconsider their financial strategies and the traditional advice often given about wealth accumulation.
- Encourages entrepreneurial thinking and highlights the importance of financial education beyond conventional wisdom.

### Accomplishments:

- The video successfully demystifies the concept that index funds are the best or only way to achieve financial freedom.
- Provides a framework (SENSE) for evaluating business ideas that could lead to faster wealth accumulation.

### Summary of the Content:

The video presents a critical view of the conventional path to wealth through savings and index fund investments, promoting instead a more entrepreneurial approach that involves creating value, solving problems, and leveraging business systems for financial gain. It emphasizes the need for control over one's financial plan and the potential for scaling as key components of the fast lane to wealth.

### Interesting Quotes or Insightful Sentences:

- "Live poor, die rich is a plan that sacrifices today for a nebulous freedom tomorrow."
- "Wealth isn't embodied in material possessions but in the freedom to make those purchases."
- "Money should give you more freedom, not less. Anything detrimental to freedom is not real wealth."
- "You can't medicate poor money management with more money."
- "Insanity is doing the same things over and over again and expecting a different result."
- "If it can't impact millions, you won't make millions."
- "Wealth isn't embodied in the car but the freedom to know that you can buy it."
- "Don't invest into your life into building someone else's business. Take control because otherwise, you'll be controlled."

This comprehensive overview captures the essence of the video's critique of traditional financial advice and its advocacy for a more proactive, entrepreneurial approach to achieving financial freedom.

Transcription:

basically all my money that's in stocks
and shares is invested in IND what's
going on when it comes to Index Fund you
want to get rich from investing
F
invest despite the popular Financial
advice of saving as much as you can and
investing the rest into index funds I
don't think any of these people got rich
by investing into index funds do you
think Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk or
let's say Alex heroi got rich by
investing into index funds or the
founder of notion Ivan out get rich slow
is an absolute scam based on this book I
know what you're thinking another
getrich quick scheme but don't judge a
book by its cover because this book will
challenge your belief system and reveal
the truth to you go to college get good
grades graduate get a good job save 10%
of your paycheck invest in the stock
market preferably in a lowcost index
funds Max your 401k slash your credit
cards keep a Frugal budget then someday
when you're 65 years old you will be
rich this is a story most of us been
told to you about Financial Freedom and
getting rich realistically my guy MJ
DeMarco calls this plan live poor die
rich aka the slow lane getting rich slow
ultimately means sacrificing your today
your dreams and your life plan that pays
a nebulous Freedom after most of your
life has evaporated assuming you
continue living like a minimalist monk
an important question that this book
made me think over and over again is is
reaching Financial Freedom at 65 worth
it if it divorce 40 Years of my youthful
most precious time of my life but if
there is a way we can get rich during
our 20s or 30s or maybe in a couple of
years from today according to the book
there are three road maps and depending
on which one you choose to walk your
path to wealth is also detrim mind which
one are you so the first one is the slow
Lane this is the most followed path and
also a recipe for poverty to determine
whether you belong to this group let me
ask you a couple of questions if your
answer is yes please give yourself a one
point one you haven't learned much since
graduating from high school or college
two you live paycheck to paycheck three
you think people with money have it
because they had wealthy parents luck or
easier life circumstances than you four
you put faith into politicians and
government to change the system instead
of focusing on how you can change
yourself five you're easily impressed
and seek to impress six you think money
doesn't buy happiness now stop the video
and tell me how many pints you got I'm
sorry to break it to you but if you even
had more than one point it's pretty a
bad sign because it means that you're
walking the sidewalk the path to Poverty
the important thing to understand is
sidewalk is money blind meaning it's it
doesn't matter how much you actually
make I always thought if I would make a
little bit more than the last month I
will have less stressful time with money
but I've learned in a hard way you can't
medicate poor money management with more
money we see many rappers and NBA
players who had millions of dollars file
bankruptcy after a few years they retire
no matter how much money we have if we
spend more than we earn we will be
always walking the sidewalk so the first
step to escaping the sidewalk walk is
recognizing that we might be on it only
a mindset and a behavioral change is a
solution to money problems one of my
favorite quotes says insanity is doing
the same things over and over again and
expecting a different result one of the
common belief in the sidewalk path is
wealth means material possessions I used
to think that way too you know in media
in pop culture we're encouraged to look
rich rather than be rich the author says
if you're financing your 90k
mercedesbenz over 6 years because that's
all you can't afford you can't afford it
wealth isn't embodied in the car but the
freedom to know that you can buy it
freedom to walk into the dealership know
your price pay cash and drive away a big
misconception in the sidewalk is money
doesn't buy
happiness does poverty buy happiness
people say money doesn't buy happiness
because they don't understand what money
actually means when most people earn
more money it doesn't expand their
freedom but it contracts in the
beginning of my YouTube channel I
thought if I would post more videos get
more sponsorships I would make more
money and therefore I would be more free
but that's completely wrong I started
working 60 hours a week to post three
videos every single week even though I
got pretty good results like gring
subscribers money and Views I was
completely burnt out I didn't have to
hang out with anyone I didn't have time
to enjoy my hobbies and actually spend
the money money that I made after basic
needs met like security shelter health
and food our happiness quadent is most
significantly impacted by the quality of
our relationships with our partners
family friends spirituality and also
ourselves many millionaires and
well-paid career folks are miserable and
it has nothing to do with the money it
has to do with their freedom on the
sidewalk money doesn't buy happiness
because it's misused money should give
you more freedom and I'm not only
talking about Financial Freedom but also
time Freedom you should have the ability
to control your own time and schedule
anything detrimental to Freedom is not
real wealth so how can we make money
that actually results in the freedom of
choice it's by walking the fast Lan path
but before we get into that path we need
to understand the next PATH so that you
truly realize the differences once
people get out of from the sidewalk the
next PATH we tend to walk is the slow
lane this is the path path that our
parents teachers and many Financial
gurus recommend it sounds like this go
to college or uni graduate with good GRS
get a good job save some of your
paycheck pay yourself first climb the
corporate letter contribute to your 401k
save save safe invest in the stock
market Buy and Hold buy index funds say
no to expensive coffee live below your
means have patience and one day in your
60s or maybe' 70s you will be rich if
we're celebrating Friday and hate
Mondays it's a strong side that we're
walking the slow lane which leads to
mediocrity slow lane is often times
labeled as responsible and normal and
even realistic way to get rich if that's
a life path you want to walk and it
genuinely excites you then that's
completely fine in my opinion but the
problem with the slow lane is that what
most gurus recommend doesn't even work
people say pay yourself first live
Frugal and save but with increasing
inflation High tax rates and many things
you can't control as an employee you
never pay yourself first indeed most of
the time we pay ourselves last two
things are absolutely required to get
wealthy one control and two leverage and
with slow lane you have control of
neither of them if you have a salary
that means you're trading your time with
money it doesn't matter whether your
annual salary is 30k or 200k as long as
you're tied to your salary you don't
have control on your time our time is
limited and can't be leveraged also if
if you're an employee you have no
control on your paycheck since the upper
limit is 24 hours for the hourly worker
there is nothing you can do to change
this limit and the worst part is you
can't control the compound interest of
index funds too when the market goes
down your hard-earned savings evaporate
too you might think but I will buy and
keep and hold for 30 40 years what if
you didn't even live till till your 60s
or 70s last week one of my brother's
close friend passed away due to a car
accident and he was 27 in the slow lane
we assume we will live long but you
might even die right after you watch
this video from a heart attack who knows
and even if you invested 10% of your
income successfully till you're 60 or 70
you're not going to be rich with the
inflation rates the amount you made with
index funds is not going to be much you
might be not broke sure but you will be
never be rich don't get me wrong
slowlane strategies aren't worthless in
a plan they shouldn't be the plan the
slow lane as a total plan is the problem
not the slow lane being a piece of the
plan you're watching this video because
you want to control your financial
destiny not to put in wall Street's
hands or some Corporation because if
you're investing all of your savings
into index funds you're just making
someone else's Corporation get richer if
you want to get rich we must control the
leverage and the variables in our
financial plan and any plan without
control immediately disintegrates into a
plan of hope hope isn't a plan if you
want to have an actual plan for
financial and time Freedom we must walk
the fast lane path with with fast lane
if you're 18 you can be Filthy Rich by
25 if you're 30 you can be retired by 36
broke at 48 and you can retire by 54 so
what's exactly a fast lane fast lane is
a way to get rich quick when people hear
get rich quick they assume it means get
rich easy because get rich quick is such
an abuse phrase that has zero
credibility the distinction is that get
rich quick is not equal to get rich easy
it's obviously not easy and it's
obviously not for everyone for sure but
the question is is it for you fast
laners make money via their business
systems and investment they believe that
money is everywhere and it's extremely
abundant money reflects the value we've
created how many lives we've touched so
how are we going to create value it's by
being a producer first and consumer
second my mother always told me to
create video games rather than playing
them and it can be applied to anything
in life whether you're watching YouTube
videos or taking mortgage or even buying
clothes CL don't be the consumer first
be the one that creates YouTube videos
holds a mortgage and sells clothes it's
not easy for sure but we need to offer a
value through our businesses if we want
to make money if you're looking to start
a side business to diversify your income

today don't miss out on this opportunity
to turn your creative ideas into a
profitable business one of the
misconception is just because you're
Your Own Boss it doesn't mean Freedom
not all businesses are Fast Lanes and
many can't be transformed into systems
that survive on their own sure there
isn't like a complete you know passive
business but you got what I mean there
are five CL Lane business categories
these are rental Systems computer or/
software content distribution and human
resource what all of these businesses
have common is the sense framework sense
stays for the Commandment of control
entry need time and scale let's start
with the first letter C control when you
control your business you control
everything in your business your
organization products pricing Revenue
model and operational choices no control
means crashes if someone can flip a
switch and destroy your business you're
playing a rou it with your financial
plan don't invest into your life into
building someone else's business take
control because otherwise you'll be
controlled the second one is entry the
business you picked should have a high
barrier entry the easiest way to figure
the entry difficulty is ask yourself
this if getting into a business an event
or process real business startups are
processes not events if everyone is
doing it it means the entry barrier is
low if you still want to enter a
business model where the entry is low
barrier then be prepared to be
exceptional with exceptionality you can
break the odds of Entry another
important thing is the need businesses
that solve needs and provide value then
because no one cares about your desires
your dreams your passions and your wise
the world is a selfish place we need to
solve other people's problem to make
money we need to stop chasing money and
start chasing needs the amount of money
in our life is a reflection of the
amount of value we have given to others
you don't know how to offer value here
are the list of the things you should
consider make people feel better it can
be entertainment music or games help
them solve a problem maybe losing weight
educate them make them look better give
them security raise a positive emotion
satisfy appetites like food make things
easier enhance their dreams and give
hope if you can bring one of these
values and be exceptional at it you will
make millions a profitable business
doesn't guarantee wealth or time
Detachment some business owners are
married to their businesses if the
business can't be automated and
systemized to be operated while you're
absent and if it's attached to your time
completely then it's a job lastly if you
can't scale your business you don't have
a chance the more you can scale it the

Transcription:

Introduction
one of my favorite features of editing
and working with code in neovim is the
concept of text objects which provide a
really nice way to manipulate and edit
the text in a file through Concepts like
Words paragraphs and many others through
neovim's tree sitter there's a really
powerful way to extend this
functionality even further and make
editing code in New of them even better
Basic Text Objects
[Music]
if you take a look at this typescript
file I've just opened my cursor is
currently over a text object called a
word to select it I can use V for visual
mode press I for inside or inner and
then press W for word If instead I do v
i and uppercase W then it's any sequence
of non-blank characters including
symbols as well another text object is
called a paragraph which is a sequence
of non-mt lines so if I do v i p it'll
select the paragraph I'm in and then you
also have text objects for when you're
between several different characters
like Curly braces quotes single quotes
parentheses brackets that sort of thing
if I place my cursor somewhere between
these curly braces I can do v i curly
brace and select everything between the
curly braces if I do V A for around
instead of inside and then curly brace
it'll select everything within them and
the curly braces as well I can also do
this with brackets so if I move between
these brackets and do v i bracket you
can use either an opening bracket or
closing bracket or VA bracket to select
the brackets as well or with double
quotes I can go between these double
quotes and do VI double quote or the a
double quote if I'm before a text object
so if I go up one line putting the
cursor before this array and I do v i
bracket it'll find the next nearest one
and select everything within it there's
also some commands for moving between
some text objects like words or
paragraphs if I want to move through
paragraphs I can use opening and closing
curly braces if I use closing curly
brace it'll move through the paragraphs
in the file so the sequences of
non-empty lines and if I do opening
curly brace it'll go backwards if I want
to move through words instead I can use
W to move forward to the start of words
or uppercase W if I want to include
symbols I can is B to move backwards or
E to move forwards to the end of words
other than selecting text with text
objects you can also apply operators so
for example if I want to delete a word
I'm in and I move to this ingredients
and do d i w I can do that or c i w to
do that and move into insert mode
all of this is pretty awesome in and of
itself but what if I told you that
through neovim's built-in tree sitter we
can configure syntax aware text objects
that essentially know what a conditional
Loop function or class is in your file
Setting Up Treesitter
[Music]
alright so I've opened up my neobim
config here the second line requires
Hacienda lazy that's because the first
thing you'll need is a plugin manager to
be able to install plugins for your
setup I'm currently using lazy.nvim and
this require statement corresponds to a
file that's within this Lua folder
within joseon and it's called
lazy.lua in this file the first thing I
do is bootstrap the lazy.nvim plugin
manager so that it gets installed
whenever new of them starts up if it
isn't already installed then I require
the lazy.admin plugin call it setup
function and specify a set of folders or
Lua modules with the configuration files
for all of my different plugins now what
you should really care about here is
this first import for joseon.plugins of
course you can structure this however
you like this corresponds to this
plugins folder you see right here if you
want to learn more and understand all
the details that you might need to set
up and use lazy.nvim I highly recommend
you check out my detailed video on that
which I'll have Linked In the
description in this file as I mentioned
earlier I have luo files for all the
different plugins that I'm using in my
setup now the first thing we'll need for
this is a plugin called nvim tree sitter
so I'm going to add a new file here
called nvim Dash tree
sitter.lua I'm going to open that up now
the first thing we want to do here is
return a table that will contain the
lazy Dot and Bim plugin configuration
for NVM tree sitter and then inside this
table We'll add the short plugin URL for
NVM tree sitter I'll have a link in the
description to my entire neovim config
so that you can find the code I use for
this in my own setup and also a blog
post where you'll find all the code you
might need so you can copy and paste
that into your own config after adding
the short plugin URL which points to a
GitHub repository We'll add a config
function that will run whenever this
plugin loads in this function the first
thing we'll do is require the plugin
with the following require statement
from nvim treesitter dot configs after
requiring the plugin for call it setup
function and inside of the setup
function we'll specify several different
important options first one will be to
enable the Highlight module so that we
can get better syntax highlighting
through tree sitter we'll also be
enabling indentation so that we get
better indentation through the equals
operator and then we'll specify and
ensure installed list with parsers for
all of the different languages that we
want to use tree sitter with if you go
into the tree sitter repository you can
go to the supported languages section
and here you'll see all the different
parsers that you can install through
nvim tree sitter if they have a checkbox
it means that at least the syntax
highlighting is supported in my own
config what I work with the most are
JavaScript and typescript files as well
as spelled files so I've included those
we'll be needing the typescript parser
for the example typescript file that I
was showing you guys earlier now the
final thing I want to add is the
following
this is called incremental selection so
I'm enabling it and I'm setting some key
maps for it using control space we'll
select the current node I'm in taking me
into visual mode and if I do it again
it'll select the parent node and
everything within it if I press
backspace it'll go backwards in the
order I've already selected things I'll
show you this in a second now we also
need to make sure that whenever nvim
tree seter updates all of the parsers
are updated as well because if not the
plugin can break so I'm going to go to
the top here and I'm going to add
following this build command runs
whenever NVM tree sitter is installed or
updated through lazy.nvim so whenever
this happens we'll run TS update to
update all of the installed parsers now
I also want to add an event here
to Lazy load this plugin on specific
neogram events I want to Lazy load it
whenever we open a buffer for an already
existing file with buff read pre or open
a buffer for a new file with buff new
file this is because we don't really
need tree sitter out of the context of a
buffer so we can lazy load it whenever
we open a buffer for an already existing
file or for a new one now I'm going to
save this file I'm going to open the
lazy UI with colon lazy and you'll see
here that nmim tree sitter says it's not
installed so I'm going to go ahead and
install it by pressing uppercase i as
you can see here after it gets installed
the parsers get installed as well
The Syntax Tree
now I've gone back to my typescript
example file and essentially what
happens now is that through three sitter
and the typescript parser we now have
access to a syntax tree for the current
file we're working in I can get a visual
representation of the tree by doing
colon inspect tree you'll see here that
whatever is highlighted on the left hand
side corresponds to the current node in
the tree and my cursor is in so if I
move through these nodes the
highlighting changes on the left hand
side if for example I go to the left
hand side and then go to this class here
you'll see that on the right that's
called a class decoration node
so right now we've added better syntax
highlighting better indentation to the
equals operator and incremental
selection as well to show you guys how
Incremental Selection Example
incremental selection Works let's say
I'm in this Title Here which is a node
in the tree if I do control space it'll
select that node if I do control space
again it'll select the parent of the
node and everything within it and this
will go on like this until I've selected
the whole file so if I do this again
it'll select the body of the class then
the whole class and then the file can go
backwards with backspace
Adding Treesitter Text Objects
[Music]
I've gone back to my config to add
support for these same tax aware text
objects I'm going to add a dependencies
table and inside I'm going to specify
the short plugin URL for nvimentary
theater text objects which is the plugin
that we need to set this up I'm going to
save this file open the file explorer
and under the plugins directory I'm
going to add another file called nvim
tree sitter
text objects.lua
now in this file we'll also return a
table the first thing will be the short
plugin URL for this text objects plugin
then we're going to add lazy equals true
because we want this plugin to load
alongside NVM tree sitter and because
we've specified it as a dependency if we
set lazy equals true here then instead
of loading whenever new of them starts
it'll just load whenever nvm3 Setter
loads then we'll add a config function
where we'll require nmim tree
sitter.configs because it's the setup
function and inside pass a table where
we'll add a text objects field then
inside will have a select field we're
going to enable this set look ahead to
true so that we can jump forward to the
nearest text object like I showed you
guys with the built-in text objects
earlier and then we're going to start
configuring some key maps for this
plugin my first set of key maps will
look something like this how this works
is that first you specify the key map so
this is going to be a equals and this
will match an outer assignment to
execute this I'll use v a equal sign the
second one would be for doing v i equal
sign to select the inner part of an
assignment this third one will be v l
equal sign to select the left hand side
of an assignment and then v r equal sign
to select the right hand side of an
assignment you can also use operators so
you could do c a equal sign or D a equal
sign now when I show you this in action
so I'm going to save this file and then
open up the lazy y with colon lazy and
press capital I to install the missing
and Vim tree sitter text objects plugin
and then close the UI with Q now I've
opened up the typescript file again as
you can see here in Line 39 we have an
assignment now with the key maps I
configured I can do VA equal sign and
select the assignment if I do v i equal
sign it will select the inner part of it
which is the right hand side if I go
back to the start of this line and do VL
equal sign I can select the left hand
side or VR equal sign and select the
right hand side if I move down a line
and do VA equal sign it'll find the
nearest closest one and select it as
well now let's add some more key maps
I'm going to add the following two to
use vaa and Via to select the outer and
inner parts of an argument or a
parameter the next two are for selecting
the outer and inner parts of a
conditional
these two are for the outer and inner
parts of a loop then I'm going to use
vaf and vif to select the outer and
inner parts of a function call
vam and Vim to select the outer inner
parts of a function definition and the
following select the outer and inner
parts of a class I'm going to save this
now I'm back to my example and you'll
see if I'm within this function and I do
vam I'll select the function definition
or Dam and delete the function
definition if I do Vim I'll select the
inner part of the function definition or
dim and delete the inner part of the
function definition and then with the
rest of the key maps I could do it with
classes conditionals Loops parameters so
for a parameter I could do vaa or via
which seem to do the same thing that
applies to arguments as well you can
play around with this as much as you
like and set up key maps as you like I'm
still playing around with it and it
might change in the future to see a list
of all the built-in text objects you can
Target you can take a look at this list
in the documentation do note that not
all of them are supported in every
language and you'll have to take a look
at this table here to see what is
supported for each language in
typescript and JavaScript specifically
there's a good amount of stuff supported
Swapping Text Objects
now let's say you want to be able to
swap some of these text objects then
you'll have to add another field here
called swap set enable to true then
you'll have to add a swap next field
that will specify key maps for swapping
the current text object the cursor is in
but the next one this first one is for
swapping a parameter or argument with
the following one so I would use leader
n a to do that and this next one leader
NM for swapping the current function
with the following one then you'll want
to add a swap previous to go backwards
and here I'm doing the same thing but
instead of using n I'm using p for
previous so leader PA and leader PM I'm
going to save this file I just realized
this swap should be up here and I'm
going to save that so I've opened up the
example again I have this get recipes
function and this create recipe function
if I'm in this get recipes and if I do
leader and M it'll swap it with create
recipe and if I do leader PM it'll go
backwards now I can do this with
parameters or arguments as well as so if
I'm over here in title and I do leader
and a leader and a or leader PA and
leader PA now finally you can also add a
Text Object Movements
set of movements to do this I'm going to
add the following
you'll see here A Move field I'm going
to set enable to true I'm going to set
set jumps to true so that these
movements add to the jump list in any of
them essentially if a movement is in the
jump list you can use Ctrl o and Ctrl I
to go forwards and backwards and then I
have a set of different key maps here
first set is for moving to the start of
the next text object closing bracket F
will go to the start of the next
function call for example or closing
bracket M will go to the start of the
next method or function definition same
goes for classes conditionals or Loops
in go to next end
it's the same thing but in uppercase to
move forwards to the nearest end of the
next text object then go to previous
start I'm using opening bracket to go to
the previous start of a text object so
opening bracket F will go to the
previous start of a function call and
then go to previous end we'll also go
backwards but instead of the start to
the end of the text object I think the
best way to explain this is with
examples so I'm going to save this file
I'm going to show you some examples of
jumping through function definitions so
if I want to go through the start of
function definitions in this file I can
do closing bracket M closing bracket M
closing bracket M and if I want to do
this backwards I do opening bracket M
opening bracket M and opening bracket M
you have to be relatively quick when you
do this for it to work properly if I
want to go through the ends of functions
I can do closing bracket capital M and
closing bracket capital M for example to
go backwards it would be opening bracket
capital M and opening bracket capital M
and according to the key maps we setup
this would also work with function calls
methods if statements loops and classes
if these are supported for the current
language you're working in now at the
bottom of this file there's one last
Repeating Movements
thing I want to add it to be able to
repeat movements and it's going to look
something like this
first thing here is to require a module
from NVM trees or text objects that will
allow us to set up these key maps and
then over here I'm setting up the
semicolon to repeat the last move in the
direction that it was in and then coma
to do this backwards this is very
similar to the built-in semicolon and
coma Vim commands when using F uppercase
F T and uppercase t but we don't want to
lose those so we also want to add the
following lines so that we can still
repeat F uppercase F T and uppercase t
with semicolon or coma I'm going to save
this file and I'm back in the example
here if I do closing bracket M to move
to the start of the function and I do
semicolon it'll go to the start of the
next one and semicolon and send if I
want to do this backwards I can use coma
now it'll still work with the built-in
Vim movements so let's say I move down
here and I want to move to the first
double quote I can do F double quote and
repeat that with semicolon or go
backwards with com all right you guys
Conclusion
that's it for this video if you want to
dive even deeper in the blog post in the
description I'll have a bonus section on
how to define your own custom text
object capture groups and take this
functionality even further I also want

newsletter where I'll be sharing what
I'm learning doing and tinkering with
I'll have a link for it in the

Intro
objectively calling conventions player
iOS
hi everyone thanks for watching Lori
wired and in this video we're going to
be learning about objective-c calling
conventions for iOS reverse engineering
now iOS applications can be written in
either Swift or objective c but we're
going to be looking at an older malware
sample today so it is in fact written in
Objective C now if you're doing your
analysis inside of guidra and you're
taking a look at the decompilation you
might notice a few things that seem
funky about it the main thing to
understand is that Objective C actually
uses this special thing called message
passing for method invocations so this
Message Passing
requires something called a selector
which is basically just a string
representation of the method so think of
it kind of like the method name and this
selects which method that you're trying
to invoke for a particular object then
The Objective C runtime actually passes
this invocation to the correct object
while the application is executing so
we're going to look at a couple examples
in ghidra and see kind of what that
looks like and look at these objective-c
runtime function calls and how we can
actually follow the control of the
program now I'm going to pull up the
example application that I have for this
Example IPA
this is the goontuct iOS malware family
and this is available for you on malware
Bazaar and I'm just going to jump right
into it and open up this executable
inside of ghidra and if you're not sure
how to follow along feel free to watch
my previous video on how to find the
entry point of an iOS application so
that you can follow along in gitra with
me
so I'm going to close it out this out
and let's just go straight into ghidra
now I already have a particular function
selected that we're going to be using
for this example and this is going to be
this blur bottom BG view function right
blurBottomBgView
here
and this is going to be inside of this
LC action sheet class and you you can
tell this because of the two colons
inside of here this signifies class Name
colon colon actual method name
so let's go in and let's take a look at
what this code actually looks like and
how we can follow along its flow of
control
now I'm going to skip this method real
quick and let's talk about this really
important function call called Objective
C message send so that's what this objc
actually stands for
now this is a really important runtime
method that's actually going to be
objc_msgSend
causing a function call so this is going
to be sending the actual message that's
going to invoke a particular specified
method now if we want to take a look at
the reference for this we can open up
our Apple developer documentation
and we want to make sure we go to the
subjective C runtime documentation and
then we can find our Objective C message
send function defined right here
now here's the name of it but the
important thing to note are the actual
parameters for this as I said this is
actually just invoking a method so the
first parameter right here is going to
be the object or instance of the class
that we're trying to actually call this
method on so this method is located
inside of a class so this is going to be
a pointer to the object that actually
represents that class
the second parameter is going to be that
special selector string that I mentioned
earlier and think of it just like the
name of the actual method that we're
trying to invoke and then any subsequent
arguments inside of this are just going
to be Arguments for that particular
method that we've selected by this
second parameter right here
so let's move on and let's look at a
couple examples of this inside of ghidra
first we have our message send
invocation
this first parameter remember is going
to be the object that we're trying to
call this on
then this second parameter is going to
be the name of the method that we're
trying to invoke in this case the name
is the selector called set hidden and
then we have this colon the special
thing to note about the colons for
method selectors is that however many
colons there are in the selector is how
Method Selector Colons
many arguments that this method is
expecting now in this case we have one
colon so that means that this set hidden
method is actually expecting one
parameter and we can see that one passed
right here so now we have successfully
chosen what object we're trying to
invoke this method on the method name
that we're trying to get and then the
arguments that this particular method is
receiving so basically if you are
reading a c Style version of this it
would just be set hidden open
parenthesis one close close parentheses
but Objective C is actually going to
make it look something like this but now
you know that this is just a regular
method in vacation
now let's talk a little bit more about
what this uvar1 actually is remember
this is the instance of the class that
we're trying to call the set hidden
method on and you can see I can press
the middle key or the middle Mouse
scroll bar for highlighting all
different references inside of ghidra
this is going to be our object and we
can see that it's getting set one line
above now this Objective C retain Auto
release return value is another special
call what this is doing is basically
when you have a new object the runtime
might try to release that object and
then we don't actually have it anymore
so it's just a special call saying don't
release that memory and we'll store the
return value of the previous function
inside of to inside of this variable so
that means the return value of this
function is actually going to be stored
inside of this U var1 by this Auto
release return value basically just main
thing to know is this is going to store
the return value inside of this variable
now we know that the return value of
this method is going to be stored in
here so let's see what this white BG
view actually is what this is doing is
it's just taking this Ivar 1 and it's
going to be returning it and if we want
to know what this ID type is this should
be another runtime type let me just
ID Types
Google this real quick
we'll do
objective
C Apple
developer
then we'll do ID class so we have to be
kind of specific because this ID is kind
of a generic term so we want to make
sure we're looking for the particular
Apple developer documentation on this
and this is Again part of our objective
scene runtime this is just saying we're
returning a pointer to an instance of a
class so pretty simple we are looking at
this we have this white BG view class
that we're going to be returning an
instance of so that's going to get
returned from this method call
and we can go back
then this is going to store the white BG
view object inside of this uvar one
so let's go ahead and name that I'm just
going to rename this bar
white BG View
object
and now it's actually coming together
and making a little bit of sense we have
the object that we're going to be
calling this on and then this set hidden
method is going to exist somewhere
inside of this class we don't need to
worry about it too much because now we
know exactly which method that we're
trying to invoke now one thing that's
interesting to note is you'll notice
that we invoked one method using this
Objective C message send but this other
method was actually not invoked using
message send but because we're looking
at the decompilation of this application
in ghidra you might see a lot of
different conventions for invoking
methods basically ghidra is trying to be
Method Invocation Madness
nice and it's trying to prodify some of
the code for you so it looks like a c
style type invocation but actually in
reality this is also going to be invoked
with message send but we don't need to
worry about it too much basically just
know that there are multiple ways that
you can actually see function calls when
you're trying to reverse this inside of
ghidra
except they're all pretty much meaning
the same thing
let's move on and just look at a couple
more examples here to get the hang of
this
we have
blur effect view function call looks the
same style as this white BG View and
I'll double check this again it's
returning an ID type for this blur
effect View
so I'm gonna go back
we're again getting the return value of
this blur effect view method storing it
in Ivar one so I'm going to hit L to
name this variable I'll name this bar
blur effect
view object
so now we have our object
_objc_release() calls
and you can pretty much ignore these
objective-c release calls basically
they're just releasing the memory that
we did not let release previously
remember this so pretty much these you
can ignore
let's move on a little bit and just do
maybe one more function call
so we're checking to see if our object
is zero maybe null
and then we are calling one more method
remember you can't expect any
consistency in the actual method Styles
but you should pretty much get the hang
of all of the different method and
vacation styles that you'll see which is
returning another pointer to a blur
effect style object
let's go back
it's going to be storing this and kind
of reusing this variable maybe I'll name
this something more consistent like VAR
temp object
because we had already released it up
here but we're reusing that one and then
we've got another actual method
invocation and this is invoking the UI
blur effect class now this should just
UIBlurEffect Class
be a regular Objective C class this is
not an Objective C runtime value if we
want to see we can say let's take this
let's just look at our developer docs
one more time I'm going to do this and
then I'll do looks like I've already got
it up Apple developer documentation
so this is just a regular Objective C
class for your Apple development but you
can see if you wanted to check out what
kind of object this is returning
hopefully I'm focusing on calling
conventions so let's just move on looks
like inside of that actual class we're
calling this effect with style method we
have one colon and then that means we're
expecting one argument which is going to
be this temp object then we're going to
be returning the return value of this
effect with style method and storing
this once again inside of our temp
object so we could continue on down
through this but hopefully you're
getting the kind of idea of how to
follow along and see what methods that
this application is actually invoking
inside of our particular function of
interest and we can go through and
finish
some of the calls inside of here here's
another call for this UV R2 object and
it's invoking the send sub U to back
method inside of there now what I want
to do lastly is I just want to look at
Source code of Method
the actual source code of this method so
I picked this one on purpose because
this is an actual Library that's
available on GitHub for Apple developers
to be able to use so what I want to do
is I want to take the original source
code and kind of compare and contrast it
to what it looks like in ghidra since I
think that's one of the best ways if
you're trying to learn a new convention
for a particular language so I'm going
to open up my reference this is going to
be remember that LC action sheet class
which was defined here then we have our
blur bottom BG view which was our method
name
so we can find that right here
and one interesting thing to note is
Developer Method Names Trick!
that because of the way Objective C
actually performs this message passing
the original developer method names are
going to be inside of your iOS
application so this is kind of nice
because you can actually see what
different naming conventions they were
using and they might kind of give an
idea about what the method is doing if
they're not obfuscated or anything and
if you have the source code it's really
easy to find the actual original
implementation of it which is what we're
doing right here so let me make sure
you're able to see this let me just move
that and scroll in so this is what the
actual source code looks like in
objective scene our dot m file there was
our method name and if we look at it
inside of ghidra you can see we have an
additional parameter what often happens
is this first parameter inside of our
method is just going to be a pointer to
self or the current instance of the
class so I can just do L and name this
ARG self so that's kind of clearer so
that if we're calling a method maybe
we're passing a reference to the current
object to other ones let's go back to
our source code and let's just kind of
take a quick look about what was
happening first we had
ourself.whitebgview.hidden equals yes
would make sense because if we look at
our code
we're calling this white BG view method
call and then recalling this set hidden
method inside of here and passing the
value one
and we can see yes probably means true
so it's going to be a Boolean value
which corresponds to the value one and
then we're saying if not blur effect
view which we can find our if statement
over here
we can see we got our object through
this routine Auto release return value
then we're checking to see if this
equals zero so basically if this is not
actually instantiated and then if that's
true then we're going to go through and
do all of this instantiation code
so hopefully this is kind of clearing
Recap
things up and if you want I highly
recommend kind of going line by line and
seeing if you can find the corresponding
Objective C in the source code as well
as the decompiled code so thanks so much
for watching Lorry wired everyone in
this video we learned about objective-c
calling conventions for iOS reverse
engineering we saw how the output of the
decompilation looked a little funny
inside of our guidra decompiler and how
Objective C actually uses this special
convention called message passing in
order to invoke methods we also looked
how we could check the objective-c
runtime documentation if we wanted to
get an idea of what a particular runtime
method was doing and then we went
through and we fixed some of our code to
see how we could follow the actual flow
of control inside of a method so thanks
so much for watching Lori wired everyone
and I'll catch you in the next video
I will not fail again
probably

Intro
so let's run this and here we go our gcd
is
[Music]
seven Hi everyone thanks for watching
Lori wired and in this video we're going
to be translating C++ code over to
assembly to compute the gcd now the gcd
is the greatest common diviser or the
largest number that divides evenly into
two different operan now this is also
known as the ukian algorithm so at the
end of this video our friend uid is
going to display what gcd we have
successfully computed inside of assembly
so let's get right into it and let's see
what that looks like now I'm going to
open up the algorithm in C++ and
C++ Equivalent
generally what I like to do if I'm
trying to work on assembly code is
basically implement the algorithm first
in a higher level language like C or C++
that is fairly easy to translate
basically line by line over to
equivalent assembly code and this kind
of just helps me think through how I'm
trying to implement this and get the
overall goal of what this is going to
look like now this is a really nice
recursive approach so we have the gcd
function called from inside of itself
you have an iterative and a recursive
option for this but they'll both do the
same thing I personally think that the
recursive approach is a lot easier to
implement and it just looks really nice
so what we're going to do is we're going
to go line by line through this and
we're going to translate this over to
our assembly code now I already have a
repository that contains the associated
code for computing the gcd if you would
like to follow along you have a fillable
version as well as a completely finished
version but we're going to be working on
the fillable version today and simply
implement the function that's actually
doing the recursive computation of the
gcd so I'm going to pull up my Raspberry
Pi where we're going to be running this
on and let's start doing this so first
of all I have a few different files here
one is going to be a python script
that's going to demonstrate the gcd that
we're Computing I also have this shell
script which is going to trigger our gcd
executable as well as our python gcd
computation so let's take a look at our
assembly file and let's start
editing now I have my main function
already completed and this is completed
for you as well so let's go over to our
actual GCB function which is of interest
to
Base Case in ASM
us
okay let's just get rid of this default
code here and let's start filling in our
own code now I'm going to go back to my
C++ implementation and let's start
copying over a few of the different
lines so that we can kind of get an idea
of what direction this function is going
so we already know our base case so
let's copy that and put this in as a
comment so we can see where this is
going to be taking us so I'm going to do
this copy we'll
insert a new comment
and we'll just put the entire thing on
one line I think that's easier so we're
going to be returning a if B equals z
and we'll return
a and that's going to be inside of our
if
statement very nice so this is going to
be our base case let me just add that in
as a comment as
well so that looks good and that should
make a decent amount of sense inside of
C++ and this is pretty straightforward
to translate directly over to Raw
assembly code so let's input a new new
line and let's just go ahead and
translate that now the first comparison
our if statement can be translated
directly over to the CMP operator now if
we take a look at how this function is
being called we're passing over two
operan to this gcd function so if we go
over to our main function you can see
we're expecting two operands to be
passed over to this gcd function the
first is going to be of of course the
first operand that we're dividing into
then the second is the second operand
that we're dividing into to find the gcd
of both of these operand now these are
passed inside of our r0 and R1 registers
which is kind of the standard practice
if you're passing arguments to a
function inside of armv7
assembly so now we know where our two
arguments are so R r0 is going to be
equal to our a value and then R1 is
going to be equal to our B value so we
have our two operands
now let's go ahead and let's do our
comparison so let's do
CMP and we're trying to compare the
Writing Comparison
value of B currently so that's going to
be our R1 register and then what are we
trying to compare to we're trying to
compare to the immediate value Zer and
if B is equal to zero then we're simply
going to return a which already resides
inside of our R zero
register so all we need to do is Branch
over to this end gcd
now if that is indeed equal to zero all
we need to do is Branch if equal over to
our end gcd label so we'll do
end
gcd and this has successfully taken care
of the entire base case so that was
really simple to implement so now let's
move on to our recursive case let me add
a comment here we'll say
recursive
case and then let's take our recursive
Recursive Case
case code and let's just paste it in so
we can get the second half of the
algorithm and make sure that we're
following this
properly so the recursive case is going
to be return gcd of b a mod
b so let's paste that in that looks
good and let's actually start filling
that out now one interesting thing to
note is that armv7 assembly does not
have a built-in modulus operator so
that's going to be this operator right
here which is the remainder if B is
divided into a so we kind of have to do
this manually but again let's go back to
our C++ code and Implement that inside
of C++ first and then translate that
directly over to assembly so I already
have this implemented right here this is
equivalent to doing a mod b but just
taking a little bit of a roundabout way
so let's take this and then let's paste
that into our code so that we can do
this directly inside of assembly as
well so let's let's add an extra
line I'm just going to paste in my code
and let's turn this into
[Applause]
comments so this is going to
successfully
compute the modulus operator but doing a
lot of extra steps in between but
unfortunately we have to do that inside
of
assembly okay so this is
effectively add another comment in here
compute a mod b
so now let's implement this inside of
assembly and this should be kind of a
better view of exactly what we want to
do so first of all we want to do the
division of a / B and then we're going
to have to multiply multiply that
division by B itself then subtract that
product from a so we can compute the
remainder of that so let's compute this
inside of assembly let's
do s div and then we're going to store
Manual Creation of a Modulus
the result inside of let's say our R2
register we haven't had to use that
yet and then we're doing a / B so that's
going to be
r0 /
R1 and then we're trying to get the
product of that division times B itself
now B remember is our r0o register so
let's do
mole and we'll do the product maybe
inside of our R3 register which we
haven't used
yet and the current division is inside
of R2 so let's do
R2 * B which is
R1 and now the last step that nicely
computes here is going to be finding the
actual remainder so we have a simple
simple sub instruction we'll do sub and
let's just store the result inside of
R4 and then a minus the previous product
that we computed inside of our R3
register so a remember is in
R1 and then the product is inside of
R3 so that's really nice now we
successfully have the aod B result
stored inside of r r for register now
the final thing we need to do is simply
compute the recursive case which is
going to be returning gcd of b and a mod
b now remember we have our B value
inside of our R1 register and this a a
mod b is going to be inside of our R for
register so now what we need to do is we
need to call gcd which is this function
and add the new parameter values to that
Calling the function
recursive call so let's go through and
let's add
that let's add one more line now this is
going to be the recursive case we could
move our comment down here but I think
we know where we're going with this so
let's do
move our old B value which is inside of
R1 is now going to be our new a value so
it's going to be inside of r0 so let's
move R1 into
r0 and then remember our second value is
going to be a mod b which is going to be
inside of this R4 register right here so
let's move that R4 value into our second
argument so let's do move into R1 which
is our new B value
R4 and now all we need to do is actually
make our recursive call so let's do
Branch with link and then go over to gcd
now let's save our file and compile our
code all right so let's do arm
Compiling and Running Code
Linux
EAB as for assemble then we're taking in
our fillable gcd dos I'm going to
generate our object binary and call it
gcd do o now I'm going to generate my
executable so I'm going do
arm
Linux can e ABI GCC and we'll statically
link this since we're making some
different Library calls inside of this
so we're going to take in that gcd Doo
and output a new executable called
gcd looks good all right now we have our
new elf binary which we're going to run
and then let's execute this on a
Raspberry Pi so we can see if we
successfully computed the G gcd inside
of assembly now let's run our gcd
visualizer so I'm going to call our
shell script
slun and we'll pass in our two operand
let's maybe try 7 and 14 so we expect
our greatest common diviser to be the
integer 7even inside of this and this is
going to call our python script as well
as the executable that we just
generated so let's run this and here we
go our gcd is s so thanks so much for
watching Lor wired every and I'll catch
you in the next
video oh I got a boost okay okay I'm
going to take this guy out not go to the
truck oh my
gosh I'm literally doing it for 2
seconds okay I'm going to go
left oh

Notes:
Here are the notes from the video transcription on overcoming the challenge of "Tutorial Hell" in programming:

#### Advantages:

1. **Structured Learning**: Tutorials offer a guided approach to learning programming, which can be beneficial for beginners.

Tutorial Hell, because noob
you completed a programming tutorial but
still don't know how to code so you take
another tutorial and another and another
nothing seems to be getting better and
you can't figure out why you're putting
in all of this time and effort coding
these projects but feel no more
competent than you did after the first
tutorial well congratulations you're in
what's known as tutorial help but I'm
here to extend you a ladder so that you
can climb your way out of this hell hole
and become the programmer you've always
dreamt of or not it's up to you now just
imagine me reading the whole thing like
Introduction, because me
this let me actually close that door
over
there hey guys welcome to the video I'm
A programmer who's built countless
projects over the years as a hobbyist as
a WABE iOS Developer as a computer
science student as a YouTuber as a
portfolio Builder and as a professional
software engineer and currently building
a platform for developers from the
ground up now many of those projects
haven't seen the light of day but I have
found value in every single project I've
built more value in these projects than
any tutorial or online course I've ever
taken so today I've Consolidated a
handful of projects I've personally
built to share with you complete with
instructions on how to do it and the
lessons I've learned that way you can
build them and hopefully learn just as
much as I did and at the end of the
video I am going to include a couple of
honorable mention projects that I feel
like should be added to the list but I
didn't as well as a project that I
haven't built just yet but that I plan
to soon or at least would like to in
2024 the very first project I'm going to
Games, because logic
talk about has the ability to be
difficult for any level of developer
whether you're a novice or proficient
programmer that is building mini gamess
I built many of these back when I was a
computer science student around 2017 as
well as just as recently is last month I
built my first however during my very
first programming class ever in Java I
remember it like it was yesterday a
fully functional game of tic-tac-toe in
the terminal using dashes and plus signs
and pipes to draw the grid and of course
X's and O's for the X's and O's
prompting each user to Mark a square on
the grid when it's their turn I learned
a lot during this process inputs and
outputs printing variables functions NFL
statements and just by building a game
we all already know and love I found
that comforting because I didn't have to
try to learn about the thing that I was
building I got to focus solely on the
logic and printing out things in the
terminal it really simplified the
process for me and gave me a one toone
understanding of how code Works to build
this yourself you can really use
whatever programming language you want
just whip up net beans or code blocks
which are idees or integrated
development environments which I
specifically mention because that means
they have built-in build and run tools
that way you can focus solely on the
logic of what you're building instead of
trying to figure out how to build it and
how to run it you do that start looking
up a little bit here and there and start
coding that's the way to get it done
don't copy and paste whole entire code
blocks just start coding little by
Frontend Dev, because pretty
little if we want to take this minigame
project to the next level we can do that
too one route is web development I
recently built a miname website
containing five different games Word
Search decryption challenge code trivia
card match and riddle reveal this not
only reinforces everything I learned
from building the tic tac toe game came
back 8 n years ago but also adds in that
element of front-end development I used
react use cases um even more logic than
before and to add even more to this
getting the website live using GitHub
actions and hosting her who by the way
is the sponsor of this video but we'll
get to them a little bit later just know
in the meantime they have an outstanding
Black Friday web hosting deal of 85% off
it's the best deal I've ever seen them
have so if you build any websites at all
now is probably the best time to buy
hosting especially especially if you use
my link in the description and then my
code Forest at checkout for an extra 10%
off but again more on them later take a
look at this it's a onetoone difference
in my implementation of Caesar Cipher
decryption Challenge on the left you'll
see the terminal application that I
built with Java and on the right you'll
see the web version built with
JavaScript and react and CSS and HTML of
course same project different languages
different desired outcomes to build the
website version of mini games all you
have to do is whip up something like a
vit project using mpm Create V app just
do that in VSS code start the server and
start coding you're able to build out
the logic in front end design from there
because you have a working application
or we'll call it a website already and
you can see every little change that you
make now slightly moving on from
Real AI, because awesome
minigame project while still keeping it
in mind because a minigame project or
just any sort of video game from back in
the day like Tetris or something can
also be an Avenue to learn artificial
intelligence and I mean the Deep stuff
algorithms not the hype in school I
built Connect 4 and then I implemented
an alphabeing pruning algorithm which is
an optimization technique for the minia
max algorithm I also built a sodoku
solver utilizing a naive backtracking
algorithm that simply searches for empty
cells and tries a number checking each
time if the number will lead to a
solution and if not backtracks and tries
the next number but that wasn't good
enough so I also implemented a smart
backtracking algorithm with minimum
remaining values or mrv a more optimized
backtracking algorithm using the mrv
puristic which involves selecting the
cell with the fewest legal values to try
next reducing the number of branches in
the search tree making this algorithm
more efficient and I built a soab bond
solver with a Litany of algorithms to
use like BFS DFS a couple Renditions of
AAR with different humanistics a couple
of greedy best first searches and
uniform cost search this was my first
forray into artificial intelligence back
in 2017 17 so needless to say I learned
a whole lot more than I can simply put
into words and keep the scope of this
video here now for you to build
something like this take the game you
already built like sodoku and start with
a simple AI technique like a naive
backtracking algorithm figure out how to
write that and tie it in with your code
which is all very simple get it working
and then experiment with other
algorithms or enhance the existing
algorithm to include mrv heris or what
have you that's it and by the way I'm
giving you loose instructions for a
reason because this is similar to what I
was given when I built these projects
and in doing so I had to figure all of
this out myself there's only so much you
can learn from following a tutorial
online word for word cod line for COD
line you can see kind of the overall
idea of how a project is built but you
don't really learn code or the logic so
when you have to figure out these things
yourself utilizing the loose
instructions that's where you're really
5 Different Portfolios, because depends
going to learn the next project can take
shape in many ways it can be GitHub
repositories enhanced with a GitHub read
me or a custom website laying out what
we've built how we built it and why or
even a full-fledged interactive website
that thoroughly showcases your skills
not just on the website but with the
website that's right the most boring
project on the list but probably the
most important if you're looking for a
job or just want to showcase your skills
portfolio what just about everyone
starts out with is a GitHub profile what
you see is what you get code and a repo
but you can also enhance each individual
repo with a readme file to explain what
you built and how you built it meaning
what languages Technologies and or
algorithms did you use and then it would
be helpful if you listed out how to use
it like I did here with a list of
commands or if it's a website linking to
the website in the repost description
for easy access but to enhance that even
more you can also create a profile
readme file in GitHub that enhances your
homepage to really make that GitHub
profile complete and if you've been
looking at the screen for the past 10
seconds instead of just having me open
in an extra Tab while you work on
something else maybe you're coding a
project or something you would have seen
that I build all these things myself you
know why though because a lead developer
once came and spoke to my program in
class back in school and a student asked
probably a question we were all thinking
how much does a GitHub profile matter
when applying to jobs the speaker's
response simply it matters but what if
I'm not really that proud of my projects
the student asked and the speaker said
something is better than nothing A
GitHub profile with simple projects is
better than no GitHub profile at all
I'll personally never forget those words
even though I'm not actively looking for
a job because at that time I wasn't
really proud of my projects either they
were just silly little basic projects
that I knew had no bearing on what you
actually built in the field but after
after he said that the tech lead who by
the way hires more Developers for his
Dev team so in other words he knows what
he's talking about I uploaded all of
those silly little simple projects to my
GitHub and have tried my best to
maintain my GitHub profile ever since he
did specify however that it's not just
specific to GitHub of course it's just
we want to see what you can do in
whatever way you choose to Showcase your
work like a website there are two ways
to approach a portfolio website though
if you're a webdev don't just use the
website to Showcase your skills on it
but build something that showcases your
skills with it a website that if I'm
looking for a frontend developer and I
click on your website I don't even need
to take a look at any of your other
projects because I'm just in awe over
the amazing portfolio website that
you've built I always wanted a website
like this myself and maybe one day I
will but as a programmer you you kind of
realize that guess what not everyone's a
web def I mean for example take a look
at some of these websites these are some
of the most prominent figures in
computer science and not exactly
breathtaking these websites look like
something straight out of the 90s before
CSS was invented but their websites
aren't indicative of their skills nor
should they be these individuals work on
computer science theory and algorithms
and in that space not web design or web
development so no a portfolio website
doesn't need to be this beautiful thing
that's not a necessity all it has to do
is show case your work in your field
that's what I did when I built my
minimal developer portfolio last year
wait crap I kind of forgot I built this
thing how do I use this thing help this
is my fun little portfolio project that
yep still curating most projects are
offline on get hope or
confidential That was supposed to be a
portfolio but I never added the projects
so yeah kind of forgot about that one
that's not what I meant to pull up this
is what I meant to pull up just a little
minimal developer portfolio with light
and dark mode showcasing a couple
projects here linking to them like as
you can see here with what I built and
how I built it as in languages and
Technologies as you can see here a bit
more information about myself and well
now that I look at it I'm not actually
that happy with it not that it's a bad
website but as you can see from this
video I have a whole hell of a lot more
projects than just these three
I don't think these three that I have
listed on the website are indicative of
my skills oh yeah that's right I built
this partly for the tutorial last year
with new devs in mind who may only have
two or three projects to their name
that's what I did well yeah if you want
to build a minimal developer portfolio
I've made two videos on this a showcase
as well as as a tutorial video so uh I
guess check those out those are the
instructions right there for you yeah um
I'll link those two videos in the
description and if you build a website
Hostinger and AI Builder, because sponsor
like that you'll need to host the
website that's where hostinger comes in
and honestly it's just really good
hosting for a really good price and I'm
not just saying that I've been using
them for years with no issues and right
now they have their best Black Friday
deal of all time up to 85% off hosting
plus their website builder which we'll
talk about in a second a free domain
free website migration 24/7 customer
support and 2 months free plus remember
and extra 10% off when you use my code
forest and the link in the description
which by the way is hosting your /ar
night and it's really easy to get
started just click on the link of the
description hostinger.com sfar night
claim deal choose your plan we'll choose
premium here pick the amount of time you
want which for me is forever so I'll go
with 48 months plus 2 months free and
then come down here and make sure you
add in my coupon code f o r s apply and
as you can see an extra 10% off they're
already pretty dang good Black Friday
deal from there everything is very
straightforward thanks to the hosting r
h panel just make sure you change your
DNS record record and you're good to go
or we can take a look at another way in
building a developer portfolio to
Showcase your skills using hostinger AI
website builder and this is how you do
it under the hosting tab in your H panel
set up your premium web hosting or
whichever you got click Start now we
want to create a new website and then we
can go with WordPress psych we're going
to go with hostinger Builder with AI and
then of course we have to claim our free
domain what do we want that to be
definitely a.com right but let's go with
devotes newsletter.
because I need this domain anyway so I
might as well get it now all right and
then you fill out your personal
information you're not going to see mine
all right here it is let AI create you a
website in minutes start creating I'm so
curious what this is going to look like
brand name website type description okay
I know I picked the devotes URL but this
is for me so this is for the portfolio
so we're going to say brand name is
farest night I am a brand and then we're
going to create a portfolio
this is my personal software development
portfolio that showcases projects I've
built complete with an image of it what
technologies I use to build them listed
out and a description of what it does to
build it listed Out Create website all
right I'll see you in a
second so here is where it sits so home
takes you down to portfolio oh no that
takes you over to a portfolio page
interesting so home we have my name a
picture of me presumably about me
another picture just to break up the
monotony and then we have featured
projects recent projects so you can just
kind of have like a little Montage of
projects here project project project
project and then they contact me which
is something I also included in my
portfolio website come over to portfolio
page has that description right here a
few more images of your projects and
then boom weather app e-commerce website
task management you can keep adding
sections I like this obviously we would
need to fill out our own information
within here oh it also has this which I
included in my minimal uh website as
well what did I name that I have my
timeline here and it also has a timeline
education work experience freelance
projects and you can list whatever you
want out within that if you need I'm a
software developer with a passion for
creating Innovative and userfriendly
applications with expertise in various
Technologies such as Java Python and
JavaScript I have built a diverse range
projects that showcase my skills and
experience this is actually pretty cool
I like that and over here we can add
element adjust pages and navigation
website Styles start writing a Blog so
you can add a CMS aspect into this and
then you can also integrate an online
store wow I actually didn't know I could
do that that's pretty insane huh logo
maker AI Rider AI heat map analytics SEO
form submission information Integrations
what is this Google Analytics WhatsApp
Google AdSense dude what this is sick
and then languages of course nice I'm
not going to lie that's actually really
cool I wasn't I wasn't sure how I was
going to feel about it I was just going
to Showcase it but I will be honest with
you I do I like it it's a good starting
point for you to be able to build out
from there put in your information
definitely worth checking out it's
included in your hosting or web hosting
package whatever you choose premium
business whatever the heck the third one
is check it out hostinger.com
forestnight Link in description use code
Forest at checkout for an extra 10% off
AI Robots, because why not
these next projects are effectively one
of the same but both equally as fun my
AI robots last year I built an AI Nerf
gun that shoots me in the face when I
get distracted and this year in 2023 I
built an AI coffee gun that feeds me
coffee at regular intervals to maximize
efficiency both projects utilize
artificial intelligence and robots which
is a term I'm using in set of internet
of things because I don't know Internet
of Things is just a really weird term to
me you two or just me all right sick I
learned about Electronics arduinos
tensor flow object detection
segmentation real-time face tracking
proper GPU utilization Jupiter notebook
and so much more and despite the late
nights of frustrating errors and just
things that shouldn't have been
happening in the first place I don't
think I've ever had as much fun coding
as I did when building these projects so
if you're looking for a fun project or
you're trying to reignite that spark
that you once had for coding this may be
the project for you all you need to do
is simple just do research buy the stuff
install a crap ton of packages and
libraries write some code or steal some
code you do whatever you want tie the
code together you're going to have to
work with some Electronics do this do
that just that's how you get started and
all of this kind of like the overall
showcase and how these project projects
were built there's two videos about them
uh maybe I'll just have a fullon link
just a bunch of links about all these
projects in the description and you'll
be able to see a little bit more of how
these projects are done remember they're
not tutorials they're showcases and the
overall just fun little video with a fun
little project but they are helpful to
give you an overall idea of how they're
built now it's time for the honorable
Tourney Sim, because favorite
mentions and that one project that I'd
like to build but I haven't yet my
favorite project of all time the one
that broke down that coding barrier for
me tournament simulation now this is an
honorable mention instead of a main
project because I've already made an
entire video about it and I don't really
want to just rehash all that information
that video is probably just as long as
this entire video where I go into full
detail on the project walk you through
everything tell you why I love that
project and how it really broke down
that coding barrier for me so that's why
it's an honorable mention go check out
that video for full detail that project
is definitely worth building the second
Chess AI Bot, because competition
honorable mention is a chess AI bot I
actually started building one of these
back in September or so August to
participate in Sebastian log's AI chess
tournament thing that you may have seen
on YouTube but if you didn't we also
mentioned it in the devotes newsletter
where he set out specific criteria and a
starting point consisting of everything
you need whereas all you need to do is
implement the AI however the deadline
for all of this was a the beginning of
October and I kind of had a baby at the
beginning of September so I was a little
bit preoccupied in the project I'd like
GPT, because forget
to build but haven't yet although I may
figure out a way to somehow integrate it
into the devotes platform is anything
utilizing open AI or chat GPT this could
be in the form of a chat GPT Plugin or
creating something for open ai's GPT
store or it could be something so simple
which is what I would do with DeVos
platform if I do which I probably will
is utilize the open aai API wait I've
definitely used the open AI API I that's
right I utilized the
gpt3 API when I built data set GPT in
that video for bright data I don't
understand how I forget these things
anyway just build some a fun project
would be to build something that you can
put on the GPT store maybe even
potentially make a little bit of money
or create a chat GPT plugin preferably
the former I just think that would be a
pretty cool project to build for now
Subscribe, because please
well it looks like it's about time to
get back to coding on the devotes
platform which by the way we're going to
be launching the MVP soon and going to
be needing some beta testers here in the
next few weeks I'm just saying you
should probably get to coding to if you
can't decide what project to build just
write them all down on a post-er note
each stick them on the wall and throw a
dart at it it doesn't matter what you
build as long as you build something or
feel free to check out those project
videos I mentioned in this video or do
none of that and just tell me to f off I
don't care I do hope you have a good day
though I'll see you in the next one

- The video successfully demonstrates the vulnerability, showing how malicious code can be executed simply by opening a Visual Studio project.

#### Summary of the Content:

- The video provides an educational walkthrough of a Visual Studio project vulnerability, showing how the `.suo` file can be exploited to run arbitrary code. It also provides steps on how to protect against this exploit.

#### Interesting Quotes or Insightful Sentences:

- "I bet you didn't know that just by opening a Visual Studio project you could be getting ratted, token logged, and basically any code can run on your PC without your knowledge."
- "Just look out for those `.suo` files when downloading a Visual Studio project."

The video serves as an educational tool to highlight a significant security risk in Visual Studio projects and offers practical advice on how to mitigate the threat. It emphasizes the importance of being vigilant and proactive in scrutinizing project files to ensure system security.

Transcription:

intro
I bet you didn't know that just by
opening a visual studio project you
could be getting ratted token locked and
basically any code can run on your PC
without your knowledge you just got
ratted by Daddy Yuri magma F the OBS n
in this video I'll be explaining how
this exploit works and how you can
protect yourself against it by the way
this video is for educational purposes
explanation
only okay so if you did a know Visual
Studio it's basically where you write
code and it compiles it for you into an
exe but now it could be getting you
hacked if you're not careful if you've
ever been looking at projects on GitHub
you'll notice that most repositories in
C++ and C are given as a visual studio
project and Everyone likes this and
thinks it's safe just because they can
see the source code cuz on GitHub you
can literally go into the source files
and look at the entire code you know
make sure there's nothing sketchy going
on so until recently I had full trust in
Visual Studio project files so how does
this attack work all Visual Studio
Projects generate a Sul file which holds
project preferences and it's loaded
whenever you open the visual studio
project project so before you debug your
program before you write any code just
as you open the project it gets loaded
immediately and a couple months ago two
guys figured out how to inject code into
the suo file so now I'm going to walk
disclaimer
you through the vulnerability and show
you how to protect yourself and just a
disclaimer I'm testing this on my own
system so you can better understand this
vulnerability and defend yourself
against it do not do anything shown in
this video on someone else without their
test
permission so I got the exploit file
right here and I have a test Visual
Studio project that we're going to test
out on so if we go into the folder open
it up so this is the ID this is visual
studio right here this is our program
hello world and some people still call
me a skid like look at this so anyway
when we close out of it in the vs folder
test and then v17 we're going to see the
suo file right here okay so let's make
the infected suo file so if we run the
exploit file suo exploit test usage so
the input this is our input right here
output and then the command whenever new
exploit comes out and everyone's testing
it out they usually just test it out
with the Cal command that's what we're
going to do and then I'm also going to
do a remote shell example and then our
input so that's this right here so our
output we'll just call it I don't know
suo and for the command yeah we'll just
do Cal for now perfect so this is our
infected file right now and we just drag
it into the folder replace the file and
boom here it is so now when we open the
visual studio
project calculator pops up o so that's
that's pretty wild we didn't have to do
anything was no Windows Defender no
nothing wait and by the way yeah
realtime protection is on everything is
on like it's it's not detecting anything
yeah so if we can open calculator we can
do many other things so something I also
flaw
noticed is that when you close out of it
right after it executed when you run it
again it's not actually going to open
calculator in our case doesn't run the
command again it only runs once and it
overwrites your suo file it's basically
corrupted at this point so I just delete
it and then generate a new one with
visual studio and you just do that by
opening your project closing out of it
it should generate another one okay so
remote shell
now time for a remote shell basically
what I'm going to do I'm going to put in
a code that gives me access to the
command prompt of whoever opens the
project in this case so we're going to
go back up and instead of the Cal
command we're going to be doing this
drag it over replace and now we're going
to start a reverse shell listener on
Port 4444 so we're going to go back to
the project run
it and we can run any command from here
once you have a shell it's basically
like GG's for the other person so for
anyone who's confused what this is in
the first place I'm accessing my own
command prompt so doesn't look as
impressive but if I used my local IP and
like another computer on my network Rand
this I would get access to that
computer's shell if you want to learn
more about reverse shells I'll throw my
video about it in the cards it seems to
help a lot of people so if you're
confused about what the hell this means
then that'll clear things up this type
lore
of attack hiding code in Visual Studio
projects using different methods was
first seen a few years ago in 2020 one
hacker created 10 fake Twitter accounts
and pretended to be a security
researcher on each one and then
retweeted new discoveries and updates in
the Cyber Niche which got them a small
following then the hacker would reach
out to legit security researchers and
offer to collaborate on vulnerability
research together then send the
researcher a visual studio project which
contained malicious code and gave the
hacker full access to the researcher
protect yo self
system to protect yourself against this
just look out for those suo files when
downloading a visual studio project to
check for them you can go into the vs
folder the next folder and then v17 and
from there you can delete the Sul file
outro
anyway that's it for today I hope you
enjoyed like sub join my Discord server
and I'll see you next time and make sure
to check out my other

Transcription:

Intro
okay so I often get asked about uh my neovim and my neovim configuration so I
figured I do a quick little walk through um let me first all my DOT files and
configuration can be found on my GitHub which will be here and we'll get a link
Disclaimer about nix + link to github
in the description but you can find my do files at DMM mroy Kickstart
ni um currently I'm managing all of my uh uh setup with NYX but I still uh use
Lua and all that for my neovim and anyone who uses neovim normally should be able to uh copy this so if you go to
Kickstart SLC config drop into the NVM or envm directory all of my setups here
uh and you can pretty much just copy paste that and dump that into your own project I've also tried to take a lot of
care and effort um to comment a lot of my uh Lua
configuration to explain what's going on I had originally started this repo in my envm configuration using uh TJ D's um
Kickstart uhmm project and then slowly expand it out from there so everything
should be pretty uh idiomatic and standard but yeah let's uh let's jump in
shall we so if we look here this is the root level directory of my config uh it's pretty straightforward and
Directory structure + lazy.nvim
barebones and basic um I use lazy. MVM as my package manager which is what this
Lazy Lock file is the entry point to my DOT files is going to be this init.lua
which really just requires my uh specific user configuration in the root
level we have these two directories after which is the typical neovim after directory um you can read the neovim
docs for what that directory is used for but like the too long didn't read is that's the last thing um the files in
the after directory is like the last stage of bootstrapping new ofm so uh things you'll find in here are going to
be um things for detecting specific syntaxes or file types um I have some
set up for reason ML and uh ok camel and then the majority of my
configuration lives within uh Lua which if you recall we import user so if we go
back and go look in Lua we have user and then this anit do Lua that's what this
outside file is requiring if we look in here uh we basically funnel everything
else up through this uh user init into the top level init and that's kind of
how my newm bootstraps itself so in here we bring in my options uh all our
plugins um which our plugins are loaded via this user. La module uh my keymaps
and then I have a bunch of Uh custom uh plugins if you will um or just like
little uh scripts that I've written in L to uh make my editor experience exactly how I want it so to start let's jump
Options
into my options that's probably going to be the most important uh as I said I try to like
I've tried to comment mostly everything in here um for what it does and what it
controls so I personally enjoy having relative line numbers so I can see for
instance like um let's have a better example right now I'm on line 13 but
maybe I want to jump 10 up so I can just say 10K and I jump up there fun describe
so that's what relative line numbers does um I set up tabs to spaces I turn
on auto indenting with these options um I turn on some smart indenting and
have a link to stack overo for why we need this uh we incremental searching I
disable uh text wrap kind of across the board I use my space bar as my leader
key um so any of my keybinds that are prefixed with leader I am pressing space
bar and then my key bar to activate those I set up how I want uh things to
be split so when I'm doing things like a vertical split or a horizontal split um
those settings control that I turn on Mouse mode so right we can come in here
can do all that I rarely ever use that but I do prefer to have it
on uh we enable some settings for uh
casing this mostly is to help um searching I actually have no idea what
up time or update times does so let's see
here uh looks like this is just for writing the swap file uh we set some autocomplete options
our undo file we update to 24-bit color we have our sign
column um which is this guy over here so it's always going to be enabled not just
when plugins decide to put something there I really hate having this off uh because if you have it off and you go
into a buffer or you're working in a buffer where let's say you make a edit to get and suddenly get wants to put
symbols in there it's going to push your buffer to the right I think that's really annoying uh we enable access integration
with the system clipboard uh we put a cursor line on which is basically this line right here
it moves with what line my cursor's on just easier for me to at a quick glance see where I'm
at uh we set up some fold settings and this is mostly to work with one of our
um plugins so I'm not sure if I can fold anything in here yeah um we'll go over folding a little bit later but these are
recommended settings for folds um from envm UFO which is the plugin I use for
managing my folds uh then scroll off is basically what keeps the buffer um I
almost just pointed at the screen like an idiot um there's always at minimum eight lines above or eight lines below
me as I'm scrolling through my files that is what this does uh the column
line is just this over here it's pretty standard nowadays to have a column width
of 80 characters um so I just keep that as the default and then right now I have this
setting here uh most of you won't need this and I'm not even sure if I need this anymore but this is to customly
configure the blinking of of my cursor um I was having some issues in t-mo and G ghosty that I need to revisit um but
for now it works reasonably well um each thing's commented on what it does and
yeah hopefully I can remove that sometime soon so the next thing uh I want to go
through is our actual plugins so if you recall if we look in our user in it we
bring our plugins in through this lazy module and we're managing all our plugins with lazy so let's go take a
look at lazy. Lua if we look at lazy. Lua this is
going to look super similar to your if you use Packer um we basically just set
up where uh lazy can put data we uh install lazy if it's not already
installed um make sure it's in vim's runtime path uh actually load the plugin
and then we set it up and we import plugins this is going to go look in a
directory of this name so to actually get all of our NE plugins we keep it in
a directory called plugins um and if you're not familiar with lazy lazy ends up looking like this you get a command
that you can run and it's going to bump up this window in your view you're going to get all the plugins you have loaded
in your system which you can see I have quite a few and then some of them haven't loaded in yet because I haven't
needed to use them that's one nice property of lazy is you can really configure it to not load plugins until
you need them hence the name lazy lazy loading um that can help with startup times if you use a lot of
plugins we can come in here and we can do things like uh we can check if any of our plugins have updates uh looks like I
do so let's read through these quick some new updates to
treeit Great some updates to dressing some updates to
luine great these all look good so if we go back up to the top we can go ahead and run update or sync so I'm just going
to run sync and that will update everything for me um one nice thing about um this is you can also profile it
to see how fast your uh editor starts up so if you press P you can see that uh
neovim in total starts up in 77 milliseconds for me
and you can kind of see when and where plugins get loaded and lazy gives you a bunch of options on how to configure
that um I could spend time getting this even lower but um I don't notice really
any problems with my startup time at the moment so that's lazy so now let's go
take a tour of my actual plugins so if you recall uh in our
Plugins + more on Lazy
current file we're looking for a plugin directory that's where lazy's looking and it is looking right here this plugin
directory so this I uh have a file for um most of my um
plugins so we have Auto Pairs and uh uh
my completion stuff so if we come in here and look we load in the typical endm
autocomplete um plugin and this plugin is going to load uh when the buffer read
post event fires or the buffer new file fire event fires excuse me we have a
handful of dependencies in this so we have things like uh integrating with our LSP getting completions from our buffer
getting file path completions getting snippet completions um some other stuff that
make our Snippets better let's see here LSP kind if I recall correctly gives me
icons in in our autocomplete so if we look here like I don't know yeah so
these icons here that's where uh LSP kind is feeding
in sete that and then um enm Auto pairs
is uh going to be a plugin that like automatically closes our brackets or
strings um so you can see like when I press these I'm getting like the equivalent closing of it so that's what
mm Auto pairs does walking through our configuration of
this stuff um I probably won't go too into the weeds with a lot of this stuff
um because it's pretty specific to me but uh here we're just setting up how um
Auto completes and um our popups work so
setting key bindings here so I can like basically go through my list of key bindings I can open it pressing control
space contrl j and k move me up and down through the list I think I can also use tab and shift tab
yep so that's what you're seeing here that functionality that we just covered is what those keybinds
does or do excuse me um if we have hover
docs for a particular function that sets this up and this configures our sources
for actual autocomplete so we get first and foremost sources from our LSP and
then we get sources from co-pilot and then uh stuff out of the local buffer
which I think I want to replaced these um
around co-pilot file path and then our Snippets this configures some of our
formatting um adds basically just um you
know the symbols generally and then ghost text is like what will give the
this is the ghost text here from our autocomplete plugin it's not actually in the buffer but if we accepted that that's what it's going to give us so
that's our autocomplete plugin and all of its dependencies moving on our color
scheme uh I use capucin macchiato no idea if I said that correctly but the
plugin for capucin actually is super nice because it lets you um
automatically apply your color theme to a bunch of really common
um so this handle is applying my theme across all of that for me and then down
here we just set our color theme and um this little bit right here um I'm not
sure if I need it anymore um neovim was doing some changes to
semantic highlights and it was uh giving me some weird visual effects so I just turned it off I need to go back and
revisit this to see if I still need it moving on our comment plugin this
just lets me do things like if I press uh GCC it's going to comment out a line
or if I have a giant selection and I do GCC going to do the same thing we can
also do blocks of comments so if I highlight all this and I do GB it'll do a block comment pretty
straightforward um we also configure um TS context comment string I believe if I
recall um this helps um integrate treesitter into our
commenting next is co-pilot um I can probably remove this first
co-pilot plugin nowadays I don't really use it anymore and I've changed to using
our co-pilot uh complete um or co-pilot
integrated with my autocomplete rather than co-pilot being it's like Standalone UI and such
um so in fact let's actually just get rid of this plugin because we don't need it
anymore save that next up is dressing dressing is a plugin which um just gives
some of the UI a little bit better of an appearance so for example like the borders around this popup window and
like down here in my autocomplete um that's what dressing does fidget is a little plugin that's
being Rewritten right right now so if I press format or save you'll see this stuff down here in the corner loading
this is what fidget does um so that's all fidget is git signs is going to be the plugin
that adds um changes to our sidebar for
if you're in a get controlled repo this is a new line so you know not super
exciting um Harpoon I use Harpoon all all the time uh Harpoon is a plugin that
like I can Harpoon this file so if I press spacebar ha this will be in here
now and I can quickly navigate it to it so to demonstrate this let's add the previous file weim so if I press
spacebar ha and then I do spacebar ho we
can see our Harpoon menu I now have two files harpooned if I were to click on uh the
first one that would jump us back in forth spacebar ho we are in here again I can go back here and now I have key
bindings for up to five Harpoon files so if I press spacebar one it's going to
take me to the first Harpoon file if I press spacebar two oops I waited too long there space
bar two it's going to jump me back forth there um I can do you can edit this menu in
here like you can just B one out save it um or you can just move them back and forth right and that will change the key
bindings and everything pretty nice plugin I use that a lot for jumping around file buffers that uh if I'm
working on a feature and maybe I have like a types definition file and a implementation file and a testing file
I'll Harpoon all of those and just be able to quickly navigate back and forth between
them after Harpoon we've got illuminate illuminate is going to be the plugin
that uh highlights um
if there's more than one symbol uh with what you're hovered over I'll highlight it so you can see I'm highlighted over
this here and highlights it down there if we jump back to a file that has two
Imports maybe here um let's see here yeah here's a great
example we have multiple require require statements when I go over require it highlights all the other ones and I
think I have if I press space bar Open Bracket I can jump jump back and forth behind all the different symbols
underneath my cursor um I'm actually looking to replace this with um a different
plugin um but I haven't yet it functionally does the same thing um but
sometimes this illuminate plugin doesn't work well in O camel files which I write a lot of um so I'm looking to
potentially replace it so that's illuminate indm blank line um that's
what's going to configure these lines over here I think or I actually can't even remember
what this does enabled show start yeah I think
that just helps with f or like line indentation and this over here these
lines then my LSP setup so we use envm LSP config uh it loads when we uh get
done reading a buffer into memory uh it has a couple available commands with it
we have some dependencies so Mason is a UI for installing LSPs so you can come
in here and update and install new uh language
servers so that's pretty convenient and nice just updating some at the
time then we have um a plug-in which is
probably already loaded in from our um autocomplete but this lets us bind our
LSP with autocomplete none LS is going to let us have LSP servers for things like eslint
prettier um formatters things of that nature neev is just going to make
writing neovim code a little bit nicer for us and then fidget again um probably
don't need it in here but it is a dependency is what uh gives us that nice little UI down
here um nothing super exciting in here just some custom
stuff so there's some messages I don't want to see from TS server um these are
some messages I just like um these are some info Diagnostics I just don't care
to see from TS server so I just have a list of the things I don't want to see and then I inter accept uh TS serers
stuff and I filter those out it's all we're doing there this is a list of all the servers we want installed
automatically for us um with some configuration on them this is going to be super specific to uh
your individual like workflow and what languages you work with so here we integrate here's the code where we
actually like bind our uh LSP to um the LS or autocomplete
stuff let's see here I have this function uh where we integrate our LSP
with some keybinds which this function comes from our actual keybinds file which we'll go over in a little
bit uh we set up a command for just running
formatting um and if you're a typescript Dev specifically um I have this set up
in such a way that um if you're using both TS server and prettier it's going
to default to using prettier to format your code rather than TS server that way
you don't get like a format from prettier and then also a second format from TS
server and then we just Loop through our servers in that block above register them all um here's where we set up NLS
which NLS is what gives us LSP like capabilities for things like prettier and eslint um we set up some styling we say
we want Prett PR style Lua okel format we set up um diagnostics for
eslint um we set up code actions for is lint pretty straightforward um some
styling stuff and that's the extent of my LSP stuff it's probably the most complicated piece I
have next is Lu line so your uh Lu line is going to be this bar of information
down at the bottom I
have um did I write this oh right I wrote a custom uh
Harpoon integration with um lu line so you can see down here that has this little
Harpoon a Das SL2 so this is telling me that I have two harpooned files in this
project and the current file I'm in is not one of them if I were to add this to
my Harpoon you see that just incremented I pressed spacebar ha to add this buffer
to my Harpoon list which you'll see it's there now and down here you can see that we're in our third file so that tells me
if I want to get back to this file I can press space bar three we go here space bar one space bar sorry space bar two
space bar one and to go back space bar three so that's how that little Harpoon
integration Works um I had this for work
previously um it will also show your G Branch down here you can see we're in main this basically just like intercepts
uh that data and uh we had a naming convention at work to name our branches
like this so I basically just parsed out the ticket number and then made it a
custom Branch name so it didn't take up a ton of room this is how you write a custom
component for line like I said this is like all the harpoon integration is we
brought in the marks API from Harpoon we got the total number of marks if there's
no marks we just return an empty string uh we set the current Mark to a dash and
then we go ahead and check if the current buffer is one of the marks and if so we just spit out this string right
here which you'll see like this is literally that right
there and then we follow the standard lure line setup and add all the pieces
we care about in my case I care about my G Branch my Harpoon uh the diff
Diagnostics um our file name and our file type which is going to be over
here markdown preview this is super cool I just learned about this I think from
Rond recently um I have a command in my editor that um loads when I go to a
markdown file so if we just quickly make a markdown down file in here markdown MD
we save that we go in here let's just say hello world we save and I've run markdown
preview this is going to open a tab and it's going to have that in there and it actually scrolls with you does live
updating check this out like and we can
just you can see it stays in sync with your editor super cool very useful for
editing markdown
files delete that next is envm notify
um envm notify is going to give us a uh little popup over here when asynchronous
things are running so for example if I run this like this airor message right here that is the kind of UI that um MV
notified gives us and then uh um I just have some custom overrides and
things of that nature in here some custom styling uh nothing super
exciting next is MM t-mo Navigator so I also use t-mo and this lets me uh
essentially um switch between neovin paines and t-mo paines so
if I were to open a new t-mo pane to the right so t-mo open to the right so over
here we're outside of neovim but I can press contrl H and contrl L to jump back
and forth between these same with contrl um J and K if we had buffers or pains
above and below and one of the other nice things
is um that is not what I meant to do but sure
we can close this back over here let's close this window on the left cool so that just gives us integration between
t-mo and newm uh next up is oil oil is what I use
for uh browsing my uh file directory I don't use a file tree you might have
seen me already pop open this view this is oil this is how I navigate around my
projects and explore them it lets you treat uh your file tree as an actual
like text buffer so so you've already seen me create a markdown file like I can say file. txt save that yep want to
create it boom I can delete it um I could go paste it in here you know this
is what oil is you can also configure it to open in a buffer so if we do a new
split over here and then run oil we get a buffer that doesn't go away rather than the floating
one and then these are just my key maps um for oil
I highly highly highly recommend oil over a file
tree uh we also have Spectre so Spectre is going to be a global find and replace
plugin um so I can launch into Spectre like this it gives us a UI over here this will GP across your whole project
so let's say we want to search for dependencies right and let's say we
wanted to change this to uh depths across the entire project uh we could do
that I'm obviously not going to do that but this shows us all our changes where it would change um so super super useful
plugin that I use all the time next up is symbols outline
um this is going to give us exactly what it sounds like a symbol outline so if I press leader so uh gives us a actual
symbol outline on the left over here we can expand it uh step into stuff
yeah you're just typical symbol outline nothing too
exciting next up is telescope um this is probably like my most used plug-in uh if
you're not familiar with telescope which I it's like one of the foundational plugins in the ovm this is going to be
our fuzzy finder so if I do like spacebar SF it's going to let me search
for files across my entire project um filter it down I can also search uh
my open buffers I can search just a whole bunch of different things it lets you fuzzy find across in that UI just
showed um so this is how that's configured next is treeit sitter
treesitter is what's going to give us really awesome highlighting and basically parses our buffers into
abstract syntax trees and enables um other plugins to read and interact with
those uh syntax trees in fact can we I forget what the plugin is
here there's a way to inspect yeah inspect tree so here is what the current
files uh tree sitter syntax tree ends up looking like so plugins will use this tree to highlight things syntax
highlighting edit files one of the most useful plugins in the neovim ecosystem
uh next is tscm this is my own uh
plugin uh this lets you get uh asynchronous in fact you saw me run this
earlier we're not in a typescript project right now but this plugin will run asynchronous
non-blocking project wide type checking on a typescript project next up is UFO this is my uh
code folding plugin so so we can come in here and like fold this right that's basically what this
does um just sets up some custom
folding next up is vim maximizer so if I have two windows open um if I press
spacebar M it'll maximize it or minimize the other or maximize the current paint I'm in and I can press it again to uh
have them equal out so very little setup for that plugin
themm surround uh is a plugin where let's say I have um some text I can say
yank y s i w and then brackets and it'll surround it with brackets I can also do
that or I can delete surround all sorts of things like that so that's what that plugin does and
finally Wilder um Wilder is what controls uh command mode in newm so
command mode is this guy down here this is going to give me like fuzzy finding and better Auto completes and some
different uis um so that's what Wilder does and then I have some just styling
and custom setups that I found useful so that's all my plugins
um it's quite a few but it's still pretty lightweight like I said that I have a 77 second or 75 can you imagine a
77 second startup time 77 millisec startup
time so my key maps are going to be under here and again this is a file I've
Key Maps
tried to uh comment pretty heavily so maybe one useful thing to cover first is
I have these keymap utils which I actually think I'm going to rip out I copied this from primagen originally um
but I think I'm going to get rid of them when I get some free time but to go look at what my keymap utils look like um I B
basically just give myself convenient methods for U mapping different key
combinations in vim's various modes whether that's normal mode which is what we're in now insert mode when we're
typing uh command mode um things like that so that's all these
do um nothing super exciting some of them are non-recursive which means it
won't override um underlying keybinds but let's jump
in uh so we disable spacebar since we're using it as our uh leader key so we can
move in every direction contrl jrl KRL l contrl h um I can
press um leader um control up to switch between the last buff
ER which is you know here that's actually not what I would have expected
um I should probably change this but save with leader key so I press space bar W to save my buffer leader Q to quit
out of the buffer uh save and quit leader Z I almost never use this key
bind I press leader e to open uh a floating oil buffer
um I have a bunch of key maps for keeping my buffer centered when I
navigate so ZZ in neovim is a key bind to Center
your buffer around your cursor so when I'm doing vertical movements which are
all captured here on the left um I update them to automatically Center my
buffer so if I'm going up and down it's always keeping my buffer centered that's
what these do these are some of like my most
important keybinds in my op opinion um let's see here I can press
leader capital S to launch into find and
replace um I can oh that was that one if I just
do capital S it'll put me down here to uh find and replace in the current
buffer and then leader capital F uh launches me into
Spectre uh I have two key binds for jumping to the beginning and start of a line so I use capital L and Capital H to
jump between uh the start beginning of lines uh I use capital u for
undo so I can do undo there and then this is actually more like
redo so if I come in here and I delete in between these I can press
uh lowercase U to undo it and then capital u to redo it so I thought that
was a pretty uh nice convention uh if I want to turn off highlights so if I search for let's just
say no recursive remap you can look in here and if I want to hide these
highlights I press spacebar n o turns them off um if we had Diagnostics I can uh
navigate around my buffer by pressing bracket D or bracket um e bracket W let
me jump around my various Diagnostics in my buffer so D will take me to any
diagnostic e will just take me between my air Diagnostics W for my
warnings uh we can place all our Diagnostics into a quick list I don't really ever use this um I do use these
Quick Fix list ones so if I did have something in my
um if we do spacebar LD
whoops it's going to put all our Diagnostics into this quick fix list and I can navigate in my Quick Fix list from
in the buffer by pressing space bar CN CN or CP uh I can close it by spacebar
CC whoops Cc or reopen it with
so that's how I use my Quick Fix list and let's go back and fix
that uh the maximizer toggle I talked about before that's where if I have two buffer opens and I press spacebar M it's
going to maximize the current one I'm in I can press lader M again to bring them back to equal widths
um uh I can also use leader uh Arrow key to
um or leader equal excuse me that was a weird uh little ligature there so if I go in here
and I press leader space bar it'll set them to equal so those kind of do the same thing space bar F formats my
current buffer uh oh this is one of the custom ones I wrote which we'll go over in a
little bit so if I have two buffers open uh let's go to a different one actually so I have my options in this open I
normally am always editing in my left buffer if I press leader RW it rotates
them RW um is the pneumonic that I came up with you know it's short for rotate
windows so that's what that does uh leader TC runs my uh typ script
type Checker plugin that I built and obviously the the pneumonic there is uh type check or typescript compile
so my Harpoon keybinds which we've talked about already ho opens Harpoon ha
adds the current one HR removes it HC clears all of it see if we did HC whoops HC it's now
empty and then here's how I navigate between my Harpoon files again spacebar one space bar two space bar three space
bar five got through all this oh GX I did skip this one GX if my cursor is
over a link and I press GX uh it will load that link in um the browser so if we just have
like github.com DMM mroy and I do GX it'll open that so getting into actual
telescope keybinds um I can do leader question mark to uh show my most
recently opened files uh leader SB I also use quite frequently for all the
buffers right now like I've been in every buffer I've been in every file in this
project so this isn't really a good list to demonstrate but this will effectively just be a list of all the buffers I've
opened uh SF again like I said all the files in my
project uh sh lets me search the neovim help so if I press leader sh I can
search all of the help documentation across all my plugins and across all of the uh neovim and Vim super
useful SG is searching by GP across the whole project so if I press SG I can
then just search across everything in here and it'll GP uh really the entire
project for uh whatever you type in SD lets me search Diagnostics I don't
use this at all and in fact I overwrite it right afterwards with uh search git files
which we also have up above so I can get rid of that SC lets me search commands I really
don't use this because Wilder gives me autocomplete and fuzzy finding all my compl uh commands down there but if I
did SC this would also give me all my commands uh in this view
here uh let's go delete that uh leader slash is going to let me fuzzy
search in the current buffer again I don't really use this super frequently um I just end up using the normal search
down here um so it's there though uh leader SS lets
me do a spell check I uh have tons of
typos when I edit so if I do SS it's just going to pop up spelling suggestion
questions and then here's our LSP keybinds um so this is the function that
if you recall in our LSP we have map LSP keybinds in here we import this function
into our LSP keybinds uh to use and we pass in the buffer so if we
go excuse me if we go back so these are all of our LSP
keybinds so leader RN will rename the current
symbol uh so let's see if I can just do like this that just rename that and all
of that in there um yep we want to go there sorry CA is
for opening code actions so if I press leader CA there's no code actions available I don't know if I'm going to
get anything I don't particularly know Lu's code actions but that will give me
code actions in other languages uh pressing GD is my go to definition uh gr is going to be go to
references so if I do gr it's going to show me a list in telescope of all the
references of that symbol uh GI takes me to a list in telescope of
implementations um I don't think I've ever ran leader BS
uh but that would give me all the symbols in the current buffer like instead I would open up my uh symbol map
over here um project symbols again like BS I
just don't really use this at all um we map capital K to have that
hover dock there and leader k for that um control K when we're in insert
mode to get a signature help um we can go to declarations and
then TD is for type definitions uh we've already covered our symbol outline um we've covered jumping
uh in illuminate so illuminate again is what's hovering or highlighting uh the
same words um key binds for UFO uh I map JJ
so if I'm insert mode and typing if I press JJ I go out of insert mode in visual mode we
disable space again the same as normal mode um using capital L and
um capital l and H to jump to the beginning and end of lines uh this is a super useful plugin
um so when I paste we don't lose the contents of the register um I have these if I press alt
K or J I can move selected text up and down uh we've got some indentation stuff
so if I highlight a block of text and I press Arrow Arrow moves it over and back
or if we do equal it just automatically does it and then finally the last stuff to cover is kind of all of my custom
Custom Stuff
stuff this group of uh files here so we'll start with highlight
yank so in here uh if I do like yanking word if you see how it like highlights
that whole block right there that's what this plugin does so like when you yank something uh it highlights that whole
block to give you like a visual indication that you yanked something next is going to be format on
Save and here basically this just runs that format command that we saw previously in my LSP file um so when I
write it's automatically going to try to format the
file uh toggle es lint this basically just gives me a uh user command that I
can turn eslint on and off
with up next is the rotate Windows plugin again this is the plugin that uh
lets me do stuff like this I just custom wrote it to the way I
like it it's one of my favorite things about neovim is being able to easily write this kind of functionality that fits your workflow um and this was
really easy to write like I just go look at the open Windows if I have more than two I say I can't do it otherwise I just
swap them next up is resize windows so this
is an auto command uh that like um basically as I resize this this
just keeps the proportion of um the windows or the the open windows and
buffer in your neoven buffers as it it uh
resizes next is vertical help um this just is a function that makes when I
like if I search for help right and let's say I just want to go to I don't know look at LSP stuff it's going to
load it in a vertical tab rather than a horizontal Tab and that's just a
personal preference next up is uh this little
edit text thing and this just turns on word wrapping and spell checking when I'm in a text file a get commit message
or a markdown file and then toggle Diagnostics is
going to sound pretty exactly like it what it is if I uh I don't know let's make some
errors here you can see that I have diagnostic showing up in my buffer so if I run my
toggle Diagnostics command it will just hide them and turn it off and then I can come in and turn them back
one and I think that is pretty much everything I wanted to cover all yall
that's the full tour thank you very [Music]
much

Transcription:

Intro to DP
dynamic programming is a powerful design
technique that combines the correctness
of brute force and the efficiency of
greedy algorithms
there are two common use cases for it
finding an optimal solution for example
we may want to find a minimum or a
maximum answer to some question
or counting the total number of
solutions that some problem may have
these are not the only types of problems
that DP solves but they're the most
common
the method was invented by Richard
Bellman in the 1950s
dynamic programming is somewhat of a
weird name so don't look too much into
it fun fact is that Bowman invented this
name because he wanted to hide the fact
that he was doing mathematical research
the reason he was hiding this is because
the Secretary of Defense in Washington
had a pathological fear and hatred for
the word research using the term dynamic
programming made it hard for anyone to
express this approval as it was quite
generic dynamic programming appears in
many interview questions and is
generally seen as a difficult topic
however if you understand the
fundamentals and solving of problems you
will get good at solving them and who
knows maybe you'll even enjoy them
dynamic programming is about identifying
and solving all sub problems
while the general idea is simple
identifying what's a problem to solve
can sometimes be hard
good news is that the human brain is
generally good at pattern recognition so
the more problems we solve the better we
become at identifying what sub problems
to solve quickly we will look at four
problems in this video starting with the
basics
future videos will cover more dynamic
programming problems so don't forget to
subscribe to get notified
Problem: Fibonacci
let's start with a classic Fibonacci
problem
we want to write a function feeblevan
that Returns the nth Fibonacci number
the first and the second Fibonacci
numbers are one to generate the next
number we sum the previous two for
example the sixth Fibonacci number is
eight we calculate it as the sum of the
previous two numbers which in this case
are 3 and 5. let's write a naive
recursive solution to solve this problem
the base cases for the recursion are 1
and 2. otherwise we return the sum of
the two previous Fibonacci numbers
this is a very simple solution but it
has a problem let's print the seventh
Fibonacci number
we get 13.
but what happens if we try to print the
50th Fibonacci number
it's very slow
let's see why by visualizing how this
function is executed
to calculate fiber 5
we need to compute Vivo 4 and then to
calculate Vivo 4 we need to compute Vivo
3.
and to compute Vivo 3 we need to compute
fibof2
finally we know that fibub2 is the base
case so we return 1.
we continue calculating V of 3 which
requires no fee of one that's also one
and we finally can say that V of 3 is 2.
we go back to calculating fibo4 now we
need field of 2 again
so this is one
and the sum is three so Vivo 4 is 3 now
now we go back to calculating Viva 5 and
we need the second part of the equation
which is Vivo 3 and to calculate 3.3 we
go through the same process again so we
need fibof2 and fibof1 now we can sum
these and get two and finally we can
calculate Vivo 5 which gives us the
result five as you can see this was a
very long process and a lot of
iterations just to get to the result for
feedback 5. can you tell me what the
time complexity of this function is
we can assume that the number is 15 a
word which means additions are fast
let's say the running time is T of n
which is T of n minus 1 plus T of n
minus 2 plus o of 1. constant is for
additions and other simple operations
that we run in this function
the time complexity is the same as the
nth Fibonacci number which is the golden
ratio to the nth power meaning it's very
slow
another way to look into this is to see
that t of n is at least 2 times T of n
minus 2 because the bigger the N is the
more work we need to do this means that
the time complexity doubles for each
recursive call and we are subtracting 2
until we get to the base case
we can subtract this half n times so the
complexity of this function is at least
of 2 to the power of n over 2.
notice that we are doing the same
computations multiple times for example
we have already computed fibo3 but we
are repeating the computation later we
should only do it once there is a
general approach to improve algorithms
Memoization
like this one and this approach is
called memorization which means remember
in Latin let's go back to our
implementation
the idea is to remember the computation
of each Fibonacci number and compute it
at most once
we can do this by storing the Computing
value in the dictionary let's call it
memo memo is initially empty
next time we want to return the nth
Fibonacci number
we first check if it's in the dictionary
and if so we don't need to run the whole
computation the computation is replaced
by a single Dictionary lookup notice
that the memoized solution is almost
identical to the naive solution
this means that you can convert the
naive approach to memorize the approach
for any recursive algorithm in general
let's see how this algorithm runs with
memorization if we run fibo50 now we get
the result very quickly
so can you tell me what is the running
time complexity of the memoized solution
well notice that the recursion is rare
in this case
the function we'll call the recursion
only the first time for each value n
next time it will retrieve the value
from the dictionary which is fast this
means that the number of non-memois
calls is n each non-memois call ignoring
the recursion part takes all one to
compute
this is why the total running time
complexity is linear and this is the
fundamental idea of dynamic programming
remember the solutions and try to reuse
them to solve bigger problems
this is why the biggest challenge when
designing a dynamic programming solution
is to figure out what are the sub
problems that can help you solve the
actual problem
so to summarize
Bottom-Up Approach
in this implementation we started from
the final problem and recursively
computed the sub problems when needed
another way to look at dynamic
programming problems is to start from
the bottom up which means computed the
sub problems first
most people prefer this approach because
it doesn't have function calls which is
more efficient in practice
it also allows us to save memory in some
cases for example to compute Fibonacci
we only need to remember the last two
values so we can delete the value if we
know we won't need it anymore to save
space
notice that the solution is the same as
the memorized approach except that we
are storing the computed values in the
dictionary and iterating over sub
problems with a for Loop instead of
using recursion
when we compute the ice Fibonacci number
we are assuming that the previous two
are already computed this means that we
need to put a bit of thought into the
order in which we solve sub-problems
it's important to solve dependencies of
a subproblem first therefore we have to
Dependency order of subproblems
solve the sub problems in the
topological sort order if you imagine
each sub-problem being a node and the
edge is representing dependencies
between sub problems the dependency lag
for Fibonacci sub problems is very
simple nth number depends on the N minus
1 and N minus 2 and so on it's usually
obvious in what order we need to solve
some problems but the sub problem
dependencies must not form a cycle
because it would be impossible to start
them in the topological order
let's move on to the next problem
Problem: Minimum Coins
given a set of coin values C1 to CK
and the target amount of money m
what's the minimum number of coins that
can produce the given amount
for example let's say that we want to
give a customer
734 cents in change using euro coins
possible euro coins are 1 2 5 10 20 50
100 and 200 cents
the optimal solution is to select three
coins of 200
one coin or 100
one coin of 20 one coin of ten and two
coins of two cents
do you notice anything interesting here
well we're always choosing the largest
possible coin until we get to the Target
amount
this is called a greedia approach
because we're choosing the greediest
option every time and it turns out this
works for euro coins
however it's not immediately obvious
that this approach works and actually
doesn't work in the general case for
example imagine that the coins are worth
one four and five cents and the target
sum is 13. the greedy approach would
produce two coins of five cents and
three coins of one cent
which is five coins in total
however the optimal solution is to use
two coins worth four cents each and one
coin worth 5 cents
can we use dynamic programming to solve
this problem if so what sub problems do
we need to solve it's usually a good
idea to consider the final question
you're trying to answer to also be the
sub problem for dynamic programming
in this problem the question is what's
the minimum number of coins that can
produce the sum M if this was our sub
problem what would be a recursive
formulation to solve it
let's say that the function minimum
coins represents the minimum number of
coins required for a sum m
clearly our base case would be minimum
coins of zero equals zero because no
coins are required to form an empty sum
now let's try to solve a general sub
problem minimum coins of M assuming that
m is greater than zero remember when I
said that dynamic programming is a bit
like a Brute Force if we were to
implement a Brute Force solution how
would we do it
if we want to get to the sum 13 we can
do that by choosing any of the coins if
we chose coin 5 then we have one coin
and we're left with solving the same
problem for some 8. similarly if we
choose 0.4 we have to solve the same
problem for some nine and if we choose
coin one then we have to solve the
problem for sum 12. we will keep doing
this until we get to the initial
position which is our base case Zero
however notice that we can't go below
zero so we will only choose coins that
leads to possible States
for each node in the tree we try all the
possible coins and take the best
solution with this in mind we can Define
the recursive solution as minimum coins
of M is zero if m is zero or we take the
best solution after choosing all
possible coins c for M greater than zero
let's try to implement this using the
naive recursive approach first
let's write a function minimum coins
the base case requires no coins while in
other cases we wanted a minimum across
all sub problems plus an extra coin to
get to m
negative subproblems don't exist so we
ignore those
we're using the mean ignore none helper
function to ignore non-values because
some sub problems may not have a
solution
let's run this function for some 13 and
coins 1 4 and 5.
we get the result 3 because we can form
13 as 4 plus 4 plus 5.
what happens if we run it for the sum of
say 150
similar to the recursive Fibonacci this
is very slow
luckily we know about memorization so we
can use this trick to speed up our
solution
let's store the computation in the memo
dictionary and return it if it's already
computed
this solution is much faster and Returns
the value 30 immediately
the reason this function is efficient is
because the answer for each sub problem
is calculated recursively only once
after it was computed once it can be
efficiently retrieved the next time the
function is called for the same
parameter
the time complexities of M times K where
K is the number of coins and M is the
target sum
this is because we iterate or each coin
to find the best solution for its sub
problem
now let's provide a bottom-up solution
using a loop to calculate the solution
for all the sums up to m
first we store the solution for the base
case which is zero
then iterate over each subproblem and
each coin type
ignore the negative sub problems and
keep the best solution
notice that we are calling the function
get on the dictionary which returns none
instead of raising an error when the key
is missing
both memorization and the bottom-up
approach are good Solutions
the bottom-up approach has a lower
constant factor and it's slightly
shorter which is why I personally prefer
it
from now on I will only use the
bottom-up approach in the final
Solutions
nevertheless it is often easier to think
about dynamic programming problems in
terms of recursive functions so the
thinking process will remain the same
now let's see a variant of this problem
Problem: Coins - How Many Ways
instead of finding the minimum number of
coins to form a sum m
let's find in how many ways can we form
the given sum m
for example given coins 1 4 and 5 in how
many ways can we form a sum of five
there are four ways in which we can do
that using all ones using one and four
and vice versa and a single coin five
let's try to construct a recursive
solution
choosing a coin 5 takes us to zero zero
is the starting point so it's a good
candidate for the base case
the question is what is the answer for
the base case
in how many ways can we construct zero
well our only option is to choose no
coins so that's one way in which we can
form the zero this path represents the
choice of a single coin with value 5.
another option is to choose going 4
which takes us to the sub problem 1. in
how many ways can we construct one
to find the answer we solve the sub
problem for one
we repeat this process for every coin
in the final solution we want to know in
how many ways we were able to reach zero
we can take the sum of solutions across
all sub problems to get a final answer
let's go and implement the bottom-up
solution
note that this is going to be very
similar to the previous problem the only
differences are the base case and taking
the sum instead of the minimum
let's run this Solution on the example
we saw earlier
before finishing this video let's look
at One More Counting problem
Problem: Maze
imagine an N by m grid
a rabbit is in the top left corner and
wants to go to the bottom right corner
it can only go down or write
how many ways can it reach the bottom
right corner
for example
for a 2x3 grid there are three ways in
which the rabbit can get to the bottom
right corner
right right down write it down right and
the down right right
again let's start in the exact same way
as before by defining a sub problem
our goal is to find in how many ways the
rabbit can get to the bottom right
corner given the grid n by m
so let's use that for the sub problem
it's helpful to visualize the problem
so let's look at a bigger 6x9 grid
if the rabbit moves down then we are
reducing the problem to a five by nine
grid because it can go back
similarly
if the rabbit moves right
then we are further reducing the problem
to a five by eight grid
since the rabbit can only move down or
right we are always reducing the problem
to a smaller grid
notice that when the rabbit gets to the
last row or column
it can only keep moving in One Direction
until it reaches the bottom right corner
once the rabbit gets to the bottom right
corner it has no more moves left it's
often useful to think about Corner cases
like this one when trying to construct a
base case in this case we can say that
the rabbit has only one way to get to
the bottom right corner for a grid of
size one by one which is by not moving
at all
okay so let's go back and try to
construct a recursive solution
if we want to solve the problem for a
four by six grade in how many ways can
we do that
since the rabbit can move down or to the
right we need to take into account both
options
if the rabbit moves down then the number
of solution is the same as for the grid
three by six
and if it moves to the right then the
number of solutions is the same as for
the grid 4x5
since it can go in either direction we
can take the sum of both sub problems
also notice that our formula doesn't
quite work when one of the coordinates
is one because it requires the solution
for the grid of size 0 which we haven't
defined one way we can solve this is by
expanding on our base case
for example we can say that the grid
with at least one dimension of one is
the base case because we already know
that there is only one way to get to the
bottom right corner once the rabbit gets
to the last row or column
let's try to convert this into code we
want to populate the memo dictionary
such that memov and M gives us the
solution
let's initialize the base cases first by
iterating over all grades with at least
one dimension of one we can do this with
two for loops
after initializing the base cases let's
populate the memo dictionary for all
sizes using our recursive formula we
start from the size 2x2 because the
grids including size of 1 are base cases
finally we return the solution for n by
m how many paths do you think exist for
an 18 by 6 grid
what about 75 by 19.
okay so we have solved a couple of basic
dynamic programming problems at this
point
in the future videos we will tackle more
complex ones
I'd like to finish this video with a

Link: [# Why You Shouldn't Nest Your Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFRhGnuXG-4)

Notes:
Based on the video transcription, here are the categorized notes:

#### Advantages:

1. **Readability**: Limiting nesting improves code readability, making it easier for programmers to follow and understand the code's flow.
2. **Maintainability**: By keeping functions small and focused, code maintenance becomes more manageable.
3. **Error Handling**: Inversion allows for a clear distinction between the happy path and error handling, making the code less prone to bugs.

#### Drawbacks:

1. **Refactoring Overhead**: The process of denesting might require significant refactoring, potentially leading to temporary disruptions in the codebase.
2. **Performance Considerations**: While not directly mentioned, excessive extraction could potentially lead to performance overhead due to increased function calls (though this is generally minimal in most modern compilers and interpreters).

#### Tips and Advice:

1. **Limit Nesting**: Try to limit the nesting of your code to a maximum of three levels deep.
2. **Use Extraction**: When you encounter deep nesting, consider extracting parts of the function into their own functions.
3. **Apply Inversion**: Utilize inversion to handle error cases early and return quickly, keeping the happy path code less indented and more readable.
4. **Tab Size Visual Aid**: Consider using a larger tab size visually to discourage deep nesting.

#### Lecture Content:

- The video discusses the concept of 'never nesting,' a coding style where programmers avoid excessive nesting in their code.
- Two primary methods to denest code are introduced: extraction (pulling out part of the function into its own function) and inversion (flipping conditions and switching to early return).
- The speaker demonstrates how to apply these methods to refactor a complex, heavily nested function into a more manageable and readable form.

#### Main Challenges:

- Resisting the urge to deeply nest code, which can make it difficult to follow and maintain.
- Deciding when and how to extract parts of the code into separate functions without overcomplicating the code structure.
- Applying inversion properly to ensure that the logic remains clear and correct.

#### The Importance and Usefulness of the Topic:

- The concept of avoiding deep nesting is crucial for writing clean, maintainable code, a fundamental aspect of software development.
- Understanding and applying the principles of 'never nesting' can lead to more efficient code review processes and better collaboration among team members.

#### Accomplishments:

- The speaker effectively communicates the disadvantages of deep nesting and provides clear, actionable strategies to avoid it.
- The transformation of a complex, nested function into a series of simpler, more focused functions demonstrates the practical application of the 'never nesting' principles.

#### Summary of the Content:

- The video explores the 'never nester' approach to coding, emphasizing the importance of keeping code depth minimal.
- Practical strategies like extraction and inversion are discussed, providing viewers with tools to improve their coding style.
- A real-world example is refactored using the discussed techniques, showcasing the benefits of limiting code nesting.

#### Interesting Quotes or Insightful Sentences:

- "A never nester doesn't dare to go four deep."
- "The kernel dudes are always so dramatic."
- "This is what eight characters look like with heavy nesting."
- "I believe that constraining how much you nest forces you to write better code."
- "If you need more than three levels of indentation, you're screwed anyway and should fix your program." (referencing the Linux kernel style guidelines)

The video effectively conveys the disadvantages of deep nesting in code and provides practical solutions to address this common issue. Through the concept of 'never nesting,' programmers are encouraged to write cleaner, more maintainable code, ultimately leading to more efficient and reliable software development practices.

Transcription:

I have to admit, I'm a never nester.
I know.
Shocking.
But there are more of us than you think.
Dozens. Even Linus Torvalds is one.
I mean, I haven't asked him, but I'll show you what I mean in a little bit.
You might be wondering, well, what is a never nester.
A never nester never nests their code.
Okay. Not never.
But we do have a disgust-o-meter which grows
uncontrollably as the number of tabs go up.
Nesting code is when you add more inner blocks to a function.
We‚Äôll consider each open brace to be adding one more depth to the function.
So this function is one deep because there's no inner blocks.
And if we add an if statement, we've made it two deep.
If we add a loop, we've now made this function three deep.
And this, my fellow
programmers, is the maximum a never nester can handle.
A never nester doesn't dare to go four deep.
Now the perverse among you might wonder what four deep even looks like.
And while it brings me great pain to do,
I understand that I must show you for science.
Here is four deep.
We've now taken a reasonably readable function and dramatically increased
the amount of conditions your brain must simultaneously hold.
But what can we do about it?
Well, there's two methods you can use to denest: Extraction.
This is where you pull out part of the function into its own function.
And inversion, which is simply flipping conditions
and switching to an early return.
Let's look at extraction first.
We can extract the inner part of the loop into its own function.
Now we can apply inversion.
When you put the happy path of code
within deeper and deeper blocks, it creates a lot of nesting.
Instead, we'll invert that condition and put the unhappy first.
First, we'll flip our if else, by inverting the condition.
Now, since we can return here, we know that the else block isn't
actually needed so we can flatten our else into the main level.
Now, if we hit our unhappy case
condition here, we simply get out of the way.
And then the main part of the code can do its job.
When you have a lot of conditions to check like this,
we can apply inversion over and over again
and we end up with a sort of validation gatekeeping section of the code
which sort of declares the requirements of the function.
And then we have the
crux of the real functionality here.
And you'll notice that the happy path moves
down the function and all of the error paths.
They're indented.
When reading this code, I find I can mentally discard
the condition and focus on the core code versus when it's nested.
I find myself having to hold these ideas in my head.
I'm curious if you‚Äôve experienced the same thing?
Let's look at a larger example.
All right.
Look at this beauty.
Before we go refactoring it,
let me walk you through what's happening.
The goal of this code is to download a bunch of files from the web.
It talks with this download class that we can't alter.
It's an async download.
So when we start the download, you have to call process over and over again.
And each
time it gives you one of these results.
If it returns InProgress, we'll need to keep calling process() more.
On top of that, we want to download multiple files at once in the background.
So we've created a thread that manages all of them.
The way new downloads enter the system is through this append download method,
which puts the requested URLs onto a queue.
The thread then wakes up and grabs the URLs from the queue
and then adds them to this list of current downloads.
Each download is given a state
which is either pending InProgress or Complete.
So in each cycle of the main loop, the thread walks
through each download and checks what it needs to do with it.
If it's pending we start a new download.
If it's complete,
we simply remove it from the list.
If it's InProgress, we call that process method we mentioned earlier
and figure out what's happening with the download.
If it's completed successfully, we mark it as complete
so it can get removed from the list and InProgress means
we do nothing because it's still ongoing.
But things get interesting if we hit an error,
if the connection was okay, but we got an unhappy HTTP response.
We determine whether the air is retriable
If it is, we retry up to three times,
setting the download back to Pending.
Once it's failed plenty, we ejected from our download list
and push it to a failure queue for someone else to deal with.
For connection error, we retry three times.
Then we set the special connection disabled flag and this causes us
to basically give up on every download and clear the list.
Okay, so there's a lot going on here and it's all heavily
nested in this function, which makes it hard to follow.
So let's apply extraction and inversion to flatten
the first two big candidates.
Here are the two big branches of download processing:
Pending and InProgress.
So let's extract these out.
We'll move the pending part to processPending()
and InProgress
to processInProgress().
That's a bit better.
But this in-progress function is still too deep for my liking.
The worst offender is this HTP error section.
So let's move that out as well.
Now we'll keep extracting further in our run function.
We have four major sections of our code.
Where we process incoming requests from the queue;
Where we deal with our current downloads;
where we clear out the InProgress downloads,
and where we wait for the signal that there's new downloads to look at.
So let's do it.
So now
our main function clearly outlines the steps that are happening.
You can see the high level logic I described before.
And if you were to dig into any of these functions,
there are also concise.
At the beginning of this video, I mentioned that Linus
Torvalds is a suspected never nester.
And I say this because in the Linux kernel style guidelines they state
if you need more than three levels of indentation, you're screwed anyway
and should fix your program.
The kernel dudes are always so dramatic.
They visually enforce this
by making the tab size eight characters wide.
This is what eight characters look like with heavy nesting.
Yeah.
I'll admit I'm not that committed to the cause, but I am into limiting indentation.
I believe that constraining
how much you nest forces you to write better code.
If you notice, instead of one large function that handles many things.
We now have small, concise functions that have one responsibility.
What do you think?

You'll learn techniques to immediately apply to your studies that improve your understanding and retention.


What CEOs want to learn about learning and why
what I wanted to do today in the session was very interactive my objective is to optimize whatever learning processes
that any of you have based on your needs and it's a fully transferable skill so even if you're learning different things
or learning it in a different setting at the end of the day all of that external stuff is going to come into your brain it's just going to be data in and as
soon as data comes into your brain everything homogenizes it's basically the same stuff that happens and so the
structure that I want to take is first of all identifying what type of learning scenarios and needs do you have and then
mapping that against what would you love learning to be like so for example maybe you don't say you've got a problem with
learning per se but maybe you would love if you could learn like this and then what we'll do is map out the existing
sort of process that you're using and we've got limited time so in that time I'll just focus in on what I would think
would be the highest impact thing that you could make a change in that would immediately improve your efficiency of
learning and just a little bit of the theory around it so that when you leave here you've got some first principles to
fall back on and start being the mechanic of your own brain I think a lot of the time when we're learning if
there's a problem with the learning we have an overall way of tackling it per se because it's not very clear what part
of it is producing the result there's so many things going on in the learning process all we have is this binary idea
that sometimes it kind of works well and sometimes it doesn't work as well and then we can often have these ideas like I'm just not good at this type of
thinking I'm just not good at this type of topical subject or you know I just struggle to think about that I can never
remember this type of thing but actually those assumptions are most likely just a symptom of a method that was not
correctly optimized and so the idea is not let's take you from like being absolutely terrible to being
decent it's going from being already pretty decent to absolutely weaponizing what works for you and just eliminating
every fraction of something that does not work and just removing friction so would you just underlying question here
do you think that it's about optimizing for each person each person's got a different learning style or is there an ideal path the way that I like to
explain this is with the example of a banana a banana is like I don't know like 50 genetically identical to like a
human being all human beings have a brain that is 99.9999 pretty much the
same the individual variation happens in the very very small fraction so there is individual variation that is important
and optimizing that is important as well but in the overwhelming majority of
cases the biggest high yield thing that can be improved is actually something that's fundamental that is basically the
same for all people once the fundamentals are done then we start fine-tuning and that's where it gets a little bit more complex and a lot of
that individualization the idea of people having different learning styles as not really something that is we're
not really considered that scientific anymore it's been sort of disproven for for the last few decades but there is definitely learning preferences and that
you know people tend to like learning in a certain way but those learning preferences are usually formed from prior experiences and what they feel
comfortable and competent with but research is also quite strong in saying that if you develop competencies with other learning styles so your
preferences are of a wider range yeah yeah so it basically just equips
you with more weapons so for example a common thing would be I mean how many of you listened to like an audible or something or like a lot of people really
struggle with what they do with that new information that comes in because a lot of that information they're thinking about and think oh this is very useful
and then it's like well I'm driving like I can't like do I pull over or do I like quickly like draw something else I just try to like hold on to that or sometimes
you can feel like oh I don't need to write this down like I'm going to remember this it's just you know it just clicks right and it just stays there but
sometimes you think there's a chance that by the time I finish this this drive that particular point I just don't
have it locked in at that level that I wanted to or sometimes especially how many of you read like multiple things
simultaneously it's not just like necessarily one audiobook but it's like an audiobook and maybe got a book about that topic on the side or an article
that you read that's you know related to that topic yeah it's pretty common I think so when we're doing that type of information consumption a very common
thought is oh that like reminds me of this thing that I've read in this other book and it's like it's obviously related together and there's this kind
of comparison but without the skill to take that and then fully consolidate that into your knowledge knowledge
there's a lot of kind of efficiency that's lost there so the way that I like to say it is if you imagine that
everything that you learned that you thought I should hold on to this you could just hold on to it and then what you held on to was at the level where it
is fully integrated and connected so you're able to use that information fluidly and omnidirectionally not just
like I hold on to it because I thought about it every 20 seconds for this drive that is sort of the ideal situation it's
not necessarily always possible to get to that ideal situation but you can get pretty close does that answer your question in a very long way yeah
yeah Okay cool so let's just start off with um identifying some of the learning tasks that you tend to engage in so it
Metacognition: How to become the mechanic of your own brain
can really be anything it doesn't have to be like the biggest most important one but just something that's relevant for your life what are the things that
you'd like to learn what are the things that you want to learn the learning challenges potentially if you know that there are barriers or things and just
note a few of them down what about the other way around what
how to teach better okay to apply um some of these methodologies uh to my
students okay there is a overlap this shared ground and that if you really understand how knowledge works and how
it interacts in the brain that fundamentally changes how you think you should present it I will talk about a
few principles with regards to how you communicate information that is more likely to cognitively optimize it in
someone else's brain without them doing the work so even if they are not optimized in their ability to take
information in there are ways that you could present it that force them to think about it in a certain way that would sort of hijacked their own
Pathways I'll talk about that a little bit it's a very deep topic though so I'm not going to cover it in depth but I'll definitely touch on it so the next part
would be to start mapping out what the learning process kind of looks like so we're really diving into something that
we call metacognition right now which is the thinking about thinking just like if you're sort of driving a car and the
analogy that I give is that if I'm driving along and then I'm driving and I just think like something about the engine just does not sound right like it
doesn't you know something doesn't it feels little bit off and I'm listening to it I'm thinking that's not how it should be is rattling a little bit
there's a little bit of like I'm feeling a bit more vibration at the wheel I'm going to pull over I'm going to open up the hood I'm going to look inside and
I'm going to think I actually don't know anything about cost so I'm just going to close the lid I'm going to ignore that and I'm just going to say this is just
how my car drives now and I'll take it to a mechanic but if that mechanic is hard to come by then it's just you drive
a car that rattles now and that just becomes how it is so becoming the mechanic of your own learning is something I think is very very important
when you open the hood you know what you're looking at so let's start mapping out what the learning process is and try
to be specific so we take it in terms of this information comes in
okay that's going to interact with your brain
and then as inside the brain things are going to happen and I want you to try to be specific
about what is happening in your brain so it could be things that you are observing you notice you tend to think
about certain things or it could be things that you are actively consciously trying to do when information comes in
it'll be a combination of both and then information is going to be outputted and this is the term we use for this is that
that information is going to be retrieved and we also want to think about the types of retrieval when I do
this talk and I talk to students they have a lot of what we call lower order retrieval requirements which is just
what is the definition what does the terminology mean all this sort of stuff for most of us in this room that level
of retrieval is almost completely obsolete in our lives now you either just look it up or someone else's job to
know what that means right and it's just not a good investment of time and that's not the learning that we really struggle with so when we're thinking about
retrieval what we're also looking at is the order of retrieval and specifically we're looking at higher order of
retrieval so a higher order of retrieval would mean that you're retrieving the information primarily this is the
Hallmark of higher order retrieval is that that information is almost never retrieved in isolation that information is usually paired with something else
there's a comparison there is a application there's a context so if you think about the way that you tend to use
information that you learn the question that I'll put out is do you feel that the majority of that retrieval happens
in a way that that information is never retrieved in isolation right we would agree with that there may
be the odd exception to that would be what we call mid-order so what mid-order retrieval would be is the application of
a singular isolated piece of information for a very specific circumstance so that is also what we would be considering as
isolated information retrieval so that would be for example if there's a very very specific problem that you have to
sow so you learn a very specific thing about that problem directly and then the way you retrieve it is purely within
that context so that's the odd exception to it but again it's you know fairly rare so it's like higher order is going to be more like pattern recognition this
is similar to this other thing whereas the mid order is very specific it's like no I've seen this exact thing before I
like that you bring up pattern recognition because when we say something is a pattern in order for us to recognize that something as a pattern
we need to be able to see how it sort of the structure that it creates it has to have that familiarity so pattern
recognition is kind of a different thing because you can have pattern recognition for an isolated thing you can have pattern recognition for a broader thing
what is going to determine whether it's pattern recognition or not is how familiar yeah it is to you so you can be
isolated for something that's totally new or something that's familiar and you can be Broad and multi-connected and
integrative in the thinking for something that is new or familiar pattern recognition is more of like a efficiency like time saving tendency of
the brain it just uses less energy yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly it's a heuristic it's what we often call as system one
thinking okay so let's use this and let's just try to map out what what are we doing at each of these processes and we want to be meta-cognitive about this
in terms of what are the thoughts that are going on ahead so when information is coming in what are we doing with that
information in a variety of contexts and be as specific as to when a new thought or A New Concept enters your brain for
the first time for example like right now what is the thought process that is going on immediately start from the
earliest possible moment that you have awareness of that thought so the first thing I do whenever information comes in is I do a two-part filtering process the
first one is like is this important the second one is how can I simplify this and distill it down to the only part
that I'm going to need okay good I'm going to build off of that in a second let's look at a few more ideas my first step is
a little bit before that actually maybe a lot before that is just asking myself
do I comprehend this information like is this something I fully understand I ask
myself some questions like how does this actually apply to my life or a situation
that I can refer to and then that confirms my comprehension of it that's good so that's actually the same
underlying cognitive process that's happening with just different symptoms and that's actually I'm glad that these are the first two things that we heard
because that's one of the most important things that we have to understand about learning to start really hacking it yeah so I'm going to build on that as well
also just think about after you've learned something for the first time what are you doing with that information and what's the time delay between that
activity like are you using it multiple times in a short period of time was there a long delay or does it vary it
probably varies but in what situations would it vary if you've never thought about this before then that probably just means that you
are a normal human being that lives in the society and you know that's really a societal issue that um we're here to
solve yeah so I mean as soon as I've done my filtering processes um I take notes and then I go on at the
earliest opportunity I go seek an opportunity to use the information um whether that's in a basic way that's going to be ultimately useless for me
it's for the pure purpose of making it sink here okay so you will engage in activities that are functionally useless
purely for the purpose of helping to consolidate knowledge correct okay yeah all right and you do that all of the
time uh so this is in the context of my most common way of learning which is video courses or YouTube videos or
normally learning via video or audio yep okay I think there's probably a step in between though between for example you
said you take some notes on it yeah so I'd take like I get an Evernote and I actually but if I'm doing what say I'm
doing a course that's got six modules each module I'll actually stop after that module and I'll go and try and Implement yeah so when we say take notes
I want you to imagine that I'm just like a robot you need to program me to take these notes okay so I take screenshots
of what really matters okay uh the most important thing is uh because I run my butt like yeah
what's important yeah and then how do I how if I was to simplify this and distill it down so the only part I'm going to need the it's also what parts
am I going to need to remember from there the screenshot is going to do a better job of illustrating that to me
um than written notes if I can get Bible written notes and short bullet points then I'll do that that's how I'd
normally technology right so you're aiming for that conciseness and and making sure that what you've got is like the minimal amount that serves the
purpose of understanding the important information correct yeah okay good yep because it's only quite long form the
information I'm taking in it's not still down in any way I've really got to wait for it correct correct yeah and in fact there's even research saying that the
higher the word count of your notes the lower your performance is likely to be make sense yeah yeah because it likely
means that the information was processed to a lower level yeah okay and that's probably a very similar
process with different flavors around this room most people will probably do a similar sort of process of taking notes
in a similar sort of way maybe the software is different and maybe the timing is a little bit different does anyone have a vastly different approach
to processing and potentially documenting it I'm gonna explain that but also you'll see where my problem is
right so I've come from a background where my business is about putting the director of operations into businesses
and so a lot of what we do is very process Centric and so my challenge is now I'm I'm now in uh doing sales and
marketing for my business and this is a foreign concept and someone has not come from this background right so my challenge which will relate to my
learning technique is now I'm doing podcasting now I'm doing video marketing
and trying to I will have had some scripts of bullet points and then I'm going to have to
play that back in front of the camera so the way I tend to learn that is yeah make it shorter form to put key bullet
points and then I uh do I guess a crude version of what you might have heard of
as Roman room technique but I'll associate that with images or something to really make it high level yeah but
even so that's still not many people not many people call it that that's the old name for that technique
yeah people normally call it Memory Palace or method of loci now yeah that's the common term for it yeah I have not
heard that term used in 15 years I think yeah
so my problem is just recall really it's just simple recall of something I'm gonna be saying in front of a camera and
I still use imagery to relate that sort of still link it to an application but
um can I just ask you very quickly is that when you use that kind of method do you
feel that that is a sort of a limited process like do you feel that that is quite a
like a um a cumbersome process and you're just subjectively yeah I mean it's cumbersome
and it takes effort to put it into that format for me to be able to play that back it works right if I could find a
less common method of that that works yeah okay yeah let's dive into some of
Basic theory of learning: cognitive architecture
the like some very very very just basic theory around learning because we're going to see how all of these things are
kind of similar at a first principle level why some things work and something's done and you can really take
any way that someone learns and you can just adopt it and make it work better by doing this so what we're talking about
is the idea of like cognitive architecture that's a term that we use for a cognitive architecture it basically means that it's a school of
thought that just says that your brain is structured in a way and like your memory and your thoughts and your
beliefs and self-conceptions and all these other things that make up your what you consider as your mind it's made up of like a network of ideas that are
connected to each other and some of those connections are more important and some of them are less important and some nodes have more connections and some
have less and this side there allows us to form these schemas of knowledge these
sort of models of thinking so this is what allows you to have a how to think about something rather than the what to
think about it colloquially when you're able to see how it connects together in
such a a way that it starts to make sense and when you form the schema we colloquially call that a light bulb
moment you haven't learned anything new you've learned the same thing but you're not able to see it in a way that you previously were not able to see it the
time it takes to form a good mental model in a schema is one of the biggest
delays where a lot of the time efficiency is actually lost there's a lot of learning and thinking and there's
a lot of effort and load placed on our mind in order to try to figure out what that schema is and that's that period of
learning where you're feeling kind of confused and you don't really know what's going on you know there's something going on but you haven't really quite figured it out yet and
sometimes that process is extended like months you could be learning about something and you know you're on the
brink of something but you haven't quite locked it in yet so what we want to do is we want to expedite that so how do we
expedite the formation of a mental model so there's a couple ingredients that we need here number one we need the
information that we're learning for it to be felt as being relevant and it seems like the most obvious thing when
we say something is relevant we're actually talking about something having connections with our existing cognitive
architecture that's what we assign relevance by my favorite example for this is can you tell me the third letter
of the first license plate you saw today right that data came in to your brain
the same as any other data that comes into your brain but your brain is eliminating that information from your memory at such a rate that you don't
even realize that it was even entered into your brain to begin with I can remember
yeah I'm serious because one's an Uber because you know what happened on Saturday we got into it
because it was a white Uber I think he was driving for 10 minutes and someone canceled so this time when we got the
movie today I definitely all right so that's a great yeah that's the perfect example of like the you know the same
data you know because maybe some of you saw that same Uber maybe you saw it driving right but you know you wouldn't
have picked up on that when he said our ebh 1025 or whatever it is no one was like that's the 50th license plate I saw
today oh I remember suddenly it doesn't happen that way that relevance that we're assigning something that is actually a controllable process
relevance doesn't have to be something that is inherent to the information because relevance is dictated by us
we're the ones that assign something relevant the information in itself is just raw data so once we understand how
we can create relevance forcibly for information that magical effects on your memory and ability to hold on to it
which then allows you to manipulate that information to form these models so that's kind of that first ingredient so
always remember that your brain is pretty efficient at learning as an organ
in itself it does not compare to how efficient it is at forgetting information the billions of information
that enters your brain every second you know almost all of it is completely disregarded because learning is
extremely energy consuming we want to limit that as much as possible so your brain will aggressively get rid of any
information that it does not deem as relevant you know when you're sort of learning something and you're thinking to yourself I don't really get it like
I'm not really sure how it fits I feel like the only way for me to learn this is going to be to like just repeat this
like a few times maybe it's like a speech or a script that you've written or something and you're just going over it again and you just feel that without
having that repetition you're just it's just gonna slip that is your brain saying this is not relevant right that
is the indicator of your brain saying this is not right it does not fit with my existing schema of knowledge and you what you are doing is that you're trying
to bypass that through Force Through Brute Force the analogy of you know those baby toys where you have like the
square like the cube and then you have like the square and then you put it through the thing and then that's a circle in the circle you know it's like
taking the square the cube and having like the circular hole and you're just like smashing it through that hole
repeatedly until it fits like yes eventually it will fit but it will be distorted and your hand will be bleeding
and you've got like wood splinters in your eyeballs and you know and it takes like an entire hour together then everything is destroyed that's what the
process looks like when you're trying to force something through when it doesn't feel that's relevant so step number one
is start tuning into that feeling at any point when you feel like it's not clicking because I don't really see how
it fits be aware of that sort of process and if you feel that the only way to overcome that is through something that's repetitive then use that as an
indicator to flick up to a higher level of thinking which I'm going to go over shortly how can we create relevance how
can we force something to become relevant so Tony Robbins has a process on this um I've been through all his
stuff it was something that was quite helpful one of them was basically before I go and learn something
um tell myself why I'm learning it so actually defining clearly the reason I'm doing this is because of this reason and
then I'm going into it and I'm forcing the relevance I guess yeah and now I know what he was doing yeah that's a very good sort of starting technique
that you can use to just start priming your brain to receive information it's just kind of you know prepping it we can
take that in other three levels higher yeah so that but that's a good place to start with but we can do more than that
Stakes are the other thing that do it for me steaks so yeah that does this
does this matter in my whole life on what level of my life does this matter is it about my income is it about
whatever if I've got to learn something but the thing is that not all learning that you engage with and necessarily
have the stakes associated with it and it doesn't I make myself go if I don't learn this
I put myself through that scenario and then it forces me to learn it yeah I mean uh I I think you know if it works
it's good but um I don't know if that's the best sustainable way to you know you don't want to think back on your life
and just feel like man my life was torture because I just everything I had to learn I had to you know hold myself
at gunpoint so very easy way that we can force relevance to something is to
actually start with relevance so the normal way of approaching information is like this information comes in we think
about the information and then we retrieve that information and this process in the middle all we're trying
to do here is think well why is this relevant and how is it relevant how can it fit and how can it make sense of that right so instead of doing that what
How to learn a new topic
we're going to do is start here and we're gonna go out and we're going to make that a step
number one so if you're learning something for the first time and you're learning it brand new before actually
going into actually learn about it get a big wide scope of everything that you know that you're going to learn in the
span of this so if it's a course you know get a course outline or you know make a list of all the keywords or all the terminologies or anything like that
if you're reading from let's say that you've got a new book that you've read get a book summary or flick through the
book very quickly and just look for headings bold words diagrams paragraphs that seem like it's talking about a
certain idea you can do an entire book let's say 200 Pages you can do that in 20 minutes right all you're doing is just making a list of all just the words
okay what's important here is that that list is not ordered any specific way I don't want any hierarchy I don't want
anything boldered I don't want anything indented nothing like that in fact it's even better to make this list out of
order of the order that you first did it you maybe start the book back to front start in the middle move outwards it's
important that we start with an unordered list because it breaks the
cognitive bias of tending to think about it and same way it was presented to us but the author of the book I can
guarantee you was not thinking about you when they wrote that book so by Design the way the information is presented is
never really going to be cognitively optimized for you and your knowledge schema we don't want to run into the Trap of understanding it in the way the
author thought about it because what's happening with learning and teaching is that we have this fluid you know
omnidirectional schema of knowledge and this is what we know when we think about a topic that we're very specialized in
if you think about that your area of specialization and your business you know that you have a better knowledge about that than most people that you're
going to meet about that particular topic and so that knowledge is not something that starts in any particular
order it's not linear you can start at any point and go in any other direction very fluidly but in order for you to
teach someone about that let's say you become the author of the book and you need to teach someone about this you now need to linearize and order this
information in a way that you think makes sense for the reader so if the reader takes that information and learns
it in that format their knowledge is not going to be your knowledge because your
knowledge was distilled and simplified and funneled through pen and paper or you know through the printing press
through the limitations of how that knowledge could be communicated so what the learner's job is to take that and
then re-package it in a way that most closely resembles that Omni directional fluid structure right I think we all
know this kind of intuitively well some people don't know this intuitively right and they just take it as is when we
start with learning we've got these you know maybe one book or a range of resources we're going to take that list of keywords and terminology and main
ideas and we're going to make this list and we're going to do it out of order with no indentation no boating nothing it's just a list of words plain as can
be and that's going to help us to break away from seeing it and the author's mode of thinking and then from that
you're just going to scan through this list if there is a word there that you look at and you just think I have
absolutely no idea what it means I look at it and I literally do not have any idea what it means which is uncommon
then go and look it up a little bit more read about a little bit more read a few sentences about it know spend 30 seconds to just generally get your head around
what that word means and this might take you another I don't know five ten minutes now you're going to take this list and you're going to try to create
that fluid mental model that schema that omnidirectional that kind of network of
thought purely based on what you understand about this list of words so what we're doing is we're sort of skipping the process of trying to
understand it and you know comprehending it fully and all of that sort of stuff we're just going to create a hypothesis
about I think this information will be structured in this way and that because
of the fact that we're working with with almost nothing it forces us to rely only on our prior existing knowledge step and
so we'll end up forming this model that could be you know 30 of it might need to be modified and changed because it was
inaccurate or something like that but we'll form this overarching structure about how the knowledge works and then
at that point we have a schema we have that how to think about that mental model that normally takes months to
develop we have a hypothesis about what it might look like before we've even really started learning about it so that
model that we've created that was built fundamentally off the foundation of our prior knowledge everything to do with
anything in that model is now relevant because you generated this model everything is testing a hypothesis new
information comes in oh yeah that fits in with how I thought about it previously oh it's different to how I thought about it differently but like
How to use higher-order thinking and mind mapping
how is it different why is it different oh and therefore the type of thinking that we can have about it is automatically at a higher level so
normally the process would be understand what we're learning first you know to a decent amount and then as we're going
through we're processing and building models sort of as we go but the problem with doing it that way
is that uh information just becomes too disorganized too scattered it's kind of
like a map of a city that has no highways you can get from one point to another point but the rows that you need
to take is just you know everywhere so you might start with you know saying okay here's one point I'm not really sure what it means you learn a little
bit about it and then you have this point and then you know you might say well are they connected no they're not and you learn about this point and these
three are still not connected and you've got this point and by that time you're sort of semi-forgetting this point and then you think oh this is related to
this thing and then you're going off and you know learning more things and you're creating these sorts of so this is
generally what learning ends up kind of looking like is that you form these sort of structures as you kind of go and what
you can hopefully see is that there are relationships and connections that are forming but it's very hard to see what
is actually going on right it's there's not really even much on there and already assigned to become difficulty if
someone looks at that they're not going to get a clear picture of it and so if this is the state of organization of that knowledge in your mind then that's
the extent through which you're going to be able to retrieve it going from here to here is going to be like I know that you can kind of do something there but
then there's this other part that comes in and so it's it's very disorganized right by starting with just the basics we're
saying that okay we understand that all these things are probably related in some way and I think it's probably going
to be something that looks like this and we're starting with just a very very basic skeleton of it we've got the big
picture of it the whole scope of it to begin with when you learn the first piece of information you're already thinking about the last piece of
information how it might relate when you normally learn linearly from start to finish you're not even aware about what
you need to be thinking about later on to even have the thought to potentially connect it so everything becomes kind of
retrospective whereas now when you learn that new information you're thinking okay it could fit here here or here well
I know it's going to be related to this thing but I also know it's probably going to have a relationship over here so now you're thinking I'm not going to
organize the information you know like way out over here because it has to connect with the stuff that's over here at some point somehow that already
starts framing the context and the relevance and the purpose of the information differently this is called
integrative learning and the idea is that we are trying to integrate the learning as quickly as possible we're
creating almost a mold that information can sit in as soon as it it's there rather than having each individual
component and then going through it retrospectively to try to to figure it all out and then cleaning it up and then going back to the resource and then
looking at it again and then fixing this we're saying this is probably how it's going to be I'll shift a few things around as I learn but as I'm taking more
information in I will just be building and consolidating it as a big picture to begin with so it's kind of like if
you're sculpting something out of stone you wouldn't take a stone block and then you wouldn't you wouldn't scope like a perfect nose in like a perfect eyeball
and then you know work your way through that and everything's gonna be out of proportion and it's gonna be in the wrong place you're going to get the general shape of it first and then
you're going to go in progressively further detail if you're painting a wall you're going to do that primer layer first and then you're going to go over
it again again we're working out knowledge in layers of Mastery rather than order of information
changes right so the big thing about how this system is novel is that no one else
really tells you to flip it because it's actually very counter-intuitive it's very counter-intuitive to try to achieve
essentially Mastery over a topic before you even understand what the concepts individually are but the idea is that no
matter how you learn it you're going to you know have have questions and doubts and you're going to reform that schema
you're forming anyway at some point and no matter what you're learning if it's not relevant if it does not fit
somewhere you're cognitively you're going to struggle with it so those are objective truths so therefore if we can
increase the relevance and if we can make it so that the revisions of our knowledge that we're doing are just more productive since we're doing them anyway
then we're able to achieve a level of Mastery of learning that's far beyond sorry not necessarily Beyond in terms of
the Mastery but much faster than you would normally be able to achieve right so if I was I mean I'm an audible
listener right so if I now wanted to apply something like this I might find the book summary yes right my list of
words yes research a bit around what those particular topics were yes but
then go from start to finish no no after you do that you then need to create some kind of schematic and you can put this
in you know this kind of format you could have a you know a paper where you jot it down you could I personally really encourage you know people so
normally when we think about note taking we're thinking like learning at school or like you know sitting in lectures or something but the ideal way of using
note taking is to cognitively accelerate your learning if you do note taking correctly what what it does is it
offloads unnecessary cognitive resources instead of having to hold on to all of
it you're just speeding up the process of it so you would map it out on something so I personally use an infinite canvas app on a tablet because
it allows my knowledge to grow organically in in all directions I'm not restricted by Page size which personally
I believe is the stupidest possible reason for knowledge to be restricted is because of page size
you know what if we were just born into a world that A1 is the norm you know like what everyone will be a genius
um so in this example here you would reorder the table TS okay
uh the answer will be yes but it's very important that you're trying not to see it in terms of a table of contents to
begin with because even the idea of seeing it in terms of table of contents will influence the way you're likely to
structure it so if you shuffled it if you just make a list Shuffle it yeah there's a little random shelf load and
then you try to create a schemer and try to draw out how you think that's going to link together that that would be a great starting point yes that would be a
great starting point and the important part here is that there's two things that you should try to follow number one try to do it relatively clean try to
make it relatively simple to follow like we're working big picture you don't need to have every single keyword planted on
here but you should have what you think are like you know basically all of the main and important ones because you might look at one thing and know already
that is just simply one example of this other concept it's not going to be important in itself you don't need to
have that one on your overall starting structure but the main concept that it's tied to that should be integrated somehow so try to make it as simple as
possible and then number two follow what I call the 2-4 rule which is that information should be grouped together
you do not want 100 pieces of information with just like 100 you know 700 arrows everywhere this can be
grouped together this can be grouped together this can be grouped together this can be grouped together the reason we do it out of order is because the order you group it and needs to make
sense for you which is not necessarily the way that it's presented to you in fact in my experience around 60 to 70 of all the groups you will form for
knowledge across any domain end up being different how it is initially presented to you you know you're going to look at all this information and think well how
can I group this in a way that makes sense and therefore you're going to do a lot of this back and forth thinking a lot of this kind of comparing and
contrasting and I want you to notice even at this very early stage before you've even really looked at it linearly
before you've started consuming information already you are engaging in the type of back and forth thinking that
you know you are going to need to start doing when you actually retrieve it at a high level that's how you think about stuff that you are good at knowledge
that you're confident and that's the type of thinking you do so we're engaging in that type of thinking before we even know what it is we're really
thinking about and this is a this is a big cognitive hack you know it allows you to retain information much more
easily and it allows you to build that Mastery more quickly and what do you call playback and what you call it you call that like a schema for this yeah so
there's different ways that you can call it you know some people call it models some people call it schemas there's different terminologies that I use in
the program that I run that associate more things with it it doesn't really matter what the label you associate with it is but so it really comes down to
that pre-work I've got my list I'm now trying to create an order I'm going to
say order but create some rationality structure of how it links together yes so that it's that more simple flow
through but then as you do eventually then I'm assuming you could then do take in
the book in normal format yeah well actually what you'll find is that once you do that you may not even want to
take it into the normal format because you may find that already through the just the pure process of doing this you
are already achieving a level of knowledge on the estate is seems impossible where you feel more
confident about this topic than you really should be given that you don't really know anything about it but you already sort of see how it can you know
come together and you are assigning more and more relevant to certain parts and you're starting to apply the knowledge before you even know what it is you're
applying so you may think I actually want to start here right so you could just start there if you wanted to in fact a lot of the times what I'll do is
Justin's workflow for learning
I'll have like you know two or three or three or four books that I'm looking through and I'll make this as a keyword and then I'll go through it and then
I'll just start going into where I want to start and I'll just use Google and by time I finish I don't actually even need
the book so what I do with the book is I just flick through it to see is there anything I missed and there's always something that I missed but it means that the learning is driven by me I'm in
control of every single process and I'm optimizing everything any information that comes in it's because I want it to come in it's relevant because I wanted
it to be there and it serves a purpose every time there's no thinking about how does it serve a purpose and how can I
make this relevant it's relevant because it was relevant to begin with right that makes sense yeah and why is
it called the 24 rule ah yes so um so you were creating these groups you you always want each group to have only
two things in it and a maximum of four okay so you'll have groups and then subgroups within those groups so if
you've got like one big thing and then underneath that is like 20 other Concepts break that into if you can two
subgroups and a maximum of four this is basically the type of schema that you might end up forming there's a few things I want you to notice with this is
that number one the information flows in multiple directions it doesn't do what I call water falling so this would be an
example of water falling okay let's start with a conventional model this is what water falling looks like
right you can see why it's called waterfalling what's the problem with this knowledge does not look like that not not real
expertise this is exactly what it looks like for someone that has really done well at trying to learn the way that the
textbook grouped for them because that's fully linear right so this we are avoiding this through that reordering
process and it's very hard to avoid doing this without taking a deliberate step to break that because it's a
cognitive bias that operates on autopilot before you're able to really react to it it's already been reframed a
little bit so we don't want water falling but waterfalling can look like this as well
right it doesn't have to be necessarily down the page this also is waterfalling
right and for most people this is what a mind map looks like but this is waterfall you can see it's essentially
just radially coming out but it's the same thing so what this is lacking is laterality of thinking so if you saw
information like this and then you demonstrate it expressed it like this and then now you're saying oh
I want to add laterality to the information then it's going to look like this
okay that's what I'll end up looking like and now you can't follow that there's too much going on and the reason
is because laterality which is inherent to the knowledge was added retrospectively the structure itself is
fundamentally wrong and we're trying to make it work by just adding arrows into it the problem is not that we're trying
to think about that the problem is that we're thinking about that after the fact this is what happens when you also learn linearly is that you have a structure
but the structure is not something that actually makes sense it doesn't operate the way true knowledge operates so this
is what we want to avoid so when you're looking at my thing notice that there is laterality but the laterality is not
just going everywhere all over the page you know there are no lines that cross each other there are no arrows across
each other everything is there is laterality and there's structure and then there is a flow and there's a Simplicity but it's represented cleanly
and also there is no group on there that has more than four things coming out of it at any point I call that a chunk map
because what you're forming are these chunks uh that chunk map obviously it looks like there's you know a decent
amount of information on there so this is over 500 pages of information distilled on that that's Journal
articles that's textbook chapters that's my whole Masters paper on that I made that in one study session and then I was
invited to be a lecturer for that topic before I even finished the paper so the Mastery that you're able to get through
this is it allows you to achieve the Mastery that is sort of unnatural to achieve it allows you to have a problem
or a certain field of learning that you're interested in and engage in that learning and then after a week you're
talking to people that have been studying this for years and they will be you're not going to know more than them the value you can extract from
interacting with that expertise that's going to be efficient level you're going to get more value out of that does reckoning surface level of knowledge of
the entire landscape first and then building up the Mastery in different areas because they're all interconnected
as you need yes yeah and you could do it linearly if you wanted to if you've done these first steps well if you do it
linearly that's okay as well it's not technically as Optimum as it could be compared to just going into it as you as
you want to have done it like this just naturally and and I've picked stuff up way faster yeah and the times when I've
tried to go the other way where I've tried to master the individual step before getting the whole picture like when I was learning salsa it was
terrible it was it was one picture I just couldn't learn But the teacher was trying to get me to master this first
step and no you're going to get that right before we move on yeah I would say other people who like the whole picture and did it all poorly and put it
together learn everything a lot faster yeah so the difference here is in terms of what we call lower or higher like
orders of learning versus orders of thinking so a high order of thing King
allows you to achieve both high and low levels of actual Mastery whereas a low
order of thinking only allows you to achieve a low level and so if you're focusing on things in isolation and just
learning one thing at a time it's true you need to know the basics to be able to navigate the higher levels that's unavoidable fact you cannot talk about a
concept without knowing what the concept is but the method of how you understand that concept do you use a lower order
method of thinking to achieve it or do you use a higher order method to achieve it higher order means integrated
therefore it means more relevant so you're still learning the same thing but now it has context integrated your
boosting connections to other topics to increase its level of relevance correct and the important part is that what
we're boosting is the connections that we're forming to prior knowledge we're starting with the prior knowledge because what you do is you're boosting
connections purely just connections without first starting with a schema from what you already know then the
difficulty with that is that you end up falling what I call an island which is a well-connected schema of knowledge that
is actually separate from your main body of knowledge so a symptom of that would be that you have a good understanding of
that knowledge but you will still struggle to apply that in nuanced ways or you will require cueing to be able to
engage in that type of thinking most common way that you may have experienced is if you've worked with like very intelligent new grads that have a lot of
knowledge but you really need to cue them to start thinking about it once you cue them you're like oh yeah and they can grow with it but being able to
themselves apply it is separate because their knowledge schema is not actually connected with it it kind of reminds me
of Feynman who used to do the Christmas lectures and the Nobel Prize winner yeah he was well known to be able to take a
really complex topic like you know nuclear physics and explain that to kids because you could very link it to prior
knowledge yeah so a lot of his work is you know a lot of the stuff kind of Builds on and extends some of his work
yeah because the idea here is that if you're able to do the very simplified big picture schema then that's
essentially what you need to be able to explain something to uh you know like a five-year-old because it's not just explaining to a five-year-old it's
explaining comprehensively and accurately the main important points and the main important rate relationships in such a way that it's simple to
understand right it's not just purely explaining something to a five-year-old right which you know you can do with anything just use simpler terms it's
about the comprehensiveness and the accuracy of it so this level of Mastery and building that is what we are aiming
for the difference is that we're trying to build that before we even have a good understanding of the topic itself most
people that are professionals that have some real world learning kind of experience you already will have many of
the elements of thinking that we've talked about here and a lot of the things that you found work for you will be using certain elements of this and
what we're doing is we're just creating a full system out well it's not really a full system yet but like we're creating at least a comprehensive technique out
of it and what you should feel is that sort of restrictions on your learning that you previously didn't even know
where there start being lifted things just start becoming easier to understand like everything clicks that light bulb
moment it should just be every concept is light bulb moment just constantly right to the point where it would be
unusual for you to learn something and not have that light bulb moment at an extremely early stage that should become
the norm and for most people that have this sort of learning experience if they apply this kind of thinking you'll probably be able to achieve something
like that within just the first few attempts of it the very first time you do this you'll realize that it's a lot
more complicated than I've just made it out to be because there's just so many thoughts going through your head in terms of like does it make sense to do this am I meant to do it this way like
can I group it this way but then I could group it this way as well and do I form this structure or this structure or am I meant to read into this or not and all
those micro decisions and you know that there's a much longer discussion but you just give it a go and you see how it
is and then you start optimizing and then after a few weeks it starts becoming easier and easier and after a
few months that becomes a normal way that you start thinking about things and the great thing is that because of neuroplasticity the brain's ability to
mold itself the more you think like this the more you're able to to hold on to because information is Consolidated much
more rapidly and therefore you're able to learn for more sources simultaneously you're able to handle much larger
volumes of information and you're able to ride over a lot of the external variability of learning whether you've
got a good resource or a good teacher or whatever it is a lot of those external variations will be able to ride over it
I like the fact that the extreme opposite of this is repetition like if I've got to urgently learn something I'm
inclined to go all right I've got a couple of lines and I'm going to change my shooting angle and I'm going to say something else and that's like the enemy
of this this is exactly yeah so I'm glad you've shot that down from the get-go
let me very quickly touch on the idea of when you're teaching someone else something so you know you can't just be
How to teach effectively
like okay let's start a meeting and therefore let me teach you about all of this and then go practice it for the next few weeks and then we'll come back
and then I'll teach you some stuff right so one of the things that we want to do is we want to get them engaged in this
process so usually most of the people here when you're in a meeting you actually have some Authority in terms of what the other person can actually be
doing in that meeting how they can be thinking about it so one of the ways I like to start off if I know that we're
touching on something that's reasonably complex is to get them to create a structure in terms of what they think
what we are talking about today is how they Envision it and what the purpose is you know almost put them in the position of that owner and figure out what that
big picture is I want you to map it up and get them thinking about it from their prior knowledge to build their
schema to begin with and then from there we can start asking probing questions some good questions that we can start with are what part of what you've
started there do you think is the most important one that we need to like nail in first or potentially watch relationship which process is going to
be the most important thing and the second thing when I say the word Black Swan is just put your hand up if you're familiar with this term Black Swan
great so the second question would be what are the black swans to your model right and that activates again that
higher level of thinking because remember the first principle here all of this is activating their brain and that level of thinking and learning that is
more reflective of true expertise rather than something that's lower level or more passive after they've done that process and they've refined that schema
you'll probably find that the conversation that ensues when you just go through and start talking about it they're able to bring a lot more value
to the table they're able to engage with the content more organically they're more curious about things because now they have a hypothesis they have
invested cognitive resources into building they want to know why it's wrong right and all of you are probably doing that while we were talking today
you were building your own kind of model of how it works and that informs the types of questions you tend to ask and
this increases the value of what you teach them correct massively because now
it's the it's the gift that keeps on giving you test them this that's the starting point a lot of the time what we worry about is we taught them something
and it's will they even remember what I just taught them right but what it should be is I just taught them this a
week later they're coming back and now they know know even more because there was a gap that they found you know from
their model and they realized that it wasn't filled through your explanation and it wasn't filled in their own schema so I mean personality is dependent you
have to have someone that's actually willing to look at it which you know can be hard to find but you know they will go and actually look at it a little bit
more and they'll you know they'll come back and then it becomes a lot more of a you know like a real relationship rather
than just like you know basically waterfall yeah it's like they're questioning and searching from the
get-go right and the amount of ownership that that places on them yeah that's a big thing and I don't need to explain
that yeah well you just that that's a great method because it actually makes them aware of their competency
um you know local hierarchical competency and it kind of makes them jump a level where they realize oh actually I'm sure yes yeah it brings
them into that yeah conscious and competency is a magical you know first step that's the hardest step though yeah
and actually one other thing this is the final thing that I'll mention here is that when you do engage with people in this way not only is it increasing the
sort of ownership of it but it's also familiarizing themselves with not knowing and navigating the uncertainty
of the topic so it's an incredibly important thing is that often especially if you're working with someone that's a
little bit younger and is experienced they're going to be used to having certainty in things and they're going to be wanting that certainty but sometimes
what's most important is what can you build out of the uncertainty and how long can you stay in that uncertainty to build something that makes sense to get
to certainty a lot of people are too eager to get to that certainty and so they sacrifice building that structure so it'll be like this I need certainty
here so they just build that and they lock it in and it's like oh this other thing comes in it's like oh but it doesn't it doesn't fit doesn't make
sense they don't know how to navigate that starting in this method starts with uncertainty because there's no expectation they're going to get it
right no one in their right mind would say hey build this mental model and then if it's wrong it's like you suck you know you well as long as you don't say
that you know so it creates not only sort of the mutual understanding that
that uncertainty is okay the familiarity for them to navigate that uncertainty by themselves so even when you're not there
and if they take on a higher level responsibility they have all the groundwork they know how to think about it or they are lacking now is the cue
yeah okay thank you everyone for taking the time to come in yeah

Transcription:

all right I'm live welcome this is day number 31 of building my business till 10K month here's what we have so
far yeah let me no not this one where's
my all right so what we have so far we have so far this website right get
certification blah blah blah the idea is what we are building we're building a coding school in this coding school uh
everyone should go and be able automatically go go from no idea about coding into being a Salesforce developer
now it's important that it's focused on the Salesforce development not on the other other other fields no Salesforce
development because I've been working as a Salesforce developer for the last four years and I notice how hard it is for
people to actually go and learn how to quote on Salesforce the way we do it in Salesforce ecosystem is that we send
people to learn Java python JavaScript all the other languages and then they go
back and try to relearn everything that they learned uh on the Salesforce
platform that sucks that shouldn't be this case people should be able to go from complete beginner in recing into
being a Sal Sports developer on certain platform and you know what such platform
doesn't exist anymore wait what did I say doesn't exist so far here we go I'm I'm
obviously not native in English right so this platform doesn't exist so far and I
will be the first one who will build such a platform and that's going to be killer and that's going to be awesome
I'm sure about that so what we have so far so far I have this website right and
we implemented recently Sasha not me Sasha implemented the
login here so I can login here if I need to create account and I log in sign in
why is it not signing in okay it it it was it was signed in okay so here I
logged in and now I can go to the modules and see the modules we have the whole first module with 12 lessons now
we have most of the second module I would say almost everything we don't have the
tasks for the second module though and the reason for that is because tasks are hard to implement technically for this
one they're they're going to be a little bit different from okay so they're not hard to implement they're just a little bit different to implement in comparison
to the first module so we're not going to uh so we're not going to implement it right now before the MVP because the
goal is to ship the product and get the feedback and actually get the revenue going because if we never never if we
never develop if we never ship the platform all of this doesn't matter if we never ship if we never get the
revenue going all of this doesn't matter at all what buttons we have what style
do we have do we have tasks we don't have tasks doesn't matter we need to get Revenue in and profits uh otherwise the
whole business going to fail so I I I don't think it's going to be the case but we do need to ship it as quick as
possible with as big quality as possible so we have here so
and uh now I'm working here on this part and we implemented this login log
out thing because turns out that some people were using the platform um they
were using the platform for free which they were not intended to do um here we
go I mean that exists I I knew it's going to happen that's why I blurred here the URL because previously you were
able to access the platform just by going to the URL that's it like you you could go to the URL and you could just
type the URL and go to the platform which a lot of which actually not a lot just a few people did and that
sucks that's not the best move that people can do but I knew it's going to happen I knew I knew I knew something
like this could happen but now we finally have registration process so now you cannot uh go and just just
do the whole platform I need to approve you in the database and therefore or I
have a whole control around who can access the platform and who can't so now only only those people that I allow can
access it which is nice which is nice H let me let me change the thumbnail here
um I wanted to watch this guy I wanted to watch this guy let me upload the thumbnail here
thumbnail and of course as always the coffee
okay looks like you guys are already tuning in looks like you're tuning
in let's check So the plan for today for me would be today here we go
today um I would say I want to finish finish
triggers and by finish triggers so yesterday I have spent a lot of time writing triggers and and I finished all
the Articles so look at this this is all written by me yesterday right and today
a little bit in the morning so that's that's nice but we still need to give
here tasks and again the same problem as with Soo queries for for this one for
simple Apex the problem is that with triers it's very very hard in the way we
check the tasks now it's very hard to check them we really can't so we're
going to need to we're going to need to implement other way of checking if I want to implement automatic task
checking for the triggers which we're not going to do because we we focus on shipping the product in whatever how how
however it looks like now we going to need to ship it in that way it's already good enough to ship it's already more
than everything out there in Salesforce ecosystem it's already so much better
than every single existing course or program or everything or trail head or
any other Pro program out there for sales for SEC system it's already better I don't want to make it perfect right
now I'm going to make it perfect as soon as we ship and have some Revenue so out of this Revenue I'm going to make it
perfect but for now I think it's good enough so the plan for today is finish
triggers which means tasks so we need to create few few I
would would say um scenarios scenarios probably for
triggers or tasks uh we can call it different ways and upload to Wordpress
and upload to
database this is the task so if I finish it if I finish it today that's going to be awesome and I don't have that much
today time actually because I only have I only have two hours today because I have a I have a student uh in the middle
of the day at one um so I'm going to have I'm going to
need to make make the break there uh in the middle of the day to go and actually
do the the mentoring part that I'm doing because if I stop doing mentoring I'm
going to have zero money so that's the plan before we start
before we go into hard stuff I want to see what this guy is saying so I'm not sure if I'm going to watch the whole 23
minutes I or other way around I'm super sure I'm not going to watch all 23 minutes but I want to see a few few
statements what he makes because that seems to be quite quite popular video so let's try to do
that let's let's do
that welcome to my channel my name wait can you hear that is Josh and today I'm going to be
talking about the major layoffs happening in Tech and what I think is actually the cause behind them let's get
[Music] started the first thing I want to talk about is what's been kind of on
everybody's mind which is AI you always constantly see articles and people
talking now everywhere around the internet about how AI is going to replace programming jobs now I'm
probably going to have to make a totally separate video about this particular topic because it's such a a big topic um
but the truth is I think that is a pretty minor reason why people are being laid off right now when we look at yeah
right now so AI is definitely now the cause of the layoffs and definitely not the reason for that that much down turn
on the more how more people without a development background to actually write some
code uh which I a good example of right I I'm not really good with nextjs but I
was able to write the nextjs website using a lot of GPT and a lot of help of you guys
but still I was able to do that so AI is yeah it's coming but it's coming it's
it's coming I think that not this year but maybe in two three years AI could be
the reason why uh why the tech Market is not is not growing that
much and I think especially for the junior positions at the big tech companies which I'm going to get into in
a minute um and why they're doing these huge layoffs I think there's something maybe much
deeper that's rotten at the core and I think probably the most significant things are things people aren't really
talking about or thinking about so I'm going to get into that in a few minutes but I just want to kind of get the AI
out of here for the moment if you've ever used Google bard or if you've ever used chat GPT to actually program and
make stuff you would know that it's not going to replace programmers anytime soon actually AI isn't new we talk about
it like it's new because it's finally um it's gaining Public Access right people are finally able to use it to write
stories to plagiarize things whatever um but when we really look at AI it's been used for well over 20 years in aviation
it's been used for uh routing pathing all sorts of stuff it's just finally
people and the public have access so they seem to think it's this new thing well no it's been replacing jobs for
decades it's not really new and it's not going to replace programmers anytime soon not in
that's not true that's not true I disagree with that a lot AI is new AI is new in
that with this capabilities like we didn't have ai that was that were able
to here's an example here's an example here's what here's how I was using AI before create notion table I paste a
screenshot here into the chat GPT and say hey can you give me this code give me give me code from my own my own
screenshot I use the screenshots in uh in canva and then I want to get and then
I want to get code from the screenshots and I'm using CH GPT for that and we didn't this possibility wasn't there
three years ago and then what I say hey can you also write me a test a test can
you can you write me a test for this for this piece of code and then it writes me the test these things they didn't exist
yes it's nothing that's going to replace developers but those are very small like productivity incre for everyone for
everyone who's using AI so I'm so I'm so sick of people neglecting the impact of
AI like this whenever you hear like this guy saying oh AI you know that's blah
blah blah it's not that good it's not it's not there yet yes but it is so good now like you you like come on how how
cool it is that you can who has the CH GPT on their their iPhone or smartphone
or mobile like you can go and chat with your mobile in just normal language like this is so
awesome this is so awesome and that didn't exist like it's very new it's
it's not like it existed so this guy don't neglect the AI and the thing is
with every type of automation whenever you have an automation that for example you want to
automate developers right the automation is basically zero until you develop it
fully right or with any business process that you're trying to to automate for a company especially with with a
Salesforce right so in Salesforce I was working four years I used to the process
that you're developing something for let's say five months and if you look at
the production if you look at the what it what is it used by the client it's zero in this five months but there's a
lot of work happening there's a lot of work happening and for five months there's a zero that is out that is
automated but then when you release when you go public with your project
suddenly it switches from zero to 100% on certain on certain things the same
thing happening happening with AI now yes AI will not is not replacing
developers yet but that's exactly this type of automation that's going and who knows
maybe at some point they're going to release uh GPT developer and it's going
to go from zero automated developers to 100% automated Developers
possible can you recap what you're building I'm building a coding school
I'm building a coding school where you can go and read the theory and solve a lot of
different tasks like here automatically and they they will be automatically checked that's what I'm building
um but yeah that's what I'm building let's see entirely at least if you work
and you know let's say you are a web developer that does HTML CSS and that's
it yeah there's a possibility your job could be in danger maybe eventually but
uh certainly not anytime soon and people that do hardcore logic anything low-level anything SE
assemblers AI is just super inaccurate plus the other thing too is the way AI
works is it just resources public knowledge right AI doesn't really
creatively solve problems the way people seem to think think it does it tries to solve problems Based on data sets that
are already developed which means it can really only effectively solve problems that have already been solved and the
whole point this is not true this is not true not true at all like I I don't
understand how people cannot see that AI is coming for their jobs I just just just don't understand it this is just
how you call it this is just neglecting this is kind of like he
just convincing himself that it's not that it's not going to happen it's going to happen eii is not doing any any new
knowledge that's not true I think I don't remember what was this forbs article
AI uh mineral
exploration I think there were like news
that deep learning advancement exploration I think there was there was news that Google I think Deep
Mind so why are you building the coding school anymore I am building the coding
school Alpha code yeah I mean one of the things is Alpha code is Alpha
code right so Alpha code can can program and it can solve it can solve prog pring
programming stuff better than than definitely many of us many of us you
take the average you take the average developer now right now the AI exists that can develop or solve tasks better
than this average developer and and this is how people how people
are still denying it it's just it just such a denial phas for a lot of people
like AI slowly if you if you look at the last last at the last five or 10 years
AI slowly knocking out people out of all the fields like it's it starts slow it
starts with chess it starts with games it starts with Tetris and then we go
into the cancer exp cancer into the like cancer detection
then we go into programming and like this one by one just just people are knocked out by ai ai
outperforms uh already people in a lot of cases and even look at the chat GPT
which is not the highly specialized AI right but it has knowledge more than every single
human I think it will come for the jobs but it will be like WordPress word press does everything for
[Music]
you still developers making 200k with WordPress for Theon can't solve problem by itself yes it can't but here's the
thing that's that's coming like it's not so difficult to write EI even now it it
does exist look at the CH GPT right so I think here look at this
one um no not in this one this yeah this is perfect like I have a
data set of it's not displayed here but this is I had I have a data set of people who took the course the free
course that I have like my lead magnet right um and I and I said to chpt hey
can you analyze it it wrote some code and it executed
the code then something went wrong right so error analyzing so here was some
error so when it run the code it saw that the error has happened and then it says okay seem there's an error let me
try to incorporate the changes from this era that I think uh going to improve the code and then and then let me run it
again and then it it produced a new code it run the code again and then again the error and then it was like okay let me
let me run it again and write and then it basically turned off right but if you
continue like this for quite a time this is exactly how we develop all the programs you just need to have a smart
enough eii GPT 5 GPT 6 let's say and just let it say hey just run just write
the software it's going to execute the software run it test it check that check
that it actually does what people requested and that's it and that's it
like it's not coming yet it's not there yet it's not going to be it's not going to happen next year but it's going to
happen it's going to happen there's nothing that's going to that's going to prevent EI from taking over developers and people are a lot in in
denial but which doesn't mean you see the thing is that it
doesn't even if AI takes over developer it doesn't mean we have to to prepare it the certain way because as if if AI will
be smart enough to take over programmers we will be living just in a
different world because it's such a bottleneck for Humanity now to write programs it takes
a lot of time it is costly it just it's like super it's super
expensive to write software if we can lower the cost of the software by like 100 times um
and we're still going to need developers but I think the developer R going to be different right if we can lower by 100 times we
going to we can advance Humanity so much so much and I hope it's going to happen
even even if I'm developer I'm developer and I'm I'm developing a coding school right so I don't expect eii to take over
uh to take over the world in the next in the next let's say 5 years but at some
point it's going to happen and and it's totally not true what this what I totally disagree with this guy I mean it
might be true but I totally disagree with the guy that EI is just basically like a monkey that that is replicating
whatever you whatever you some common knowledge okay what do you write
there yeah I have been a thing for several year now yeah I mean it's been thing for quite a time
but it become so Advanced only in the recent years since chat
GPT have you tried the arc browser yes I tried it and I switched to Edge
there will be always that one guy with a startup idea who needs a developer yeah that's that's always
going to be but the the best part I definitely know that the now there are people who can with a little coding
knowledge you can already do so much more now with the J GPT than than you used to be able to do even even one half
year ago like that's not that's not a huge that's not a huge time frame the point of hiring a programmer for for the
most part um is that your company or your needs are going to be specific to
that product now I make games that's my job I've tried to use AI to help with my
game development especially like hardcore logic programming problems and I've just found it's just not very good
sometimes it's helpful on some things it's a good resource for a programmer to have but it is not going to be replacing
programmers dramatically anytime soon it is a small factor it is part of the why
some companies are looking to the Future and saying we need to start laying off unnecessary staff because in the future
and they're anticipating that uh this may replace certain jobs but again I think this is kind of a very small part
of the reason why some people are being replaced so I just wanted to kind of get that out of the way get your concerns
out of the way again I'll make a whole video on this and why it's not going to replace people not truly uh later but
you don't need to worry about AI That's not the major factor here so another thing that it could possibly be is
preparation for a looming recession most people that work in
economics will tell you as we speak you see it all over the news that a recession is probably coming stock
values can only go up so high for so long before something has to collapse
right it's just it's it's the rules of entropy or gravity things can only get better and go up and then eventually
they have to come down we look at interest rates for example and that's a good place to start your search if you think there's an economic recession
coming soon professionals and people that are analysts see interest rates and they see that well I thought we are already in
the recession I I I don't want to I don't want a recession coming soon I
thought we are in the recession and that we are coming out of the recession that's what I hoped see
that as a concern companies of course hire their own economists and the economists are going to be going to the
CEOs and going to the CTO and people that handle handle hiring hiring managers hiring departments hiring companies whoever they Outsource that to
and they're going to say look a recession is coming we need to start doing minor layoffs slowly and we have
seen some of those but again of these big major layoffs that we're seeing right now I don't think that this is the
biggest factor I do think it's a factor just like AI is a factor but it's not the big one so that's the thing I want
to get into now as I start to talk about this and as I start to go deeper into the problem it's going to become more
clear the more you start to look at people's critical roles in their company the oh my God I like this video is
definitely not made not made for current current way of watching videos like I
need like quick like give me in 30 seconds we we've been we have spent on this video 5 minutes what is the where
is the juice where's the where's the actual video the real and major factor that's
causing a lot of these layoffs I really do seem to think is being overlooked
because people are so used to the way the tech industry works now that nobody
seems to question it anymore what's been happening in Tech about the last 20 years is what I like to call a hyp
specialization for roles right 20 or 30 years ago if you were a programmer and
you knew a couple programming languages or maybe even one maybe you were a generalist you could get basically any
programming job companies were hiring based on the fact that you knew how to program and that you understood logic
and you understood generally speaking how computer science works and how to make products that are useful for that
company that's not how it works anymore because it does like it does if you have
if you have someone who is really good developer you're going to hire them like you you're going to I I know people who
like we especially in the Salesforce ecosystem we have such a shortage of people who are good developers then
we're going to hire whatever developer you are and then train you on the
Salesforce so it still works the same I mean probably not to the same degree because I cannot speak about the last 20
years because I have I haven't been on the market I've been playing video games because I was 4 years old
but but definitely still happening so far like I remember we on my last job we
hired someone or we may we made definitely a lot of offers for people who were developers in other niches but
they were good developers there we knew that they are good developers and we wanted to get them they declined but
that's that's another story cuz somewhere along the way big companies like Facebook um I think Snapchat is a
particular offender I'll talk about that that in a minute um they started to realize that they could grow their companies artificially if they started
hiring more people than they really need most tech companies most social networks
could be managed by shockingly small teams of programmers now I'm not talking about legal I'm not talking about HR
resources other things that are considerations as well but just the actual Tech that goes into an app for
iOS let me give you an example say Instagram or SnapChat I think it would surprise most people how few programmers
it actually takes a lot of these social networks were developed originally by one person but now for some reason you
look at a company like Snapchat who even uses Snapchat anymore they still have something like 6,000 employees you need
6 exactly what Snapchat Snapchat I'm not using the Snapchat I have never used the
Snapchat I have no idea how to even use it how how many
how many employees almost 6,000 that that always I always wondered
like what do people do on those companies like for example
Instagram in Instagram how many
employees no way that many no
way 18,000 no way
no no that's more reasonable 450 that's unreasonable that many employees it's it's maybe the whole
mattera matter how many
employees matter how many employees what
86,000 that's insane what the hell are you doing there like
86,000 it's like a small City if you want to take the whole mattera you can put them in in like small
City Spanish why would I open it in Spanish but look how they
grow from basically in the last two years from 58 till
86 of course of course we see layoffs of course if you grow like this the the
thing is that the platform doesn't grow that that much I guess I mean maybe I'm
not sure Facebook does Facebook even grow that's their main business right
Facebook what else Instagram WhatsApp is not monetized I have no idea what those
people are all doing there I don't think that that's true but if this is true I have no idea what they're doing
because Instagram doesn't have that many like it's not inating like what they do
they they just sometimes every couple of let's say every six month they just change the UI of of the Instagram and
that's said and that's slack slack how many
employees how many employees 2,000 like 2,000 employees of
slack when was the last the last meaningful update that the slack
did like I've been using slack for the last four years it's it stayed the same except of the UI change that they did
like couple of months ago that's it it stayed exactly the same what are those
2,000 people doing there of course of course we see layoffs like if you have 2,000 people working on an app where you
don't have any updates yeah of course you're going to have layoffs here they're counting even the
legal person that writes the terms and condition the cleaners of the office yeah that's true but like 2,000 people
you like that's even even if we take that only 30% of
2,000 people let's say 20% that's 500 people like even even if
20% or 30% of them are developers that's like still a lot but you do need I mean quite to be
frankly like you you do need a lot of infrastructure support right so you do
need a lot of on slack it's a cloud-based right so you do need a lot
of people who understand how Cloud works you need a lot of those things but still
that's that's like really a lot
and of course there are layoffs then thousand employees I could understand have I bet that each of this company can
cut 5% of its employees and that's going to have zero impact like look at the Twitter Twitter X is still running even
I don't know how how many people in musire like 80% I bet you can do the same with most
biggest product based companies having a few dozen programmers but they have
hundreds and hundred hundreds and hundreds of programmers not to mention all their legal and everything else so what we're seeing is a hypers
specialization of roles and companies are doing this to prop up stock values the core here is it's a type of
invisible and legal fraud if you keep growing your company by just hiring more
people and then investors and people that frankly don't know a lot about tech think that's necessary they see that as
positive indicators so your goal if you're Mark Zuckerberg is to make your company as valuable as possible to stock
investors not to the public Facebook doesn't even need to make very much money at all the the key to Facebook
being valuable and more specifically Mark Zuckerberg being valuable is doing what investors want and what lenders
want and they want to see Positive Growth constantly in the industry we call this employee farming so the idea
behind employee farming is as long as you keep growing your worker base it
looks like your company's growing it looks like you need to hire those people and therefore again bigger company means
bigger stock valuations it means lenders and um investors see you as this better
growing big future company even if it's not and this is ultimately what's leading to this hypers specialization
because they have to keep creating new roles and when you look at these videos I'm I'm sure you've all seen them by now
people mocking them constantly on the internet but you look at these videos of these girls and guys who work in this
hyp specialized role uh posting videos on Tik Tok and they post videos on Twitter of like my my day at Twitter or
uh my a day in the life of a Twitter HR engineer or something like that and it's
basically the girl or guy just drinking coffee hanging around chilling out they they show
themselves sleeping in these pods that they have now they're really not doing much and again this is the result of hyp
specialization they were basically just creating BS jobs and now you have a bunch of people sitting around who don't
work like once you have a 100 programmers you're done you're not doing anything more useful beyond that maybe
you could have people in specialized roles outside of the tech again people
like legal and HR but we are seeing jobs for button Engineers like literally they
want you to specialize not just in programming but specialize in making a
button do you know how many people work at Snapchat for example Snapchat has
like I said early about 6,000 employees but they have over 400 employees that
just work on UI that's it they do nothing but UI the entire UI of Snapchat
could easily be done by a handful of professionals if not less if not one person probably if you've ever actually
used Snapchat you know it's awful anyways the whole UI is just a complete disaster there is no reason to have 400
people working on the UI they don't even have 400 buttons there's something like like 30 or 40 buttons on the whole app
that's more than 10 people for each button that the app has in each function but they do it because the company is
forced into this cycle of infinite growth and then other companies are doing it so they have to compete or else
they look like they're small and shrinky and they lose value in investors as people Port else
wait let me put the focus here because it distracted me with this bimp beim
sound swear but we're just seeing massive hyp specialization for RO roles
that probably shouldn't even exist to begin with and when we start to look at that problem we start to see why tech
companies are doing massive layoffs a very big reason for this is the Catalyst
event which was of course Elon buying Twitter I'm going to get into that in just a minute too so now as we start to
see negative indicators in stock value AI future growth things like that I especially you know look at meta they
tried to do this whole metaverse thing that failed lost billions of dollars now they know okay we need coup some of that
money and the best way to do it is to start firing these people or doing layoffs of them that we I don't think
they fail they they have quite a good product don't they like they have the last thing that I saw is uh T back
and and who and fre fredman is is that is it Lex I I just know he's called Lex
uh they did a podcast in in this metaverse and and it was awesome and it was awesome like look at this let's
let's let's search for it Le um
Lex here we go look look at this with Mark Zuckerberg inside the
metaverse Mark and I are hundreds of miles apart from each other in physical space but it feels like we're in the
same room because we appear to each other as photo realistic codec avatars in 3D with spatial audio this technology
is incredible and I think is the future of how human beings connect to each other in a deeply meaningful way on the
internet I agree I agree because the way we connect now with meetings it sucks
have you ever like if you ever had a day where you have 10 meetings you're
exhausted by those meetings if you just meet with 10 people you're not exhausted you're okay but with having these
meetings There's Something About This zoom zoom meetings that really draining
so I think that that should should change in some way that we never really needed to begin with so a lot of people
have this sort of idea that oh programmers are all just getting fired now no they're not good programmers are
not getting fired not predominantly at least except maybe at Unity but that's a different topic but the idea here is
that if you're a good programmer you're going to have a stable job you're needed there's tons of companies that are still
growing that are still bringing in new programmers you don't need to worry you only need to worry if you're one of the
people that's getting hired in something Super Hyper specialized and that's why I still recommend to people to be
generalists be a good programmer who knows lots of Frameworks who knows lots of languages who understands computer
science intimately because that makes you a valuable resource they're not just going to fire you or get rid of you you
have an intrinsic value when you bring something to the table Beyond just being able to make one tiny button on the
interface when you really fundamentally understand how apps work and are designed when you understand core
architecture you are never ever going to be out of work and if you do get fired because a company goes under or something you're going to find work
really fast as well so you shouldn't worry about that I I see too many people panicking in the industry right now the
people getting fired are in almost every case I've seen the jobs that never should have existed to begin with and I
don't mean to insult those people many of those people are generalists that ended up being forced into a
specialization just to get a job because these companies don't want to hire generalists right these companies want
to hire people in specific subsets because then they don't complain they
don't whine about wanting to do better bigger things they get comfortable in the rule they get comfortable in the
fact that they don't have to do very much and I think that that's just convenient for the industry it's convenient for this type of mass hiring
fraud which is what I considered it I know they they just call it employee farming but I call it employee fraud
because ultimately this is bad for the companies because they do do major layoffs and then they lose stock value
because people think the company's shrinking so it's bad for them and it's bad for employees because you never feel
like you're stable you feel like you work on things that don't matter so you're just a cog in the well oiled
machine if you want to even call it that more like a brick in the wall you're a brick in the wall of this machine like
at meta or Facebook and you just feel like you don't matter you feel like your job is what I think Joe Rogan had a
podcast on this actually called BS jobs um but that's that's ultimately What's led to this is is way way over hiring
and super specified jobs that they don't is the thing BS jobs by BS jobs
jogan let's see what's that let's go this but also if you really think about
the fact that we are in a world where people have to go to work to do a job that by the way
man if there is a dude you need to get on this podcast and there's a book B that you would love David Graber wrote
this book called [ __ ] jobs this guy is a [ __ ] genius man and this book [ __ ] jobs breaks down the phenomena
of uh how many many people are working in jobs that don't do anything for the
world or the company they're working for and it's not like this judgmental thing where he's like yeah that's a [ __ ]
job you're a blah blah blah he one of the he's like a anthropologist so he's very precise but one of the
qualifications for your job to be a [ __ ] job is you know that it's really kind of a worthless job it's not
really doing anything and like companies have gotten so [ __ ] big that uh they
they end up having like departments or people running departments or extra employees that don't really need to be
there at all and they have to pretend to be to work that's what he writes about
he he he he writes that the if you really want to torture a person person uh not only give them like the
job of like you know pouring a glass of water in an empty glass and pouring it back but then add to it that they have
to deceive their boss into thinking that they're like doing an important job or
they lose their job so these not only are these like some corporations and companies scanning your piss to see if
you're taking a substance that is allowing you to connect with home what
you actually are they are also demanding that you spend many hours a day lying to
them that you're doing work that you're not doing if you're [ __ ] efficient
you know and this is another thing Graber writes about forgive me David graer in any way I misconstrue this I
read your writings stoned but the and and but the the um the the the other
[ __ ] element to it that is abs absolutely atrocious and [ __ ]
horrible is that uh these substances are connecting us to home they don't want us
to be in those States and they're asking us to [ __ ] lie all day and you know what psychedelic means the the atmology
of psychedelic no it means mind manifesting or Soul manifesting right so
a psychedelic connects us potentially with the truth what we are our identity
right and these companies they're asking us to lie to be the opposite of our
identities to wear weird a suit or or some kind of dress code oh yeah this is
why I don't like Joe ran because of this like he has such a concentration of
conspiracy psychedelics drugs whatever things that are so strange for me like
this guy I I don't know like he speaks right things about the BS jobs but about this thing like substances substance es
that connect us to home what the hell is that and to sit in a desk where because you're efficient you get your job done
in 45 minutes and for the next 6 hours you got to sit and type and pretend that you're working
knowing you're a person and knowing that this is like unethical you're but if you
if you like go and tell your boss hey man I don't really have much to do you
might get fired the boss might like in the book he cites one person cuz he did
like a survey and he cites one person who went to her boss and she's like hey I can finish my job in two hours I need
can I have other stuff to do and her boss is like don't talk about that stay quiet about that oh yeah man that's the
[ __ ] world we're in right now because of automation there's less to do computers are making [ __ ] fast it's why
are we work we're working the exact same amount of time we were when there were no computers but you have to be there to get paid and you have to act like you're
doing something or they can you yeah how many people right now are doing just that while they're listening to this a
lot a lot and and by the way if you if you had a guess what percentage of people are listening right now that are
really supposed to be doing some [ __ ] job and they're kind of sitting in front of their keyboard with earbuds
on just barely paying attention trying not to get caught looking at porn yeah yeah I probably all over the planet over
million over a million in the workforce probably when do you think companies had
like million is like nothing to put in rules that you can't look at porn at
work like that wasn't a thing in the 70s it wasn't a thing in the 80s right it
wasn't a thing in the '90s then all of a sudden you could just find porn
online and people they have a work computer that's hooked up to the Internet like when did companies start
going oh yeah yeah we didn't know about that yeah you can't look at that dude and I mean I'm sure it started with like
Penthouse right like you when they had Penthouse like Penthouse mag like when you had [ __ ] like you know yeah for
sure bring you couldn't bring your Penthouse your [ __ ] Hustler to work that's true but the but looking at
something online is so much easier than going to the store and getting a hustler like the access is universal
instantaneous everyone has the the ability to just go and download it you know if we're going to like ask
questions that are impossible to answer like how many people right now do you think listening to the podcast are in
their [ __ ] job jerking off the porn while they listen at least one dude
yeah for sure that's what dudes do yeah I mean because they get away with it they jerk off especially a guy with a
bad job who could find a way to jerk off somewhere yeah let me just get five minutes in this bathroom and jerk off
just so have to think about this stupid [ __ ] job dude come on like that's like sexual assault I don't think
jerking off in an office not in the what if you scream if everyone knows you're G
to go like hey I'm gonna go in there I'm gonna jerk off when I come I scream that's sexual assault oh for well that
is I [ __ ] feel like okay this is why I don't like Joe Rogan because he invites such weird guests and of course
he also has like normal guests but this is this is not very useful for me I don't know I don't I don't like it I
don't enjoy those type type of conversations on the podcast but I guess the I mean there are people in into it
right but it's true the I've been there like I've been there I I had I'm going
to tell a story so so I had a job my first job uh I applied
for the company they they were called software Factory so software Factory so they supposed to do software right um
turns out they were doing iot software and this iot software
it's so first it's boring because the project that I was on it's supposed to collect data from a lot of sensors on
some kind of uh some kind of Bavarian machines sitting somewhere and doing some grain or some what whatever like
that's like the most boring project that you can imagine I was put on this
project and I asked them so basically the whole task was collect the data and
put it into the system so basically pars the data so I asked them hey can you give me an example of data and we don't
have it I was like okay so where can I find what I actually need to put into
the system they said oh we don't know let us make a meeting in three months
they made a meeting so when I joined the company when I joined the project they put me on the
project they made a meeting in three months in three months to get me the
data going that I need to comp completing the project and I said to them okay okay let's wait and then we
had the meeting and when we went to the meeting turns out the guy who had who made the meeting didn't have the data so
we have made a meeting in the next three months with another person and all of
this time I've been working I couldn't just go home I couldn't just say and
like I don't know go and watch YouTube I couldn't just go and study no I was supposed to work and I was supposed to
put hours into the system and then I would get paid based on the amount of hours that I put into the
system so if I put if I put 20 hours into the system I get paid for 20 hours
if I put 16 I get PA paid for 16 well guess what I don't want to put 16 I want to get paid for four hours more but I
don't have any meaningful work to do the only thing that I could do is go and research the whole system that we have
to do go research the programs how how do I wrote basically everything that I could without knowing the actual the
data that is supposed to pass and if you're developer you're right because you don't know the structure of the data
so you cannot you don't know what you're going to need to do you don't know the structure you don't know the data you
only know the the the database where you're supposed to put the pro the the the data and you only know that you're
supposed to do it in this program and that's it so that that's
that was my BS job and I worked there for four months and I didn't really do anything
meaningful in this four months is the stream
down
is the stream
down I think it was down for a second right but I hope you heard my story
about about the BS jobs or about the BS job that I was
working no look still still on still on nice
day 31 am I still live on Twitch [ __ ]
internet yeah I am
um all right that was my rant about all of this BS jobs do you like Andrew what do you what
do you mean Andrew Andrew Tate
if you mean the endr Tate I don't care like I wouldn't say
like he exists which is good doesn't have any influence
around my life so I don't really care about about
him I love I love the marketing he's doing though I mean he's marketing genius the
stream was lagging yeah [ __ ] the
internet sorry for that think it was a bit too
loud yeah so that's been that's that's my
rent so I spent on that what uh on all these things an hour but I think it was worth it I think it was worth it now to
actual job now let's do some productive work I know that this type of this type of
streams they are bit more entertaining but that doesn't
bring my goal near right
I mean we we all should learn from those guys like ENT Tate even if they are full of full of
[ __ ] I mean we don't know about Andre Tate right but definitely
not the type of guy I would like like to follow or the mindset that I would like
to take just because of so much negativity like in general I I want to
stay positive like I don't want to I don't know I just like be being positive in my life I don't
like I don't like having any negative and he is super negative right so he's
basically his whole think is that he's he's I mean he has so much negativity in the way he
speaks he criticizes everything and so I don't know I don't I don't like it I
don't want to I don't want to be involved too much with it those
things okay so now we need to create actually cases for the
triggers it's called practice
cases
or this
part
so basically I don't know how many how many should I create I would say 10 would be nice and the way I'm going to create
those cases will be um first business like business requirement second the
uh the solution that's it business requirement and solution that's
it but before I actually do it let me get some coffee I I just see here coffee
in front of me and I don't drink
it
I I really should stop drinking that much cafee and then I also not only I drink a lot of cafee I know how many how
many cups of cafee I drink I also show all of this how I drink that many cups of coffee on the stream and then I show
you a bad
example
feel maybe at some point I'm going to do coffee in free stream so I'm going to
try to be without coffee for a week and if I fail I'm going to need to
do something I don't know what but I'm so addicted at this
point
all right now we can continue with actual
work
so the way I want to create the tasks is that I want to get help of jgpt and I want to I have here task body
which helps me to restructure the tasks but it should also help me to create the tasks wait do I have another
one yeah this one homework homework for beginners
okay I want to create 10 different use
cases for simple triggers the cases should be
solvable in just one
trigger it should involve trigger for following
objects leads
counts contacts and
opportunities all of the cases should be beginner
friendly friendly not containing not containing any
integration or Advanced topics let's think step by step and
first outline what the cases
are let's do the CHT let's go let's
go if I can do those 10 things today those 10 cases today that would be
awesome so I mean this is my plan for today um I'm going to do the 10 cases and I'm going to upload everything into
database and then we are done with writing everything for for the
website okay one thing that I I
should yeah let let let's finish
um I want to make the triggers only using standard
Fields standard Fields because I don't want my students
to go and create create fields in the
system
and I already have some I already have some cases and I'm going to I'm going to steal some cases I I think I only have
like three in total let's see
triggers oh wow oh I already have them that's nice just now just need the
answer
okay okay let's write it ah this is I have I have already so much material and
I'm yeah okay send it to your map to your man
okay let's do it like like this case case one righty trigger that creates a
follow-up task for an account if an opportunity is lost that's good case
two case
three case
four Cas five I wish notion had some kind of
autopilot really missing autopilot I'm missing autopilot in
anytime anywhere where I need to type anything case
seven those are all good T Test case um trigger cases and I already tested all
of them so I know that they work
okay nine cases so let's say we only need to get like a few few few new test
Cas let's
see of course I need to make sure that I
don't have the same the same test cases okay let's
see going to change the music to something more relaxing
that's a good one that's a good
one
okay I mean I see I see some of them are good let's ask jgpt to make it
more how should I set it more descriptive
no
those are some good good things here I like
it
descriptive is descriptive word okay Cas
11
case number 12
I mean we're going to also need to check all of them so even if I have now approximately some of them still going
to change especially this one I'm not sure that it's actually possible I think it I
think Salesforce formats this on its own and we cannot really have any influence
around it that's what I
think
e
basically when we have an account so we have an account and then whenever we deactivate this account we going to set
all the opportunities to Clos lost automatically which is could be would be
a strange way of doing that but why not some companies that's definitely
would be doing something like
this okay so I know that the first nine are tested I only need to test
the this 10 and let me write here's what
I end up with can you come up with two
more so that we have nice 15 cases because 13
is somehow not the number that I want to end up the the the cases
count oh that's good
one
okay so here it's trying to use notifications but it's a bit too advanced for people who taking so
notifications we didn't cover notification since and it means we cannot use
notifications notifications anything with
notifications for the last
one oh that's a good one
that's a good
one mhm nice this is actually a really good one I like this one okay so let's
make them bold and remove bolt
here remove here as
well
nice it looks really good and again it was much quicker than I initially
thought I'm a
hello right now we need to actually test them
let's go and try to test
them
let's see if it's actually a case such a like such thing as a let's
see contact trigger
you know what let me maybe do it should I do it in vs
code yeah let me do it in vs code because I'm going to be so it's going to be so difficult to do it not in vs
code it's not going to be so difficult but it will be bit of
pain and then you can see coding in vs code in cellport for the first
time contact
Trier and in my work we probably already have it so let me retrieve this whole thing
up
okay I think I just had another problem with the with the internet oh my God I I
do need to fix the
internet now it seems to be working
again
now now the sales force doesn't work
nice oh come on celles
Force
contact look at this at least we could deploy
okay nice okay so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to copy those things and just put it
here and this is going to be an example how CH GPT can actually help with not
jgpt just copilot so I'm going to write here just a structure right so
if trigger is
uh and then it gives me the whole the whole boil boil plate and then now I just modify it a little
bit and this is is is before and is
update before update
and is let just let's do insert let's just focus on the insert before insert
yep let focus on the before insert let's see deploy deves deploy FL I'm going to
go to the orc and check that actually
works let's
see let's say yeah please fill in the maing Y nice
nice nice so it works and then we fill out everything and we leave one empty
and it still doesn't work so now we need to fill out blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah and now I can save
it nice so it works as expected nice okay so this one is done this is about
contacts all right so this is going to be this account this later let's do let's do this
one now let's also make this
one okay then if contact and then the
next oh that that makes it way too compo complicated
um you know what it is actually way too complicated I didn't see it coming so I
didn't see I didn't I didn't really think it through and of course it is a little bit too complicated to think so I
don't think that we should include this
one yep let's just delete it that's fine we have enough cases
okay customer that's about accounts that's about leads that's about accounts
okay so I think we're good with contacts let's create now the account
uh create account account trigger triggers and I'm
going to retrieve here for sure we have some okay contact now let me take this
trigger and let me put it here as a
solution Cod here's
solution okay
so count trigger okay in the account trigger we have something doesn't matter
what after insert after update as
well
okay let's see that's going to work I'm not sure what are the values for the type pick list
though it does work but let's see what are the values for the typ pick list
setup uh accounts
type
direct Channel and
partner uh let's say it's going to be technology
partner no let's do technology partner here here and Healthcare is going to be
what customer let's do
Prospect okay now let me update this one technology partner technology technology
partner and
Prospect okay let's see if that trigger is going to work
and it should be wait it should be before before insert and before
update and let me also enclose it in the if statement
if if trigger is before insert and before update and of course it's also
not the best practice for triggers so whoever watches this if you're watching it for learning how to write triggers
it's not the way to learn how to write triggers um the actual way would be with
trigger handlers but that's going to do the job this is what what we are here for so
we're here for writing before update before insert
and before update yep to be correct and closing parenthesis deploy
accounts new account
type not type industry Finance let's search for
finance Finance
save customer direct um okay let's let's create a new
account blah blah blah industry technology technology
save technology partner
and blah blah blah blah blah
healthare wait where's the
healthcare Prospect nice nice nice okay it worked awesome so this trigger is
correct as
well
solution now is customer inactive change the status of wall okay this is I
definitely know that this is possible let me um let me ask CH GPT because I don't
want to type all of this thing my own I have let create a new a new one
classic I have following trigger and I'm going to show this
trigger up can you
adjust this trigger so that it solves following following
problem following case
enter
seems like it's approximately the right
solution
let's see the only one thing that I'm
using different spacing sorry to GPT I'm going to need to butcher it
completely
okay let's see also select statement at least it writes with the
right with the right best practices in terms of The Styling so it's
good let's see accounts for update
wa what when accounts changes to customer
inactive new account new account new account new
account what's the problem I I never understood what's the problem to just spell whole word old account I know the
JT is based on how people write it on the basically in the public but what's
the problem like why people don't don't spell the whole thing it's it it it definitely increases readability so if you if you're writing a variable it it
doesn't doesn't do anything bad if you just write four letters more
right but increases readability so
much yeah so here we're checking that it is now the type is inactive but previously
it was not inactive then accounts for update we add them to accounts for update then if it's not empty then we're
searching for everything that is not in closed one all the opportunities we iterate through the opportunities and we
update yep that seems to be that seems to be correct let's see if that's going
to deploy yep it deploys now for this account I'm going to create a new opportunity and I'm I'm going to call
blah blah blah blah blah doesn't really matter stage going to be qualification
save and new blah blah blah blah stage
negotiation close date oh my God close date where's the close date doesn't matter and one more opportunity for blah
blah blah blah blah and Stage will be close
lost you know what closed one closed date
closed one and I'm going to modify the code here so that it doesn't take and stage
name not equal
um and stage name not equal close l or Clos
one why because we don't want to put to the closed lost those opportunities that
were won because that's already done I mean in Salesforce there are basically two end stages for opportunity close
lost and Clos won so we only want to take all of these who were not closed and close
them okay and now if we modify it from uh from what from type
to wait we don't have such a type that's the catch that's the catch we don't have such a type castom inactive yeah we
don't have such a type um let's see how can we do it in other way around ownership public
private customer priority no SLA no Absol opportunity
no I mean we we can of course we can uh we can say here important
add as a pick bck list
field okay again this
s add customer inactive as a bck list value for for the
bck list field
important and that's what we're going to do as well we're going to go and edit the object and pick list and
type type
new custom reect to save and now we should have this field
customer and probably we need to refresh it let's see I think we need to refresh it with a cash update cash update
refresh I feel like I want to do one stream that's going to be completely only sales force because you see how
much how like how it is much easier for me to do sales for than anything else so
I maybe at some point I should do that okay account now the type customer in to
save and the opportunity were not updated ahuh no wait closed closed
one okay that was closed one okay this is still in qualification so that they they were not updated what is the reason
for
that well we don't need actually we don't need this if statement check
um what's the
reason okay let's debug let's say system to debug Ops to
update deploy and I'm going to open the developer
console so that we can see the looks
okay count name count type customer conect to
save success success I think the trigger is just not
firing huh why are you not
firing ah because I didn't include it here huh okay after after update that's
why it's not firing
okay okay so Prospect customer in
active still
wait why is it why is it still Prospect ah okay why is it still Prospect okay because healthc care is I
see wait and it was not even deployed before okay before
insert before no before update and before
update update let's see so I'm going to I'm going to remove from the last one I'm
going to why do use Microsoft Edge over chrome
because Microsoft Edge is the best browser currently on the market and it's chromium based so it has
all the features on all the Chrome extensions and all the all the stuff that you used on Chrome and currently I
think now is the best the best
browser
do you feel like it's more lightweight no I don't think it's more lightweight but it has I don't know the the
navigation is much better much smoother the just the overall experience I think is just so much
nicer you know what I don't need this part I don't need this part because I'm going
to do anyway separate like look at this it's so easy
to navigate here and this is so awesome but it's like it's like Arc browser
right so if you have ever tried Ark I like Ark but I like Edge more more
than Arc
all let's see prospecting custom enactive oh now it works nice nice
basically the code was mostly correct just few adjustments okay this one's done automatically said
the priority of the leads based on the company size
field let's do it quick create Apex
Trigger leave trigger and let's
go uh and say can you solve this one as
well also is Edge optimized for M1 chips no idea no idea but I also don't think
that that Arc is optimized for I think if you really want for something that optimized you should use Safari but the
Safari sucks I tried to use it it
sucks okay so this is delete trigger
that okay company size is there such thing as
a field of company size on the lead object let's see or maybe something
remotely similar to the lead to the company size
lead this company size nope there's no such thing
as company size ha
oh let's do the industry
then no let me go back to the this one and here right this case assume that
there's company company size field
but no such standard standard field can we rework this case so that it
uses standard standard
Fields annual revenue annual revenue where on the
is there such thing as the annual revenue on the on leads annual revenue nice nice and
that's currency nice uh based on annual revenue
field
I reworked it so that so that it uses standard
Fields I think I already have such a case
no actually I don't okay nice
so yeah that seems to be
correct
and here I can say if annual revenue is equal equal null or this
one and that's going to be already good check or null value
deploy at Le Trier ah damn it uh I need to create another file because I misspelled it a little
bit create Apex s trigger all right oh hey give me
back play what's going
on elad trigger what's what's the file mismatch rename elad
trigger rename the
trigger okay will you be happy now deploy yes now it's happy
good let's go and try to create some leads what is this intelligence view
sales force what kind of innovation is that okay new blah blah blah company doesn't
matter lead Source annual revenue let's make like this what is 10 million let's
let's make it less let's make it 100,000 rating
nothing and rating set to low
good clone instead of creating and just cloning the new one let's add here one zero and it's going to be 1 million and
it should go into the medium medium and oops not sharing don't care about
sharing clone and 10 Millions 10 million should be
high still medium because we need probably two millions
and one here hi yeah that's right okay let's
yeah another thing we don't need this one because it's already checked in the previous one so don't need this
one and equal like
this that would be the right solution and deploy this thing to the
or okay this lead is done ensure that account name stand
enough format okay let's do I have a account trigger yes I do have account trigger this one um and
I'm going to ask jgpt as well so that it's a bit quicker can you also solve this
one what's
up here code and for the count here I'm going to remove this one I don't really need this
one
okay let's already start writing what they write uh that's a bit stupid what they
have but anyway kile's failing me a
bit all right if
can you write it in one
one trigger without any helper
classes I think we I I think I can just quicker write myself account name not equal null
then we going to create a list of strings string yep words that's called
words words and let's call it string
capitalized capitalized name will be equal to this
one then we're going to iterate through this and that's [ __ ] not like this
capitalized W will be W capitalize
this and Dre count name capitalize name y I
think that's good we can even we can even do something yeah I think it's fine I think that should should work
already okay let me go back here and this is on accounts so if I create
here Global Tech was it deployed yep it was deployed
Global Tech Industries it's automatically capitalized nice so
it works I was almost quicker than chpt and definitely let's check let's
compare the solutions me and
chpt huh my solution is better I'm not doing the substring I'm using capitalize because I
know that such thing as capitalize method it exists on the the
string nice I'm really proud of
it a lot of people a lot of people joined a lot of people joined welcome everyone who
joined look at this I'm done with this that was much quicker than I expected finish
triggers finish triggers by B done trigger done now I'm
going to need to focus on those things uploading to Wordpress and uploading to
that base which will be a little bit painful but I wouldn't I don't need to think for this type of task it's
basically going to be this passively but for now guys I
have I have a meeting now with one of my students so I'm going to need to go I'm going to need to go but tomorrow I'll be
streaming at the same approximately at the same time and thank you everyone for joining thank you thank you and see you
everyone tomorrow

Summary:
### Lecture Notes: Importance of Algorithms in Programming

**Speaker**: Forest

**Overview**: Forest discusses the significance of algorithms in programming, categorizing them into three main types: sorting, searching, and graph algorithms. He emphasizes their foundational role in efficient problem-solving and software optimization.

**Advantages**:

- Algorithms provide a framework for efficient problem-solving and data organization.
- They optimize software performance and enhance programming skills.

**Drawbacks**:

- Some algorithms may not be suitable for all tasks and can be inefficient if not chosen wisely.
- Certain algorithms like merge sort require additional space, which may be problematic in memory-constrained environments.

**Tips and Advice**:

- Choose the appropriate algorithm based on the task, system capabilities, and data characteristics.
- Understand the trade-offs between different algorithms, such as time complexity and space requirements.

**Sorting Algorithms**:

- **Bubble Sort**: Simple but with a time complexity of O(n^2). It's illustrative but not efficient for large datasets.
- **Insertion Sort**: Better for nearly sorted data. Average and worst-case time complexity of O(n^2), but best-case is O(n).
- **Merge Sort**: Efficient and stable with a time complexity of O(n log n), but requires additional space.

**Searching Algorithms**:

- **Linear Search**: Simple but with a time complexity of O(n). Suitable when data is unsorted or for small datasets.
- **Binary Search**: Efficient for sorted arrays with a time complexity of O(log n).

**Graph Algorithms**:

- **Depth First Search (DFS)** and **Breadth First Search (BFS)**: Used for exploring nodes and edges in graphs. Time and space complexity vary based on the representation of the graph.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Finds the shortest paths from a single source node to all other nodes, considering the weight of the edges.
- __A_ Algorithm_*: Optimizes pathfinding by using a heuristic to prioritize nodes closer to the goal, enhancing efficiency.

**Importance and Usefulness**:

- Algorithms are crucial in various real-world applications, including computer networks, database management, and route planning.
- They form the backbone of efficient data processing, retrieval, and analysis.

**Accomplishments**:

Why algorithms are important
hey my name is Forest welcome back so
there are three types of algorithms you
should know as a programmer we actually
go over nine algorithms in this video
what they are how they work rare world
use cases complete with code examples
and explanations but they fall under
three categories three types of
algorithms you should know sorting
algorithms used to rearrange elements in
a list or an array in a certain order
searching algorithms used to find or
retrieve an element from a data
structure or to determine its existence
and location in the data set and graph
algorithms used to solve problems
related to graph Theory where data is
represented as a collection of nodes or
vertices connected by edges you probably
know these as trees and just as I did in
my Ford data structures video I want to
say I'm proud of you for clicking on
this video because this isn't the glitz
and glamour where you can watch this
video and dream about being a software
engineer this is the getting into the
nitty-gritty the stuff that you do that
will actually make you a software
engineer so why are these algorithms you
should know because they form the
foundation of efficient problem solving
in computer science studying these not
only enhances programming skills but
deepens analytical thinking and their
instrumental and optimizing software
performance among a wide array of real
world applications it's like the
difference between building something
with a hammer versus a nail gun and this
is a quick analogy I promise they both
get the job done but the nail gun is
clearly more efficient for most projects
but sometimes the hammer would actually
be a better choice because it could be
more efficient due to the scope of the
task same with algorithms some may be
better for most tasks but not all tasks
and you need to know these different
algorithms exist to know which one to
use because if you never knew a nail gun
exist did well good luck trying to frame
your entire house using just a hammer it
may take you a while so sorting
Sorting Algorithms
algorithms a sorting algorithm is a
method of process used to rearrange
elements in a list or an array in a
certain order whether it be ascending
descending or even based on some complex
rules the purpose of sorting is to
organize data in a way that makes it
easier to use easier to search analyze
and display information efficiently if
you wanted another analogy it's like if
you take a shuffle deck of cards and you
want to put it in order here are
actually eight different sorting
algorithms working on four different
initial condition conditions random
nearly sorted reversed and few unique
it's a beautiful representation of how
these algorithms are great at sorting
some initial conditions but bad at
sorting others but I want to break it
down even further let's take a look at
bubble sword helping programmers learn
how not to sort things since the 1950s
but a great representation of showing
how sorting algorithms work bubble sort
is a simple sorting algorithm that
repeatedly steps through the array
element by element comparing the current
element with the one after it swapping
their values that the former is larger
than ladder repeating again and again
until the array is finally sorted the
code works as such first it determines
the length of the array the outer for
Loop represents each iteration through
the entire array but along the way the
inner for Loop iterates over the
unsorted part of the array where the if
statement Compares adjacent elements
bubbling the larger elements all the way
to the top that's the infamous bubble
sword it has an average and worst case
time complexity of Bigos squared which
means it's not a very good choice for
sorting things insertion sort however is
a little bit better
most the time insertion sord is a simple
sorting algorithm again that builds the
final sorted array one element at a time
the code works as such the for Loop
sequentially selects each element of the
array starting at index one which is the
second element in the array for each
selected element which is key the while
loop Compares it with the elements in
the sorted section of the array so all
the elements before the current position
while key is smaller than the sorted
elements those sorted elements are
shifted to the right to make space until
the correct position for key is found
where it is then in inserted this
process repeats until each element has
been correctly placed resulting in a
sorted array like bubble sort it does
have an average in worst case time
complexity of Big O squared however its
best case time complexity is Big O
making it aine choice in situations
where the data set is nearly sorted but
a poor choice when the data set is
reversed now that we've seen some not so
great yet simple and good
representations of sorting algorithms
let's take a look at one of the more
efficient sorting algorithms merge sort
merge sort is an efficient stable and
comparison-based dividing conquer
sorting algorithm and it's recursive it
divides the input array into two halves
calls itself for the two halves
recursion sorting them and then merges
the two sorted halves the code works as
such the merge sort function checks if
the array has more than one element
since a single element is already sorted
it then splits the array into two halves
recursively the function is called for
each half once these halves are sorted
the merg function then takes these two
sorted halves and merges them into a
single sorted array this merging is done
by comparing the elements of both halves
one by one and placing this smaller
element into the new array continuing
this process until all elements are
sorted and merged merged sort has a Time
complexity of Big O of in log in in all
cases however it requires additional
space for those temporary arrays used
during the merge process which can be an
issue in memory constrained environments
whereas an algorithm like quick sort
which is almost or often times equally
as good as merge sort is an in place
sort which requires very little memory
and there are many more sorting
algorithms like selection sort shell
sort Heap Sort and so on the Sorting
algorithm you use depends on your use
case system capabilities and the
specific characteristics of the data
you're dealing with like size or whether
or not it's partially sorted already
sorting algorithms are fundamental in
computer science and are used in many
real world applications from organizing
files on a computer to arranging
database records for easy retrievable

Searching Algorithms
searching algorithms a searching
algorithm is a method or process used to
find or retrieve an element from a data
structure the goal is to find whether an
item exists in the data set and often
times to determine its location it's
akin to open in the Yellow Pages to look
for a specific phone number but you have
to do it thousands of times so you
better make sure your searching
algorithm is correct you know how much I
love these real analogies one way to do
it is via a sequential search algorithm
like linear search which is exactly what
it sounds like each element is checked
in sequence until you find what you're
looking for or the list inss and if the
current element equals what we're
looking for which is X return it the
average in worst case time complexity is
Big O of in where n is the number of
elements in the array so in other words
if the element is found in the first
index well then this is a pretty good
searching algorithm to use but if the
last index maybe not so much an interval
search like binary search would be a
more efficient approach assuming that
this is a sort of data set it works by
dividing the search interval in half
repeatedly so if we wanted to use that
analogy of the Yellow Pages in this
example which is alphabetical order so
already sorted it would be like opening
the book directly in half and based on
the name let's say it starts with a T
well you eliminate the first half then
you take the second half split that one
in half check the middle element there
and then see which side of that middle
element that it's on eliminate that half
so on and so forth until you find that
element or it's not in the list the code
works as such you start by passing in
the sorted array in the element you're
looking forward into the binary search
function initialize the left and right
boundaries to represent the current
search interval the while loop accesses
the middle of the current search
interval compares the middle element of
the array with the target value and if
they are not equal eliminates the half
of the array that doesn't contain the
target it then repeats this process on
the remaining half until you find the
Target or the array can't be divided any
further meaning the target isn't there
the time complexity of binary search is
Big O of log in in the worst and average
cases making it significantly faster
than linear search for sorted AR raay
and of course there are many other
searching algorithms like jump or
exponential or Fibonacci or you could
just use a hash tail search and just
look up the key in the hash table with
the Big O of one time complexity but you
know that's not always the case so we
got to actually discuss these other ones
because searches utilizing tasks such as
querying databases or searching for
something in your files I'm pointing to
my computer here by the way and many
other applications where quick retrieval
Graph Algorithms
is crucial graph algorithms are another
type of algorithm you should know graph
algorithms are a set of instructions
used to solve problems related to graph
Theory where data is represented as a
collection of nodes connected by edges
like trees graph algorithms are pretty
dang crucial for handling and analyzing
relationships between Elements which are
used in numerous real world applications
like computer networks social networks
and literal roadmap you know how you
type in an address in maps and get
directions or maybe you you know type it
in a map quest and print it out if
you're living in 2005 well this is an
example of a graph algorithm at work
remember the data you use graph
algorithms on is a collection of nodes
connected by edges you get to get the
nodes as intersections and the edges as
roads a rather inefficient way to go
about this would be to utilize DFS or
depth first search which I have quite a
bit of experience with but depth first
search is exactly what it sounds like
you go as deep as possible in a single
way see if it works then backtrack if it
doesn't so it basically just keeps
trying different routes at each
intersection to see if it gets to where
you need to go checking every possible
turn and road to reach your destination
not exactly the best way to go about it
but but it's recursive yes it's
recursive you can see how it works in
the code here the DFS function gets past
the graph it needs to Traverse its
starting node and nodes that it has
already visited during each recursive
call the function marks the current node
is visited then iteratively explores
each of the nodes unvisited neighbors
and if a neighbor is not visited this
process continues until all reachable
nodes from the starting point have been
visited and I would discuss the time
complexity of DFS here but it really
depends on how you go about it if the
graph is represented using adjacency
lists then this is a Time complexity but
if the graph is represented using an
adjacency Matrix this is the time
complexity however we could talk about
space complexity whereas most of the
time DFS will have a big O of V Space
complexity which v stands for vertices
otherwise known as nodes they're
interchangeable now when talking about
DFS you always got to talk about BFS
breadth first search which again is
exactly how it sounds breadth first so
expanding wide simultaneously instead of
singular depth like DFS BFS is a layer
by layer approach casting a wide net
from your starting point and gradually
widening it so basically if you're
standing in the middle of an
intersection with four options or four
roads you take all four of those rows to
their next intersection one at a time
that's the first layer and if you aren't
at your final destination at any of
these intersections or again no then you
start the next layer by checking all
remaining roads or edges at each one of
those intersections you are now at 12
nodes simultaneously and checking all
edges from there to the next nodes until
you find your destination that's all
this is it's like your kids in the back
seat are we there yet are we there yet
are we there yet we will turn this van
around
Mister he started it but instead it's
you asking yourself that at each layer
and because BFS keeps track of the paths
taken you're now able to trace back the
route taken which will be the shortest
path but only in terms of of layers
traversed yeah again not the best way to
go about it and has the same space and
time complexity of DFS as well instead
we'll use deer's algorithm this is quite
literally the algorithm that Google Maps
uses or at least a modified and enhanced
version of D algorithm which is a star
algorithm and then they also modify and
advance that algorithm in order to get
their proprietory thing that works way
better than Apple Maps all the time we
can talk about both DX's algorithm finds
the shortest path between a given node
which is called The Source node in all
other nodes in a graph not only that it
also uses the weights of the edges again
roads to find the path that minimizes
the total weight or distance between the
source node and all other nodes so in
short it takes into account the distance
and cost of each road which is akin to
considering factors like Road length
traffic conditions and speed limits to
determine the quickest route this is the
only algorithm of these three that's
actually thinking ahead recalculating
the best route as you move from node to
node and of course AAR I had to talk
about it AAR is a graft IAL and pathf
finding algorithm used in many fields of
computer science due to its completeness
optimality and optimal efficiency like
deer's algorithm a star is a
sophisticated algorithm used to find the
shortest path between point a and point
B it's broadly the same thing except it
uses a heuristic function giving
priority to nodes that are supposed to
be better than the others so estimating
the cost from the current node all the
way to the destination at every node
prioritizing nodes that are believed to
be closer to the goal making it more
efficient DX's algorithm does not have
Want more algorithm videos?
this heuristic and there are so many
more algorithms I want to discuss like
dynamic programming using the Fibonacci
sequence or the napsack problem hint
hint dynamic programming by the way is
just breaking down problems into smaller
sub problems but also hashing algorithms
to efficiently map data of any size to
data of a fixed size that is a fun one
and so many more so if you want to see
more you want me to do that just let me
know I love this stuff I'd make nothing
but these videos if I could so just if
you do like it make sure you subscribe
again leave a comment to let me know and
turn on the Bell notification so you get
notified when I upload my next algorithm
video again I'm Forest I'll see you in
the next one

Intro
how far can you push someone before they
break the Asian work ethic is notorious
for being synonymous to hard work with
things like tiger parenting academic
excellence and tutoring all being
closely tied to Asian culture in fact in
2018 Korean drama sky castle explored
these values to the extreme as it
portrayed four families obsessively
pushing their kids to study better and
harder in order to make it into one of
Korea's most prestigious universities
though this is a satirical drama the
ruthless study culture and fierce
competition portrait resonated with a
lot of its audience
competition is everywhere but in Asian
countries it is truly inescapable the
situation in China is no different and
perhaps the extreme levels of
competition in China is becoming too
much take this Tutoring company that
went viral for trying to exploit the
anxieties of parents and students with
the ad that reads if you come with tutor
and help your child if you don't come
we'll tutor and help your competitor
it's honestly horrifying and that's just
the tip of the iceberg once you make it
out of the schooling environment and
through possibly one of the hardest and
most grueling University admission exams
in the world you find yourself looking
for a job in a culture that has
normalized the 996. what is the 996 it's
where you're expected to work 12 hours
from 9am to 9 pm 6 days a week which is
insane the grueling studying routines
and the 996 work system is just a taste
of what happens as a result of intense
competition but how did this hyper
competition come to be and how is it
impacting the people to really
understand this I'm going to introduce a
word that went viral in China in 2020
and it expresses a very specific type of
Despair arising from this very situation
and that is involution
Involution, despair, and the making out game
foreign
is said to be popularized by American
Anthropologist Clifford Gertz he used
this word to describe when Society had
developed to a certain point that it
just plateaus and it isn't able to reach
a higher level in modern day China this
word is being used to describe the
experience of being locked into a
competition that one ultimately knows is
meaningless now hearing this definition
might not mean much at the moment but
there's a brilliant analogy that really
puts this into perspective yeah
foreign
in the real world this extra effort that
people make is the equivalent of the
front row just deciding to stand up in
school or in the workplace this is a
student or a colleague deciding to work
extra hard on a project then the second
row saying that first row stand up and
work hard has no choice but to stand up
and work hard themselves too if they
want to get the best marks and
effectively we've mentioned the whole
theater standing because no one wants to
be outdone so they all end up putting in
extra effort for this project or an
assignment and because they all put in
the same amount of extra effort we're
kind of back to square one involution
therefore is the result of fierce
competition between individuals but more
specifically it's a level of competition
that results in an outcome that is
unfavorable for all participants so far
it feels like the only people involved
in this situation are students or trying
to outdo each other on an essay by
writing more words or workers who hold
each other hostage by voluntarily doing
overtime but if we take a closer look
the situation is actually unfavorable
for all participants except for an
invisible third party who acts actually
profits and is the source of all of this
involution to figure out who this third
party is I would need to bring in some
economics into this video but I'll be
super quick about it and I'll keep it
under 60 seconds so hang it in there
sociologist Michael Bureau was studying
Factory workers when he noticed
something peculiar you see something
that is emphasized in traditional
Marxist theory is how labor and capital
during the production process is
mutually antagonistic in other words the
interests of the workers conflict with
the owners of capital according to Marx
this is because capitalists want to make
as much profit as possible which often
means that they would have to exploit
the labor force by paying them as little
as possible and working them as hard as
they can the workers meanwhile kind of
want to be paid fairly for what they do
and work good hours in good conditions
so their interests are very different
and because one side is always trying to
exploit the other this is essentially
why labor and capital don't get along
okay that's the basic economic theory
ty Surfshark
over and now I like to thank surfshark
for sponsoring this video honestly it's
kind of crazy because I'm currently two
foot rotary for sponsors and instances
in my life where I wish I had the
product or service if you haven't heard
about surfshark before it's an awesome
VPN service which helps keep you safe
and private as you browse online but the
best perk in my opinion is how you can
change your location to any part in the
world to one of my worst mistakes which
is going to China for three months and
forgetting to install a VPN beforehand
which meant I couldn't access anything
because of China's massive firewall if I
had surfshark back then with one click I
would have been able to change my
location and instantly access all of my
favorite sites again but I didn't so the
next best thing is to make sure none of
you repeat my tragic mistake I was also
in Japan recently and I started watching
Nano on Netflix while I was there but
now that I'm back not as not actually on
my Netflix anymore which had me kind of
stressed before I realized I could just
change my location and everything was
fine I would pick up right where I left
off which is amazing surfshark also
offers a 30-day money-back guarantee and
if you use my code only or go to the
description and click the link there you
can get 83 off and three months for free
now I just need to figure out how how to
gift my 17 year olds off this
subscription thank you surfshark for
sponsoring this video and now back to
The making out game (cont)
our man pureway we mentioned just then
how in traditional Marxist theory labor
and capital are opposed so Bureau was
just observing all these workers except
he realizes not only were they not
complaining about the system they won't
complain about the working hours the
wages their conditions or anything they
weren't resisting it at all instead they
were actually working really hard for
the capitalists so this is a real head
scratcher for bureauway and the question
that he's left asking is why are they
working so hard he came across the
answer during his field work and turned
the mechanism responsible for this than
making out game the company that Bureau
away was at employed a wage system based
off assert datum if you produced below
that data you only got the basic wage
but if you produce above datum you got a
bonus for every extra piece you produced
what's so important about this mechanism
is the fact that this system is all
based on individual labor and not
Collective labor it creates competition
between individual workers because
they're all trying to create the most
pieces they can to surpass the data
sound familiar the system did two very
crucial things first it added a bit of
spice to the workers shifts which
provided them with a sense of
satisfaction to what was otherwise a
very tedious and repetitive job secondly
and more importantly this Mutual
competition from the making out game
transformed the vertical class
antagonism or beef with the capitalists
to horizontal class antagonism AKA
rivalries with your co-workers and as
Bureau puts it once workers participate
in this making out game the third party
being the employer who led all of these
workers to compete with each other
becomes completely obscured because
instead of questioning the rules of the
game being capitalism workers would
instead enthusiastically compete in this
game to get as far ahead as they could
and this making out game could not be
more evident in modern day China the
food delivery industry exemplifies this
because of how individualistic the job
is that whole industry is all about
being fast the faster the driver
delivers the food the happier the
customer the more they like and use
their app so as you would imagine the
algorithm is scarily good at pushing the
limits of their drivers by giving them a
very tight time frame for them to
fulfill the order in since Riders get
higher ratings and rewards if they beat
the time and punishments if they're
delayed Riders end up having to go
faster and faster and honestly I think
this Obsession or Need for Speed is
going overboard like do you guys
remember all those Amazon Prime memes
because the same day delivery was
getting so out of hand with stories
about delivery drivers who don't have
time to take bathroom breaks because
that's how tight their delivery time
frame was but all that rushing cutting
Corners cutting bathroom breaks tells
the algorithm that we can shrink this
time frame even more therefore
accelerating the whole industry faster
and faster and the same thing applies
not just to speed related delivery
Industries but also to workers and
students where competition is often even
more individualistic this relentlessly
accelerating and hyper-competitive
environment is the reason why China's
youth is feeling an unprecedented level
of burnout and despair in fact the
Chinese word for involution is nature
and Hua and nadron is made up of the
characters inside and rolling which
suggests a process that cows Inward and
snaring its participants title and title
I wanted to start off by looking at the
making out game because even though
involution is characterized by
meaningless competition between
individuals it's really more of a
reflection of how China's society and
economy has developed let's keep that
perspective in the back of our minds as
we take a look at how growing up in this
hyper-competitive environment impacts
people and why China's youth are giving
up
Extreme competition and its impact on student life
thank you
the usage of the word involution and how
it took China's internet by storm
actually all starts with this one photo
here this is a photo of students from
qinghua University one of China's top
units if you made it here or Beijing
University which is just as top tier
there is no greater honor therefore
those who do make it in are without a
doubt China's best and brightest the
cream of the crop so the problem with
this picture is that we're seeing a
bunch of Ching Hua students making their
way around campus fairly normal stuff
but wait why is there this one guy on
his bike traveling to and from campus
while doing statistical modeling on his
laptop this action blew up on the
Internet because people were realizing
that even the top 0.001 of students
didn't feel like they could take a break
from studying I mean this guy literally
didn't think that he could just ride a
bike on campus to and from somewhere
without cramming in study time too and
if even the best students didn't think
they deserved a break what does that
spell for the rest of us this bike guy
was then nicknamed The involution King
but he was not the last China really
likes bargaining things into fours like
the four Great ancient Beauties or the
four classic novels in Chinese
literature so of course three more
involution Kings had to pop out these
are all still Ching Hua students by the
way so may I introduce you to guy who
sleeps and eats at the same time because
there is clearly no rest for the wicked
guy who sleeps and reads at the same
time and now I need those Chinese
captions to really elaborate because
this is the life hack I need all those
clickbait articles to actually cover and
finally guy who rides a bike and eats
instant noodles at the same time he's
just out here to flex that he can ride a
bike without using any hands oh and I
guess the secondary fact is that he's
from Ching Hua but guess what we're both
out here eating instant noodles during
uni so we're kind of the same anyways
but in all seriousness despite being
cream of the crop it seemed like even
China's best and brightest students were
still uncertain about their future and
whether they could land a good grad job
so like everyone else they felt the need
to constantly hustle and this may seem
like a few individuals just showing off
but it really sets the tone for how
intense competition is for students one
student gives the following example to
depict the despair that involution holds
say the teacher gives out an assignment
and it's an essay of 5000 words however
because students want the best marks
many of them would choose to write 8 000
or 10 000 words or even more than that
and if you know the guy next to you is
putting in that much effort you're not
going to get that Top Mark if you stick
to the original 5000 word guideline so
you start putting in more effort too in
the end everyone submits double the
advice length everyone goes above and
beyond and it's precisely because
everyone did more that we've kind of
evened out the playing field again and
the worst part is the teacher
technically didn't even ask for it this
is the type of Despair that sums up
involution forced to compete and burn
out in a process that they ultimately
know is meaningless but that is not all
the damage that is done a state of
competition like this affects not just
academics but also how students interact
with other students instead of students
being close with those in the same class
or in the same cohort as them there's
been a shift in these social dynamics as
Junior Senior Friendship are becoming
more common now and there's a few
reasons one of them is the fact that
you're not in direct competition with
each other you're not doing the same
exam competing for the same ranks and
for the same marks so there's less
threat from them and the other reason is
that those in the grade below can ask
those in the grade above for all of
their resources and notes because
they've been through all of this before
this is just one of the many
observations that Liu Shan the vice
president of the education department at
Beijing University had summarized he
spent four years talking to 200 students
as well as teachers from various other
departments and schools and the main
takeaway was that this level of
competition was changing things and
often not for the better
[Music]
one teacher who had been on the
interviewing panel for prospective
students told dorinshan that early in
the career they could still see the
unique characteristics of each applicant
however since 2015 they've become more
reluctant to attend these interviews
because it seemed like the answers to
each question had become standardized
with students or becoming a copy of each
other why had this happened well the
cost of failure is simply too big if
you're being original you're taking a
risk in trying something that has no
guarantee to work so all students end up
approaching interview questions in the
same way the teacher then comments that
in these interviews instead of students
answering questions with how they would
respond it felt like they were trying to
figure out what he was thinking instead
how can they adapt their answer to agree
with him and that he says is terrifying
this evolution of how students think or
how they're taught to think is probably
best exemplified by an interaction
between change reason and wunjabal in
the hospital the former known as the
father of China space and missile
programs and the latter being the former
premiere of China interesting
essentially says China still hasn't
fully developed a large part of this
being that no University in China has
really taught in a way that has allowed
for the next inventor in stem to emerge
this is a recurring thing when no new
Talent has appeared and it is a big
problem after he passed away in 2009
this became known as chenshiosen's
question why can't the Chinese education
system produce Innovative talent and
some important context here is that
Chang actually grew up and did his
schooling in the states so that would
have played a big role in how he saw the
Chinese education system as well as his
criticism of it change person questioned
whether Innovation was perhaps being
stifled by the Chinese education system
to be Innovative you have to be able to
take risks but does the Chinese
education system which is so focused on
your marks really allow you to do so
a department head once told joinshan
about how once they had a student with a
GPA of 3.89 apply for one of their
scholarship programs the whole panel was
really impressed with this High Mark
until they realized that this applicant
had very craftly dodged some of the
hardest subjects when they asked this
applicant why they didn't do some of the
more difficult subjects they replied
that they weren't interested but it was
clear that their interests really lay in
their GPA the department head then goes
on to say that they had to turn this
applicant away even though they had
really high marks because this wasn't
the type of behavior that they wanted to
encourage ideally students will be
challenging themselves and taking
courses that they're genuinely
interested in even if it's hard but it's
difficult to do so when Max matters so
much probably making things even harder
is knowing how much of your family's
hopes ride on your shoulders in hopes
that you do well
[Music]
a teacher has commented on how studying
no longer feels like a solo Endeavor in
China because whole families are
becoming very involved with this process
now partially this is because a lot of
parents have come out of their education
system themselves so they know where
they can step in but also because a lot
of families if they are able to will
have one parent actually quit their jobs
so they can devote their time to fully
helping that child study and so students
will naturally feel burdened by all
these expectations and the level of
sacrifice that's being made for them
which would make them reduce the amount
of risk that they take and therefore
lead to them taking courses that are
easier and they will guarantee higher
marks an example of such high
expectations from parents on their
children can be seen through this one
Forum post this poster asks my child is
four years old and they only have around
1 500 Words of English vocabulary does
that seem a bit low and the response was
that's definitely enough in America but
that's not enough for high ten district
and hydrone is a district in Beijing
where China's best two institutions
Beijing and chihua these very involved
parents not only have expectations for
what their kids academics should be like
but they also made a tier list for what
kind of hobbies children should have
based on how good it would look on your
application because God forbid Hobbies
be something you genuinely like and let
me tell you if you play a musical
instrument and it's piano bottom tier
that's dead last on the list it's okay
though we can keep each other company as
we come to understand how worthless
playing piano was and you know how we
should remodel this living room so I can
fit in this new organ that I want to
play sorry to say but that's not the
only list either there's also one for
sports don't ask me where basketball
volleyball tennis or your favorite sport
is if it's not on this list it's not
worth your attention it might as well
not exist but the fact that these lists
itself exist leads us back to how
everything kind of boils down to your
marks and how everything comes back to
doing whatever you can to guarantee your
best chance at success so this obsession
with marks filled by intense competition
really leads to more than just academic
burnout it also comes with the
consequence of these kids not really
being able to develop on their own and
finding out what their interests may be
at least with these tear lists though
it's still considering Hobbies as
something that's worth doing but there
are schools in China where their whole
Focus will be on studying and studying
only
foreign
[Music]
schools in China so much that many
parents have come out to criticize their
teaching routine due to the
semi-military style under which the
school is Run students follow a tight
schedule where each period of the day is
meticulously mapped out and if you
notice on the screen that only breaks
other than lunch and dinner are short 10
minute ones that are squeezed in between
classes oh and the days are also like 17
hours long this extreme study routine is
also accompanied by various social
restrictions like not being able to
interact too closely with the opposite
gender and if you get into our
relationship with a classmate you could
get expelled some of you may be thinking
hang on what happened to that example
where students are all going above and
beyond writing extra words on their
essay to do better and it ends up
forcing everyone to do more Hong shui
high school was that first kid who
decides to send it and they not only
write 8 000 words they write a whole
book so now that Hong Street has raised
the stakes does that mean other schools
in China have to also follow suit adapt
and Implement more brutal study routine
well interestingly no the teaching
methods of hung show high school is
actually quite controversial in China in
lower socio-economic areas there's more
authoritarian approach is accepted by
these families as the gold color is so
important that doing this maximizes the
chances of students being able to lift
themselves out of poverty however in
more wealthier areas this approach is
looked down at and is regarded as
backwards cruel and unnecessary that's
not to say that families from wealthier
areas don't play the game they still do
it just in a different way
in the TV show nothing but 30 the
protagonist is constantly seen creating
this image where she inserts herself
into different Social Circles she
sponsors this whole firework event and
she also takes out a loan to buy a
luxury apartment all this to solidify
her social status so that later when she
attends an interview at a prestigious
kindergarten it's easier for her kid to
make it in obviously this is an example
from a TV show which is often dramatized
but it is still relatable for example in
many countries where you go for primary
school is often just the school that's
closest to where you live so many
parents will actually move houses or
rent a property that's closer to a
school they know has better teachers
education is such a big part of Chinese
culture and values that the game is
often being played really before the
child even starts their enrollment and
because education is so valued and
important the government often keeps a
close eye on what is being taught and
how things are going in late 2021
because of all this pressure placed on
students there was actually a reform
implemented to reduce studying hours for
students but this also came with other
changes for one new study material was
introduced as a political Doctrine
outlining xi's Vision to strengthen the
Communist party's control was made
compulsory from primary school to
University there was a huge Crackdown on
the private tutoring industry to reduce
the cost of education and some of the
stress that came with it but this also
came with other ideological motives for
one foreign tutors are banned from
teaching kids on online platforms as
this had become a way for Chinese youth
to interact with foreigners and secondly
foreign textbooks are now barred from
primary schools and middle schools so
whilst the reform did cut study hours in
order to make student life better it
also made the student experience a lot
more insular with its increased
censorship being a student in China is
not easy and there's so much pressure
not just from competition in general but
from your parents and from yourself what
you learn and access is also very
subject to government policy but it all
comes back to this no matter how old you
are which type of City you live in or
how hard you work you can't escape the
game and worse once all that studying is
done and you enter the work for both the
competition only gets more intense let's
talk about the 996 work week and what
happens when you push your people to
their limits what does it look like to
quit the game
Lying flat and the 996 work week
foreign
six work week was named after the
expectation of working 12 hours a day
from 9am to 9 pm 6 days a week this
should sound horrifying and it is but
the reason why this system works is
because these companies know if you
can't handle the workload and you quit
there will instantly be someone to
replace you even worse you know this too
so you don't really have any say or
leverage in trying to reduce your hours
or workload one in five young Chinese
are unemployed and these people are all
usually educated and capable they just
can't find a job because of how
competitive the market has become
economists shares our phone commented on
the situation as he said it is not the
boss who makes you work overtime but it
is other people who are willing to do
overtime the 996 was able to work
because of competition and how everyone
was willing to work hard in fact we can
see this overly competitive Spirit
through this Banner here which went
viral for exposing how bad involution
had gotten the words here translate to
I'd overwork myself to death if that
meant my competitors would be left
starving that's a pretty literal
translation but they're just are still
there I'd sacrifice everything I have if
that meant I edged out the competition
no one wants to work 12 hours a day and
six days a week but they don't have a
choice Vice Asia actually did a video
covering their 996 where they
interviewed people currently going
through the system and being able to
hear from the people themselves is way
more powerful than any description I can
give you
um
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
YouTube
foreign
under the system as the notion of
involution called popularity China's
youth also saw a growing opposition
towards capitalism on this has said the
previous editor-in-chief of Harper's
Bazaar China sumang commented that she
understood involution to be the result
of young people having too many
Ambitions but being too lazy to achieve
them she then said that all your
confusion and being at a loss isn't
really that hard to solve which
disappointingly just feels like an older
generation response that we might have
heard all too much the younger
generation is talking about something
that deeply affects them and the
response that comes back is totally
disconnected and dismissive the comment
section was unsurprisingly filled with
criticism with comments like capitalists
should just shut up and if bosses
understood how the working people felt
the 996 would have never happened and
this whole involution situation might
have been avoided even Jack ma the
founder of Alibaba who was previously
adored and respected by the public is
feeling the heat all these voting
comments in the screenshot here are
either calling him a capitalist
derogatory or they're telling him to
shut up and you know what I think him
going on the record saying the 996 is a
blessing probably didn't help either as
a result of this situation the
resignation and burnout that many
Chinese youth face are being conveyed
through movements like Tom ping which
translates to lying flat compared to
everyone else constantly being caught up
in a never-ending grind lying flat is
about being anti-hustle and this term
comes from a forum post where the poster
talks about how he hasn't worked for
almost two years and he's just been
messing around and he doesn't really
feel like anything is wrong in fact the
only pressure he faces comes from people
around him who compare their lifestyle
to his and Elders who hold a more
traditional view the poster then talked
about how he can do whatever he wants
with his free time and this idea really
blew up with the disillusioned Chinese
youth who are facing a shrinking labor
market as well as greater demands to put
in more effort lying flat was a movement
so extreme in its non-action that is
starkly contrasted involution and was
able to convey that sense of
powerlessness and hopelessness that were
felt by the people Chinese youth were
now realizing that things weren't the
way it was for their parents you simply
couldn't be smarter work harder and reap
the rewards you would simply be working
harder and getting caught up in a
vicious cycle in a game where everyone
continues to raise that bar a game where
you are an unwilling but active
participant at the same time there were
numerous deaths being reported of
employees allegedly passing due to
overwork a delivery driver was reported
to have died while delivering meals for
the platform elemor which sparked
concerns sometime later on news broke
out again this time regarding the deaths
of two employees at e-commerce giant
pindwodor one of these employees
collapsed on their way back from work
later passing away at the hospital and
the other by Suicide all of these tragic
deaths stirred heated discussions over
both China's 996 work culture and the
Dark Side of working at some of China's
most acclaimed firms given the bubbling
outrage for the 996 work culture and
growing attention on the lying flat
movement the government stepped in to
reduce such brutal working hours and
they made it illegal although that
practice still very much exists today
the state's official media then
expressed concerns over the lying flat
movement and has even denounced it
saying that people who participate and
believe in it are impeding society's
growth and not just that but because of
the Aging population problem that China
is facing young people really need to
pull their weight other media Outlets
have also criticized the lying flat
Movement by saying it's the grind and
the hustle that brings happiness and if
you don't hustle in life then that's not
worth of being called a happy life then
another media Outlet called out lying
flat for being an attitude that is very
irresponsible because not only are you
letting down your parents but you're
also letting down tens of millions of
other people who are working hard oh and
the lying flat hashtag is also obviously
banned on weibor keeping workers working
is obviously a big deal for the Chinese
government because they need workers to
keep the economy going and not only that
China needs young people to work so they
remain competitive but young people are
realizing that whilst they might never
be enough and do enough they've had
Conclusion
enough it seems almost unfair to be in a
situation where the harder you work the
more hopeless Things become but that is
the reality with involution we started
this video by examining the making out
game where workers are pitted against
each other but really it is the
capitalist that profit we then saw what
involution was like for students how
everyone was forced to put in more
effort for the same amount of reward and
end up exhausted in the workplace this
constant acceleration also ramps up
filled by how Expendable labor is in the
end after running in place for so long
people are thinking of lying flat that
brings us to the end of this video and
as usual I would love to hear your
thoughts about the 996 system
competition involution or really any
part that shocked you because there were
so many things in this video that
shocked me thank you all so much for
watching make sure to subscribe if you
enjoyed and I will see you in the next
one bye

Transcription:
Introduction
hello today I would like to show you my notetaking system I recently created a video about my whole workflow on Mac OS
which is based on the terminal and neovim and in there the my not taking
was a part of that as well and a few of you have asked me some questions about the system and were curious about it so
I created this mind map to help me sort of structure my thoughts around this and
I invite you to come along for the journey as we explore this mind map
so in the middle here we have note taking and I'll tell you the the story
Notetaking
of how I got into note taking I studied at University and I used to take notes
in written journals and I I passed University just fine doing that and this
is also the time when digital uh formats came along uh where it was becoming very
established to hand in things digitally so I also had this sort of growing
collection of things that were in a Google drive somewhere but there was never really a system right everybody
has this everybody has these notes and files floating around without any system
behind it or without any sort of thought behind it then about 3 years ago I
changed my career to it I made a total switch and at the same time I got into a
phenomenon called personal knowledge management this is part of this whole productivity Niche on YouTube by the
likes of um Ali abdal and all those very interesting people and that really
inspired me to sort of build an my own system around this and to be very intentional about how I create notes and
it has given me so much benefits that I um yeah my hope is that by sharing this
this this system that I use or the way I have used this that it might Inspire others to do this as well because I as I
made this career change it was a very good moment to start taking notes because I was learning so many new
things and I had to document these things and keep them as a reference
so yeah that brings me to the point why right and and here I said the reference
it's basically because I I basically have a bad memory I I don't remember
things very well verbatim and it's very useful to me to have a sort of personal
database of knowledge that I can search search in or look look look up things
that I need and one of the big why here is this it's summarized beautifully by
Why take notes?
this quote by Thiago Forte uh is as you are looking watching
this video I assume you know who he is if you don't if you don't then I highly suggest you check him out and his book
building a second brain which is a very yeah very big part of my whole system
here but this quote says your professional success and quality of life
depend directly on your ability to manage information effectively and I totally totally agree
with this this is so so true especially if you are a knowledge worker like
myself like I'm a devops engineer I work with infrastructure as code cloud
computing programming coding all these kinds of things and this world that world is constantly
under development there's constantly new technologies coming out and it really
makes such a difference to have a system established for yourself where you can efficiently store and retrieve
information from and so this quote has been a really real guiding principle in
my own system and how how it will function in the time to
come because yeah not trying to speak highly of myself but I have managed to
completely change my career and and I I have get I've been getting very good
feedback on my my output and people really um appreciate my presence in
teams as I join them as a consultant but also other people who I greatly respect
uh techn in the technical sense like in in terms of their technical knowledge but also their personal skills uh there
are a few few very senior people out there that I respect very much and all of them have something in common and
that is a not taking system which they use extensively and and the best ones
are e also willing to share the the notes publicly um and that brings me to this
Content Creation - Blog
point of content creation so one of the wise is uh content creation I I have a
Blog and I'll show you my I'll just quickly pull it up here my blog is uh a
collection of markdown files rendered by Yugo but this is basically the public
part of my my not taking system of my zcast the notes that I take for myself
are live in a system but they are also published on the internet as well so my my zelc the the notes that I decide are
not personal and which can be of use of others are actually published on a Blog
and I'll go into that a bit later so that is one of the reasons why I let's
open the drawing again uh here we go one of the reasons why I do it because it
helps me to create content to write articles to write blog posts to create
YouTube videos and uh I do that by sort of thinking of a concept then searching
my database of notes and then Gathering relevant information being inspired by
the other notes that I have there and then this linking of notes and reading things as I go through my my my system
helps me to generate new ideas and and do creative thinking because that's all
creativity is right it's it's creating links between things and coming up with new original ideas or or links between
notes or concepts and also I take a lot of notes on um yeah on my on my life
basically I uh as I write here thoughts and feelings under the what section so I
keep a Daily Journal and I write about my feelings my thoughts
the things that I'm doing and noting down everything and I find that very
therapeutic it helps me to reflect on what's going on in my life and to
understand things better it's it's very often that I find that when I write
something down that it helps me to process something and I wrote a little article about that which is called the
power of writing on my uh channel here which you can look up if you are
interested in how I think writing is very powerful so let's just add that
straight away um here I'll do power of writing and I'll just
uh finish clean that up later I will be take adding some few
notes here and there and then um this this entire mind map will be available for download later just so you
What do I take notes on?
know so what do I take notes on well the basically
everything uh I am constantly learning new things I love learning I love
discovering new Concepts and and doing new new things and this happens in the
form of reading books listening to podcasts watching YouTube videos and every time I uh create every
time time I learn something new I will usually just write it down so that I can reference it later and sometimes I
create a new note based on the podcast right so I'll go into the the
zcas method a little bit later and how I have implemented that but
basically usually a podcast will be its own note and I just write down all sorts of all of the thoughts that are in there
and then like Concepts that I think will be useful in other notes as well I will create separate notes out of but
basically any activity where I'm consuming content or learning something uh is accompanied by taking
notes and um yeah I I I I talked about thoughts and feelings so this means that
I I keep a Daily Journal and a daily note and weekly notes and such like I'll
go into that here in the the reflection part but it also means that whenever I have an interesting idea I will just
dump it in my my system and very often I will find that these random notes somehow pop up somewhere else and then
they even though they're not useful at the time when I make them then they will become useful later so that's the whole
point right so capturing things and then somehow you through Serendipity you you
come across the notes again and then they are of U some value to you at that point and how I do it is uh yeah mostly
digitally like I said in my University years I did everything on most most
things on paper and I have also kept a written personal journal for years and
years I actually have a pretty nice handwriting and I thought it was a very nice mindful activity to sort of try to
write neatly and slowly and there are many studies about how handwriting has
benefits in remembering things um that being
Benefits of Digital Notetaking
said having notebooks has a big disadvantage in the sense that you can't
look up information quickly so it's nice to sort of read through a paper notebook
and see what you were up to in that year but if I have 20 notebooks and somewhere
there is a note about a s certain Concept in GoPro programming it takes me
a lot of time to reach that note right if I don't have some sort of system to help me do that and that's the whole
it's a huge advantage of taking digital notes is that you're able to search them and that you that they're also stored
safely so if my apartment somehow caught fire all of the notebooks that are
behind me they they will be gone I do have a project in mind to sort of scan everything and and and store everything
digitally I should really get get going on that but for now if if I if a fire
breaks out it's it's gone right and my digital stuff if you are meticulous
about your backup strategy it will be stored forever it's there forever and
the main advantage is that you can can search it so I think that's everything on the
not taking part in general and then I would like to go into the tools that I
use to take notes and my system is unique in the sense that I use both both
neovim and obsidian there are many many many tools out there and many many
strategies but um these are the ones that I use consistently and I have I found that I
can't use them I can't exclude any of either of them I need both and that's
probably going to stay like that for for forever
but I I started using notion when I started my personal Knowledge Management
journey I started using notion and it's a great tool it's accessible in the
browser you can create relational databases with your stuff and it's super useful and it was a great start on my
personal Knowledge Management Journey but the main disadvantage to me is that
it's stored with an external part that can have access to your notes and I I'm
Obsidian part 1
not that concerned that anybody is going to snoop through my daily thoughts but it is something that I I that was
bugging me and secondly you don't have your text files the your notes live in
the cloud but you are not able to manipulate these files and that is why I
completely fell in love with obsidian when I discovered it so I
obsidian I if you watching this video I assume you already know what obsidian is
but very very quickly obsidian is the is the tool that I use now here it's I'm
actually using excal draw in obsidian I'll get into that later but obsidian
basically has this concept of a vault which is a set of folders on your local
hard drive and in each folder there are markdown files in which you keep your
notes and that is why that is how I how I got really got into markdown and and
and and um obsidian as a tool because the thing is that I can have my my notes
on my drive but I can run scripts on those notes I can do other interesting
things with those files if I want to I can manipulate them exactly the way I want they are mine I can store them
wherever I want I can copy them I can back back them up the way I like so that
is the main selling point for uh obsidian for me that it uses local
markdown files and I love markdown I completely fallen in love with that way of writing and I'm never going going
back so I started an ocean then went to obsidian and then I used obsidian for a
long time uh I still I still do but in my daily work as a devops engineer this
is where I where I spend my time right in the terminal so let me I forgot to
Neovim - Why I use it
start my screen keys here so let me start casting my keys for those who like
to see what I'm doing and I'm also going to run the script that will increase the
font size a bit so it's easier for you to see but this is where I work most of
my time I do coding I am uh let's see I
I I am I can go and log into my kubernetes cluster here so I'm now
logging into my kubernetes cluster that's at home and I'll be working and write and checking out the logs and
checking out how things are going here and then in here I need to access my notes
right so all of my coding all of my work let's let's bring up some code
everything that I do happens in neovim so what you see me doing here is neovim
this is a text editor and the editor is runs in the
terminal here and this is also why I like it so much but this is a an editor
that runs in the terminal where you use your mainly use your keyboard for
navigation you don't use the mouse and and I did when I got into devops and
changed my my career to it I started out in Linux Administration current these days I work
mostly with kubernetes and Cloud native technology Microsoft Azure but then I learned about vim and
the power of editing files in the terminal right there because you can log into servers and Vim is usually always
installed everywhere so you can edit text files locally on those servers so I
got the advice to learn Vim learn it well and I fell completely in love with
it and that is what I use for my coding
for working with for working with other files that are related to my work so
then it made a lot of sense to also start using um Vim on my markdown files right
so obsidian has this like I'm now in my second brain directory and if I just
open Vim here here you will see the directory structure that I have here and
this is created by obsidian right this is what I created initially with obsidian but I found well I can also
just query my notes in neovim or from the terminal so let's say I want to find
all of the files related to kubernetes I do FD cuber and then here I see
kubernetes ch chenge devops automation project kubernetes Network debugging so here I see all of the notes that have
the word kuber in the in the file name or if I would go and grab for
function here I see all of the function that all of the files that have the word
function in them so it's very powerful for me to have these files local on my
on my PC so I can work with them from the terminal and VI is my tool of choice
there so I'll will come back to obsidian and how I use it but let's go into the
the pros of Vim so yeah like I said I'm a terminal Focus devops engineer and to
sort of prove my point like say I am debugging something in a kubernetes
cluster right and then I I am writing some code in this window and then I I
think oh I should write a uh go program for this kind of thing so let me review
my notes on go functions so I'm I'm in this directory here I will create a new
directory let's say call it go test here and I'm in this directory then I switch
to a new window I open Vim search my files and do go and then here I see oh
go Loops that was what I needed or maybe I want go functions and here I have my
notes on vartic functions in go so I'm reading through this note and then let's see is there any code example
here yeah here's a here's a code example here I yank it I switch back to my file
here I add a new file test. go and I paste it in
Tada so this is why it's so powerful to have these notes I don't have to bring
my hand to my mouse and switch window open up obsidian and sort of start
clicking around and so some like that so let's say I am uh now finished with this
file and then I'm going to go into another directory and create a bicep
test directory I'm just improvising here but let's say I want to create a bicep
file and I remember oh I had this bicep course the other day and then I go to my
Vim I do bicep and here I have advanced bicep and here I see a Target scope
subscription a SN nippet that I like I go back to my file and I open the file
bicep do uh test and here I open it and paste and boom I have my code in here so
this is why it's so powerful and I didn't lift my hands I was doing
everything from the from the keyboard here and that is why I need Vim in my
not taking system it is so incredibly efficient to
learn this well to be able to learn this well and to access your information
quickly being able to do this from the command line like this switching between
Windows copying and pasting and without any lag let's say I'm debugging these
logs I see these logs I want to uh copy this and now I'll just use the mouse to
select this and then I go back to my notes and then I can write um uh
noticed these mistakes in the log logs and then here I paste them in and you
see how how how useful this is I can or if I'm noting or writing something here
and I open up my K9s again I can have my thing here and then I can describe
describe my pod and then I can write about what I see here like the IP IP is
this and that the the labels labels are
configured this way and having this information so easily accessible without having to use the
mouse is just incredibly useful and it has increased my productivity a
thousandfold so uh enough about that I think I think
I brought the point across how efficient it is to learn how to do this well so
Tmux
and here I also got into the t-o thing that I was um I already showed that so
this what I was doing switching between these windows and if you are interested
in this look up the video about my workflow on Mac OS but I can switch between Windows I can create new windows
I can have information available in several windows I can split this one and
uh this is why this is all done by t-mo so tmox is a way a terminal multiplexer
which helps me to create screens or p uh windows or panes that I can switch
between and copy information between if I need to next I have a telescope so what you
Telescope
saw me doing in Vim here I have a shortcut I do space FF and now I'm able
to search the file names for things so I have I have some file name conventions
but usually my files are are my file names are representative of the
the uh contents so let's say I have I want to do something about running well
I here I have a note about running my first 10K I have so notes about running
form and this is why telescope is so powerful because I can see these notes
first of all it's a fuzzy finder so if I do Ry then it will find running see if I
do fun function then it without the u it will still search functions so it is a
uh fuzzy finder so let's go back to the running example well now I'm scrolling
through these and I have this preview window on the right so here I have a
longer uh longer note and I can um
scroll the the the preview here as well by pressing control D and control U so
this is so incredibly powerful to quickly look up information because this
is based on file names but you can also ba base it on the contents of the node
which uses grap so space SG and now I can start looking for function and here
I see function I see all of the notes that are that contain the word function
in it or let's do another search for um base training right so here I
have all the all the notes that have the word Bas training in it and I if I find
this note I can scroll up and down in it so this is why it's so incredibly
incredibly useful to have telescope in my workflow because searching in
obsidian is fine so let's say what it would look like if I'm in
obsidian here I can search based on on file names so that would work right
that's also a fuzzy finder but you can also search based on the contents so base
training this also works well but I I have to use my mouse right I'm clicking
around it's this very small screen it's not very efficient I have to sort of
look into move my head and even though it would get the job done it is much
much much much more efficient to do it this way just opening up running and then checking this out and scrolling up
and down so it's incredibly incred it's like magnitudes of it's an order of
magnitudes that it's um efficient more efficient so I I that's why I use Vim
basically in and specifically teles scope um another thing that Vim that I
UNIX Filters & Scripts
can use in Vim is UNIX filters and scripts so a Unix filter is a command
that that takes input and outputs something so one example that I have is
Let's uh let's do a um temp video test.
markdown here I am writing a new markdown file hello world and let's say
I have written some stuff here and now I want to uh have a title so this is going to
be a very long title I can type it like this I can do bang bang and pipe it to
the program title and it converts it to title case so the title command if I do
which title is a by go program that I wrote a
very simple go program can I can I find that very quickly
uh can I just uh uh
go no GitHub [Music]
Misha yeah here we go so title. go here is a very
very simple go program it's called has a function it takes a string and then it
takes the string and does the title built-in function on that string and
then it prints it out again so this is very very useful to sort of basically be
able to pipe what's called you take the the words that are on this line and then
with the Vim command this you can pipe it to the title command and then it
will it will return the the the the values that you want so you can write
all these programs and they can act as Standalone programs as you're working on
the terminal but you can also use them from within Vim another thing that I have is the space d command that inserts
the the the date in a certain format now obsidian has 10 pler and it has all
sorts of hot keys that you can do those things with but here I can just use
things like go and Bash and things that I do that I use for work I have this dot
files uh repo with tons of scripts in them these are all scripts that I
regularly use and these scripts I can either like run them here from the
command line or I can call them from within Vim to help me with my text editing so that's another very useful
functionality that you can use with vim and yeah finally something that I didn't put
here which I maybe should uh or scripts maybe
scripts should be its own text um field here
scripts because I'll show you I spoke about that I keep daily not not well when you open
I have obsidian configured that when I open obsidian it will open up the daily note so if I but I also have a hotkey
that's command T where it opens up the daily note so this is the place where I will be writing down today I had a
pretty good day at work so this is how how a typical
obsidian user would use daily notes and it works fine however sometimes I am
working in the command line and I just want want to quickly write something down so then I have a script that's
called day and here we have the same file opened up in Vim right today I had
a pretty good day at work you see that's what I just wrote so let's add some
text and gone and I can go back to my work so sometimes I will have a thought that I want to do or like remember to
take out the laundry and then later when I sit down
to write my diary then I will see that file again I think oh yeah wait I noted down I need to take out the take out the
laundry so this this day command that you see me using that's actually just a
script in my scripts Library it looks like this and here I format the A and it
just opens a file with a sort of template that I created and it opens the
file in Vim so it's ready for me to edit if it's not there it will create a new one but this is how you can sort of
Publishing a blog post in under a minute
extend your not taking system and build custom commands and make it do things
the way you want I have this other command that's called blog Z and then it
enters a file name test for video and here it creates a markdown
file in my blog repo and now it's ready for me to write a blog po post so let's
see a test title for my blog post and then I can pipe this to title
because I want it as a title right so that's what I showed you here tags hello
and then this is my blog post then I can write it down I do blog reset
and it will build my new blog and it will show it here as Local Host and here
you can see the the block that I just wrote right so you can build these
scripts for yourself and build a workflow around your notetaking system
this is how I'm sort of merging those two together and this is something that I think you can most efficiently do when
you first of all know the command line and and know these kinds of things know bash scripting but also if you're used
to editing text files with Vim because I
I maybe it's possible but to write a bash script that creates a file somewhere and has you ready to edit it
at the right as quickly as I did and then have it open in obsidian I don't know if it can be done and if it can be
done I I don't think it will be as efficient as this so I think that's enough of why Vim
Obsidian part 2
is um hugely efficient in my note taking now let's uh go go back to obsidian
here and let's talk about why I still use obsidian because if my Vim system is
so damn efficient like what do why do I need obsidian for right well obsidian
has so has some functionality which is so incredibly useful and Powerful that I
I will probably never never leave obsidian ever again even so I I that's
the the thing about my notes system I keep keep them compatible with each other I want to always make sure I can
use them but I want also want to make sure that my system is always compatible with obsidian and the main reason for that is
the visual aspect of obsidian so one thing I cannot do in my Vim notes so if
I'm editing my daily note oh oops here if I'm editing my
daily note I cannot just paste in an image here image this is this is the
terminal you can't work with images here that's just that's just simple as that
however if I am going back to my daily note and I'm writing something here and
let's say I come across a very interesting thing on the internet or a nice picture and I want to save this I
can just take a screenshot here go back to obsidian and paste it in like that's
not ever going to work in in vim and now this image is here but if I go back to
vim and open my daily note I won't see the
image I see the reference to the image but I won't see the image so obsidian has the ability to be able
to render images like this but also just to paste them in which is really handy
if you are creating if you're writing notes on something and you want to
capture visual information from tutorials and things like that then you can just paste them in right
there another um let's see another very important part
of the visual side of things in obsidian is the graph so here you have the graph
view the every dot on this graph represents a note in my not taking
system and I think it's very powerful to see that sometimes you get this sort of
cluster of notes right like I some of them I intentionally color yellow by
using a tag but because I know that it's an important thing but sometimes I'm in my
my thing in my view here and then I see well what is this here this is a
something that doesn't have the color but apparently it's something that I am uh connecting a lot of notes to right so
here is the one called writing well because it shows shows up as a thicker dot here it means that I'm creating a
lot of links to these notes and these notes apparently writing is a very
important thing in my life and yes it is um well let's check out the
connections to writing well it is connected to these big dots here here's a note on my iy guy and flow I'm not
going to open that because it contains um a few very personal things that's the
danger of making videos on your second brain or your your uh not taking system
but here's another one like coding right this is a very important part of my notetaking system which contains all
sorts of notes then when I open the coding I can
do uh open local graph and here I see all of the notes that are related to my
coding right so I have a note on Lua learn go functions bicep SDK and if I go
to bicep then bicep is linked to all sorts of other notes I can go bicep
random strings so here's an article that I wrote about bicep strings I go back to
coding and I see oh function oh oh wait here's that note on go reading standing
from Reading from a standard input output right so this graph view is very
useful in the sense of discovering new links show and and it's just just so
cool to see your your your whole collection of notes living like a uh
visual representation like this it also shows me notes that are orphans that don't have links yet so sometimes I'll
go through and just check out oh this way this this note that doesn't have any
links maybe I should link it to something here's another one about pod disruption budget
well maybe this note should have a link to kubernetes because it's a related to
kubernetes right and now it won't show up as an orphan anymore so it's a very nice thing to sort of interact with your
with your nodes like this and and your Vault so that's the
other um oh let's see where is the
drawing here back to the drawing so that's another very important thing of the visual part and there's exol draw so
that's what I'm using right now here it's so powerful that this is now integrated into obsidian because like
I'm doing here you can create notes uh you can create links to the notes and
they live in the drawing like this I can embed notes so I have
this uh let's embed do I have something about settle cast no I don't have any
topic notes on that uh writing well let's do let's embed this writing Noe
here right so here we see I I have this other note living in My Vault somewhere
but now I've embedded it here in in excal draw so excal draw itself is a separate tool but now it's integrated
into obsidian it I'm able to sort of combine things and represent them in a
visual way and that is something I'm exploring more and more recently and
it's uh yeah this this whole mind map is a is a an example of this right I a few
years ago I came across the book by Tony buan buzan buzan about uh mind mapping
and how coloring and and drawing things is very um beneficial to thinking
processes and then I also learned how to draw I'm a horrible horrible drawer as
you see here but it still helps with the creative process right so I work through
this book um drawing with the left on the left side of the brain it goes into how
drawing lights up certain parts of your brain how they are uh helpful in the thinking process and even when I
prepared this video I just start with this concept and I add pretty colors and you sort of organically start to create
these things that help they really help me to think so I'm um I'm I'm going to
be exploring this more in my in my not taking setup and uh as I'm also becoming
more established as a Creator I'm thinking this can be a very useful tool for me to create new things and to help
me in my thinking process uh obsidian also has a lot of
plugins so what one of the plugins that I use a lot is the Kindle plugin the K
obsidian Kindle you can just add your my clippings file and now I have all of my
uh let's do Sumo here now I have all of the highlights that I made in my Kindle
book about this is a book aan Sumo it's a Budd Buddhist teacher it book is
called direct realization and at some point I made the highlight letting go is
therefore being able to bear with something unpleasant and not be caught up in anger and aversion this passion is
not depression it's a very beautiful quote and the power of having this in my
second brain is that if I'm searching for things so here is depression so say
this might be a very risky thing to search for but if I search for depression then here I get all of the
notes that are are depression but also the highlights that I made in the books
you see here you see the directory name it's called the Kindle highlights and here you have the all of the highlights
that I made about depression so you see
how this all starts come to come together to have all of the information in one place well that's the that's why
I used the Kindle uh plugin to sync in all of the
highlights from my Kindle another one is Anki Anki is a a uh
program to create flashcards and to do um what's it called space repetition for
when I'm studying for exams and certifications and things like that but then from here I'm I'm able to create
flashcards from my notes I think if I can
quickly uh is there an example here um is there a quick
example 104 networking
uh yeah here the these are this um
notation Nic double quote double quote network interface controller this means
the front of the flash card is NI and the back is network interface controller so this creates flashcards from text and
it's very useful because you just run the plugin and then it creates flashcards which you can use in uny and
then use space repetition for study so that's a very useful thing and yeah the
thing with obsidian is it basically has infinite possibilities with all the the plugins that you can can make some
people have created these hugely intricate things with data View and i' I used that a little bit myself too but
yeah there's just so much extensibility to obsidian so much things you can do and that's a very big Plus in
obsidian one other reason that I I I always uh will keep using obsidian
probably is the mobile AIS so it's great that I can work very efficiently from
the terminal like this but in order to do that I need to be sitting behind the computer that is able to pull in these
files and to uh run run a terminal like this I don't have that when I'm in the
mountains and walking around and I want to create a note or I want to share something that I meet then here we
always carry these things around these days I can open up obsidian on my
phone and uh it's loading now but it I open up obsidian and I have my entire
note collection available to me from my phone if I'm sitting on the bus and I want to look up something as I'm writing
in a journal or something then I can I have it all here I can write notes I can
continue working on a document that I'm writing I can all I have my entire
collection sitting in my pocket at all times and that's incredibly powerful and
that's something that's not very easily achieved if you only use Vim or not use a tool like
obsidian and in order to achieve that I use iCloud sync so I'm very heavily
entrenched in the Apple ecosystem and I I use a Macbook I have
an pad I have a iPhone and before I was running most mostly on Linux and windows
and I that's one of the problems that I had that it was become becoming quite
difficult to share my my entire not taking system in between systems I have
since discovered the plugin obsidian git so I my entire system is synchronized to
a gate repository it is currently in GitHub but
that's something that I am not very happy with like I trust Microsoft but in
a way it's not not a very nice feeling to know that everything is there so I'm now considering having my own selfhosted
git instance in my home lab and then create compressed encrypted files that I
will then back up to git or somewhere else but uh obsidian git is is a way of
synchronizing your not taking system in between operating systems if you don't
want to use iCloud sync but with iCloud sync I'm able to do that and of course
there is the obsidian sync service which costs money and I had that for about a
year mostly because I I was using Linux and windows and had to sync across these
things but also because I wanted to support the obsidian project because it
just uh adds so much value to my life this is isn't it amazing that this tool
is just entirely free so yeah obsidian sync it works
great it's all encrypted end to endend so give that a shot if you uh are not into the Apple
ecosystem so talked about visual right the thing is uh I I recently bought an
iPad and it comes with this pencil and then you can draw so I have this open sometimes and then I will draw or write
and I'm I'm just having a lot of fun with it these days so I just had had this little
funny drawing where I'm sort of create trying to symbolize a guy thinking very
hard and the gears are running uh moving around right I drew this by hand and
then I do a bit of writing and it it it makes everything become very alive and
and it it activates other parts of the brain and I think this is helping me to
think um in in in new cre creative ways so um on the bottom side of my mind
Reflection
map here is zcast and reflection well reflection is
basically um the function one of the functions of my not taking system so yes I take a lot
of technical notes and and and Technical topics when I'm learning something I will create a note but also there is um
this part reflection journaling like I showed you on the daily notes but also periodic notes I have a template of
weekly notes here and here there are goals and
I will set intentions for the week and then when the week is over then I will
go through and how how did it go with my intentions uh what are the most significant things that happened in my
week and then I will uh note things things down how am I going with my goals
are there any tasks lingering did I make any purchases that I regret so this is a very useful tool for reflection and I
have done this very consistently for about a year and there was this point where I I started seeing notes from last
year in my searches and that was a very powerful uh thing to see these notes
from a year ago and what I was doing then now recently I've had a period
where I wasn't doing it and filling out these weekly notes started to feel like
a chore um so then I had a break from it but then I started noticing no I kind of
want this again I I it's a very nice way of checking in with yourself same for
daily journaling I I had a phase recently of about a couple of months where I wasn't doing it and I started
really missing it so now I'm I'm really back in the habit and I'm doing it a lot and that's the great thing about it
right a not taking system is something that evolves with you as a person and
How I Organize my Notes
your needs and you can try things out and then you'll think well I don't
actually maybe I did this and I found out that I don't really need that in my life anymore but in my case I found out
well I I do need it and I I I like to do it so that is uh a fun that's a uh thing
of reflection that I that I have in my notes taking system and there is project
management so I'll get into it in the next section um that will go into the
I've talked a lot about the tools and the why and and how I take
notes well what I take notes on but now let's go into how I organize my notes
and how I organize the my my note taking system so like many of you in this space
I I have read the book um how to take smart notes by sunka Ain which
introduced me to the zcast method and that is that changed my life basically
reading about him is such was such an experience about Nicholas Lumen and I
wrote an article about my neovim zelc here it's on my website which will go
into more depth into yeah why I take notes what I take notes on but how I've
implemented this um specifically with all the tech you can read about it too
so I will paste that in my thing here as well and then it should
be on the on the drawing as I export it
later but this um a zcas is just a place
where you collect the notes and then you link them with unique identifiers so I I have currently have
this uh approach to my notes as well I have this one large let's show it in
obsidian I have a few folders I I do have a few folders
still but most of my notes live like here you see how often I use obsidian in
in the graphical sense which is not very often here here here I have this
zcast um folder or directory and that contains the majority of my notes Here
on the left so you you I yes if you don't know what
a zel Casten is look into it it's a system of collecting notes and linking them and the main thing is that you
don't have a lot of folder structures where you keep these notes they they just live in this one big thing and then
you bring them together as you need them and the the structure that I have chosen
PARA - Tiago Forte
for my not taking system apart from the zcast is the the para structure by
Thiago Forte and this he Advocates a well let's
open it up in Vim because I think that will be a bit easier to see
so here I have my second brain open and Thiago Forte has this para p a
a structure so projects areas resources and archive and I adopted this structure
and even though I have a zel Casten that contains most of my notes I still find quite a bit of value in this directory
structure so my my system is basically a mixture between obsidian and Vim and
then mixing zel Casten with the para method so the projects contain projects
that I'm doing so now I I have a project of revising my personal knowledge system I'll get into that later but I have a
project of the home lab which contains all of the notes that were related to my home lab and then when I am finished
with a project then I will either move it somewhere else and or move it to the
archive so most of my notes are being put into the zle Casten but I find it
quite useful to have them like when I'm doing a project to put my notes in a
separate project folder areas are the things that you are
responsible for in the long on the long term so here I have a few areas of interest and responsibility like my tech
blog and my YouTube channel f ort is my current customer so I'll keep all of the
notes that are for my customer there uh food is a large interest that I and
health so here are all the notes related to my health and yeah let's it's just
Rings reps and hypertrophy notes on sugar uh vegan protein right I just uh
like when I'm when I am categorizing my notes then sometimes I think it's useful
to put it in here even though I I most I hardly ever sort of go into the heal
folder and and look and what what notes do I have in my health folder but I
think somehow it will help someday to have them collected like this and there's just this mental thing of having
it having it in a folder like that next there's resources these are just you
know areas of interest that you just put in notes like that and collect them this
way and the archive contains the archive of all of your notes so when I'm done
with a project I generally will move it to resources or uh the archive or now my
home lab is actually turning into a long-term responsibility ability so that will very likely be moved to
areas I also have the inbox uh folder and that is a very useful thing so when
I I have this command that's called zet then it will ask me for a file name and
then I'll do video demo hello and it creates this note and it will be located
if I do PWD I am now in my users Misha second
brain inbox directory so it will create a note in the Inbox and then
hello for the video video hello
world so you have this this note here now and if I then open a new window and
go to my inbox there will be a video demo hello and here is the VD the note
here so as I'm going along in during the today I will make a lot of these zet
entries so every time I have an interesting thought or an interesting thing that I want to capture I'll just
Inbox and note review
do Z my random thought and then random
thought and today I was thinking that it will will be very nice to get go out
camping in the spring again I don't know I won't generally capture thoughts like
this but I might you know so I I capture them like this and they are all collected in the inbox
folder uh here there will be here my random thought and then in obsidian
usually once a week I will go through my inbox folder like this and I have a few
uh keyboard commands using a plugin so command Y and then I open the Inbox and
then I will go Untitled or this can be deleted so I will do delete file then I
open the Inbox again and go to uh video demo hello and I think okay this is a
one for my YouTube channel folder so then I'll move it in there and that's
that's a nice process because it go I go through the inbox like that and
then when I do I sort of have to look at my notes and evaluate if I still want to
keep them in my system so sometimes I keep some notes and then I I I write them on the Fly and then I think well I
don't really need that in my in my system at all anymore there's this very
good quote well let's do a demonstration of my do I have a curator here we go um
this is another Showcase of how effective my system is right I I knew there was a quote that contained the
word curator I do a quick search and here I have the the quote we need to adopt the perspective of a curator
stepping back from the Raging River and starting to make intentional decisions about information we want to fill our
minds well this is not exactly the one that I want but here is um like a
scientist capturing only the rarest butterflies to take back to the lab our goal should be to capture only the ideas
and insights we think are truly not worthy so not surprisingly this is from
the book building a second brain by Thiago Forte but this was actually a really nice example of why my system is so efficient
and that I can quickly search up things if I want to um but the point I wanted to make is
that I have this inbox I once a week I go through it and then it forces me to think about these notes like do I really
want them in there or not and then I will either usually they go to straight to the zelc and directory and now it's
moved I press contrl m z and it's in my zcas directory or I will delete the file by typing it
and now it's gone so there is this uh that's the uh
Atomic Notes
element of my um folder structure with the inbox the zel cast that contains
most of the notes and then there are a few folders that are still helping me to have some sort of structure I am now
revising this I am I don't really want to use para anymore but I do think that
this projects folder is going to stay because it really helps me um not to
take on too many projects at the same time I I should pray be I should usually
limit myself to three projects at the most and if I have certainly six uh
folders in my projects folder then I know that I'm getting a bit too ambitious and maybe I should few put a
few things on hold so it does help me reflect in that way and I like the fact to have sort of separate things where I
can store things that are related to my interests um that are longer term even
though I don't usually go in and and look at the notes in that folder it does help me somehow to yeah have an
organized feeling about things [Music]
um I have talked about the directory structure para Atomic notes so I I was
into this a little bit briefly I I take small notes on with that contain topics
sometimes I take longer notes like this bicep Advan this is like a course that I
did which is a sort of longer notes that will contain all of the things that are
based from that module but if there is a an interesting Concept in here that is
useful that I think I will use in other notes or that can be useful to be linked to other notes then I will create a more
Atomic notes for example um what did I did one on persistent volume
persistent storage here uh PVC here here I created a note
that has some thoughts about persistent volumes and reclaim policies and I think this can be useful to embed somewhere
for example or to when I'm writing a an article about kubernetes storage then I
I can link this to that storage and then it will come up as I'm right and in a creative process so mostly I try to
create small notes like on sugar or on vegan protein and I there are smaller
notes that I can link together but sometimes I have bigger notes as well so I'm not a zcast and purist in that sense
that I I do keep longer notes as well and as I went into a bit
earlier a large part of my zcast is actually published as a Blog um here you
have this directory I have my Z Casten directory with my my personal zelc but
in the zcast there is a zet directory and that is actually the part that is published on my website as a um uh
public zcast but the great thing is that here we have this note news Bo in Zen
mode for example this is a note or yeah a note on my public slecting but if I am
in my daily note and I want to link to my news boat in Zen mode it I can still
link to that right I can even embed it uh if I want to and now my note is
embedded in my daily note if I somehow wanted that so this is stuff that is published on my blog but I can still
reference it in my personal zle cast as well
[Music] um all right we're getting close to the end now I have spoken about blog Atomic
notes and yeah one last thing the the zel Casten has this very um the original
method has this way of of identifying noes and with unique
identifiers I do use unique identifiers because if we look here you will have this link section that has this number
so every node is that I create has automatic generated this um this
identifier which I can use to link somehow reference it later if I want to
but my main identifiers are my file names and if you look at the for example
the zel Casten of rwx Rob you will see that all of his file
names are actually numbers and then if he want if he references other zedal
then he will reference that that number well I think it's much easier to much more user friendly to have my file names
my files with an actual file name that I can recognize the only thing is that it
has to be unique but I find that it's actually very easy to just come up with unique file names and I rarely run into
file names that are duplicates if not I will just add a number or another word
and it's not a problem for me to sort of have unique file names all the time so I
I I I I use file names as identifiers in my current
setup and I don't use tags uh in my my
zelc I I do use them on my blog so here
on my blog I have tags and if I go to celium then if you go to the Post here
then you will see tag celium and actually because I do that and because
this is embedded in my zle Casten then in my obsidian repo then in My
Outro and Final Reflections
Vault uh if I go here and I will actually see the celium tag here yeah
here here it shows up as celium right so here I will see all the notes that are related to the celium tag so even though
I don't actively use them I do use them on my website and I did use them in the beginning a bit but I in terms of
retrieving information or linking information I don't currently use tags in my uh in my workflow but that might
be subject to change and that is about it on on the
zle cast um part of things so that means we have gone through the entire mind map
now I've spoken about why I take notes and what I take notes on I've spoken
about the pros of obsidian the pros of vim and how I use those and what I use
my notes taking system for and
um it is not a coincidence that I'm making this video now um I'm about to
start make taking more visual notes in obsidian like I was talking about and this mind map is also a testimony to
that and I want to uh I wanted to with this video capture way I've been doing things
so far so the way I have uh I've been doing it like this
for I would say well over a year that I started implementing par and and use
that as a methodology for my my not taking system Thiago for's method is
extremely useful it has really helped me to uh think about my note taking system
more intentionally Al and having this directory structure still helps me so I might not get rid of it at all we'll see
what happens but I am at this point where it's starting to itch and that I'm
uh um discovering new things I I'm now using excal brain more I discovered Z's
vers personal Knowledge Management Channel on YouTube he has this amazing
content about visual note taking and and implementing more visual things in your
in your not taking and I feel that I'm at a point of change in my my note
taking system so that's why I wanted to capture it here because I had been
wanting to make this video for a very long time and now that I have my good audio setup here I feel that the time
had come and that I felt ready to do it and yeah my conclusion is uh I will
probably always keep using both vim and obsidian each has their strength
strengths and they both have great functionality and they are uh both super
super important to me I interact with them with for hours hours a day every
single day and I I don't think I will use any other tools than vim and
obsidian but you never know but I do as uh even though my workflow has been
mostly text based for up until now most mostly just markdown files and and
noting things down in text form I'm now going to explore um having more visual
things and also the the excal brain plugin if I open my kubernetes note here
and then there is this excal brain excal
brain here and here you will see all of these um relations in excal brain and
and then you can start you can start giving names to these links and yeah check out Z's
personal Knowledge Management Channel because it's he he has gone really deep into it he's actually developer of this
plug-in and the the exol dra plugin so I'm very excited to enter this new era
of my not taking system and employing or uh or utilizing visual not taking more
in my system as well and and um yeah I'm curious to see what that is going to bring me so to finish off let's uh take
a look at some stats down in the bottom right corner which you cannot now you
could maybe see it uh it says here my my entire system is 167 megabytes large it
contains 1860 notes and 347
attachments 2,27 files and
3,833 links and in total 563,000 words
so with those stats I think I uh will close this video thank you so much for
watching I hope this was uh useful to you maybe it will inspire you to set up your own notetaking system if you have
any questions about how I did anything please just ask them in the comment I tend to reply to any comments on my on
my Tech related content and um it's nice for me to interact and to see interest
in my system if anybody wants to know more about it and um yeah if you are
looking into this just start don't try to don't watch thousands of videos and
then get going download obsidian create a folder and start taking notes that's the most
important thing and then the organization will come later as it did for me and remember remember that this
is a continuously evolving process it it it will always um like me I I'm now
revising things again and it will always be subject to change but um get going as
soon as possible because my not taking system is one of the most important assets that I have in my both my
professional but also my personal life all right thank you so much for watching have a good day and uh see you
in the next video

better might mess up my show and then I have to figure out how to be a magic singing ventriloquist or
[Laughter] whatever let's just say we're not
getting a puppet on that thing oh my God have you ever ever been to a bank
right cuz I'm not really happy with the customer services that we get at Banks nowadays right have you ever gone into a bank you've seen four available Windows
four but there's only one person working then you get the woman that works there who walks past the queue and
says don't worry she won't be long go and help her why are you out here you get to the
cashier because it's your turn right they've now given the cashiers microphones yeah so everybody can hear
your financial situation I'm right here I can hear you right and
I'm already embarrassed about the amount that I need so I was discreet right I was like can I get 150
please that was't enough for her she had to talk into the mic and get into my business sorry sir you need a pound to
keep the account open I'm like why are you shouting but I told you I needed the
rest of what was in my account so I said to her please can I get that 50 p she said to me how' you want that I was
like in silence it's very hard of me growing up he used to call me a huge
waste you see both of my parents wanted me to become a lawyer never even came close to becoming a lawyer but I was
once involved in a suit but I've since traveled the world
went to Spain fell madly in love with a Spanish
sundress and we broke up and I
pantalones yeah I love him but I'm happily married

ply it's polyester our daughter
Capri brought home a pair of sweatpants hey I want to be a supportive
father but I want to see her date someone iron with a crease this guy looked like he'd
been donated she asked if he could spend the night I said in my house you'll sleep in
separate drawers when I realized I'd never be able to talk again I was
speechless I have lived in Newcastle all my life yes but for some reason I still
haven't picked up the accent
I can see that some of you are trying to figure out where you know me
from maybe it would help if I started saying phrases such as the next train to
arrive on black is the 12 52 Serv
King and from my time at the post office please go to cashier number
some of my charts I can't explain whether they're true I just know from experience this is what's going to happen here's the locker room at my gym
I am the blue dot I walk in I start to get changed the minute I get all my clothes off 12 guys walk in and this is
where their lockers are that is so
true it defies statistics sometimes statistics sounds scary but it's not when you look at it from a different
angle when I first got married I 44% of marriages end in divorced that's a scary number think about that 4 my wife and I
like do we stand a chance think of the other side if 44% of marriages end in divorce you know what that means 56% of
marriages end in death till death to us part those are
the two ways that marriages end folks if if you're married enjoy it now
it does not end well hi Simon um you are my family's
favorite judge believe it or not um but if you had to choose between your America's Got Talent judging panel or

*Thundery Noises*
*Four chords played*
Recognize this?
Yeah, that's "Don't Stop Believing" by Journey
--And the cast of Glee!
Yeah there's a few more songs with the same chords
Check it out:
My life is brilliant
My love is pure
I saw an angel
of that I'm sure
People killin' people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
Would you turn the other cheek
Forever young
I wanna be forever young
I won't hesitate
No more, no more
It cannot wait
I'm your.....
Lipstick stains...
On the front lobe of my left side brains
I knew i wouldn't forget you
If I could, then I would.
I'd go wherever you will go.
(and) Can you feel the love tonight?
Nobody wants to see us together,
but it don't matter, no
Cause I can't live
Oh country road, take me home
To the place where I belong
I'm your biggest fan,
I'll follow you until you love me.
Papa- Paparazzi
Well I can't live,
With or without you.
Pictures of you.
Pictures of me.
Hung upon your wall
For the world to see
And she will be loved
Yeah she will be loved.
*coughs*
When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
No woman no cry.
(Yeah momma this surely is a dream)
I come from a land down under
Red, white and blue,
Funny things you do
America, America
This is you
They say that
Taylor was a good girl
Never wanna be late.
Complain, express ideas
In her brain
I need some love like I've never needed love before
I'm gonna make love to your baby.
Take on me (When I come around)
Take me on (when I come around)
I'll be gone
In a day or two!
(Save tonight)
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you (and fight the break of dawn)
(Come tomorrow) There's nothing that a hundred men or more could
ever do (If I were a boy)
Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces. Can't deny it, can't pretend, just (I think I would understand)
thought you were the one
In my head
I see you all over me
In my head
You fulfill my fantasy
(In My Head)
Despite all my rage I'm still just a rat in a cage.
What if God was one of us?
Tell me why'd you have to go make things so complicated
See the way you're acting like somebody
I know she's playing with me
Well that's okay cause I got no self esteem
With a thousand eyes and a good disguise
Hit 'em right between the eyes,
Hit 'em right between the eyes
You're so beautiful
So damn beautiful
It's too late to 'pologise
Too late
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
That's alright because I like the way it hurts
It's my life
It's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
Can't read my- can't read my
No he can't read my
Poker face (Come on Barbie, let's go party)
How long- how long will I slide?
(Separate my) Double rainbow all the way across the sky
Yeah yeah so intense
Enjoy yourself
Take only what you need from it.
A family of trees wanting
Time to say goodbye (veduto e vissuto cante)
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
and never brought to mind.
I'm more than a bird! I'm more than a plane!
I'm a birdplane.
A motherfuckin' birdplane
Doesn't that sound familiar?
Doesn't that hit too close to home?
Doesn't that make you shiver;
the way that things have gone?
And doesn't that seem peculiar?
'Cause everyone wants a little more.
It's something I do remember;
to never go this far
That's all it takes to be a star

The medley includes a diverse array of songs across different genres and time periods, illustrating the versatility of the chord progression. Throughout the performance, the artists interject with humorous remarks and coughs, adding a lighthearted touch to the presentation. The video concludes with a self-aware commentary on the nature of pop music and the formulaic tendencies that can lead to widespread appeal. The performers then promote their new album, "Animal Vehicle," and encourage viewers to engage with them through social media and live shows, with a final humorous introduction of a member named Benny, followed by the four chords played once more.

A rundown of the Glove80 and why it is my favorite keyboard. We cover all of the main features, and take a look at some of the switch, keycap and mounting accessory options that MoErgo offers. Shop Glove80

Intro
okay I'm not actually on a beach that's
a green screen but the keyboard is
attached to my chair and it's pretty
amazing and not only because it makes me
feel like a Starship Captain but more on
that later in the video I used to think
keyboards didn't really matter and then
I discovered this board and I felt like
it really gave me an edge starting about
4 months prior to making this video the
glove 80 has been my absolute favorite
keyboard both for software development
and for almost everything else I do on
the computer I've talked a little bit
about the glove 80 and referred to it as
being my favorite keyboard in a few
previous videos and those videos were
not sponsored but I am happy to say that
after seeing those videos Mo Ergo has
reached out to me to collaborate on this
video so thank you so much to Mo Ergo
for supporting the channel and what that
means for you is that I get to show you
all the different key switches and key
caps and mounting accessories that Mo
Ergo offers so you can kind of see and
hear what they sound like and I'll give
you my personal thoughts on all them as
well despite this being a sponsored
video Mo Ergo has insisted that I feel
feel free to say whatever I like so I'm
going to be extremely transparent in
this video You're going to hear some
things that I like some things that I
don't like why I like it better than all
the other keyboards I've tried and we're
going to go through all the features of
the glove 80 all the accessories all the
key caps and some of the different key
switch options the glove 80 and
keyboards like it are generally referred
to as ergonomic keyboards they are
ergonomic so it's accurate in that sense
but I'm a little ambivalent about the
term because I don't feel like it
encompasses everything that these
keyboards are to me ergonomic keyboards
are like this thing it's kind of like a
normal keyboard but it's split in the
middle and each half is kind of angled
outward so your wrists are kind of at a
more natural angle when you type I like
to think of the glove 80 and keyboards
like it as NextGen keyboards because
they do away with a lot of less optimal
characteristics of normal kind of
typewriter inspired keyboards and
there's a very real opportunity to
increase your productivity in addition
to just being more comfortable overall
Features
the glove 8 is what some call an
ortholinear keyboard others will insist
that it's technically a column seg
keyboard because the keys aren't in a
perfect grid but either way it does a
away with the rose stagger that
traditional keyboards have that was sort
of inherited from the typewriter what
that means for the user is that each
column of keys can accommodate the
length of the finger that's going to use
that column so the The Columns that are
going to be used by your shorter fingers
are actually elevated above the keys
that are going to be used by your longer
fingers so you don't have to curl up
your longer fingers just so your shorter
fingers can reach the keys there are a
fair amount of ortholinear and column
ster key boards on the market but one of
the more unique features about the glove
80 that's only shared by a few other
boards is the curved key well and the
curved Key Well allows your fingers to
travel less distance when they're coming
off the home row so if I'm going to the
row below or the row above the home row
my fingers don't have to move as far
because of the curv key well another
feature about the glove 80 that's
somewhat unique is the chalk key caps
and key switches the chalk key caps and
switches are significantly shorter than
traditional key caps and switches so
ultimately that leads to a thinner board
overall that sits lower on your desk the
other thing about Chalk key caps and
switches is that your fingers don't have
to move as far down to get a key
Activation so ultimately your finger is
going to move quite a bit less than they
would with traditional key caps and key
switches there are six Keys per thumb
and they're all very easily accessible I
personally feel like the thumb is the
most underutilized digit on traditional
keyboards so the six Keys per thumb
really opens up a lot of possibilities
there the glove 80 is Bluetooth capable
and supports up to four devices and
that's really handy if you have
something like a computer and a phone
and maybe a tablet you can easily switch
between the three of them so you can be
working on your computer grab your board
and leave the room and go into a
different room and quickly switch to
your phone and continue typing there
that that can be pretty handy of course
like most Bluetooth boards you can
choose to just leave it plugged in to
your computer via USBC if you'd like as
Switches
well okay let's talk about the switches
in the glove 80 switches can be fun
because they're very taste specific at
the time this video is being made Mo
Ergo offers three main types of key
switches and these are all soldered onto
the board so you can't easily change
them once you get the board the main
switch types that Mo Ergo offers for the
glove 80 are a 50 g linear switch a 60 G
tactile switch and a 60 G clicky switch
and I'm going to show you all of those
in this video they do also offer a 35 G
linear switch which I haven't tried 35 G
is a little bit too light for me I'm
more of a 50 gr 60 gram type of person
but if you do have some kind of RSI
issue and light key switches that
require very little Force are something
that you need there is that 35 gram
option as well when I first ordered my
glove 80 I ordered it with 50 g kale
linear switches I'm a big fan of 50 g
linear switches in general I think
that's kind of the sweet spot for me
personally it's got a nice sound it's
not Ultra ultra quiet but it doesn't
make a ton of noise
either again it's very smooth there's no
extra resistance at the top of the key
press the resistance is pretty much
constant throughout the entire key press
which I like so yeah that is the 50 g
kale red version okay let's take a look
at the tactile version and the tactile
version has 60 G kale Brown switches in
it when I first opened the tactile
version I actually thought I might have
accidentally opened another linear
version because it feels and sounds very
similar to the linear version but there
is when you compare them side by side
there is a little bit more noise on the
tactile
version and it is noticeably more
resistance to get a key press so there
is is definitely a difference but it is
kind of subtle when I was about to try
the tactile version of the glove 80 I
thought it was going to be more similar
to something like the kesis advantage
360 which I've used in the past and that
board is somewhat loud it's it's pretty
loud in my opinion for tactile switches
so I was kind of anticipating the glove
80 being similar in terms of feel and
sound it is not it is much much quieter
and again more similar to the 50 g
linear versions so if you're kind of
agonizing in a decision between the
linear version and the tactile version
version you don't need to worry too much
you're probably going to like either one
to be honest I personally like both I I
think I do still prefer the linear a
little bit but it's if you if you
swapped it out with a a tactile version
and told me I couldn't use the linear
anymore I would not be sad at all so the
tactile version is very nice as well in
my opinion if you're a fan of tactile
switches you're going to like it again I
guess the only thing that might
disappoint you is if you're used to your
tactile boards being pretty loud and you
you like the board being loud I guess
that's the only scenario where I can see
people being a little bit disappointed
now on to the clicky version and the
clicky version has 60 G kale white
switches and as their name implies they
are
clicky now although I can appreciate
them I'm not a huge clicky switch fan
but the clickiness is admittedly pretty
satisfying the board is what you'd
expect from any clicky switch board it
is loud you probably don't want to use
it in office environments but I was
pleasantly surprised I could see myself
using this again I still prefer probably
a linear tactile version but I
could I can definitely see the appeal of
clicky switches I personally prefer the
the sound of the tactile in linear
versions in terms of feel it's I would
say yeah the clicky version is very
similar to the tactile version in terms
of feel so the main difference is the
sound
the amount of resistance as you would
expect they're both 60 G it's it's
roughly similar anyway yeah but if you
are a fan of clicky switches I would not
hesitate to recommend the clicky switch
version when you order a glove 80 you
Keycaps
don't actually get to choose what key
caps you get at least at the time I'm
making this video luckily though the
stock key caps are really really good
they were called MCC pal keycaps and MCC
is the profile and palm is the material
before I tried the glove 80 I thought
the only material you could make key
caps out of was Abs if you're if you're
talking about lower-end boards or PBT
which are for kind of higher end boards
and they resist the tendency to kind of
get slick after a lot of use there's
this material called pal uh I don't have
any idea exactly what it is all I know
is that that's what the stock key caps
are made out of and they feel amazing
they have this almost soft feel to them
that's really hard to describe because
they're still it's still fairly hard
plastic but the the texture is is almost
soft and despite that it still has
plenty a friction for typing your your
fingers don't slip off the keys or
anything like that the stock key caps
also have what's called an MCC profile
so instead of a a traditional key where
kind of the Four Corners are a little
bit raised the MCC profile has kind of
this carved out almost pipeline what
that means for you is when you're moving
your fingers up and down from the home
row there's nothing stopping your
fingers from sliding to the next key
below or above this key so with the
traditional keyc cap profile file you'd
have to slightly lift your finger a
little bit to get over that Ridge at the
edge of the key cap but with MCC Keys
you don't have to do that so that's kind
of a nice optimization and again the
stock glove 80 key caps do have that MCC
profile so you get to try that right off
the bat the stock key caps at at the
time this video is being made do have a
legend on them so they have printed
letters and numbers I personally prefer
blank key caps I think they're more
aesthetically appealing but also I think
even if I wanted to have a legend on my
key caps I would would be able to given
the layout that I use so my layout's
pretty unique I don't think it's really
possible to make a legend for them and
luckily Mo Ergo does offer blank key
caps both white and black they also do
offer internationalized key caps so for
for languages like Spanish uh Japanese
German and so on they have localized key
caps for those languages they also have
what are called nerd key caps various
operating system key caps which have
things like tux the Linux Penguin on
them and there's a keycap set specific
speically for Mac keys that you can get
if you like the other nice thing about
moer Go's key caps is that they are
uniform and what I mean by that is the
key caps are the same regardless of what
row of the keyboard they're supposed to
go on with traditional key cap sets the
kind of tilt of the top of the key cap
is different depending on what row that
key cap is meant for Mo Ergo key caps do
away with that so you can put any key
cap anywhere on the board that's really
nice for the key caps that do have
Legends so if you use an alternate
layout like Doric or Colac you're not
going to be restricted in where you can
put the characters on the board because
of the row that they originally intended
for before I got my first glove 80 I had
heard some anecdotes that the build
quality of the board was something less
than optimal so that's kind of one of
the first things I looked at when I pull
it out of the box and I'm happy to say
that I don't find that to be an issue
whatsoever the build quality I would say
Build Quality
is impeccable actually it is lighter
quite a bit lighter than something like
an advantage 360 from Kinesis here's my
theory I think some folks might be
interpreting that as the build quality
of this board being lower there's
actually a detachable Palm rest for your
hands to rest on while you're typing you
know it's it's somewhat thin plastic but
it is really strong plastic it's light
but it's not flimsy whatsoever in terms
of the typing experience uh the build
quality of the glove 80 is impeccable
okay let's talk about battery life and
the battery life of the glove 80 is
going to depend a lot on how you use it
but generally speaking when we're
talking about the battery life of the
glove 80 we're talking about weeks and
months not days if you have the RGB
backlighting enabled that's going to
significantly reduce the battery life of
course but with it disabled it should
last quite a while I do tend to use the
board plugged in most of the time just
because I don't move it a whole lot but
the times I have used it wirelessly I've
literally never had it run out of
batteries on me and I've used it for at
least days on end so battery life is
something I'm not concerned about even
if you do tend to use it wirelessly I
have used it for a fair amount of time
with only one side plugged in and I
actually forgot that the right side was
not plugged in and didn't really notice
until a week or two later and it still
hadn't even run out of battery so the
glove 80 does offer tenting support via
the six adjustable legs on the bottom
you can kind of just unscrew them to
adjust the tent and you can also adjust
the Tilt as well so tenting if you're
not familiar with it tenting is angling
the board outward to give you a more
natural for some people a more natural
wrist angle and then tilt you can tilt
the board upward um like that so you can
do either one with these six adjustable
legs underneath I personally don't use
tilt or tent I'm fine just having the
board flat on the desk but for a lot of
people uh tenting is a must-have okay
Key Layout
let's take a look at how you can
customize the key layout of the board
and this is the really fun part the
optimal key layout of any board is going
to depend heavily on how you use it I
personally don't think there's one
optimal layout that's going to work for
everyone for example if you're a
programmer you might want to have Keys
like square bracket curly brace and
parenthesis readily available I
personally have open curly brace open
parenthesis and open square bracket on
my left thumb and then I have the
closing equivalents of those on my right
thumb another thing I do is I put all
the numbers on the home row keys so to
type numbers I actually hold down a
layer key which is on my left thumb and
then once I'm holding down that key all
of the home row Keys turn into numbers 1
through zero so I use the same fingers
for each key that I would on a
traditional board except I don't have to
move them off the home row and I think
that's really nice obviously if you're
not typing numbers a lot that's not
going to be a game changer for you so
again the point is the optimal layout is
really dependent on how you use the
keyboard now there are two main ways to
configure the glove 80 one is via Moo's
web UI which is actually really nice it
is definitely one of the one of the
cleanest and most powerful keyboard UI
configurators I've used the other option
because the glove 80 uses zmk firmware
which is kind of an industry standard
for wireless keyboards your other option
is to Fork the glove 80 zmk firmware
GitHub repository and make changes to
your keymap directly in the source files
and that's actually what I do not
necessarily because it's easier but
because it allows me I test a lot of
keyboards and allows me to easily copy a
key layout to from one board to another
originally I thought another advantage
of using that approach as opposed to
using a UI configurator is because you
get access to more of the low-l zmk
features like different behaviors and
whatnot but I was surprised to see that
the mo Ergo UI actually exposes a lot of
those zmk behaviors that I thought you
had to edit the source files directly to
get at so that's kind of nice I think
the vast majority of people will be fine
configuring their keyboard with the mo
Ergo UI some of the accessories that Mo
Accessories
Ergo offers are pretty interesting and
they're kind of unique the first is the
chair Mount the chair Mount is
definitely one of those things that you
didn't realize you need until you try it
it is incredible the chair Mount is kind
of what it sounds like it allows you to
actually Mount each side of the board
onto each side of your chair so the
board is kind of just an extension of
the armrests of your chair and you can
even remove the armrest of your chair if
you want to because you can just rest
your palms on the keyboard instead of
instead of having them on the armrest of
the chair there are two flavors of the
chair Mount one is uh what's called a
quick release basically so there's a
plate that you attach to your board you
can quickly put that on or take it off
the the chair I would recommend getting
that version if you move your keyboard
around at all the non-quick release
version is fine if you're always going
to have your board attached to your
chair but if you're going to want to
remove it even occasionally it's going
to be a bit of a pain so I would
definitely recommend the quick release
version if you do plan to move your
board at all otherwise the non-quick
release version is fine and the way this
works is you kind of attach this acrylic
plastic to the bottom of your board the
original feet that came with the board
act as kind of a spacer between the
board and and the plastic and then you
get another set of feet with the
mounting kit that you put on the bottom
of the board and then the board attaches
to basically an arm that comes off of
the chair this one I have here is the
quick release version and it's got a
little bracket on the bottom and so I
can just slip that on there uh lock it
in with the ball head that attaches to
the arm and the board is on there solid
they do have like these mini tripods
that sit on your desk and that creates
some interesting possibilities so you
can you can actually Mount the board to
those tripods those mini tripods on your
desk and kind of type on those tripods
maybe potentially angled at a 90¬∞ angle
that's not something that I would do
permanently or for a long period of time
but if you do have wrist problems and
you want your wrist to be at the most
basically the most natural angle
possible that might be something you'd
Moonlander
want to consider now let's take a look
at some of the other popular NextGen
boards and kind of see how they compare
to the glove 80 the first up is the
moonlander and unfortunately I haven't
tried the moonlander I've been wanting
to for a while people swear by the
moonlander if you look into column
stagger or ortholinear keyboards
moonlander is definitely going to come
up and of course the moonlander has kind
of standard key caps and switches as
opposed to the glove 8s chocks and then
the moonlander also does not have a
curved Key Well I have several boards
that are similar to The moonlander and
form factor they're great but to me I
prefer the glove 80 both for the key
Wells and me personally I prefer chalk
key I like MX Keys too I just have a
slight preference for chocks and I
definitely prefer the curved key Wells
and the the thumb key layout of the
Corn
glove 80 another popular nextg keyboard
is the corn and I actually actually have
one right there it's a popular 42
keyboard and on each half you have six
columns three rows and then for each
thumb you have three keys three keys per
thumb is it's okay but if you think
about the range of motion of your thumbs
you can reach a lot more than three keys
and I think the glove 80 more fully
utilizes that range of motion of your
thumbs by having six thumb Keys you can
actually get a version of the corn or a
variant that does have chalk keys and
switches so I guess that isn't a huge
differentiating Factor the traditional
corn has MX style Keys yeah and then of
course the key Wells corn doesn't have
the key Wells so the corn is a fantastic
board but I do significantly prefer the
glove 80 and then there's the Kinesis
Advantage 360 which is of the boards
we've talked about that's the one that's
most similar to the glove
80 it shares a lot of features in common
with the glove 80 it does have curv key
Wells so that's nice it has MX style
switches and key caps so more
traditional in that sense overall the
Kinesis advant 360 I think is a
fantastic board um I actually love it it
is significantly louder than both the
linear and the tactile version of the
glove 80 it used to be that you had
there was only one key switch option
with the advantage 360 I believe just
prior to me recording this video I think
they offer a different switch now I
think they offer like a silent switch or
something but at the time I ordered mine
there was only one option it was Gaton
Brown switches that's that's all you had
to choose from I like the key Wells and
I like the layout for the most part I
don't particularly care for the thumb
key layout there are six Keys per thumb
just like the glove 80 but in my opinion
the layout of those keys is suboptimal
especially compared to the glove 80 the
topmost ones you can't really it's it's
hard to type them naturally cuz you kind
of have to reach over these two unit
keys to get to them so for me they're
not Ultra usable and then the key caps
aren't uniform they're they're kind of
angled differently depending on where
the key is on the board so you the the
key caps are not interchangeable if you
wanted to take a cap from one row and
put it on a different row you might not
be able to do that depending on what key
it was again the advantage 360 is a
great board but I do prefer the glove 80
Other Reasons
other reasons you might prefer the glove
80 this isn't really an issue for me I
have I think fairly average Siz hands
but the glove 80 is deliberately
designed for different hand sizes
there's apparently a lot of complaints
online about from people with smaller
hands that the the key Wells of the of
the advant 360 don't really work well
for people with smaller hands the glove
80 is deliberately designed for
different hand sizes so that's something
else to consider and obvious question
that a lot of folks are going to have
when considering a nextg board is okay
how long is this going to take me to
learn my first nextg board was a board
called the kbio iris it's might not be
an Apple's apples comparison because it
doesn't have curved key Wells but it is
column stagger so it's similar to the
gl8 in that sense my experience learning
on the iris was I actually got it for
the most part within a day but I was
still making a lot of typos after that
for probably several weeks I would say I
got 80% of the way there on that first
day and then the next 20% took several
months to get so this is not a
transition that is ultra difficult it's
not even in the same ballpark as
something like going to an alternate
keyboard layout like comac or Doric not
even close so it's it's much much much
simpler than that again Doric or Colac
you you you're we're talking at least a
few months to even start kind of typing
that way next gem boards are
substantially easier than that I
probably practice at night on the
weekends for I don't know a few days a
week maybe before transitioning to using
at my full-time job long story short
there is a learning curve but it is well
worth it after all the positive things
I've said about it there are some things
I don't like about the glove 80 the
first one and this is very very very
taste specific and I think I'm kind of
in the minority on this one I personally
don't use the top two rows of keys I
probably mentioned this earlier in the
video I prefer having layers I
personally would prefer a glove 58
instead of glove 80 the RO they're not
the keys aren't hurting anything being
there it would just be kind of nice to
have the board a little bit smaller not
that it's big to begin with but because
I don't use them it'd be nice to have a
slightly more compact board I'm going to
Lobby them probably to to make a smaller
version I don't know if that's going to
be a common request I might be on my own
with that one but that's my personal
opinion and again even if you are like
me those two rows of keys aren't really
hurting much by being there the other
thing I don't like about the glove 80
and it's super minor because the
switches that come stock are fantastic
in my opinion is that the switches are
actually soldered onto the PCB which
means you can't easily change them I
think they offer a version of the board
that comes comes without key switches
and it's completely unsoldered so you
could technically if you're willing to
solder you could technically order that
and then solder on whatever switches you
want I'm I'm not going to do that again
I'm content with the stock switches I
would be perfectly fine with any of the
three stock switches even if I had the
option to change the switches of
something else I don't know what I would
change it to because um the stock
switches are fine it would just be nice
to have that option so that's something
to consider if you're really into
keyboard switches and you find yourself
maybe switching for variety there's a
whole Community around keyboard switches
that I don't personally have a foot in
if you're one of those people the fact
that these are soldered onto the board
may be an issue there you have it that's
a rundown of the glove 80 and why I
prefer it personally to any other
keyboard thanks again to Mo Ergo for
sponsoring the video I really appreciate
your support if you did like this video
and you want to kind of see my journey
of how I got to the glove 80 I tried a
lot of different boards and spent a lot
of money so if you are interested in
seeing kind of how I got here go ahead
and check out this video other than that
thanks for watching and we'll see you in
the next
one

**Advantages of the Glove 80 Keyboard:**

1. **Ergonomic Design:** The Glove 80 is an ergonomic keyboard designed to increase comfort and reduce the strain on your hands during prolonged use.
2. **Ortholinear/Column Stagger Layout:** The layout is optimized for the length of each finger, reducing the need to curl longer fingers just so shorter fingers can reach the keys.
3. **Curved Key Well:** The curvature allows fingers to travel a shorter distance when moving off the home row, adding to the comfort and speed.
4. **Chalk Key Caps and Switches:** These components are shorter than traditional ones, leading to a thinner board that sits lower on your desk, and require less finger movement for key activation.
5. **Multiple Keys for Thumbs:** Utilizes the thumb more effectively by offering six easily accessible keys per thumb.
6. **Bluetooth Capability:** Supports up to four devices, making it versatile for multitasking across different gadgets.
7. **Quality Keycaps:** The stock MCC pal keycaps are made of a material that feels soft yet offers plenty of friction for typing without slipping.
8. **Adjustable Legs for Tenting and Tilt:** Offers customizable comfort for different users.
9. **Customizable Key Layout:** The board supports extensive customization to match the user's unique needs, especially useful for programmers or those who frequently use certain special characters or numbers.
10. **Quality Build and Battery Life:** The board is well-built, light but sturdy, and has an impressive battery life, especially when used without RGB backlighting.

**Drawbacks of the Glove 80 Keyboard:**

1. **Soldered Switches:** The switches are soldered onto the PCB, limiting the ability to change them easily. While a version without key switches is available, it requires soldering skills to customize.
2. **Potentially Unnecessary Rows for Some Users:** The top two rows of keys might not be useful for everyone. Those preferring a more compact layout might find these extra keys superfluous.
3. **Learning Curve:** Transitioning to this keyboard, especially if coming from a traditional layout, will have a learning curve. It may take days to weeks to adapt fully to the new layout.
4. **Cost:** While not explicitly mentioned in the transcript, ergonomic keyboards like the Glove 80 are typically more expensive than standard keyboards.

**Tips and Advice:**

1. **Chair Mount:** The chair mount accessory can be incredibly convenient, turning your chair into an ergonomic workstation. Opt for the quick-release version for flexibility.
2. **Key Layout Customization:** Take advantage of the Mo Ergo UI or ZMK firmware for extensive key layout customization. Tailor the board to your specific needs for maximum efficiency.
3. **Consider Hand Size:** The Glove 80 is designed to accommodate different hand sizes, unlike some other ergonomic keyboards. Keep this in mind if you have smaller or larger hands.
4. **Be Patient with Learning:** If you're new to ergonomic or non-traditional keyboards, give yourself time to adjust. The initial learning phase is well worth the long-term comfort and productivity benefits.
5. **Battery Life Management:** If you're not using the RGB backlighting, enjoy the extended battery life. Even with wireless use, the battery is reliable and long-lasting.
6. **Key Switch Preferences:** If you're particular about key switches, consider the soldered nature of the switches on the Glove 80. You might need to weigh the benefits of the keyboard against your preference for specific switches.

Transcription:

Taking a play straight from the Unity playbook, Apple are introducing a new runtime fee called the "Core Technology Fee" in the EU in reaction to the European Commissions recently enacted Digital Markets Act. It will basically charge Apple developers a 0.50 Euro fee for each annual install past 1,000,000 if the developers wish to take advantage of the new Digital Markets Act rules.
hello ladies and gentlemen it's Mike
here at game from scratch when remember
the unity runtime fee and how well that
worked out well now it's Apple's turn
with something called The Core
technology fee although honestly pun not
intended it's not an Apples to Apples
comparison because this is actually in
compliance for something called the
digital markets act the EU put this law
through uh basically it's a law
mandating how digital Gatekeepers so
people like apple or um Google Play
Store that kind of thing how they have
to deal with their competitor with their
market so basically uh it defines Who
The Gatekeepers are uh so the criteria
are strong economic position significant
impact on internal markets and active in
multiple EU countries uh strong uh
intermediation position meaning that it
links a large user base to a large
number of businesses and finally you're
entrenched in the market so the last
three Financial years you've met these
two criteria above so this doesn't apply
to startups it only applies to
entrenched players if you have control
over a large install base and uh the
businesses that it hooks to uh and you
operate in uh the EU markets where the
significant and I imagine significant is
just finded somewhere uh but if you are
basically running a digital shop like
the Apple store or the um Google Play
Store you're a digital game you're
you're a gatekeeper at this point so
what is the idea behind the digital
markets act well business users who
depend on Gatekeepers to offer their
services so business users would be like
basically app developers in our scenario
uh to offer their services in the single
Market will have fairer business
environments yeah let's see how that one
works out uh innovators and Technology
startups will have new opportunities to
compete and innovate in the online
platform environment without having to
comply with unfair terms and conditions
limiting their development so this is
basically preventing them from using
like their eolas and app terms such to
do unfair competition and we've actually
seen quite a few examples of that in the
past uh and it's resulted in some
changes but now it's basically legally
stated you can't use the terms of your
app store to leverage and unfair
advantage over your competitors uh
consumers will have more and better
services to choose from more opportuni
to switch the provider if they wish so
direct access to service services and
fairer prices so this is basically like
uh if you want to offer inapp purchases
for example instead of selling them
through Apple you could use another
service provider and you know you'll
have more choices it'll be cheaper Etc
uh so if the end the consumer for
example wants to buy v-bucks in say
fortnite instead of having to buy them
through the App Store they could also
buy them through another means
potentially get better pricing and so on
uh let's see how that one works out as
well and GateKeeper will keep all
opportunities to innovate and offer new
Services they will simply not be allowed
to use unfair practices towards business
users and customers that depend on them
to gain an undue Advantage so uh
Gatekeepers will have to allow third
parties to interop with the gatekeeper
owned services in certain specific
situations allow their business users to
access the data that they generate in
their use of the gatekeeper platform uh
provide companies advertising on their
platform with tools and information
necessary for advertisers and Publishers
to carry out independent verification of
their advertisement hosted on the gate
gatekeeper this is interesting cuz Unity
did a sorry um Apple did a huge
Crackdown on what advertisers were
allowed to do on their platforms this
looks like this is actually walking some
of that back and allow business users to
promote their offers and conclude
contracts with their customers outside
of The Gatekeepers platform this one is
actually really quite interesting a good
example there is uh Netflix was offering
people could go to netflix.com instead
of using the App Store and subscribe
that way this is basically saying that
they're going to have to be allowed to
do that examples of don'ts so the
GateKeeper platforms are no longer going
to be able to treat services and pro
products offered by the gatekeeper
itself more favorably in rankings than
similar services or products offered by
Third parties on Gatekeepers platform so
that means in search results Apple or
Google can't like push their stuff to
the top simply because it's their stuff
um present prevent consumers from
linking up businesses outside of their
platform prevent users from uninstalling
any pre-installed software or app they
wish to this is kind of has nothing to
do with the rest of the conversation but
I like this so basically it sounds like
every app uh is going to have to be
uninstalled instable which I love I this
this should be mandated by law unless
it's like core to the actual OS I I hate
the fact that I can't uninstall certain
things from Apple or Google devices so I
I'm happy to see this and then track end
users of the gatekeeper core uh platform
service for the purpose of targeted
advertising without effective consent
having been graded so uh that's kind of
where it's going the rest is basically
how it's going to be implemented and
what the fees are for um more or less
being in defiance of this new uh digital
Market attack so that is the backstory
here that is how we got to where we are
at today and now let me show you
something that we call malicious
compliance which is to follow the letter
of the law while circumventing the
intent of the law and that is exactly
what Apple have just done so this is the
game developers take on it I wonder that
just because it's game development
focused in its coverage there's a number
of people have been covering this one
including myself of course and what
they're doing is basically putting in a
new install fee so instead of the unity
runtime fee apple is introducing the new
core technology fee across the European
Union that will charge developers hoping
to use third party storefronts a 50 uh
like 50 Euro or 53 C USD fee on the
first annual install past the 1 million
install threshold so if your app ships
more than 1 million copies uh a year
you're going to pay uh 50 cents or 50
eur50 EUR on each install past that 1
million install threshold so this is in
compliance with the new dma
uh and where the app store is concerned
legislation means Apple must let
developers leverage Payment Systems uh
and marketplaces outside of its own end
to end platforms for example epic games
now intends to bring fortnite back to
iOS in Europe through its epic gam store
uh there is something of a catch for App
Store developers looking to do business
in Europe in order to take advantage of
the new capabilities and terms for apps
in the EU so in other words if you want
to actually take advantage of the new
law dma um apple is requiring developers
to to agree to a new business terms the
terms will include a new tariff or tax
called The Core technology fee that
Apple says will only apply to developers
who achieve exceptional scale on the iOS
in the EU which basically means 1
million installs per year or more you
can of course avoiding that fee by
sticking with the existing terms now
this just I don't know this this screams
illegal to me uh when a government comes
in and says no here's how you can
operate your business and they say well
we're going to keep operating our
business as it was or we're going to
punish you it's kind of the way that
this is coming across there is a calator
we'll look at the calculation in a
second here's a couple rundowns we'll
get back to that uh in a second uh
developer fees are so some developers
are saying that the core uh technology
fee similar uh to the controversial
runtime fee that Unity uh implemented
Unity wanted to charge for every
installed of every Unity title ever
after a certain number of Revenue
thresholds were met on an annual basis
uh let's just say the community did not
like that uh it ended up being walked
back quite a bit so they moved it to um
it's only going to be for Unity 6 and
beond I think also the fee got smaller
so Unity definitely walked that one back
but not after setting their s on fire in
a huge way so that runtime fee was
probably one of the biggest
self-inflicted losses of 2023 amazingly
bad how it went so we got kind of the
same thing that came up when you needed
the runtime fee and with the original
math there was actually the potential to
lose money on a game especially if if
your game fell into that category of
didn't make enough money on a per
install basis and what this is boiling
down to the calculation is if you make
less than 57 cents per user which is
most apps you will end up negative and
will owe Apple money so that's actually
kind of nutty um got a couple of other
responses to it so mobile Studio Prime
31 did Apple just pull a Unity WTF is
going on in the games World Imagine a
few months from now you use Unity 6 DB
move number one and end up being dinged
per install twice plus the core
technology what a year uh it's going to
be uh epic boss actually he did a tweet
I'll go straight out to his tweet there
as well there's a lot going on there so
there is a lot going on with this new
fee so let's look at from the Apple side
of things uh so Apple says apple is
sharing new business terms available for
developers in the EU developers can
choose to adopt these new business terms
or stay on the existing terms existing
developers who want nothing to change
for them from How The Apple Store Works
currently and uh in the rest of the
world no action is needed and they can
continue to distribute their apps on the
App Store and use its private and secure
in app purchase system developers must
adopt uh the new business terms for EU
apps to use the new capabil for
alternative dist distribution or
alternative Payment Processing so if you
want to offer inapp purchases provided
by anyone other than Apple you got to
agree to these new terms same way that
if you want to have your own store or
ship on someone else's store uh you're
in uh this world and you have to apply
for the new terms here uh for apps in
the EU member states where dma is taking
effect the following options will be
available so basically stick with the
way it is today or new capabilities and
terms so basically if you want to take
advantage of the new law uh where
Developers have additional distribution
and payment processing options Apple
will apply a reduced commission so by
the way they're still charging 10%
Commission on an inapp purchase that's
not even made on their own damn store I
don't know how that one works to be
honest so they're still getting a cut
there so some people say well Apple
still needs to get paid for providing
the store they do they're getting a
commission on all sales there as well
and then we have the new processing fee
being added on top and a fee for first
annual installs uh above 1 million in
the last 12 months developers on these
terms will be able uh to distribute
their iOS on the App Store Andor
alternative app marketplaces and process
payments using secure App Store inapp
purchase system and alternative payment
service provider uh and or linking out
to your own web page from your app so
basically they just poison pilled the
hell out of anybody that wants to do
this so if you want to use another app
store uh to sell your game yeah you can
do that you're going to pay them a 10%
commission instead of 30% and then on
top of that you're also going to be pay
them this fee uh and an optional payment
processing fee so it yeah that
definitely Falls on under the category
of malicious compliance for sure um
developers who choose to agree with the
new terms in the EU membership in the
Apple developer program includes 1
million first annual installs per year
for free for apps distributed from the
App Store and or alternative
marketplaces developers who achieve
exceptional scale on iOS in the EU will
pay a core technology fee of you know
0.5 Euro for each additional for each
annual install over 1 million so we've
got the calculator here so let's just do
a scenario of you you ship a free game
but just not on Apple Store so how much
is this going to cost you uh do you sell
digital Goods so no free game no Goods
there how many installs let's say we
ship 2 million copies of our free game
new
terms uh okay we'll just skip that one
right there so what is it going to cost
you to ship your free game that did 2
million installs if it's not on the App
Store it's going to cost you $445,000 a
month a month that's that's insane and
that's App Store with inapp purchases
okay so let's switch over so App Store
and alternative providers only so let's
say there's no inapp purchases in your
game you're literally making no money
off this game it's just successful ship
2 million copies and it's on an
alternative app store what's it going to
cost you oh look this cost you $45,000
okay now let's actually say you're
making money off this so let's say you
made $1
million here 2 million copies you're not
a member of those stores new
capabilities so the App Store commission
is going to be $7,000 off of your
Revenue App Store payment processing is
going to be $1250 and then of course
you're going to pay the core technology
fee of 45,000 let's say your game was
like a just a breakout hit and you did
10 million copies but you didn't really
make any extra money just 10 million
$47,000 a month and this is with
alternate so let's do an App Store with
inapp purchases and yeah that's what
you're looking at
$425,000 in monthly fees just to to
basically ship a 10 million unit game
and let's say let's go back to a game
that's making no money oh look it's
still there this this this boat right
here this is just their commission this
is the monthly commission that they're
pulling off of your annual sales so here
they're getting paid so here's the thing
apple is getting paid so you say well
why are you going to allow them to why
would you sell on your own store if they
somewhere else they're getting paid
there is a commission anyways even if
not it's this this one here there
basically an installed tax which is why
people are in this one back to the uni
runtime fee it is a per install thing
you have zero control over that so um if
your game becomes a breakout hit but you
didn't necessarily expect it to make it
you know money you're not monetizing it
again the the break hold threshold seems
to be 57 cents per install if you're not
making at least 57 cents per install you
are going to owe Apple money and how
does that work if you actually owe them
money I don't know I I have no idea how
that's ultimately going to boil down I
also don't think that this is going to
hold up in court this is like a perfect
example of malicious compliance and
again we have uh Tim Sweeney has
responded to this and he's saying
Apple's plans to thw the uh Europe's new
digital markets act law is a devious new
instance of malicious compliance they
are forcing developers to choose between
App Store exclusivity and store terms
which will be illegal under the dma or
accept a new also illegal
anti-competitive scheme rif with new
junk fees on downloads and new Apple
taxes on payments that they don't
process Apple proposes that it can
choose which stores are allowed to
compete with their app store they could
block Epic from launch ing the epic game
store and distributing fortnite through
it for example or block Microsoft valve
good old games or new entrance uh the
epic game store is number seven software
store in the World Behind three console
stores two mobile stores Steam on PC
we're determined to launch on IOS and
Android enter the competition become the
number one multiplatform software store
on the foundation of payment comp
competition 0 to 12% fees and exclusive
games like fortnite epic has always
supported the notion of Apple's
notarization and malware scanning for
apps that's another aspect of this apple
in part of their developer things said
that they're going to start notorized
apps on their store to basically say
that these are safe but it's also kind
of a a twisted way of basically saying
everything that's not on their store is
unsafe so uh we strongly reject Apple's
twisting this process to undermine
competition and continue imposing Apple
taxes on transactions that they're not
involved with there's a lot lot more hot
garbage in Apple's announcements it will
take more time to parse both the written
and Unwritten parts of this new horror
show so stay tuned so as you can tell by
the tone uh Tim sweene is not exactly
happy but the thing is the EU is not
going to be happy this is elu is going
to look at what they just went through
the process of creating this new law to
do and you can just say if you look at
just straight up the benefits all of
this stuff that the reasons why the dma
was implemented Apple has basically
co-opted every single one of these for
it basically you can say okay yeah you
can you can work within the confines of
the dma it's just you are going to get
heavily screwed if you do and again this
supplies if you do not make any money
but you have a lot of in lot of installs
and all you've done is shipped your game
on another store you owe them $400,000 a
month um yeah that's it uh again I the
hubris of Apple lately in not in the
face of like business competition but in
the face of like legal judgments against
them and then these these counter
reactions that are just again I I can't
imagine that the European Union is going
to look at this one to go okay yeah
that's okay there's going to be fight
back on this one but that's how it
stands what do you think of Apple new
core runtime fee uh do you think that it
I don't know again I can understand how
Apple could say it's our platform we're
doing all the work we're doing the the
you know the the surfacing and the
initial exposure to these things and
they run on our devices we should get a
cut but there's the thing they do get a
cut that is what this is this whole
thing over here this commission is them
getting a cut so this is really uh it's
beyond the pale for me but um hey that's
Apple they're being very transparent
about how greedy they are with their app
stores but again this is putting their
thumbs they're basically giving the
middle finger to the EU and the EU
generally doesn't like that so it' be
interesting to see exactly how this
turns out but what do you think of the
new Unity runtime fee 2.0 Apple Edition
let me know comments down below and I
will talk to you all later goodbye

### Summary Notes:

**Topic:** The lecture discusses Apple's introduction of the "Core Technology Fee" in the EU, a response to the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA). This fee is imposed on Apple developers for each annual install beyond 1,000,000 if they wish to leverage the new DMA rules.

**Core Points:**

1. **Digital Markets Act Overview:**
    
    - The DMA aims to regulate digital gatekeepers like Apple or Google Play Store, setting criteria for who counts as a gatekeeper. It's designed to ensure fair business environments for business users (like app developers), more opportunities for innovators and startups, and better service choices for consumers.
2. **Implications for Gatekeepers:**
    
    - Gatekeepers are required to comply with certain standards, like allowing interoperability with their services, providing business users access to generated data, and enabling fair promotion of offers outside of their platforms.
3. **Apple's Core Technology Fee:**
    
    - In response to the DMA, Apple introduces the Core Technology Fee, which charges developers ‚Ç¨0.50 for each annual install past 1,000,000 if they want to take advantage of the new DMA rules. This fee applies to developers who achieve exceptional scale in the iOS market in the EU.
4. **Developer Response:**
    
    - The fee has sparked controversy, with some comparing it to Unity's controversial runtime fee and viewing it as a form of "malicious compliance" ‚Äì adhering to the letter of the law while circumventing its intent. The fee is seen as imposing undue financial burdens on developers, especially if their apps achieve significant scale.
5. **Legal and Market Dynamics:**
    
    - The fee has raised concerns about its legality and its alignment with the spirit of the DMA. It's seen as a way for Apple to maintain its revenue streams despite the new regulations. The situation is complex and evolving, with potential legal pushbacks from the EU.
6. **Community Reaction:**
    
    - The tech and developer community has expressed dissatisfaction with Apple's move, viewing it as an overly aggressive and potentially anti-competitive practice. The fee is seen as a significant financial burden, especially for successful apps, and raises questions about the future of app development and distribution in the EU market.

**Conclusion:** Apple's Core Technology Fee, a reaction to the EU's Digital Markets Act, has stirred significant debate and concern among developers and industry observers. It highlights the ongoing tension between large tech companies and regulatory efforts to ensure fair competition and consumer choice in the digital market.

### Summary Notes

**English:**

**Video Topic:** The video discusses Apple's introduction of the "Core Technology Fee" in the EU, in response to the Digital Markets Act. This fee is a reaction to the new legislation requiring digital gatekeepers like Apple and Google Play Store to allow third-party integrations and to prevent them from leveraging unfair competitive advantages.

**Key Challenges:**

1. **Compliance with Digital Markets Act:** Apple is required to comply with new EU regulations aimed at creating a fairer digital market.
2. **Implementing Core Technology Fee:** Apple's introduction of the fee is seen as a way to circumvent the intention of the new law by imposing additional costs on developers who achieve exceptional scale on iOS in the EU.
3. **Potential Legal and Public Backlash:** The move could be perceived as "malicious compliance" and may face legal challenges or public outcry, similar to the backlash Unity faced with its runtime fee.

**Importance and Utility of the Topic:**

1. **Impact on Developers:** The fee has significant implications for app developers in the EU, particularly those with a large number of installs.
2. **Industry Standards:** The move sets a precedent for how digital gatekeepers might react to similar regulations in the future, impacting the global app development and distribution landscape.

**What Has Been Done:**

1. **Introduction of New Fee:** Apple has introduced a Core Technology Fee for developers who wish to leverage the new Digital Markets Act rules and achieve more than 1 million installs annually.
2. **Option to Stay on Existing Terms:** Developers can choose to stay with the current terms and avoid the fee, but this restricts their ability to use third-party payment systems and marketplaces.

**Potential Dangers or Advantages:**

1. **Financial Burden for Developers:** The fee imposes a significant financial burden on successful apps, potentially making it less viable for developers to distribute their apps through third-party platforms.
2. **Restriction of Market Choices:** While the Digital Markets Act intends to offer more choices to consumers and developers, the fee might restrict these choices by making alternative platforms less attractive.

Transcription:

uh hello everyone so my name is Harang
and uh today I talk about my PhD project
called
DM based compiler compiler for dynamic
languages which is a speaker working oh
yeah okay so today we are be talking
about Dynamic languages and I guess I
don't need to explain what is dynamic
language I'm sure everyone has C python
or things like those and thanks to
Dynamic typing it it's it's it's quite
easy to program in in a dynamic language
but due to the high level
of dynamism on simple VM implementation
the execution performance is poor and
it's really hard to build a good VM
so let's take a look at the state of art
VMS
so uh the thing is that in order to
execute fast
we we of course with a jit and for a jet
uh the compilation happens at wrong time
so the thing is that the compilation
time is part of the execution time so we
cannot simply uh only have optimizing
compiler that spends a lot of time in
compilation the thing is that we have to
spend some of the time in compilation
and also some of the time in execution
so so we have uh so the end result is
that we
actually
the two jits uh one is called
a baseline jit that compiles fast and
the other is optimizing J that spends a
lot of time in compilation and generates
higher quality code and the end result
of this game is that we need at least
three tires the code starts executing in
an interpreter and eventually hot code
get Tire to tired up to the Baseline J
Tire and eventually even hotter code
gets further Tire to to optimizing tire
and uh this architecture is followed in
the STA art VM in general like Javas cor
and the V8 and the spider
monkey so as you can see while and
architecture like this gives you a high
performance VM it takes a lot of
engineering cost to implement this and
the lvm as a compiler infrastructure it
seems quite natural to use rvm to to
like reduce the high engineering cost
and of course I'm not the only the only
one to have this idea in the past uh
there are already attempts to use rvm
for python
for Ruby and Lua and a lot of other
things but as you can see despite the
many attempts they are not quite
successful so why so so to summarize the
main problem is that arvm compilation is
very slow so rvm is a highly optimized
compiler and it's the code generated bym
is really good but the compilation is is
totally not good but however for jit uh
is it's important to have um to compare
F since
since as
I said earlier the compilation happens
at execution time so the compilation
time is a part of the total total
execution time and the second issue of
rvm is that it has no direct support for
the important domain specific
optimizations for example in order to
optimize uh things like table
access object access uh we have to have
inline caching and the I'm efficient
implementation of inine caching is self
modifying code and the VM is not really
designed to do that and lvm is also
designed for static languages so and it
has no support for dynamic type
optimizations and also the thing is that
we have to have more than one VM tires
so we have to think about how to tire up
and how to osr exit and has no support
for that so how do we solve this issues
uh the core idea is that we are not
using rvm as a compiler instead we use
rvm as a compiler comp tier so the thing
is that we take in
the the semantic of the language
implementing in CPP as a single source
of truths and statically we
automatically generate this jit so and
the this part uh so so the thing is
statically uh at Bild time we use rvm to
automatically transform
the execution semantic of the language
to
a architecture similar to the state of
art VMS and uh now we have done the
optimized interpreter and
the Baseline jet part and I'm in in the
progress of implementing the optimizing
jet
part so let's take a look at some
numbers so in order to actually test
this idea in the real world we have
implemented a standard compliant VM for
Lua 5.1 and the execution engine is
automatically generated by digit which
includes an optimized interpreter a jit
compiler and the tiring up
and cing
up logic right now and importantly we
have inline caching
optimization so to summarize the
performance uh for the inter only
performance it turns out that we are
about
31% faster than the highly
optimized du J interpreter and
179% faster than official PC Lua
implementation and for the jet Tire the
compilation cost is negligable and the
generated code is about 34% slower than
the do just optimizing jit and
360% faster than PC Lua uh the thing is
that here we are comparing the
optimizing J performance against the
Baseline J performance so it's quite
that natural that that that we are
slower uh however as
I'm
uh once we don't uh have completed the
optimizing J part hopefully the
we
can eventually have higher Peak
Performance as
well and uh now let's take a look at how
how all of these things work so as we
explained before uh the input is a
semantic execution semantic of the
language bite codes and uh in this
example we have a add bite code and as
you would expect it takes two operant
rhs and rhs and here we just check if
rhs and rhs are both double and if not
we simply throw throw out an arrow
saying that cannot add otherwise we cast
rhs and rhs to double do the ad and say
that the outcome of oh sorry wait sorry
what's going on wait what's going
on
wait and I say that the outcome of this
ad is just the rhs C to double and rhs C
double and here the thing is that the Z
arrow and
the return our API is in D and the throw
Arrow as you would expect through
sign exception and
the return is an API that says the the
outcome of this add is this value and
the the is as and the create apis are
defined by the user so the thing is
that D can understands the type
hierarchy of the language and it can do
all
optimizations and
uh yeah that's it and now let's take
a look at a slightly more complex wait
why is
battery now let's take a look at a
slightly more uh complex example and
here uh at the time we check rhs and rhs
type uh if
it's it's not a d wait
what wait I've connected the
better
yes okay here uh at a time we check RS
and rs type if it's not double we will c
um better method similar to an
overloaded operator to excute this ad
and here the interesting thing is that
is
this B API so it allows us to to core
a GU language function and it Dev
returns and at the time the core ends
the control is transformed to the
continuation functor and here the
continuation functor just says that the
the end outcome of this add is the first
value return by the core and
the the continuation passing sty is
needed
for do stack Fortin semantics and also
it allows us to to know that a core
always happen at at a
TA position which is important for
optimizations as
well and the exclusion sematic is not
the only thing in the language so we
also need to know things like an add has
two operant and every operant is either
a constant or a temporary value in the
in the stack frame and and that's this
operan thing says and we we also need to
know that an add always generates a
value and the implementation is the add
function we just covered here the the
interesting thing here is a variance so
in a dyamic language it's quite common
to have slightly different variant of
the same operation like adding two
temporary values adding one value and
the con and the constant and things like
those here since teach understand the
type system as we covered before uh we
can specify that the constant is stally
known to be a tou not now and the can do
optimizations according to the for
example if touble LHS is known to be a
tou not n then since touble not n is the
sub type of
touble we can know that LHS do is touble
is always true so the check here can be
ided so and uh
there are also more complex
optimizations that we support but due to
time constraints I'm unable to cover it
right now and from this input sematic
uh dig automatically generates a bite
code Builder API that allows the
the user to construct the
streamer B codes from the uh the input
source program like this is just creates
an saying that rhs is is slot slot one
and rhs is a constant double and the
output is in slot two things like those
and the Dig automatically generates
highly highly optimized implementation
of the Imp interpreter and the jit for
the semantics and I don't have time to
cover the
exact generated assembly but it's yeah
now let's take a look at the uh at the j
tire so as we explained it's completely
free for in language implementer and
since everything is automatically
generated from the input
semantics and it features extremely fast
compilation speed and uh good excution
code quality and almost all the
optimizations in JavaScript
course Baseline jit so the jit is
automatically generated by a complicated
uh
sophisticated pipeline at build time so
as we can see uh we take in the
execution semantic of the CBP ex um of
the CBB code and we compare it to rvm ir
and then we
first need
to lower the d apis d the core and
the return through arrrows and things
like those and the thing is that for jit
it's important to uh
to burning constants uh
so so thing is that at wrong time every
everything in
the Bal stream are constants so the
thing is that we automatically identify
those constants and uh generate codes uh
jit code that have this constants hard
coded in into the instruction stream and
uh this and a few more extra passes I
needed to handle all sorts of Quicks
about the constants and the in caching
is another important optimization for
the jit uh I guess I I don't have enough
time to cover all the details but I'll
cover a little bit of it then the rvm is
compared to textual ASM so the thing is
that VM is not really designed for
dynamic languages so the thing is that
we have to implement some of the
optimizations unsupportable by by
ourselves and how we do it is that we
compare it we do solve the tricks at RM
level and then we compare things to to
text ASM and then we transform the
assembly uh to achieve some of the
optimizations on doable
IVM like in caching and the hot code
code splitting so the hot code code
splitting is that we try to split the
code into a hot part and the code part
so damic D has a lot of slow pass so
it's important to to to like put those
slow PA into a code code part so that
the code locality is
better and then we compare this into to
an object file and the
oh sorry I just realized I didn't cover
copy in the patch okay so so thing is
that at the generate compiler is not
using rvm at wrong time so how it
generates code is by copying the patch
it's a a trick uh
invented by me a few years ago so the
idea is that is that you compare the
code you try to generate into an object
file and then uh s some Hax you you can
extract the object file into a Stell so
that at WR time uh all you have to do is
to copy the St cell and Patch some some
of the simple values and that's how we
generate code at wrong time and then
then we have everything needed for the J
compiler and
we we actually generate the compiler
implementation in rvm and compare it to
get the jit to get uh
slightly concrete
uh concrete view about the jit so the
idea is that the jit at WR time takes in
the Stream of bite codes as input and it
generates the two pieces of Jed code the
hot logic and the code logic and and it
also statically generates the slow pass
and the and at the time the jit code EXC
you start in the hot logic and at the
time some something unexpected happens
like the ad is not the the oper of the
ad is not a double a control is
transferred to the J slow pass which
will further transform control to thee
ahead of ahead of the time generated
slow pass and after the slow pass is
done we transfer
control back to the hot logic again and
that's basically how the git works
and uh now let's take a look at a
concrete example of the ad so as as you
can see the generator code has holes in
it like 1 two 3 four and every hole is
defined by expression so at the time we
jit code these expressions are executed
and the the outcomes are are
like burnt in into the instruction for
example if we are executing an add of of
slot one and the slot two uh then the
whole one is going to have eight and and
the whole two is 16 and the and the JP
is jumping to the slow pass the address
of the slow pass and the jump six is
going to be the address of the aot ahead
of time generated slow
pass as you can see uh since everything
everything uh known
as WR time constants are just constants
in the instruction stream the code
quality is is good
for Baseline
jit yeah so I guess I guess I don't have
time to cover inline caching and inline
caching is another important thing that
didn't supports so in if you want if you
are trying to implement in cing by hard
by hand it's really hard it takes
a lot of
assembly know and other things but
thanks to d uh we invented the clever
framework to automatically Implement
inine caching from the execution
semantic of of the bite codes yeah so I
I guess I I only have less than a minute
left so for conclusion sorts what uh so
of course dig as a research project it
has is Noy but I don't really think it's
the top contribution so let me ask
another question what's rm's top
contribution to the world in my opinion
uh rm's top cont contribution to the
world is the is engineering that's put
together Decades of the compiler
Research into
and infrastructure for any static
language and in my opinion that's also
the story that I dream for teach so so
it's the engineering that uh puts
together the expensive lessons of
javascri and and state of engines like
this into
a reusable infrast structure for dynamic
languages yeah that's of course it's
very hard and and that's and the
currently is still quite far away but we
are at a good start yeah that's it
[Music]
[Applause]
questions so any questions I I guess I I
should not his connect right
now any questions yeah hi thank you uh
for the presentation so um you have your
reasons for picking Lua I didn't quite
catch them although I've been exposed
you work before um are there any
blockers for python do playing the same
set of Tricks yeah the the thing is that
uh D is designed to be a generic
compiler generator but python is a
really complex language it has a lot the
sematic of python is huge it's a lot a
lot harder than Lua and also python
has all sorts of exortic features I mean
if you are just a Convention of python
user you probably wouldn't heard of this
at all but as a language implementor we
have to deal with all this corn cases so
targeting dig for python is going to be
a lot harder than than for but I I mean
conceptually it's doable but in practice
it's all about engineering and python
takes a huge amount of engineering so
I'm curious uh what's the uh hardest
fruit to pick or top of the list is most
complicated semantic to handle for py
yes I I guess probably
it's I mean I haven't investigated it
deeply but I think probably it's the
class inherence metics because for if
you do a ad then if if both are doues
then it's always a double but in Python
is I think you can somehow inherent a
subass of double uh yeah of integers and
that that's going to change semantics
and it's probably yeah thank
you hi thanks for the talk and um I
mostly just have some some uh technical
questions that I have on some of the
slides uh what does the uh Library do as
opposed to the LM Parts um does the
library merely provide wrappers that you
will transform them into into code
generators um in a later stage um how
does that work sorry I so I didn't get
your question I think in one of the
slides you showed us that djen has a
Library part and I think in the
gr um which Slide the the the one uh
below it number 16 number 16 yeah yeah
so um so there is this dgen API oh I
guess this this API is provided for for
the lbm code base I guess it's not oh so
the D API is just special special things
needed for the execution sematic of the
dynamic language for example this
through arrow and the these are users
space programs from lm's point of view
right these are just placeholder
functions from lvm point of view oh okay
and the V are gotcha gotcha them to the
concrete implementation for the
interpretor and the jit for example in
the interpretor if you do if you try to
transfer control to the The
Next Bite code the thing you'll do is
that you have to uh check the dispatch
table and the get the implement of
function of the next bite code and jump
there right but for for the jit if you
are trying to transfer control to the
next
SP it's a jump at instruction level
right so the implementation is different
so the thing is that by providing D apis
to abstract the semantic we need uh at
build
time we can actually lower them to
different implementations we need I
think I still have some questions maybe
we can take this offline yeah sure thank
you um I thank you for the talk uh I
also have some technical questions maybe
I didn't understand everything correctly
uh the there is a slide where you say
that there is an aot slow path uh that
is generated at build time I'm wondering
how you can do that for a uh let's say a
lure program that's only going to be
read by the generated uh compiler oh so
the aot slow pass is like all sorts of V
semantics in Lua that's
that users will not use normally but the
thing is that as a language implementor
we have to support it anyway so the
thing is that for example if you take a
look at this add if t double if if you
are adding two values that are not
double then you have to throw all Arrow
it's not expected to be done commonly by
Common L programs right so the thing is
that if you generate jit code for all of
this the generated code is going to be
huge and we don't want to generate huge
code to it takes time and the memory to
generate code so the thing is that we
put St this low pass as aot
generate code and and only C them so can
I think of this as can I think of the
aot slow path as part of the Lua runtime
library then you know part of the
standard exception handling code path
perhaps uh because if it's part of the
user program I I still don't know how
you can generate slow path at Dent build
ter we know okay so we know which code
are slow paths so we have a few ways to
specify slow pass one way is by type so
if we know that an add is almost always
going to have two double set type then
we can actually analyze this function
and split out this part into a into a
separate function and that's a SL pass
and another way is to
uh say that sun the slow pass by hand so
we can simply has another another slow
pass doic and the inside the H
pass you can jump to the z pass and
that's how we know if something should
be in the slow pass or it should be hot
pass okay I have one one last question
may I suggest uh we take the rest of the
questions offline we are already 3
minutes over time um thanks everyone
we'll take a short two to three minutes
break and um um a couple of audiences
who had questions please take those uh
with howon offline and let's thank the
speaker once more thank you

summary:

**Lecture Overview:** The lecture by Harang focuses on his PhD project titled "DM-based Compiler Compiler for Dynamic Languages." The project aims to tackle the performance issues in executing dynamic languages like Python by optimizing Virtual Machine (VM) implementations.

**Key Challenges:**

1. **Execution Performance in Dynamic Languages:**
    
    - Dynamic languages, despite their ease of use, suffer from poor execution performance due to the high level of dynamism and the complexity in building efficient VMs.
2. **Complexity in VM Architecture:**
    
    - State-of-the-art VMs require a multi-tier architecture, including an interpreter, a baseline JIT (Just-In-Time compiler), and an optimizing JIT. This structure is performance-efficient but highly complex and resource-intensive to implement.
3. **Utilization of LLVM:**
    
    - While LLVM (Low-Level Virtual Machine) is a powerful compiler infrastructure, its use in dynamic languages has been limited due to its slow compilation times and lack of support for domain-specific optimizations crucial for dynamic languages.

**Importance of the Topic:**

- **Efficiency in Dynamic Language Execution:**
    
    - Enhancing the execution performance of dynamic languages is crucial as they are widely used in various applications. Improving their VM implementations can lead to significant performance benefits.
- **Reduction in Engineering Costs:**
    
    - Developing a sophisticated multi-tier VM architecture is resource-intensive. By utilizing LLVM as a compiler compiler, the project aims to reduce the high engineering costs associated with building high-performance VMs for dynamic languages.

**Harang's Contributions:**

- Harang is working on a novel approach where LLVM is used not as a compiler but as a compiler compiler. This approach involves:
    
    - Transforming the execution semantics of a language into a VM architecture similar to state-of-the-art VMs.
    - Generating an optimized interpreter, JIT compiler, and tiring-up logic automatically using LLVM, reducing the need for extensive manual engineering.
- He implemented a standard-compliant VM for Lua 5.1 as a real-world test case, which showed promising performance improvements compared to existing implementations.
    

**Technical Insights:**

- Harang delved into the technical aspects of his project, explaining how dynamic semantics of languages are transformed into highly optimized VM implementations.
- He discussed the challenges in generating JIT code at runtime, the importance of handling constants, and the implementation of inline caching and hot/cold code splitting for optimization.
- The lecture also covered the challenges in extending this approach to more complex languages like Python, highlighting the need for significant engineering efforts due to the complexity of these languages.

Transcription: 

Intro - why we are learning AI

we are going back to school and yes you

heard that right when I say we I mean

you and me I'm ready I'm ready we're

going back to school backpack ready to

go a few weeks ago I shared that I am

going back to school for practical

Hands-On Ai and machine learning now

this is done through a school here in

Toronto that I'm going to be going to or

attending actually it's virtual oh it's

remote we're we're doing this remote

okay guess I'll just uh Park myself down

but you get the point attending these

classes this is a year-long program so I

am committed this feels like a

commitment I'm sharing this with you

because throughout my journey uh

learning about different areas around

artificial intelligence machine learning

having the exposure and experience from

both the technical side of things but

then also to the business side of things

I want to share it with you I want you I

mean this kind of sounds like a win-win

you get to take this course essentially

but for free I mean you're not taking

this course but I'm going to be sharing

with with you my learnings and my highs

my lows along the way I'm sharing this

with you or this recap with you because

it got me thinking as I was starting to

prepare for class which is coming up in

12 days which is Wild by the way I

thought Jeff what is your plan what is

your road map for learning AI are you

just going to go in and wing it or what

what's the plan other than of course

having a proper syllabus that I'm going

to follow and whatnot now I've been

studying AI for I would say about the

past year on my own I've been sharing a

lot of my learnings with you so that's

not going to change it's just in a more

formal setting I I just felt like I

wanted to take that next step I'm

sharing all this because I want to share

with you the road map that I came up

with for how to learn AI in 2024 now

this is a really it was really

challenging for me to come up with this

road map for a few reasons one because I

felt like it really depends on what role

or what area in AI you are interested in

that will depict what you are learning

about AI but I thought you know what's a

good place to start let's start with the

basics let's start with some key

Concepts from there let's go more into

some courses you can take some

communities you can join and what next

steps look like I think that sounds like

a good plan what do you think school

Tiff yeah that sounds good I guess I

guess I going take my backpack off

still all right she said so let's get

into

[Music]

it so regardless of what path you are

interested in when it comes to AI

What are the different types of AI

there's a few things that you should

know or terms you should know no matter

what let's break down the three kind of

ways AI is really looked at at a very

high level and I don't want to say three

types of AI or anything like that

because there's so many but let's focus

on the main three one being artificial

narrow intelligence Ori so this is

essentially how we interact often with

AI today so you can think of it as AI

performs a single task so something like

voice recognition or something like

recommendations on streaming services

this is using a an then we have AGI or

or artificial general intelligence and

this is something you've probably seen

in the news a lot or this is one of the

more common ones mainly because of

speculations of what it could look like

this is something we do not have today

uh but what it essentially is is the

ability for AI to understand learn adapt

and Implement knowledge across a wide

range of tasks at a human level so it

can solve its own problems build out

different solutions to things it doesn't

necessarily need us to guide it as much

then we have the third which is more

kind of like from Back to the Future

well I don't even think Back to the

Future was this far in the future but

that is a SI and that is artificial

super intelligence which honestly is

kind of what it sounds like it is well

they call it the final level of AI I

don't know but it refers to a futuristic

scenario where AI surpasses human

intelligence so it is taking one step

further you could say as far as its

ability to think on its own act on its

own and really be able to do many if not

yeah I would say many jobs that we do

today now this is not a video to scare

you about what the future of AI could

look like but more so just to make you

aware of the different types of AI or

how it's kind of categorized and before

we get to ASI super intelligence we are

very far from that so let's just keep

that in mind and I think as we always do

as humans we figure it out as we go

along and that's the beauty of it

anyways let's keep on diving into it I

also wanted to cover what is the

difference between something like data

What is the difference between AI, Machine learning, Deep learning

science artificial intellig machine

learning or deep learning I'll put up on

screen here this graph or chart which I

think does a good job of explaining it

and I wanted to break down these topics

for you because they're often used

interchangeably or tied so close

together which in some scenarios makes

sense but in others we almost generalize

these big topics just because they're

buzzwords so as you can see from this

diagram AI is programs with the ability

to learn and reason like humans machine

learning is the algorithms with the

ability to learn without any explicitly

programmed so they are learning from

models and data and just really

understanding as far as um they're

they're based on algorith they are

algorithms at the end of the day then we

have deep learning which is essentially

a subset of machine learning in which a

artificial neural networks adapt and

learn from larger databases so as you

can see even with in AI there is so many

layers to it and it can get intense

pretty quickly I know what you're

thinking well maybe you're not what

you're thinking but I'll tell you what I

was thinking when I was learning all

this well if there is so much to AI what

is the point of even learning it seems

like every time I take a course or have

a discussion about it I feel like I'm

falling behind and I hear you on that I

feel that way often times too one thing

I've learned though throughout uh

learning AI or any other technology is

you just need to take it step by step

the worst thing you can do is just not

try to learn at all because of that

feeling of H it's just moving too

quickly for me it's okay you will feel

caught up at some point it's just that

initial learning curve that can feel a

little bit overwhelming so I just wanted

to say that as a side side note don't

get too caught up on how vast the

subject is especially which brings me to

my next point is having an understanding

What area of AI should you focus in on?

of what area in AI you want to focus on

let's use the example of say you are

interested in ethics around Ai and

regulations around that maybe you come

from a law degree or a psychology

background and you're really interested

in that side especially around the

regulations with AI now this is

something where I wouldn't suggest okay

you need to go start with python

learning programming in order to become

an expert in that area it's more so

around the psychology of it the

regulations the the law that's required

with these regulations th those are

areas you need to be an expert in now

you do need to be extremely educated on

artificial intelligence and its

capabilities as well to make those

decisions but you don't need to become a

programmer and I really wanted to

highlight that because before you even

dive into your journey with AI take time

to understand how you want to use this

how you want to use this in your career

how you want to grow with AI what what's

the purpose of your learnings and even

if it's just because you want to learn

something interesting that will look

different as well all right let's move

on to some courses now these are courses

that are both Technical and some are

non-technical for the reason being I

know we have an audience of both and I

think even if you are a technical person

maybe you don't want to dive into the

technical side of AI and that's fine too

I talk about these courses a lot the

What are good courses to learn AI?

first ones I'm going to mention which is

course Sarah courses mainly because they

are taught by some of the world's best

lead ERS when it comes to AI I mean deep

learning specialization this is a course

that covers deep learning structured

machine learning projects and neural

networks and this of course is by one of

cor s's co-founders Andrew so it's a

really great course now I haven't taken

this course specifically but I've taken

a ton of other courses by him around Ai

and they are so brilliant the way he can

break down topics and such a simplistic

form is really incredible the other one

I want to share with is Udacity so if

you are interested in really garnering

or gaining that degree or certification

Udacity is definitely a place to check

out one that stands out to me is the

machine learning engineer Nano degree so

this is a program that focuses on

Advanced machine learning techniques and

algorithms so if you are more on the

technical side I would definitely

recommend checking this out I mean it

always is good too to get that

certification or in this case a nano

degree that you can put on your

LinkedIn I don't know I need sound

effect can you tell it's been end of day

I've had too much

coffee it's it's I'm in Canada it's get

it's dark at like 5: now it's it's

happening all right let's keep on moving

one more I want to share with you is

about MIT open courseware I love MIT I

love their newsletter I love every

they're just so Innovative I think

they're great one course though that

they offer is called introduction to

deep learning so this is a course that

really starts from the foundations

working the way up into deep learning

methods and application so this is more

so kind of a mix of Technical and

non-technical but i' recommend it to

both um individuals all right let's talk

a little bit about community and I think

this is funny because I don't hear when

I read online you know when I research

for these videos I read online what

other people are saying and other guides

around the road map for 2024 Ai and

sometimes they can be so specific that I

think who is this for because it sounds

like you're making it seem like the only

people that can get into learning about

AI or these super hackers or the other

side is it's very non-technical it feels

like well what like who is your audience

and that's why for this video I wanted

to keep it very realistic as though that

everyone every single person watching

this video has their own Journey no

one's alike and your goals with your

learnings are all unique as well and

that's really important to keep in mind

because there's no prescription overall

that I can be like next you need to

Learn Python next you need to learn that

What are some Ai communities to join?

because that's not accurate it really

depends on what you want to do the

purpose of this video is more so for you

to uncover that take away what some of

the key topics are and that's that's why

I really wanted to bring up Community

because Community is one of those things

that if you don't have it you're going

to struggle often times we will struggle

I'll speak for myself often times I will

struggle with learning something new I

need that sense of community to bring me

up support me I'll share right on screen

here some of my favorite communities uh

especially in the artificial

intelligence World also okay this is a

really cool thing that I do see look at

this is this like what was that movie

the um Godfather or I don't know what's

old movie they're like welcome sorry I'm

going on tangent now one thing I do

though often times is on LinkedIn just

as a little tip I will follow different

thought leaders in Technologies I'm

interested in so in artificial

intelligence in future Tech that's a

really great way to stay up to date

easily on different topics that they are

sharing about I mean I try and be one of

those individuals too um I I love using

LinkedIn for that as well so just

following people there that really bring

education and insight into your dayto

day I don't know why I've kind of

gravitated towards LinkedIn lately for

that all right I hope you found this

video helpful between sharing some

courses giving you some communities to

join some different tips as well as kind

of giving starting the video off with

covering some really big topics that are

often spoken about almost too casually

when it comes to Tech where people don't

really have the context or understanding

what these topics are about with machine

learning or deep learning so I really

want to cover those as well I hope you

found this video helpful and valuable

leave in the comments you know I got to

say this leave in the comments any other

videos you want me to make and I will

see you all soon it's time for dinner

and no more coffee for me

Transcription:

a few months ago I dropped a major Cliffhanger  secretly 453 is possible but that's a topic  
for another day today I'll finally share the  secret with you and unless you already know  
what's coming it's probably not what you  think the answer is very unintuitive see  
in order to go faster in Super Mario  Brothers we need to go slower for as  
welln as this game is today we'll be exploring  some territory that's likely foreign to a lot  
of you watching it's time to break down how  453 is possible on the pal version and how  
the fastest version of Super Mario Bros is  actually the slowest version of Super Mario
[Music] Bros real quick did you guys know that  with Netflix now you can do more than just watch  
things you can also play things this video is  sponsored by Netflix games right now included  
with your Netflix membership you have access to  over 80 mobile games you've got games like Sonic  
Prime Dash on there there's some good stuff let's  go over how it works on the home screen in the app  
you swipe down to find the mobile games row and  from there you just scroll through until you find  
what you want to play tap on the game you want tap  get game it's that easy there's a whole bunch to  
choose from and here are some pretty cool examples  some of my personal picks would be Shovel Knight  
pocket dungeon and definitely Bloon Tower Defense  6 but yeah you can play all these games right from  
the Netflix app with no extra fees and best of  all no ads if you're interested click the link  
in the description and go check out Netflix games  and thanks to Netflix games for sponsoring today's
video all right let's talk about the fastest  version of Super Mario Bros a version you may  
be entirely un familiar with we're talking  about the pal version pal P stands for phase  
alternating line it was one of three major analog  color television standards the others being ntsc  
and ccam look this is a video about speedrunning  Mario not electrical engineering so I'll keep it  
brief because the longer I talk about this the  more likely I am to make mistakes and get flamed  
in the comments but the context here is really  important so we're going to try basically the part  
that's relevant to this video is that different  countries have different standards for how their  
TVs and their electrical outlets work nowadays  our TVs use digital signals instead of analog so  
this is less relevant but back in the day it  was pretty important to design things around  
the frequency or Hertz of the electric currents  coming out of your power outlets in Japan you  
know the country where Nintendo games are made  they use the ntsc standard which means electric  
currents alternate in and out of their home at 60  htz or 60 times every second games and TV signals  
were designed around this so the typical NES game  runs at 60 frames per second that means we redraw  
the whole screen 60 times every second to give  the appearance of motion and put the video in  
video game most of the Americas also use ntsc  so the majority of my audience you played the  
ntsc version of Nintendo games in all their 60fps  Glory you played them as they were designed and  
as they were intended now let's talk about pal in  Europe Australia most of the world really besides  
America and Japan they're working off 50 HZ since  the early 2000s that hasn't posed so much of a  
problem in the video game realm but before then  oh boy 50 HZ means retro games were running at 56  
the speed compared to their ntsc counterparts if  a game was originally 60 frames per second that  
means now it would run at 50 FPS but sometimes  games were 30 FPS so that meant 25 FPS and then  
there's Ocarina of Time being drawn on the  screen at a blistering 17 frames per [Music]
second so yeah to sum things up the majority of  video games were made in regions that used 60 HZ  
and designed with that in mind when the games  were sent over to countries that Ed 50 HZ they  
had to be adjusted there were a few different  approaches taken when adjusting games to run at  
50 frames per second and there were definitely  some mixed results we one approach is to just  
do nothing let the game Run at 56 speed and  call it a day this is how that turns [Music]
out yeah not a very pretty outcome some games got  a little bit better treatment it started being  
fairly common to at least adjust the music  and sound effects even if if the gameplay  
wasn't totally optimized for 50 FPS it wasn't  painstakingly obvious that anything was out of  
order I'd say Mario Kart 64 is a good example  the game looks and plays pretty good unless you  
also saw or played the ntsc version you probably  wouldn't even realize that your carts are driving  
a little bit slow a decent number of games got  this sort of okay treatment but every now and  
then a game would be optimized exceptionally  well for pal the best example I'm familiar with  
is Super Metroid unless you're really familiar  with the game you probably wouldn't even know  
the difference just by watching footage now let's  pause and think about just how many things there  
are to change to account for just the change in  frame rate you of course have to adjust all the  
sounds and music so that they sound normal there's  also some obvious physics changes like making the  
player move a little bit faster so they don't  look sluggish but you have to be careful doing  
this could probably introduce some new bugs right  we'll get there but focusing back on adjusting the  
player speed that's not not as easy as it sounds  on paper you've got horizontal speed and vertical  
speed you've also got acceleration that's going  to affect all your jump Heights your attacks  
a million things and that's just the player  character how about the enemies the environments  
the animations of all these things it's a  Herculean task and even if you put in the effort  
to tweak every little detail it's probably still  not going to be perfect more often than not it'll  
be impossible to directly translate the original  data values you can't just multiply everything by  
1.2 decimals can be tricky business even modern  computers can't deal with decimals perfectly all  
the time but a lot of older Hardware didn't have  any capacity for decimals developers got pretty  
creative but nothing was ever perfect and yes  this did sometimes lead to new unintended Behavior  
like in Super Metroid because of the difference in  samus's speed or the speed that the door closes or  
both I'm not really sure you can just barely jump  out of this room before the door closes and skip  
a boss fight all right all of that being said are  you ready to talk about Super Mario Bros it's been  
a bit but I hope you're still with me let's talk  about the pal version of smb1 this game got all  
right treatment when it came to converting to 50  FPS some stuff slipped through and wasn't really  
changed like the speed that platforms move or how  long Bowser takes to fall in the lava and stuff  
like the PowerUp sound is pretty nasty if you're  used to the ntsc version these things aren't too  
to bad for the most part though and despite all  that they did manually adjust quite a few things  
the speed that fire bars rotate the speed the  enemies move the music is adjusted and it's fine I
guess the pal version also came out a couple years  later so they went ahead and patched some bugs and  
they even adjusted some things like how bloopers  swim so you can't just stand around on the bottom  
and be safe safe from them but all right let's  talk about the things that we'd be interested in  
for a speedrun things like the length of a frame  rule the original frame rule is a 21 frame cycle  
that dictates a lot of things in the game the  pal version runs at 56 speed so they adjusted  
the length the infamous 21 frame rule is now  the 18 frame rule an 18 frame cycle at 50 FPS  
is pretty close to a 21 frame cycle at 60 FPS  but not exactly the same the optimal cycle for  
speedrunning every stage is going to be different  due to this but it's going to be different for  
a lot more reasons than just that they of course  also had to adjust Mario's speed Mario's top speed  
could actually be perfectly changed from 40 to  48 so accounting for the difference in frame rate  
Mario runs through levels at the exact same speed  in both versions but remember top speed isn't all  
there is Mario's acceleration is actually faster  on pal sort of crazy fast you can really see see  
it in this room in 84 and once again horizontal  speed isn't all there is we have to think about  
vertical speed as well Mario can actually jump  higher in this version the easiest way to see  
that is with this row of bricks up high in the  very first level on the ntsc version you can't  
quite reach them but on pal you can surprisingly  having higher jumps doesn't really save time  
anywhere there aren't really any obstacles we  couldn't already clear but it's actually not  
Mario's Speed on the way up that we're interested  in let's talk about his speed on the way down a  
couple years ago happy lee released a video about  an impossible floor clip the basic premise is that  
in order to clip through the floor in this game  you would need to travel more than five pixels  
in a frame this game checks for Mario to land  anywhere in the top five pixels of the ground  
and when he does it snaps his position to the  top pixel if you could manage to go more than  
5 pixels deep you'd bypass the floor check and  enter the ground usually you don't get this much  
speed because as you fall and start to get close  to 5p Speed the game says uh-uh you can't go that  
fast and it caps your speed down to four but  sometimes you can get up to five speed for one  
single frame before it applies the speed cap and  puts your speed back to four here's a technical  
explanation by Des smile cat you can pause to  read if you want to understand the nitty-gritty  
the problem is that it's never normally possible  to be right next to the ground at the moment you  
do briefly hit 5 speed you're always too far away  to take advantage of the temporary higher speed  
in this video happily showed that you could  get the right positioning by doing a separate  
glitch to spawn a Vine at the start of one two  climbing on it lets you fine-tune your position  
and allows for the necessary conditions for the  floor clip a very Niche situation but a thing you  
can do all right all of that was about the ntsc  version of the game now let's talk about pal on  
pal Mario's downward speed cap is five instead  of four but the floor check is now the first six  
pixels of the floor so we need to get more than  six speed to get through as it turns out with  
the right conditions you can reach not just six  speed but even up to seven speed before the game  
applies the speed cap and puts you back down at  five that's sounding promising it can't be done  
just anywhere but it can be done in some places  and that's good enough for us one way to get the  
seven downward speed is jumping at a very specific  height and then landing on enemies we can do that  
here at the end of 1 one and clip into the ground  those who are familiar with the flag po glitch in  
this game know that it happens by grabbing the  flag lower than normal and if you can grab it  
especially low you'll get what we call the full  flag pole glitch where Mario falls out of the  
left side of the block and you instantly trigger  the timer countdown this is most commonly seen by  
bouncing on a Bullet Bill next to the flag since  bullet bills give you a really low bounce and it  
lets you grab the flag very low another good way  to grab the flag really low is by being very low  
ourselves down in the ground you can jump out  of the ground and into the flag triggering a  
full flag BookIt the smb1 warpless task gets in  the ground in various ways throughout the run  
and manages to pull this trick off several times  but now that we're talking about the pal version  
we have a pal exclusive way to get in the ground  once you bounce off these glomas and get in the  
ground at the end of 1 one you can run over to  the flag and get a full flag pull glitch since  
this skips not only the flag coming down but also  the kn for Mario to walk to the castle it saves a  
lot of time doing it this way in 1 one can save  around 1.4 seconds actually huge there aren't  
any other places we can clip near a flag pull in  the run but there is one other candidate for the  
floor clip to save time in one two to reach The  Warp Zone the falling platform lets us start a  
jump from all sorts of different heights and that  makes it possible to reach seven speed right next  
to the ground and clip in this trick combined  with Pal's very fast acceleration means we can  
do some tight movement to load the warp zone and  save 0.72 warping to World 4 one final perk of  
pal physics is in 42 on ntsc this is about the  hardest stage in the run it takes something like  
17 frame perfect inputs to match the task in  42 on ntsc but on pal you can kind of just jump  
backwards into a couple walls you get pushed  forwards plenty of pixels for the wrong warp  
to work you can do some simple Warp Zone movement  with Pal's really fast acceleration and yeah it  
ends up being being possibly the easiest stage to  match the Tas instead of the hardest the same is  
also true of 84 no need for constant double fast  acceleration jumps everywhere the stairs at the  
beginning are a little tricky but after that you  can mostly just hold right or left to accelerate  
where you need to and only lose a very small  handful of frames throughout the stage there is  
a trick in the third room where you land without  holding the Run button so you can turn around and  
get in the wrong warp pipe faster but that's a  tiny optimization in general getting a clean 84  
is pretty straightforward all right we've gone  over a few places where pal has version exlusive  
glitches that let us go faster than ntsc and the  stages that are usually the hardest are now the  
easiest this should definitely make 453 possible  the current world record does the floor clip in  
one one he doesn't do the one and one two and his  84 wasn't quite as good as he'd hoped moment of  
truth if we were to add all of these things into  his run what kind of a time would we [Music] get  
503 what gives that is so far off we're supposed  to be talking about 453 all right before you write  
your angry comment let's keep going even though  Mario can run through the stages at the same top  
speed as ntsc and accelerate faster and do brand  new glitches to save time the timer takes longer  
to count down the timer tis down once every frame  to award you points at the end of levels and since  
pal is only 50 frames per second instead of 60  that's sadly just going to take longer every  
time it happens we lose about a second on average  each time well if we're losing 5 Seconds to the  
timer counting down throughout the Run how are we  possibly going to get a 453 on this version here  
we go friends one more version exclusive trick  on the pal version the most powerful of them
all in my video about how 453 is almost possible  on ntsc I explained that it's just barely not  
possible to grab the flag low enough for a full  flag pull glitch without special conditions like  
an enemy or clipping in the floor even with the  best known approach and input combination Mario is  
a fraction of a pixel too far away but here we are  on the pal version with slightly different physics  
and what do you know it is possible wait if we can  do this why are we bothering clipping in the floor  
in one one why isn't the world record doing this  in runs on all of the flag Poes well here are the  
inputs you need to pull this trick off on top of  getting the perfect positioning with your jump to  
the flag pole you need to switch between left and  right on the d-pad every frame the d-pad has to  
be on left and then all the way down on right the  next frame then all the way down on left the next  
frame and then all the way to the right again  all frame perfectly with a frame perfect jump  
in the middle here's what that input sequence  looks like in real time these are some fast and  
physically difficult inputs it is possible to do  inputs like these by utilizing some interesting  
controller grips but it's really hard to do them  reliably Runners typically tackle them by holding  
the controller sideways and using their left hand  for a b and right on the d-pad they then use two  
fingers on the opposite hand to double flick  left on the d-pad on the surface this might  
just look like what Tetris players do where they  roll on the controller to get really fast inputs  
and they do that constantly so this can't be that  hard but it's more than that this has more moving  
parts and it's more precise you need the perfect  amount of pressure on both sides of the d-pad so  
you properly get left right left right it's  really easy for one of the inputs to not go  
through and just one frame of neutral anywhere  in the sequence will ruin everything all of this  
may start to sound a little familiar if you've  heard about the legendary final frame that was  
saved in 84 on ntsc an ultra hard input sequence  is required to do the beginning of the level at  
perfect speed the full flag P glitch inputs are  very similar to that and Runners have pulled that  
off but let's take a step back and remember that  this spot is infamously hard this is the hardest  
time save in the entire run on that version it  was the very last hurdle Runners had to overcome  
to prove that a perfect run was even theoretically  possible now here we are on the pal version where  
we need this type of thing once again but it  doesn't save one frame in this version it saves  
2.8 seconds on every flag pole they didn't adjust  the the length of the flag animation on the PO  
version so it's 20% slower than ntsc and skipping  it entirely saves a lot of time but doing so is  
so hard 453 is possible but is it really viable  to do this heart of a trick five times in one run  
Runners have shown that it's possible in general  the first person to prove it was three creepio  
showing that it could theoretically be done later  one other runner in particular took this concept  
and started tearing the game up with it to no  one's surprise it's Nifty about a year and a  
half ago he set out to try and match the task on  each stage individually here he is hitting the  
trick for the first time in a full run of 1-1 yes  yes no way a little while later he also managed  
to get it in a full run through of 4-1 as well as  an 83 nailing these three brought the human sum  
of best down to 46.5 getting close but wow still a  ways off when each one of them saves so much time  
it's kind of unfortunate in a way personally I  think we're actually really lucky that this trick  
isn't possible on ntsc it makes the run a lot more  interesting when you save a small amount of time  
in a bunch of different places rather than things  being over centralized on one big trick I think  
this trick would really ruin warpless categories  as well since you just want to focus on doing full  
flag P glitches instead of optimizing Bowser kills  and other interesting things like that anyway niy  
kind of hit a roadblock after he got those first  three levels done the two remaining stages with  
flag PES are a bit harder and more complicated  81 has some frame perfect pipe jumps and is a  
hard level in general you don't have time to  switch grips at the end of the stage so you  
have to play the entire thing in this awkward way  and it makes it hard just to get to the flag pole  
let alone do the full flag pole glitch and then  there's 82 which has a couple obstacles blocking  
your path the spiny egg that lacu throws at the  start is right in your way on the pal version  
you have to slow down a little bit to get past  it it's also not possible to get past this pipe  
without slowing down so that makes it tricky to  have consistent movement and be precisely lined  
up for the flag P glitch at the end these trials  were too much for niy to overcome and it turns out  
that 453 is completely impossible forever just  kidding last week niy learned I was working on  
this video and decided to go finish the job he  spent one day getting 81 and then another day  
getting 82 and just for good measure he took one  more day to do some attempts at 84 and managed to  
tie the task there to the frame as well granted  that is easier on this version than on ntsc but  
still very impressive and all of that makes  a perfect run of this version theoretically  
possible so what is the perfect time with all of  these tricks anyway sorry to say it guys but I've  
actually click baited you 453 isn't possible 452  is possible 42.2 if you do a perfect run of this  
game that's the time you'll get five full flag P  glitches floor clip in one two tight movement in  
42 and a perfect 84 that does leave about four  frame rules of wiggle room if we just want to  
get a 453 and officially make this the fastest  version of the game for speedrunners and just so  
happens that if you do the floor clip in 1 one for  the easier flag pole glitch and your movement is  
perfect throughout the stage age you can just  barely squeeze out a frame Rule and that lets  
you clock in just four frame rules behind the  regular full flag P glitch I think that could  
be a good approach to 453 but don't listen to  me I haven't ran this version let's hear things  
from the current world record holder miniland  who fittingly is from the UK a pal region let's  
hear what his thoughts are about the future of pal  what do I think the future of pal well it's highly  
dependent on if people actually care to run the  game so make a great video and make people want  
to play the game please please I really want  to see more people play pal I think 503 without  
full fpgs is very very doable once it hits 503 if  someone's interested enough and gets good at full  
fpgs which should happen people can get sub five  honestly the main reason the record on pal isn't  
lower is mostly just because very few people have  put time into it the ntsc version is a lot more  
widely popular and already has a storied history  but I wonder where we'd be if the ntsc version  
never existed what if the original was just  like this from the get-go here's the thing if  
ntsc didn't exist we would never have had Andrew  G sub five and all that say we liveed in a world  
where ntsc didn't exist and world record right  now was 505 pal there would be people looking at  
pal looking at the game and going do you know we  just have to do full fpgs and we get sub five the  
first ever time someone had ever beaten Mario won  in under 5 minutes and then they would go for it  
in a heartbeat say five people went for sub five  the first person gets sub five the others aren't  
just going to quit it's like 454 people keep going  and trying to improve it so I could see someone  
going oh you've got sub five I'm going to do more  flagpole glitches we'd be so much better at full  
fpgs than we are now because we have reason to  get good at them I think there's always going to  
be someone crazy enough to go record is this I'll  just one up it I'll do one more so there you go  
guys it could happen someday but it's way harder  to do than the current world record on the ntsc  
version is and the flag pull inputs aren't just  hard they also hurt doing this literally gives  
you blisters physically scraping your finger  across the d-pad like that you ever see people  
do 84 and they're wearing tape on their fingers  that's not for like friction or anything that's  
so they don't get injured or rather so they get  injured less but even with all these factors if  
people get enough interest it may one day happen  after all people are always asking what Runners  
are going to do after they finally get a perfect  run so maybe grinding the pal version is the  
next step sub five itself is going to be a huge  milestone for the pal version someday and maybe  
the thought of going even faster than ntsc can  will motivate someone down the road to try let's  
even say 45429 happens or something and people are  like we don't want to play anymore it's possible  
to get under ntsc on pal right that's what 453  means that would be the fastest completion of the  
game would that be an incentive to get 453 yes  but I would okay spoiling my next video that's  
right this isn't the end of the road sorry to do  this to you guys again but there is yet another  
approach we can take to try and beat Super Mario  Brothers faster than ever but once again that's a  
story for another day thanks for watching hey we  are really close to 200,000 subscribers I'm going  
to keep making videos like these so consider  subscribing if you enjoyed it [Music] helps

**Notes on How 453 is Possible in the PAL Version of Super Mario Bros**

1. **Introduction**:
    
    - The secret behind achieving a faster time in Super Mario Bros (Super Mario Bros) is counterintuitive - to go faster, one must initially go slower.
    - The video explores the PAL version of the game, highlighting how the slowest version of Super Mario Bros is technically the fastest due to specific version-exclusive tricks.
2. **PAL Version Overview**:
    
    - PAL stands for Phase Alternating Line, one of the three major analog color television standards.
    - The video explains the importance of different electrical standards, like NTSC in Japan and America (60 Hz) versus PAL in Europe and Australia (50 Hz), and how this affects the game's performance and speed.
3. **Impact of PAL Standard on Games**:
    
    - Due to the 50 Hz standard in PAL regions, games run at 56% the speed of their NTSC counterparts, leading to slower frame rates.
    - While some games were optimized for PAL, many were not, leading to noticeable differences in gameplay and performance.
4. **Super Mario Bros PAL Version**:
    
    - The PAL version of Super Mario Bros was adjusted for the 50 FPS frame rate, affecting various game elements like the speed of fire bars, enemy movement, and music.
    - Notably, PAL's "infamous 21 frame rule" is adjusted to an 18 frame cycle to match the change in frame rate, affecting the optimal cycle for speedrunning.
5. **Advantages in PAL Version**:
    
    - Despite running at 56% speed, PAL version-exclusive glitches allow for faster gameplay than NTSC.
    - For instance, Mario's top speed and acceleration are adjusted for PAL, and his downward speed cap allows for unique floor clips, offering speedrunners new strategies.
6. **Flagpole Glitch in PAL**:
    
    - In PAL, it's possible to achieve the full flagpole glitch without special conditions, saving significant time.
    - However, the inputs required for this glitch are extremely fast and precise, involving alternating between left and right on the D-pad every frame.
7. **Challenges in Speedrunning PAL Version**:
    
    - Despite the potential time savings, consistently performing the full flagpole glitch is physically demanding and challenging.
    - The PAL version's slower timer countdown offsets some of the time gains from these glitches.
8. **Future of PAL Speedrunning**:
    
    - The potential to achieve a 452 or 453 time in the PAL version exists, but it requires mastering the difficult flagpole glitch multiple times in a single run.
    - Interest and dedication from the speedrunning community could push the limits further, potentially making the PAL version the fastest completion of the game.
9. **Conclusion**:
    
    - While the PAL version of Super Mario Bros offers unique advantages and challenges for speedrunning, it demands a high level of skill and physical endurance.
    - The video teases another approach to beat Super Mario Bros even faster, promising more content and discoveries in the world of speedrunning.

I've been saying for a while that apple

is the sleeping giant that is about to

dominate artificial intelligence they

are well positioned in pretty much every

aspect to come in and completely change

the industry overnight and now leaks are

starting to come out about their AI

strategy so we're going to take a look

at those today first this is a fantastic

article by Mac rumors that goes over a

lot of what is dubbed Apple GPT as well

as their overall AI strategy now with

the release of Apple Vision Pro which I

believe is the perfect vehicle to

deliver AI to the masses apple is likely

to make their presence known this year

so let's talk about what we know about

Apple GPT first Apple's AI Chief is John

gianandrea and if you don't know who he

is he is an incredibly important figure

in Silicon Valley he has been in the

industry for a long time and been a

contributing member to incredibly

impactful projects this this is him SVP

of machine learning and AI strategy at

Apple and funnily enough you will never

see apple use the two letters AI they

rarely if ever say artificial

intelligence so the fact that we see it

here is pretty interesting John has been

in Apple for almost 6 years but if we

look at his experience he was at Google

for nearly 8 years but if we go all the

way back he was actually the chief

technologist at Netscape and I'm

probably dating myself with the

reference to Netscape but Netscape was

one of the first internet browsers

period and Netscape really changed the

face of the internet so just imagine

that Jon has been working on projects

all the way back to the birth of the

internet now he's working on something

that is likely going to be bigger than

the internet so going back to the Mac

Rumors article John reports directly to

Apple CEO Tim Cook and he has a team

that has been working on conversational

AI for 4 years and now it's been leaked

to that apple is testing Apple GPT

internally and previously it was code

named Ajax but in perfect Apple fashion

it is highly secretive what we know

about it is that no employees can use it

without permission and its output cannot

be used to develop new product features

for customers it is used for product

prototyping and is able to answer

questions about the data that it was

used to train on here it says Ajax is

said to be more capable than prior

generation chat GPT 3.5 and it's trained

on 200 billion parameters but as of

September 2023 opening A's newer models

are allegedly more powerful than Ajax

and that wouldn't surprise me open AI is

definitely at The Cutting Edge but you

all know I'm extremely bullish on open

source obviously apple is not going to

be open source here or at least I would

be incredibly shocked and it wouldn't be

the first time meta's contributions to

the open source AI Community has shocked

me every single time but what I'm most

excited about is bringing artificial

intelligence to Siri the idea that I can

use Siri for much more than just setting

a timer or reminding me of something

later is so exciting imagine a Siri that

is essentially a fully capable

artificial intelligent agent you can

give it multi-step tasks you can give it

sophisticated tasks it can start

predicting things that you need in your

day even before you ask it this is all

the promise of what Apple can do with AI

now here's something interesting apple

is said to be spending millions of

dollars per day on conversational AI

research as training language models

requires a lot of hardware and on the

topic of Hardware we're going to touch

on that in a minute but apple is

probably the most well-positioned

company in terms of Hardware maybe

besides Nvidia and they're on track to

spend more than $4 billion on AI servers

in 2024 now here it says Apple's work on

generative AI could eventually be

incorporated into its Siri voice

assistant now that is the most obvious

statement I've ever heard I don't

believe apple is ever going to call it

an llm a GPT or AI it's going to be Siri

and in apple fashion they are going to

use completely different terminology to

describe their artificial intelligence

very similar to how they call their

apple Vision Pro spatial Computing

instead of what it really is augmented

reality now here's a quote from a former

Siri engineer John berky and he told the

New York Times Siri's cumbersome design

means that adding new phrases requires

rebuilding the Siri database which can

take up to 6 weeks each time while more

complicated features like search tools

can take upwards of a year I'm going to

guess that they're probably working on a

complete refresh of the Siri

architecture and if they're not that

would be quite surprising because I

don't know how much mileage they're

going to get out of the existing

architecture injected with artificial

intelligence and here it says the

information suggests that apple is

aiming to create a feature that would

let Siri automate multi-step tasks

automatically performing tasks that are

accomplished with shortcuts today this

makes a ton of sense to me very similar

to how we've seen open source SCE

projects like open interpreter be able

to control your computer with just

natural language this is exactly what

artificial intelligence can do now I

believe Apple sees the future and

they're thinking that there's going to

be less and less Reliance on physical

screens and you're probably pretty

surprised to hear that I'm sitting in

front of a massive screen and I use my

laptop every single day and my phone

every single day but let's think about

things for a second as Computing moves

more and more towards large language

models and the device form factor

changes such as the rabbit which of

course still has a screen but the

primary input and output is voice then

all of a sudden we're just using natural

language to accomplish tasks and if we

look at the Apple Vision Pro and

augmented reality it's the same thing

now of course these are little screens

in front of your eyes but really it's a

very different form factor than what

we're used to here it talks about Apple

adding AI into their apps and of course

that's going to happen but I truly think

that all apps need to be reimagined from

the ground up with AI first and that

typically means a natural language

interface so here are some very basic

examples which seem like they could

probably just come out tomorrow and

honestly I'm not super excited about

what I'm seeing here I think Apple

really has something cooking that is

going to blow us away that is not just

adding artificial intelligence into

existing products so here Apple music

for example Apple could use AI to create

autogenerated playlists I mean that is

the most basic underwhelming feature

I've ever heard while an xcode AI

support could help developers write in

troubleshoot code we already have that

it's incredibly powerful but still not

revolutionary in pages in keynote Apple

could be used for writing and creating

slide decks while Apple's internal

customer support apps could be updated

with generative AI to assist with Apple

Care all of which happens today this

sounds like Windows co-pilot to me and

what Apple does incredibly well is

partner with thirdparty media companies

you can look at the iTunes Store with

music movies magazines everything they

do an incredible job of bringing

companies into their ecosystem and that

just might be the Apple gorilla throwing

its weight around and they are reporting

that Apple has approached Condon Nast

NBC News and IAC about possible AI deals

and that would make a lot of sense apple

does not want to get into the same hot

water as open AI is with the New York

Times and why would day apple is the

Beast Apple everybody is going to work

with apple because they are the primary

player and Apple employees have been

banned from using chat GPT GitHub

co-pilot and other AI tools and they are

concerned that AI tools would leak

confidential information and that is not

only something that Apple is very

concerned about internally but that's

actually something that they build into

all of their products they really think

about privacy first many of you might

disagree with that statement but I truly

believe my Apple device is probably the

most secure device I own compared

compared to other devices around my

house and here both the information and

analyst Jeff Pooh claim that Apple will

have some kind of generative AI feature

available on the iPhone and iPad around

late 2024 which is when iOS 18 will be

coming out who said in October that

apple is building a few 100 AI servers

in 2023 with more to come in 2024 Apple

will reportedly offer a combination of

cloud-based Ai and AI with on device

processing now let's talk about that for

a moment because that is the most

exciting to me I have a MacBook Pro M2

Max and it is insanely powerful at

running inference when all of these

large language models started coming out

Nvidia was the main player I have an RTX

490 and it does it rips through large

language model inference but I still use

my Mac most of all and with tools like

LM studio and olama natively supporting

Apple metal my little laptop in front of

me runs large language models hyper fast

in fact let's look at this guide right

here here by Andy ping and quickly thank

you to the sponsor of this video M mate

M mate is the most advanced AI platform

for creating and connecting lifelike and

fictional AI characters visit mate.io to

experience the future of digital

interaction now back to the video A

Simple Guide to local llm fine tuning on

a Mac with mlx mlx is the library that

allows you to do fine tuning on your Mac

and it is very very fast and not only

that there seems to be something about

the Apple silic chips that make running

inference extremely efficient Apple

silicon chips are very different from

traditional GPU and CPUs because they

basically combined both of them into a

single chip and that makes the

communication between the CPU and GPU

very very efficient very very fast if

you want to see me do a tutorial on

fine-tuning with mlx using a Mac let me

know in the comments below so the idea

of a completely local Siri is not Out Of

Reach I know that my MacBook Pro could

do it and I know the chips in my iPhone

are very very powerful as well and I

wouldn't be surprised if they could run

Siri completely locally now in my

opinion apple is most likely to roll out

some hybrid of local and cloud-based

artificial intelligence they're going to

run as much as they can locally for the

sake of privacy and security or at least

that's what they're going to say and

then they're going to connect to the

cloud when they need to do more powerful

processing or when they need to pull in

third party information that can't be

stored on device alone and for anybody

thinking that apple is far behind in the

AI game which I've seen everywhere take

a look at all of their published

research which only seems to be

increasing in velocity here's acoustic

model Fusion for end to-end speech

recognition coml collaborative machine

learning model building for developing

data set design practices here's

flexible keyword spotting based on

homogeneous audio text embedding I just

saw one that helps reduce the size of

large language models here's one about

training found ation models for

wearables so again if you're wearing

your Apple watch it can start analyzing

the data even more effectively than it

already is so if you haven't seen all of

these research papers I'll drop a link

in the description below and so in the

future in this brilliant future what I

imagine is wearing an apple Vision Pro a

much smaller form factor Siri built in

with all of the AI capabilities that

we've come to know and Beyond and of

course it's multimodal so from all the

cameras on the Apple Vision Pro you can

ask it about anything in your

surroundings you can ask it about any

audio in your surroundings as the AI is

generating output it could put it

directly in Your Vision so let's say you

want to cook something you open up your

fridge you look around and you say what

can I make with what I have in my fridge

it highlights the different items that

you should grab in real time you take

them out it pops up a recipe it

literally shows you on your kitchen

table take this item put this much in

the pot and so on I mean the

possibilities are truly L and I cannot

wait to see what comes if you liked this

Link:  [This VS Code Killer Just Went Open Source (Written In Rust BTW)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOYp6-k9HhE)
Transcription:

Zed's looking cooler than ever. Still has a ways to go, but open sourcing such a big project is always impressive. Genuinely hyped for the team and can't wait to see where things go. Will this help me stop missing Sublime Text? Will my search for the perfect IDE stop here? To be determined.

VSS code love it or hate it it's become the norm for quite a while now I still remember working at twitch being the one

person who just would not give up on Sublime Text when I started writing more unit tests for weird typescript

functionality I was introduced to the VSS code debugger by a cooworker which was a huge help in me running the tests

and playing with things as I went along and ended up slowly making the shift as a result that all said I missed the

performance while I could sit here and defend electron all day I'll admit the performance is something you feel in a

text editor while vs code is way faster than Alternatives were like Adam you definitely feel that it's a browser not

a native editor and when you use something like Sublime Text or even things like Vim the speed at which a key press results in a key being on your

screen it's small but you feel it and I definitely understand why people miss a native IDE this is why I'm really

excited to talk about Zed today Zed's a really interesting editor because it's trying to find the balance between native performance you would expect from

things like vim and a plugin UI focused ecosystem similar to vs code where you can kind of get the best of both worlds

it is not just being cre cre by some random people it's actually being built by the original creators of Adam and those Adam creators didn't just invent

one of the first modern text editors they actually built electron just to make atom possible in a lot of ways you can almost see this as an undoing of the

damage that electron did where this team wants to make a much better performing editor that doesn't compromise on the

user experience the same way other things might do Now Zed is open source

this is a huge change that I honestly didn't expect because Zed's a startup they have to make money somehow open sourcing the editor is a bold to make

but not only are they open sourcing they actually rewrote most of the code in the process so why the big rewrite last week

was my first week at Zed I joined right as the team was preparing for this week's release which they referred to as zed 2 big things in the air this release

marks the end of the team's multi-month rewrite of zi framework GPI from V1 to V2 all hands on deck everybody fixing

the last bugs polishing Zed and I the newcomer had so many questions why the big rewrite how'd you pull it off what does this get you how do you organize it

this is really cool that they're like publishing this type of stuff about why they're doing these bold rewrites and

that the whole video is on YouTube as well I'm not here to talk about the rewrite though I'm here to talk about the open source release and actually

play with z a bit if you want to hear more about big rewrites like this let me know in the comments and maybe I'll make a whole video just about this rewrite

we're excited to announce that Z is an open source project the code for Z SS available under a copy left license to ensure any improvements will benefit the

entire Community GPL for the editor a GPL for serers side components interesting that they went with standard

GPL for the editor and the Apache modification of it for the serers side stuff makes sense for them to make sure they a business they can sell but

fascinating to see this type of like split licensing for a product if you think I should talk more about licensing for open source let me know cuz it's

thing I have a lot of weird opinions on they also mentioned the GPI rewrite that they are Distributing as well under Apache so anyone can use it to build

high performance desktop apps and distribute them under any license that's huge that's really cool good open source

why are they doing this most importantly they believe that making Z open source will make it the best product our mission is to build the world's most

advanced code editor and get it in the hands of millions of developers there's a ton of surface area on the platform

and will need all the help we can get considering that all of Zed's users are programmers it makes the most sense to open Zed to the maximum pool of talent

this is a really good point since everyone using Zed is going to be a developer letting them contribute to it makes a ton of sense makes a ton of

sense really cool to see them thinking in this way on a more selfish level we also think going open source will be a lot more fun one of our favorite aspects

of software is connecting with people we're not only proud of what we've built but also how we've built it we want to share Zed's inner beauty with all of you

and we're confident we'll learn a lot from you in the process to make it even better they're also introducing this idea of Fire hacks where you can hang

out with people in The Zed channels talk with other developers people contributing people not and they'll be running Fireside hacks in them where

they work on Zed live and a public Channel this is super cool I love these like Community opportunities to hang

with people really nice stuff and then they talk about the money aspect cuz this is important too CU they're a

startup they need to make money eventually and they say specifically that they strongly believe the best way to build and maintain the world's best

editor is by associating it with a sustainable business model it's the only way they can continue to invest in a full-time team to spearhead Dev some may

wonder if making it open source undermines that objective but they thought about it a lot and they don't think the openness is at odds with the

commercial success rather than selling you a proprietary editor we'd much prefer to sell you services that seamlessly integrate with your Editor to

make you and your team more productive said channels is just one example it's free for anyone today but they intend to begin charging for private use after a

beta period of experimentation providing serers side compute to power AI features is another monetization scheme they're seeing getting traction and I've seen

this more and more with companies recently where they're trying to become a standard first and then monetize later

I think it works really well I'm curious to see how it goes for an editor nobody's really tried this at this integration level usually editors either

charge or don't make money charging later to make money is an interesting strategy that requires more investment

for them to find success but seems like they're building something really special here and I'm excited to see how it goes for them they're not at one point oh yet though so know this is

still early but it is a really exciting rewrite I want to play with it so I guess there's nothing else to do other than click this download button so let's

do it download for Mac OS one more thing of note at this point in time Zed is Mac only they do plan to support other

Platforms in the future but let's be honest with the things that they're targeting Mac devs are going to be the majority of users anyways and they'll

certainly be the majority of potentially paying users in the future so as a business tries to figure out if they have something with traction that could

possibly make money in the future it makes a ton of sense that they're not supporting windows and Linux just yet anyways here is Zed one of the cool

things they actually have a Vim mode built in does that mean this is officially Prime agine approved to be determined I don't have Vim bindings in

my head anymore so I'm not going to check that they really thought of the setup process here where you can pick a theme doesn't seem like they have the PO

Manders theme I don't know you could install custom ones or not but they don't have my preferred one which makes sense it's a pretty Niche theme so let's

go with the default for now choose a key mapping vs code yes please don't make me learn new things it's cool that they let you take the mappings from other

programs and the default is vs code where they're just copying the vs code keepy bindings really good idea don't make me learn all these other new things

when I'm just trying to play with a new editor and then install the CLI we'll take a look at the upload thing public

code base so cool here's our project it is very minimal I've seen people saying that already but I do like how how muted

things are I don't love the lack of color in the icons cuz like I can mentally map things when they have color

but it's also like almost everything's just TS TS TS TS in blue so how much does that really matter debatable I

don't know if you guys know this but the VSS code CLI is slow as [¬†__¬†] so if I type code period we're going to press enter right now and that took like a

second plus to switch over I actually have a custom binding that you might have seen me use C that is an alias that

just calls the vs code application directly and when I do this instead I'm going to press enter right now it's

literally instant and as seems to care about that this lets you load the application way faster and the specific

CLI thing they're using to get those ARs and parse them is just not very fast let's start by playing with the hot

keys that worked great is there a Hut key for hiding and showing the sidebar command B that's

Snappy scrolling feels a little Jank I don't know how much this will come up like in the recording because I'm

recording 30 FPS even though my screen's running 120 but the scrolling feel

less good this is actually something I noticed when I first played with Z is that scrolling felt a little

weird yeah a ton of inertia that's a good way to describe it Vim Tim in chat so love that a vimmer has opinions on

this one thing that really annoys me in vs code is when I'm trying to delete like a section of text so let's try and

delete here up to functions CU When I go here it Scrolls too fast this is way

better for that already it's a small thing but these are the things I want to test CU I want to see what my day-to-day is like in this editor let's say I want

to delete everything from line 122 to like 200 something let's say to 205 how

easy is it for me to get to exactly 205 that was pretty easy versus in vs

code we'll start at 122 and I want to get to exactly 205 and it Scrolls way too fast no

matter how far you go and it's a good bit harder I've had a lot of annoyance with that why not scroll down to the line and shift click cuz I don't think

that far ahead probably a good call oh look at that they light things up bright green when there are changes in git okay

am I crazy or does that icon look like Source control to you cuz this icon looks to me like Source control not like files I might be insane but that looks

like a source control icon with the branching how fast does the git update that's a good question too and let's see

what happens that was instant that was instant good [¬†__¬†] yeah vs codes is not

anywhere near that fast now all these things are staged you can't even see it in vs code commit DM init

commit and vs code doesn't update these things in the background in order to see the update I have to go back here and

then it will update but I bet some older files oh no it updated everything I'm sure all of you that use VSS code really hard have had the problem where it

doesn't see certain things have been commit some things haven't been commit and it just yells at you the whole time

didn't do it there I've experienced it a lot I know y'all have too it's really cool that Zed does not seem to do that

and is like weirdly immediate I don't love this icon what is this move to a new file I don't love

that UI don't know what this does or is for it seems like probably one of their weird AI things but can I see if Zed supports Auto rename tag interesting

thought let's first off test the typescript go to definition here's our trpc proxy client let's rename symbol to

internal API rename no there's no like confirmation button or something I would

assume there' be like a button at the bottom here that says go nuts what is this Mt about why why is this upset

about the type definitions oh it's the es lint I think the es lint is out of date but the types script isn't because

you can see here I have the type definition but eslint is saying it's an unsafe assignment of an any because eslint didn't get the change that we

have a different name for this thing internal API now very interesting very interesting I have saved the changes

they've been saved in all the files that I did them in so they also get this sync issue in VSS code I get the issue where

I have to reset the typescript server but usually the es lint server catches up es lint being broken separately is new to me is there a reset there's

restart language server it looks like while I was doing that this corrected itself interesting it might have been because I hadn't opened this file since

the change and it was caching that editor level I can't know any of this for sure the goal here is just to like

play with it and see which quirks it does or doesn't have if I should actually commit to using this editor for a bit again let me know in the comments

and I'll give it a shot for a little longer other people are saying they often have to reset es lint more than they have to reset the typescript server

very interesting someone else pointed out it's cool you have es lint support out of the box I absolutely agree having es L to typescript in all of this

without any plugins CU like I don't have any plugins installed on this I don't have anything installed right now like here are my settings there's nothing

let's try some other fun things more typescript quirks I should be able to command click hello and get to the trpc

function in the server folder and it works dope having that type of deep type inference is essential for any editor

that I use so if I'm in some client or like user facing code and I want to quickly do anything like I want to just

figure out where this is coming from or like make a change to what it's returning having command click working

here is huge and the last time I played with a zed this was not working previously it would bring me to weird places in like my type definitions for

trpc itself now it actually goes properly all the way to the place where this is written hopefully it still does this on client components one way to

test that it still does good stuff should I actually try typing now cuz thus far I have avoided actually editing

in the editor let's see how this feels this is a test to see how typing here feels overall I'm impressed the auto

comment continuation is also a nice touch I don't know if you guys saw that it's hard see cuz I don't have my key

presses on screen but when I press enter it continues the comment for me that's really nice it's doing some type of Auto

formatting here too not quite as much as I would have liked but let's see if I tab this out that looks like it's doing

pretty your stuff properly Mark pointed out there was a lot of pop-ups when I was typing here when I wasn't typing it in a comment there was but it seems like

when I'm in a comment it chills out but when I'm typing here this is a test typing yeah the um the spam of like it

trying to autocomplete [¬†__¬†] is a little annoying because it's so fast that it does it quickly but it just it flashes

all over the screen when I'm typing like do you see how annoying that is that would piss me off so much I would just

add a debounce to that so when I type a letter you don't prompt me with that until I've waited for at least a few milliseconds that I also find this

really annoying ESP when I'm making content because I'll be typing something and just my screen's flashing all over the place and it makes the video super

distracting so for me in particular that's kind of a no-o yeah also the dialogue should be smaller people are saying it's pretty big I will say I I'm

on a 720p effective screen when I'm doing content so I don't know if it's less bad in other cases but now it's

taking up a ton of my screen that said VSS code sucks about this too and I type trpc like it still starts to do things

but it's nowhere near as brutal about it the jsts server immediately crashed five times great sign responsive test this is

me getting a gut feel of the responsiveness in vs code this is me

getting a gut feel of responsiveness in said I'll be honest guys doesn't feel

much better just typing like that does that come off in the video does this seem

faster because it doesn't feel very different to me curious if that Quirk

was still happen in comments what happen here I am adding cool it does not so when I press single quote or double

quote double quote it will automatically double up but single quote it won't

because a single quote might be a contraction but a single quote here doesn't necessarily know that and it

always doubles it up so when I'm doing I'm now m is surrounded even though it's in a comment so kind of annoying that

when I'm typing a comment I have to go through and delete a bunch of things it's randomly adding for me I'll be honest I've always been annoyed when you

make a tag and it autoc closes it for you I don't want that on single Pern in

a comment ever but in general I've never been a big fan of it so I am biased there one of the really interesting

things that Z's trying to do different is focus on collaboration most editors have some crappy plugin where you can

share an instance and I'll be honest every time I tried it was a Jank experience I've never had a good time using VSS code with two people on

different computers and usually I just prefer to screen share and Discord or something I am curious how this works with multiple people working in one

thing together first off there's a chat which is actually really nice to have a built-in live chat they have a concept

of channels where I can create a channel if anybody has Z let's try it we're going to make a t3g channel it wants my

microphone is there a way I can mute that oh there it is it's in the top right corner very interesting to have AV

built into the editor also a share screen option so I can share my screen Beyond just the editor so if I want to

showcase like what I'm actually working on like I want to showcase what the the browser does in the background while I

make changes really cool that it supports that can people join the t3g channel is this public or private how

does this work cool I trust you Yash I don't want to call you no I sorry I do

not think just clicking your name would call that's uh unintended I am sorry I don't know how to stop calling either

there's no way to do that remove contact yeah just on a call yeah the UI for this is a little Jank I do not like that I

can accidentally call somebody by clicking on their name like call things should should at least have like a

separate button for it there's no rightclick Behavior at all like I'm right clicking on people and doesn't do anything I just don't get this join

Channel none of these things appear to be doing anything it still has me calling Yash and I don't know how to to

stop that does revoke right access do it no share leave call okay that was dumb

on the channel invite members oh I can just make it public and now you have been invited aore there's join Channel

and open Channel notes okay the channel notes is this thing in the middle here so we can save like a markdown dock

notes hi friends aore are you able to edit those notes is this safe though can you run a terminal command fantastic

question oh hi from aore hi aore do you have access to my terminal here let me try can't open my terminal can you see

what I typed in it though you have your yours open cool um yeah I'm very curious how much you do and do not have you

can't even see it interesting I have mixed feelings on this on one hand it's

actually pretty cool to think about your coding environment as a a shared

collaborative place can you see that you're on your project you already did Z clab at work it's fun oh interesting I

have mixed feelings on this it's a really cool idea to have good collaboration tools baked into your

editor it gives you a ton of Opp opportunity to innovate in ways like a plugin simply can't and I like the idea

that it's not a plugin for this like the vs code live share plugin despite being somewhat baked in is pretty Jank this

despite being early and Jank feels like it has more potential to integrate deep in and I am excited to see where it goes

but the ux is rough like the fact that when you click someone's name it starts an audio call with them in my editor is

terrifying to me I hate that that's that's not something I can support like ever and I will probably be disabling

this feature until there's like a major update I want to better understand what the AI autocomplete experience is like

oh I can sign in for co-pilot here cool co-pilot is enabled look at that we got co-pilot

working dope pump that even though they have aspirations to do their own AI stuff that co-pilot is already built in

and working as I would expect that's dope it's nice that I don't feel the need to run and grab any plugins there

are little things that I've been using a lot in vs code recently that I like I go through my extensions obviously having

language things like um Astro and such is really nice I love cloak for hiding Secrets Dino is nice to have support for

directly they already have es lint built in they have co-pilot built in haven't played with their git stuff I'm not a big G in the IDE person but a lot of

other people are so that'll be missing which is notable the things I've been thinking about though obviously my

themes I love the PO Manders theme it'd be really nice if they had a way to import VSS code themes because it's like a standard-ish syntax somebody will

probably hack that or at least make a converter in the future it seems like it's doing all the prettier stuff for me already so that's cool the two I was

thinking of the that I'm going to miss are pretty typescript errors and quick lint JS these two plugins are very good

I already have a video for pretty typescript errors the typescript just got so much better if you want to know more about the pretty typescript error

plug-in check the video out it required a ton of hacks by the dev to make it work but the results super cool and I rely on it a ton you can see here that

it will actually make you this nice printed out formatted error thing instead of the absolute mess that

typescript normally gives you super super cool and then quick lint if you're not familiar I haven't made a video about this yet it checks for a bunch of

basic JavaScript typescript things like using an equals accidentally in an if statement awaiting something that isn't

async little type errors that are pretty common and it's super super fast so you

get feedback like immediately which is really cool that like on each character you're getting feedback I've been

enjoying quick lint quite a bit and again let me know in the comments if I should do a whole video about quick lint because it is a pretty cool project but

in order to care about those things we first need to see how Zed handles when you do something wrong so let's spell

post wrong how quickly when I add the T will I no longer have a type error pretty quick and if I have the type error and I

hover over oh no it's the super unreadable type errors also if you notice I get

different type errors depending on how far in I am because these are all accessing an unsafe any I don't know if

vs code is smart enough to not do that but there's only one way to check so have here we get the nasty tyri error

but then we get the much better formatted error from the Pretty typescript error plugin but over these

further down things now this is all the unsafe any yeah so equally bad there but

at least I can use my plugin here which I cannot use in Z in my opinion if Zed's goal is to make something better enough

than vs code that we all start switching these types of ux wins are a really big thing if you can do them because if you

produce enough of these wow moments for a developer that might not know about these plugins might not know about these other things this can be a huge huge win

for building like positive sentiment and getting them to go shill it to their friends and getting me to talk really positively about it in a video all those

types of things seeing if there is do they have any plugin system at all I don't think they do not upset with it in

any way one more thing we should probably test is auto importing what's the I can import okay we have the create

post deleting this component deleting the import for this component let's try

mounting it now the flash of that is so annoying and

also that all these mdn references come up before my own code like I have to press arrow down how many times to get

to my thing and also the width of this changes that's Jank that feels not good

that all like this UI shifts around as I try to get to the right thing and that what I'm here for is so low priority I

have to type the whole word create and even just type in create it still has credentials container canvas capture

media and all these other things that don't start with create because the fuzzy search sucks create all those

letters are in order in credentials container it has the letters for create in order but something that starts with

create should be first for sure this is [¬†__¬†] these are the little things that like are hard to get right that will be

fixed over time but feel Jank right now and if the goal of something like Zed is to offer a meaningful user experience

improvement over vs code these things matter way way more so that's a little

disappointing if I click it did it Auto Import correctly it did cool so at least the auto importing works but the ranking

there was terrible I'm happy I checked that one good one is EnV this is a new project so this won't leak anything but

it looks like it would have if I hadn't like been sure that it's good ahead of time is that a that's a no co-pilot icon

something I have to rely on is the ability to hide secrets with something like cloak because there's nothing worse than accidentally exposing your secrets

on stream if I go to here I can turn on cloak and now you'll see all the secrets are hidden very very useful and I try to

turn this on before I stream code so that I never accidentally leak environment variables again these things are small but enough of them add up and

one of the things you need in order to win with a challenging new product like this is you need to win sentiment from

the people who can sprad spread that and share that sentiment so I as a a creator with reach as dumb as it is that I'm

saying you should prioritize my quirks and my needs because most users won't benefit that much from having their secrets autohide it makes me more

confident when I use it to make content which then reaches the users you want to potentially have this is the thing I've been talking with a lot of companies

about especially when I'm Consulting it's the idea that targeting creators despite their weird needs that might not overlap with your users it's actually a

really powerful tool to hit product Market fit earlier and get your product in front of others earlier there's two

reasons one we have the reach so if we can use the product we'll reach that audience but two and arguably more

important if you can't win us you can't win our fans creators and influencers in these spaces especially nowadays deeply

understand the things that their viewers and Their audience want to use and work with we might be pickier but we're also

more understanding and we're more willing to have these conversations and hear these things out and I've regularly been surprised at how much value I and

other creators can bring to companies by giving feedback on the product and why we would or wouldn't use it we are kind of a representative minority of the

space because in order for us to get people to watch our videos we have to understand what they like and what they resonate with and with that deeper

understanding we're often positioned to to give better feedback and also we spend more time thinking about what our

audience would like so if you can't convince us to use your thing despite us having that mindset where we can think

kind of the way all of our different viewers think and all the different groups and if you can't convince us that it's good enough for one of those groups

it's going to be really hard to convince them yourself so again I feel bad saying make the things creators want but if

your target audience is the people who watch those creators making them happy can help a ton I will say I'm impressed

especially when you consider that they don't get to lean on much existing work here like they have treesitter in fact the treesitter devs are some of the core

team for Zed they have the typescript language server running in the background and allowing them to get all the data they need here but they are

missing a lot of the pieces that exist because of the size of the existing VSS code and JavaScript ecosystem like

another thing people just brought up is the Tailwind auto complete oh wow looks like they

hardcoded the Tailwind auto complete in it's PT this I don't love like weird things

get mixed into the autocomplete but at least that works does it have the hover to see the actual CSS that applies it

does not interesting and does the prettier organizer organize things correctly it does not okay so this is

again like because they can't lean on the existing tools they have to build their own versions of it so we do get a

lot of the Tailwind autocomplete help here which is really nice like I can Tailwind like group or Tailwind like

lgp whatever and it's smart enough to know what that is but it doesn't let me hover over to see what these things are

versus in VSS code I hover over one of these and tells me the exact class there another thing it doesn't seem to support that I push really hard is the auto

sorting prettier plugin for tailin which makes your tailin code way more readable because everything's in the same order I intentionally put this padding too far

forward because now when I save it's going to get moved to the right spot which is in this Chunk in either the

middle or the end depending on which classes you have that has all the padding behaviors I've learned this order it's really good the prettier Auto

sort Tailwind plugin is dope and I genuinely think everyone should be using it if they're using Tailwind so not having that sucks because they didn't

Implement prettier bindings they implemented a bunch of prettier functionality into their editor they

didn't implement the Tailwind plugin they implemented a bunch of Tailwind functionality into the editor this is also why open sourcing is so important

because if they didn't open source building and maintaining all of these things becomes really really difficult

really really quickly and I'm hopeful that the choice to open source will make it more likely the community supports these things going forward that said if

the Tailwind stuff is written rust I'm curious to see how that goes we can check the source code quick

though interesting they have the tail and prettier plug-in package it should work then although if you think about it

it's pretty wild to see tailwind and prettier in the source code of Zed especially when you compare to like the

vs code GitHub if we search in here for Tailwind nothing search in here for pretty a they might use it but it's not

part of vs code itself because these are all plugins that are external extensions whereas with zed these are all built-in

features and rust I don't necessarily love this but open sourcing is a huge step in making future extensions that

are more usable also how hilarious is it that Tailwinds considered a language the point stands having to support things

that deeply in your editor is a scary thought and the amount of work that the poor Zed team has had to do to create

all of these bindings is a little terrifying oh no oh no I see what

they're doing since Tailwind is a subset language not a proper Lang language which obviously Tailwind is not a

programming language in order to get their auto complete in their adapter working in all the other places you

might use Tailwind they had to manually bind the Tailwind parser to every language you might use Tailwind with

including we not limited to CSS Elixir heeks hex I've no idea what heex is TSX

JavaScript HTML Erb spelt PHP and more referen coming up there but yeah the

fact that they have to bind Tailwind hardcoded to every single language for it to work is incredibly not extensible

and again with like not having plugin support for other things like Tailwind to exist or for Tailwind changes to

happen or God forbid Tailwind version 4 has different classes than Tailwind version 3 you're [¬†__¬†] the fact that

these language parsers have to have such weird additional assignments made for it to work is scary also like the first

line in the language in nit is an Elixir settings register so Elixir has to do some special things and they always run

this code even if you're not using Elixir so these types of hacks are necessary when you don't have a plugin

system and they're a little scary that said they did just open

source this code and I'm not here to just [¬†__¬†] on people's code like this isn't bad code it's scary to maintain as

an open source project and that's a thing we should think about and be honest about they do have a plugins directory interesting for child and

children if okay path child path config read language config if it matches then

they register it enter interesting yeah and they're registering it through a wasm layer too that means they can safely run rust code in like a

virtualization layer and also they can run other languages including JavaScript and typescript this is very interesting

how this is architected I'm even more excited about reading through how that rewrite worked so again let me know in the comments if I should make a video

about the whole rewrite the file for all the language support including loading plugins is under 300 lines of code

that's not too bad and enough you pointed out that GPI is cool that I'll quickly touch on it it is actually really interesting the goal of GPI is to

do a GPU accelerated UI framework written in Rust so that you have rust code that runs native UI there hasn't

really been anything like this before at least that I know of they've stated a lot of their goals here and actually really surprised the quality of what they've written here they point out

there three different registers that they've created depending on the way you want to build this UI interesting this

is Swift UI I know most of y'all aren't Swift UI users but this is Swift UI this is the Swift UI sytax look familiar yeah

that is fascinating to me I haven't talked much about Swift UI and I have a lot of opinions but I think they they

took the right lessons from react and it is interesting to see other things doing it I am very curious about the decision

to use div here as the example is Zed using a web container that's rendering

divs or are they rendering native UI wasum is not a UI layer it has like if

this is running in a browser shell this is would be wum doesn't I don't care about how where it's running I care

about what it's rendering to does this render to some type of extension of a canvas or a dawn or is this making

native UI with like GPU calls cuz they pointed out that it's GPU accelerated a GPU accelerated UI framework for rust

create a new window with app context open window and register your first view there is nowhere near enough info here

seems like it's running native I'm very confused by the choice of using a div in their example because if you're deep

enough in web that you don't know this divs are a web concept even react native doesn't have a div like if you write

react native code you cannot render a div in it you have to render a react native view or text element leveraging

rust in the GPU to render user interface at 12 FPS they're calling out my concern if like divs are slow because you're doing the web layer good old Evan

Wallace code if you don't know Evan Wallace he also created es build this dude is like the JavaScript and

JavaScript accessories performance wizard yall remember in my recent video where I said game devs don't appreciate

the web and US finding new ways to render and render because they're still trying to get text to render and a bunch

of people in the comments were like you don't know anything about Native devs and like performant Dev if you think we don't know how to R text or you think

that's hard to do here's a five page section on why it's not that easy to

render text you stupid [¬†__¬†] I'm sorry but like if you're building native stuff and you're trying to build native

stuff for performance reasons you do have to care about how text renders and as you see here it is not easy to do

they also cited the Pathfinder crate which seems to be the existing rust UI

rasterization layer that they didn't think was good enough for their needs fascinating this is proof they're actually doing native code code they're

not doing things in the browser which makes me really confused about the choice to have like div and flex all in

their example because div and flex are both very Web Concepts as well as justify Center item Center all these

things are very Webby if you have the opportunity to build something new from scratch I'm a little confused why you'd bring the web Primitives somebody said

they just picked the name div instead of View kind of but they also picked Flex they also picked justify Center and item

Center they're taking a lot of the way we do things in web which is very interesting and not necessary react

native took very little from web they took a bit but not a lot and even things like Flex they they tried to take but

they they built them differently like it's a silly thing but a really interesting example of how react native

differs from react for web by default react web Flex boxes are horizontal and you have to specify B vertical react

native Flex boxes are default vertical you have to specify horizontal it's a small detail but these things add up as

you swap between platforms a lot I'm interested in why they chose to go the web Direction here there's a lot going

on in this project and I'm really curious to see where it goes from the Native layer and rust for the GPU stuff to everything they're doing with collab

and AI there's an interesting thing going on here and I'm really excited that it's not just happening but it's

now open source I don't see myself leaving vs code anytime soon but I am excited for a future where there's more

competition and more Innovation happening within our editors what about you do you still use vs code have you made the switch over to Vim or are you

one of the few remaining Sublime Text holdouts that just won't move yet I'd love to hear what you're using if you want to see me make vs code even worse I

have a great video in the corner here where I let chat decide what I would do to my vs code and I promise you it's

terrible see you guys in the next one appreciate you all a ton peace NS

summary:
The video discusses the transition from traditional text editors like Sublime Text to VS Code, emphasizing the performance issues often associated with VS Code due to its Electron framework. Despite its performance, VS Code's extensive plugin ecosystem and features like debugging have attracted many developers.

The main focus of the video is the introduction of Zed, a new code editor. Here's a summary of the key points discussed about Zed:

1. **Performance and User Experience**:
    
    - Zed aims to balance native performance and a rich plugin ecosystem. It's designed to offer the speed of editors like Vim and Sublime Text while providing a UI-focused, extensible platform similar to VS Code.
2. **Creation and Open Source Nature**:
    
    - The team behind Zed includes the original creators of Atom and Electron. With Zed, they're trying to rectify some of the performance drawbacks of Electron-based editors. Zed is open source, a significant step, especially considering that Zed is a startup.
3. **Zed 2.0 and GPL Licensing**:
    
    - The video discusses the major rewrite from Zed 1 to Zed 2, focusing on the Zed framework GPI. Zed's code is available under a copyleft license, specifically GPL for the editor and an Apache modification for server-side components.
4. **Focus on Collaboration and Business Model**:
    
    - Zed introduces innovative collaboration features, including built-in chat, channels, and AV capabilities, aiming to enhance the collaborative coding experience. The monetization strategy includes selling integrated services that complement the editor rather than selling the editor itself.
5. **User Experience in Zed**:
    
    - The presenter tests various features of Zed, like typing response, git integration, auto-complete, and collaboration tools. While impressed with some aspects, they also point out areas needing improvement, such as the user experience around auto-complete and collaboration features.
6. **Zed's Technical Architecture**:
    
    - The video delves into the technical side of Zed, discussing its GPU-accelerated UI framework, the choice of Rust for performance, and the interesting decision to adopt web-like elements in its design.
7. **Closing Thoughts**:
    
    - The presenter expresses excitement about the potential of Zed but also recognizes the challenges and the necessity for further development and community involvement. They remain a VS Code user for now but are keen to see how Zed evolves.


Overall, the video provides a detailed introduction to Zed, highlighting its aspirations to combine native performance with a rich feature set and addressing the need for better performance and collaboration in code editors.

Advantages of Zed:

1. **Native Performance**: Zed is designed to offer the speed and responsiveness of native editors like Vim and Sublime Text, addressing the performance issues often associated with Electron-based editors like VS Code.
2. **Rich Plugin Ecosystem**: Despite being a new entrant, Zed aims to provide a plugin and UI-focused ecosystem similar to VS Code, enabling extensive customization and functionality.
3. **Innovative Collaboration Features**: Zed introduces built-in chat, channels, and AV capabilities, aiming to enhance the collaborative coding experience significantly.
4. **Open Source Nature**: Being open source, Zed can tap into a large pool of developer talent for contributions, ensuring continuous improvement and community-driven development.
5. **Focused on User Experience**: The editor is designed with attention to user experience, offering features like immediate git updates, intuitive git interactions, and a thoughtful setup process.
6. **Technical Architecture**: Zed's use of a GPU-accelerated UI framework and the choice of Rust for performance indicate a strong technical foundation aimed at efficiency and speed.
7. **Integration with Popular Tools**: Zed includes built-in support for tools like ESLint and Co-pilot, ensuring that developers have access to necessary functionalities without needing additional plugins.

Drawbacks of Using Zed:

1. **Early Development Stage**: Zed is not yet at version 1.0, meaning it's still in the early stages of development and may lack stability and feature completeness compared to mature editors like VS Code.
2. **Limited Plugin Support**: While Zed aims to provide a rich plugin ecosystem, it's still new, and the range of available plugins might not match that of VS Code.
3. **User Experience Quirks**: Users have reported issues with the user experience, such as the auto-complete feature being too aggressive and distracting, and some UI elements being unintuitive.
4. **Limited Language Support**: The necessity to hardcode language support for features like Tailwind CSS into the editor might limit the flexibility and extensibility of language-specific features.
5. **Mac-Only (for now)**: Currently, Zed is available only for macOS, which limits its accessibility to developers using other operating systems, though there are plans to support other platforms in the future.
6. **Collaboration Feature UX**: While the collaboration features are innovative, the UX around these features, like the ease of accidentally starting a call, needs refinement.
7. **Complexity in UI Framework**: Adopting web-like elements in its native UI framework might lead to complexities and performance implications, which could be challenging to manage as the project grows.

In summary, Zed brings a fresh approach to code editors with its focus on performance, collaboration, and user experience. However, being in the early stages of development, it faces challenges in terms of feature completeness, plugin support, and refining its user experience.
