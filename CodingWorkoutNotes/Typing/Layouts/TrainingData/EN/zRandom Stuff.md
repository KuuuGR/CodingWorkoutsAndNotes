Transcription: 

Intro - why we are learning AI

we are going back to school and yes you

heard that right when I say we I mean

you and me I'm ready I'm ready we're

going back to school backpack ready to

go a few weeks ago I shared that I am

going back to school for practical

Hands-On Ai and machine learning now

this is done through a school here in

Toronto that I'm going to be going to or

attending actually it's virtual oh it's

remote we're we're doing this remote

okay guess I'll just uh Park myself down

but you get the point attending these

classes this is a year-long program so I

am committed this feels like a

commitment I'm sharing this with you

because throughout my journey uh

learning about different areas around

artificial intelligence machine learning

having the exposure and experience from

both the technical side of things but

then also to the business side of things

I want to share it with you I want you I

mean this kind of sounds like a win-win

you get to take this course essentially

but for free I mean you're not taking

this course but I'm going to be sharing

with with you my learnings and my highs

my lows along the way I'm sharing this

with you or this recap with you because

it got me thinking as I was starting to

prepare for class which is coming up in

12 days which is Wild by the way I

thought Jeff what is your plan what is

your road map for learning AI are you

just going to go in and wing it or what

what's the plan other than of course

having a proper syllabus that I'm going

to follow and whatnot now I've been

studying AI for I would say about the

past year on my own I've been sharing a

lot of my learnings with you so that's

not going to change it's just in a more

formal setting I I just felt like I

wanted to take that next step I'm

sharing all this because I want to share

with you the road map that I came up

with for how to learn AI in 2024 now

this is a really it was really

challenging for me to come up with this

road map for a few reasons one because I

felt like it really depends on what role

or what area in AI you are interested in

that will depict what you are learning

about AI but I thought you know what's a

good place to start let's start with the

basics let's start with some key

Concepts from there let's go more into

some courses you can take some

communities you can join and what next

steps look like I think that sounds like

a good plan what do you think school

Tiff yeah that sounds good I guess I

guess I going take my backpack off

still all right she said so let's get

into

[Music]

it so regardless of what path you are

interested in when it comes to AI

What are the different types of AI

there's a few things that you should

know or terms you should know no matter

what let's break down the three kind of

ways AI is really looked at at a very

high level and I don't want to say three

types of AI or anything like that

because there's so many but let's focus

on the main three one being artificial

narrow intelligence Ori so this is

essentially how we interact often with

AI today so you can think of it as AI

performs a single task so something like

voice recognition or something like

recommendations on streaming services

this is using a an then we have AGI or

or artificial general intelligence and

this is something you've probably seen

in the news a lot or this is one of the

more common ones mainly because of

speculations of what it could look like

this is something we do not have today

uh but what it essentially is is the

ability for AI to understand learn adapt

and Implement knowledge across a wide

range of tasks at a human level so it

can solve its own problems build out

different solutions to things it doesn't

necessarily need us to guide it as much

then we have the third which is more

kind of like from Back to the Future

well I don't even think Back to the

Future was this far in the future but

that is a SI and that is artificial

super intelligence which honestly is

kind of what it sounds like it is well

they call it the final level of AI I

don't know but it refers to a futuristic

scenario where AI surpasses human

intelligence so it is taking one step

further you could say as far as its

ability to think on its own act on its

own and really be able to do many if not

yeah I would say many jobs that we do

today now this is not a video to scare

you about what the future of AI could

look like but more so just to make you

aware of the different types of AI or

how it's kind of categorized and before

we get to ASI super intelligence we are

very far from that so let's just keep

that in mind and I think as we always do

as humans we figure it out as we go

along and that's the beauty of it

anyways let's keep on diving into it I

also wanted to cover what is the

difference between something like data

What is the difference between AI, Machine learning, Deep learning

science artificial intellig machine

learning or deep learning I'll put up on

screen here this graph or chart which I

think does a good job of explaining it

and I wanted to break down these topics

for you because they're often used

interchangeably or tied so close

together which in some scenarios makes

sense but in others we almost generalize

these big topics just because they're

buzzwords so as you can see from this

diagram AI is programs with the ability

to learn and reason like humans machine

learning is the algorithms with the

ability to learn without any explicitly

programmed so they are learning from

models and data and just really

understanding as far as um they're

they're based on algorith they are

algorithms at the end of the day then we

have deep learning which is essentially

a subset of machine learning in which a

artificial neural networks adapt and

learn from larger databases so as you

can see even with in AI there is so many

layers to it and it can get intense

pretty quickly I know what you're

thinking well maybe you're not what

you're thinking but I'll tell you what I

was thinking when I was learning all

this well if there is so much to AI what

is the point of even learning it seems

like every time I take a course or have

a discussion about it I feel like I'm

falling behind and I hear you on that I

feel that way often times too one thing

I've learned though throughout uh

learning AI or any other technology is

you just need to take it step by step

the worst thing you can do is just not

try to learn at all because of that

feeling of H it's just moving too

quickly for me it's okay you will feel

caught up at some point it's just that

initial learning curve that can feel a

little bit overwhelming so I just wanted

to say that as a side side note don't

get too caught up on how vast the

subject is especially which brings me to

my next point is having an understanding

What area of AI should you focus in on?

of what area in AI you want to focus on

let's use the example of say you are

interested in ethics around Ai and

regulations around that maybe you come

from a law degree or a psychology

background and you're really interested

in that side especially around the

regulations with AI now this is

something where I wouldn't suggest okay

you need to go start with python

learning programming in order to become

an expert in that area it's more so

around the psychology of it the

regulations the the law that's required

with these regulations th those are

areas you need to be an expert in now

you do need to be extremely educated on

artificial intelligence and its

capabilities as well to make those

decisions but you don't need to become a

programmer and I really wanted to

highlight that because before you even

dive into your journey with AI take time

to understand how you want to use this

how you want to use this in your career

how you want to grow with AI what what's

the purpose of your learnings and even

if it's just because you want to learn

something interesting that will look

different as well all right let's move

on to some courses now these are courses

that are both Technical and some are

non-technical for the reason being I

know we have an audience of both and I

think even if you are a technical person

maybe you don't want to dive into the

technical side of AI and that's fine too

I talk about these courses a lot the

What are good courses to learn AI?

first ones I'm going to mention which is

course Sarah courses mainly because they

are taught by some of the world's best

lead ERS when it comes to AI I mean deep

learning specialization this is a course

that covers deep learning structured

machine learning projects and neural

networks and this of course is by one of

cor s's co-founders Andrew so it's a

really great course now I haven't taken

this course specifically but I've taken

a ton of other courses by him around Ai

and they are so brilliant the way he can

break down topics and such a simplistic

form is really incredible the other one

I want to share with is Udacity so if

you are interested in really garnering

or gaining that degree or certification

Udacity is definitely a place to check

out one that stands out to me is the

machine learning engineer Nano degree so

this is a program that focuses on

Advanced machine learning techniques and

algorithms so if you are more on the

technical side I would definitely

recommend checking this out I mean it

always is good too to get that

certification or in this case a nano

degree that you can put on your

LinkedIn I don't know I need sound

effect can you tell it's been end of day

I've had too much

coffee it's it's I'm in Canada it's get

it's dark at like 5: now it's it's

happening all right let's keep on moving

one more I want to share with you is

about MIT open courseware I love MIT I

love their newsletter I love every

they're just so Innovative I think

they're great one course though that

they offer is called introduction to

deep learning so this is a course that

really starts from the foundations

working the way up into deep learning

methods and application so this is more

so kind of a mix of Technical and

non-technical but i' recommend it to

both um individuals all right let's talk

a little bit about community and I think

this is funny because I don't hear when

I read online you know when I research

for these videos I read online what

other people are saying and other guides

around the road map for 2024 Ai and

sometimes they can be so specific that I

think who is this for because it sounds

like you're making it seem like the only

people that can get into learning about

AI or these super hackers or the other

side is it's very non-technical it feels

like well what like who is your audience

and that's why for this video I wanted

to keep it very realistic as though that

everyone every single person watching

this video has their own Journey no

one's alike and your goals with your

learnings are all unique as well and

that's really important to keep in mind

because there's no prescription overall

that I can be like next you need to

Learn Python next you need to learn that

What are some Ai communities to join?

because that's not accurate it really

depends on what you want to do the

purpose of this video is more so for you

to uncover that take away what some of

the key topics are and that's that's why

I really wanted to bring up Community

because Community is one of those things

that if you don't have it you're going

to struggle often times we will struggle

I'll speak for myself often times I will

struggle with learning something new I

need that sense of community to bring me

up support me I'll share right on screen

here some of my favorite communities uh

especially in the artificial

intelligence World also okay this is a

really cool thing that I do see look at

this is this like what was that movie

the um Godfather or I don't know what's

old movie they're like welcome sorry I'm

going on tangent now one thing I do

though often times is on LinkedIn just

as a little tip I will follow different

thought leaders in Technologies I'm

interested in so in artificial

intelligence in future Tech that's a

really great way to stay up to date

easily on different topics that they are

sharing about I mean I try and be one of

those individuals too um I I love using

LinkedIn for that as well so just

following people there that really bring

education and insight into your dayto

day I don't know why I've kind of

gravitated towards LinkedIn lately for

that all right I hope you found this

video helpful between sharing some

courses giving you some communities to

join some different tips as well as kind

of giving starting the video off with

covering some really big topics that are

often spoken about almost too casually

when it comes to Tech where people don't

really have the context or understanding

what these topics are about with machine

learning or deep learning so I really

want to cover those as well I hope you

found this video helpful and valuable

leave in the comments you know I got to

say this leave in the comments any other

videos you want me to make and I will

see you all soon it's time for dinner

and no more coffee for me

Transcription:

a few months ago I dropped a major Cliffhanger  secretly 453 is possible but that's a topic  
for another day today I'll finally share the  secret with you and unless you already know  
what's coming it's probably not what you  think the answer is very unintuitive see  
in order to go faster in Super Mario  Brothers we need to go slower for as  
welln as this game is today we'll be exploring  some territory that's likely foreign to a lot  
of you watching it's time to break down how  453 is possible on the pal version and how  
the fastest version of Super Mario Bros is  actually the slowest version of Super Mario
[Music] Bros real quick did you guys know that  with Netflix now you can do more than just watch  
things you can also play things this video is  sponsored by Netflix games right now included  
with your Netflix membership you have access to  over 80 mobile games you've got games like Sonic  
Prime Dash on there there's some good stuff let's  go over how it works on the home screen in the app  
you swipe down to find the mobile games row and  from there you just scroll through until you find  
what you want to play tap on the game you want tap  get game it's that easy there's a whole bunch to  
choose from and here are some pretty cool examples  some of my personal picks would be Shovel Knight  
pocket dungeon and definitely Bloon Tower Defense  6 but yeah you can play all these games right from  
the Netflix app with no extra fees and best of  all no ads if you're interested click the link  
in the description and go check out Netflix games  and thanks to Netflix games for sponsoring today's
video all right let's talk about the fastest  version of Super Mario Bros a version you may  
be entirely un familiar with we're talking  about the pal version pal P stands for phase  
alternating line it was one of three major analog  color television standards the others being ntsc  
and ccam look this is a video about speedrunning  Mario not electrical engineering so I'll keep it  
brief because the longer I talk about this the  more likely I am to make mistakes and get flamed  
in the comments but the context here is really  important so we're going to try basically the part  
that's relevant to this video is that different  countries have different standards for how their  
TVs and their electrical outlets work nowadays  our TVs use digital signals instead of analog so  
this is less relevant but back in the day it  was pretty important to design things around  
the frequency or Hertz of the electric currents  coming out of your power outlets in Japan you  
know the country where Nintendo games are made  they use the ntsc standard which means electric  
currents alternate in and out of their home at 60  htz or 60 times every second games and TV signals  
were designed around this so the typical NES game  runs at 60 frames per second that means we redraw  
the whole screen 60 times every second to give  the appearance of motion and put the video in  
video game most of the Americas also use ntsc  so the majority of my audience you played the  
ntsc version of Nintendo games in all their 60fps  Glory you played them as they were designed and  
as they were intended now let's talk about pal in  Europe Australia most of the world really besides  
America and Japan they're working off 50 HZ since  the early 2000s that hasn't posed so much of a  
problem in the video game realm but before then  oh boy 50 HZ means retro games were running at 56  
the speed compared to their ntsc counterparts if  a game was originally 60 frames per second that  
means now it would run at 50 FPS but sometimes  games were 30 FPS so that meant 25 FPS and then  
there's Ocarina of Time being drawn on the  screen at a blistering 17 frames per [Music]
second so yeah to sum things up the majority of  video games were made in regions that used 60 HZ  
and designed with that in mind when the games  were sent over to countries that Ed 50 HZ they  
had to be adjusted there were a few different  approaches taken when adjusting games to run at  
50 frames per second and there were definitely  some mixed results we one approach is to just  
do nothing let the game Run at 56 speed and  call it a day this is how that turns [Music]
out yeah not a very pretty outcome some games got  a little bit better treatment it started being  
fairly common to at least adjust the music  and sound effects even if if the gameplay  
wasn't totally optimized for 50 FPS it wasn't  painstakingly obvious that anything was out of  
order I'd say Mario Kart 64 is a good example  the game looks and plays pretty good unless you  
also saw or played the ntsc version you probably  wouldn't even realize that your carts are driving  
a little bit slow a decent number of games got  this sort of okay treatment but every now and  
then a game would be optimized exceptionally  well for pal the best example I'm familiar with  
is Super Metroid unless you're really familiar  with the game you probably wouldn't even know  
the difference just by watching footage now let's  pause and think about just how many things there  
are to change to account for just the change in  frame rate you of course have to adjust all the  
sounds and music so that they sound normal there's  also some obvious physics changes like making the  
player move a little bit faster so they don't  look sluggish but you have to be careful doing  
this could probably introduce some new bugs right  we'll get there but focusing back on adjusting the  
player speed that's not not as easy as it sounds  on paper you've got horizontal speed and vertical  
speed you've also got acceleration that's going  to affect all your jump Heights your attacks  
a million things and that's just the player  character how about the enemies the environments  
the animations of all these things it's a  Herculean task and even if you put in the effort  
to tweak every little detail it's probably still  not going to be perfect more often than not it'll  
be impossible to directly translate the original  data values you can't just multiply everything by  
1.2 decimals can be tricky business even modern  computers can't deal with decimals perfectly all  
the time but a lot of older Hardware didn't have  any capacity for decimals developers got pretty  
creative but nothing was ever perfect and yes  this did sometimes lead to new unintended Behavior  
like in Super Metroid because of the difference in  samus's speed or the speed that the door closes or  
both I'm not really sure you can just barely jump  out of this room before the door closes and skip  
a boss fight all right all of that being said are  you ready to talk about Super Mario Bros it's been  
a bit but I hope you're still with me let's talk  about the pal version of smb1 this game got all  
right treatment when it came to converting to 50  FPS some stuff slipped through and wasn't really  
changed like the speed that platforms move or how  long Bowser takes to fall in the lava and stuff  
like the PowerUp sound is pretty nasty if you're  used to the ntsc version these things aren't too  
to bad for the most part though and despite all  that they did manually adjust quite a few things  
the speed that fire bars rotate the speed the  enemies move the music is adjusted and it's fine I
guess the pal version also came out a couple years  later so they went ahead and patched some bugs and  
they even adjusted some things like how bloopers  swim so you can't just stand around on the bottom  
and be safe safe from them but all right let's  talk about the things that we'd be interested in  
for a speedrun things like the length of a frame  rule the original frame rule is a 21 frame cycle  
that dictates a lot of things in the game the  pal version runs at 56 speed so they adjusted  
the length the infamous 21 frame rule is now  the 18 frame rule an 18 frame cycle at 50 FPS  
is pretty close to a 21 frame cycle at 60 FPS  but not exactly the same the optimal cycle for  
speedrunning every stage is going to be different  due to this but it's going to be different for  
a lot more reasons than just that they of course  also had to adjust Mario's speed Mario's top speed  
could actually be perfectly changed from 40 to  48 so accounting for the difference in frame rate  
Mario runs through levels at the exact same speed  in both versions but remember top speed isn't all  
there is Mario's acceleration is actually faster  on pal sort of crazy fast you can really see see  
it in this room in 84 and once again horizontal  speed isn't all there is we have to think about  
vertical speed as well Mario can actually jump  higher in this version the easiest way to see  
that is with this row of bricks up high in the  very first level on the ntsc version you can't  
quite reach them but on pal you can surprisingly  having higher jumps doesn't really save time  
anywhere there aren't really any obstacles we  couldn't already clear but it's actually not  
Mario's Speed on the way up that we're interested  in let's talk about his speed on the way down a  
couple years ago happy lee released a video about  an impossible floor clip the basic premise is that  
in order to clip through the floor in this game  you would need to travel more than five pixels  
in a frame this game checks for Mario to land  anywhere in the top five pixels of the ground  
and when he does it snaps his position to the  top pixel if you could manage to go more than  
5 pixels deep you'd bypass the floor check and  enter the ground usually you don't get this much  
speed because as you fall and start to get close  to 5p Speed the game says uh-uh you can't go that  
fast and it caps your speed down to four but  sometimes you can get up to five speed for one  
single frame before it applies the speed cap and  puts your speed back to four here's a technical  
explanation by Des smile cat you can pause to  read if you want to understand the nitty-gritty  
the problem is that it's never normally possible  to be right next to the ground at the moment you  
do briefly hit 5 speed you're always too far away  to take advantage of the temporary higher speed  
in this video happily showed that you could  get the right positioning by doing a separate  
glitch to spawn a Vine at the start of one two  climbing on it lets you fine-tune your position  
and allows for the necessary conditions for the  floor clip a very Niche situation but a thing you  
can do all right all of that was about the ntsc  version of the game now let's talk about pal on  
pal Mario's downward speed cap is five instead  of four but the floor check is now the first six  
pixels of the floor so we need to get more than  six speed to get through as it turns out with  
the right conditions you can reach not just six  speed but even up to seven speed before the game  
applies the speed cap and puts you back down at  five that's sounding promising it can't be done  
just anywhere but it can be done in some places  and that's good enough for us one way to get the  
seven downward speed is jumping at a very specific  height and then landing on enemies we can do that  
here at the end of 1 one and clip into the ground  those who are familiar with the flag po glitch in  
this game know that it happens by grabbing the  flag lower than normal and if you can grab it  
especially low you'll get what we call the full  flag pole glitch where Mario falls out of the  
left side of the block and you instantly trigger  the timer countdown this is most commonly seen by  
bouncing on a Bullet Bill next to the flag since  bullet bills give you a really low bounce and it  
lets you grab the flag very low another good way  to grab the flag really low is by being very low  
ourselves down in the ground you can jump out  of the ground and into the flag triggering a  
full flag BookIt the smb1 warpless task gets in  the ground in various ways throughout the run  
and manages to pull this trick off several times  but now that we're talking about the pal version  
we have a pal exclusive way to get in the ground  once you bounce off these glomas and get in the  
ground at the end of 1 one you can run over to  the flag and get a full flag pull glitch since  
this skips not only the flag coming down but also  the kn for Mario to walk to the castle it saves a  
lot of time doing it this way in 1 one can save  around 1.4 seconds actually huge there aren't  
any other places we can clip near a flag pull in  the run but there is one other candidate for the  
floor clip to save time in one two to reach The  Warp Zone the falling platform lets us start a  
jump from all sorts of different heights and that  makes it possible to reach seven speed right next  
to the ground and clip in this trick combined  with Pal's very fast acceleration means we can  
do some tight movement to load the warp zone and  save 0.72 warping to World 4 one final perk of  
pal physics is in 42 on ntsc this is about the  hardest stage in the run it takes something like  
17 frame perfect inputs to match the task in  42 on ntsc but on pal you can kind of just jump  
backwards into a couple walls you get pushed  forwards plenty of pixels for the wrong warp  
to work you can do some simple Warp Zone movement  with Pal's really fast acceleration and yeah it  
ends up being being possibly the easiest stage to  match the Tas instead of the hardest the same is  
also true of 84 no need for constant double fast  acceleration jumps everywhere the stairs at the  
beginning are a little tricky but after that you  can mostly just hold right or left to accelerate  
where you need to and only lose a very small  handful of frames throughout the stage there is  
a trick in the third room where you land without  holding the Run button so you can turn around and  
get in the wrong warp pipe faster but that's a  tiny optimization in general getting a clean 84  
is pretty straightforward all right we've gone  over a few places where pal has version exlusive  
glitches that let us go faster than ntsc and the  stages that are usually the hardest are now the  
easiest this should definitely make 453 possible  the current world record does the floor clip in  
one one he doesn't do the one and one two and his  84 wasn't quite as good as he'd hoped moment of  
truth if we were to add all of these things into  his run what kind of a time would we [Music] get  
503 what gives that is so far off we're supposed  to be talking about 453 all right before you write  
your angry comment let's keep going even though  Mario can run through the stages at the same top  
speed as ntsc and accelerate faster and do brand  new glitches to save time the timer takes longer  
to count down the timer tis down once every frame  to award you points at the end of levels and since  
pal is only 50 frames per second instead of 60  that's sadly just going to take longer every  
time it happens we lose about a second on average  each time well if we're losing 5 Seconds to the  
timer counting down throughout the Run how are we  possibly going to get a 453 on this version here  
we go friends one more version exclusive trick  on the pal version the most powerful of them
all in my video about how 453 is almost possible  on ntsc I explained that it's just barely not  
possible to grab the flag low enough for a full  flag pull glitch without special conditions like  
an enemy or clipping in the floor even with the  best known approach and input combination Mario is  
a fraction of a pixel too far away but here we are  on the pal version with slightly different physics  
and what do you know it is possible wait if we can  do this why are we bothering clipping in the floor  
in one one why isn't the world record doing this  in runs on all of the flag Poes well here are the  
inputs you need to pull this trick off on top of  getting the perfect positioning with your jump to  
the flag pole you need to switch between left and  right on the d-pad every frame the d-pad has to  
be on left and then all the way down on right the  next frame then all the way down on left the next  
frame and then all the way to the right again  all frame perfectly with a frame perfect jump  
in the middle here's what that input sequence  looks like in real time these are some fast and  
physically difficult inputs it is possible to do  inputs like these by utilizing some interesting  
controller grips but it's really hard to do them  reliably Runners typically tackle them by holding  
the controller sideways and using their left hand  for a b and right on the d-pad they then use two  
fingers on the opposite hand to double flick  left on the d-pad on the surface this might  
just look like what Tetris players do where they  roll on the controller to get really fast inputs  
and they do that constantly so this can't be that  hard but it's more than that this has more moving  
parts and it's more precise you need the perfect  amount of pressure on both sides of the d-pad so  
you properly get left right left right it's  really easy for one of the inputs to not go  
through and just one frame of neutral anywhere  in the sequence will ruin everything all of this  
may start to sound a little familiar if you've  heard about the legendary final frame that was  
saved in 84 on ntsc an ultra hard input sequence  is required to do the beginning of the level at  
perfect speed the full flag P glitch inputs are  very similar to that and Runners have pulled that  
off but let's take a step back and remember that  this spot is infamously hard this is the hardest  
time save in the entire run on that version it  was the very last hurdle Runners had to overcome  
to prove that a perfect run was even theoretically  possible now here we are on the pal version where  
we need this type of thing once again but it  doesn't save one frame in this version it saves  
2.8 seconds on every flag pole they didn't adjust  the the length of the flag animation on the PO  
version so it's 20% slower than ntsc and skipping  it entirely saves a lot of time but doing so is  
so hard 453 is possible but is it really viable  to do this heart of a trick five times in one run  
Runners have shown that it's possible in general  the first person to prove it was three creepio  
showing that it could theoretically be done later  one other runner in particular took this concept  
and started tearing the game up with it to no  one's surprise it's Nifty about a year and a  
half ago he set out to try and match the task on  each stage individually here he is hitting the  
trick for the first time in a full run of 1-1 yes  yes no way a little while later he also managed  
to get it in a full run through of 4-1 as well as  an 83 nailing these three brought the human sum  
of best down to 46.5 getting close but wow still a  ways off when each one of them saves so much time  
it's kind of unfortunate in a way personally I  think we're actually really lucky that this trick  
isn't possible on ntsc it makes the run a lot more  interesting when you save a small amount of time  
in a bunch of different places rather than things  being over centralized on one big trick I think  
this trick would really ruin warpless categories  as well since you just want to focus on doing full  
flag P glitches instead of optimizing Bowser kills  and other interesting things like that anyway niy  
kind of hit a roadblock after he got those first  three levels done the two remaining stages with  
flag PES are a bit harder and more complicated  81 has some frame perfect pipe jumps and is a  
hard level in general you don't have time to  switch grips at the end of the stage so you  
have to play the entire thing in this awkward way  and it makes it hard just to get to the flag pole  
let alone do the full flag pole glitch and then  there's 82 which has a couple obstacles blocking  
your path the spiny egg that lacu throws at the  start is right in your way on the pal version  
you have to slow down a little bit to get past  it it's also not possible to get past this pipe  
without slowing down so that makes it tricky to  have consistent movement and be precisely lined  
up for the flag P glitch at the end these trials  were too much for niy to overcome and it turns out  
that 453 is completely impossible forever just  kidding last week niy learned I was working on  
this video and decided to go finish the job he  spent one day getting 81 and then another day  
getting 82 and just for good measure he took one  more day to do some attempts at 84 and managed to  
tie the task there to the frame as well granted  that is easier on this version than on ntsc but  
still very impressive and all of that makes  a perfect run of this version theoretically  
possible so what is the perfect time with all of  these tricks anyway sorry to say it guys but I've  
actually click baited you 453 isn't possible 452  is possible 42.2 if you do a perfect run of this  
game that's the time you'll get five full flag P  glitches floor clip in one two tight movement in  
42 and a perfect 84 that does leave about four  frame rules of wiggle room if we just want to  
get a 453 and officially make this the fastest  version of the game for speedrunners and just so  
happens that if you do the floor clip in 1 one for  the easier flag pole glitch and your movement is  
perfect throughout the stage age you can just  barely squeeze out a frame Rule and that lets  
you clock in just four frame rules behind the  regular full flag P glitch I think that could  
be a good approach to 453 but don't listen to  me I haven't ran this version let's hear things  
from the current world record holder miniland  who fittingly is from the UK a pal region let's  
hear what his thoughts are about the future of pal  what do I think the future of pal well it's highly  
dependent on if people actually care to run the  game so make a great video and make people want  
to play the game please please I really want  to see more people play pal I think 503 without  
full fpgs is very very doable once it hits 503 if  someone's interested enough and gets good at full  
fpgs which should happen people can get sub five  honestly the main reason the record on pal isn't  
lower is mostly just because very few people have  put time into it the ntsc version is a lot more  
widely popular and already has a storied history  but I wonder where we'd be if the ntsc version  
never existed what if the original was just  like this from the get-go here's the thing if  
ntsc didn't exist we would never have had Andrew  G sub five and all that say we liveed in a world  
where ntsc didn't exist and world record right  now was 505 pal there would be people looking at  
pal looking at the game and going do you know we  just have to do full fpgs and we get sub five the  
first ever time someone had ever beaten Mario won  in under 5 minutes and then they would go for it  
in a heartbeat say five people went for sub five  the first person gets sub five the others aren't  
just going to quit it's like 454 people keep going  and trying to improve it so I could see someone  
going oh you've got sub five I'm going to do more  flagpole glitches we'd be so much better at full  
fpgs than we are now because we have reason to  get good at them I think there's always going to  
be someone crazy enough to go record is this I'll  just one up it I'll do one more so there you go  
guys it could happen someday but it's way harder  to do than the current world record on the ntsc  
version is and the flag pull inputs aren't just  hard they also hurt doing this literally gives  
you blisters physically scraping your finger  across the d-pad like that you ever see people  
do 84 and they're wearing tape on their fingers  that's not for like friction or anything that's  
so they don't get injured or rather so they get  injured less but even with all these factors if  
people get enough interest it may one day happen  after all people are always asking what Runners  
are going to do after they finally get a perfect  run so maybe grinding the pal version is the  
next step sub five itself is going to be a huge  milestone for the pal version someday and maybe  
the thought of going even faster than ntsc can  will motivate someone down the road to try let's  
even say 45429 happens or something and people are  like we don't want to play anymore it's possible  
to get under ntsc on pal right that's what 453  means that would be the fastest completion of the  
game would that be an incentive to get 453 yes  but I would okay spoiling my next video that's  
right this isn't the end of the road sorry to do  this to you guys again but there is yet another  
approach we can take to try and beat Super Mario  Brothers faster than ever but once again that's a  
story for another day thanks for watching hey we  are really close to 200,000 subscribers I'm going  
to keep making videos like these so consider  subscribing if you enjoyed it [Music] helps

**Notes on How 453 is Possible in the PAL Version of Super Mario Bros**

1. **Introduction**:
    
    - The secret behind achieving a faster time in Super Mario Bros (Super Mario Bros) is counterintuitive - to go faster, one must initially go slower.
    - The video explores the PAL version of the game, highlighting how the slowest version of Super Mario Bros is technically the fastest due to specific version-exclusive tricks.
2. **PAL Version Overview**:
    
    - PAL stands for Phase Alternating Line, one of the three major analog color television standards.
    - The video explains the importance of different electrical standards, like NTSC in Japan and America (60 Hz) versus PAL in Europe and Australia (50 Hz), and how this affects the game's performance and speed.
3. **Impact of PAL Standard on Games**:
    
    - Due to the 50 Hz standard in PAL regions, games run at 56% the speed of their NTSC counterparts, leading to slower frame rates.
    - While some games were optimized for PAL, many were not, leading to noticeable differences in gameplay and performance.
4. **Super Mario Bros PAL Version**:
    
    - The PAL version of Super Mario Bros was adjusted for the 50 FPS frame rate, affecting various game elements like the speed of fire bars, enemy movement, and music.
    - Notably, PAL's "infamous 21 frame rule" is adjusted to an 18 frame cycle to match the change in frame rate, affecting the optimal cycle for speedrunning.
5. **Advantages in PAL Version**:
    
    - Despite running at 56% speed, PAL version-exclusive glitches allow for faster gameplay than NTSC.
    - For instance, Mario's top speed and acceleration are adjusted for PAL, and his downward speed cap allows for unique floor clips, offering speedrunners new strategies.
6. **Flagpole Glitch in PAL**:
    
    - In PAL, it's possible to achieve the full flagpole glitch without special conditions, saving significant time.
    - However, the inputs required for this glitch are extremely fast and precise, involving alternating between left and right on the D-pad every frame.
7. **Challenges in Speedrunning PAL Version**:
    
    - Despite the potential time savings, consistently performing the full flagpole glitch is physically demanding and challenging.
    - The PAL version's slower timer countdown offsets some of the time gains from these glitches.
8. **Future of PAL Speedrunning**:
    
    - The potential to achieve a 452 or 453 time in the PAL version exists, but it requires mastering the difficult flagpole glitch multiple times in a single run.
    - Interest and dedication from the speedrunning community could push the limits further, potentially making the PAL version the fastest completion of the game.
9. **Conclusion**:
    
    - While the PAL version of Super Mario Bros offers unique advantages and challenges for speedrunning, it demands a high level of skill and physical endurance.
    - The video teases another approach to beat Super Mario Bros even faster, promising more content and discoveries in the world of speedrunning.

Transcription:

I've been saying for a while that apple

is the sleeping giant that is about to

dominate artificial intelligence they

are well positioned in pretty much every

aspect to come in and completely change

the industry overnight and now leaks are

starting to come out about their AI

strategy so we're going to take a look

at those today first this is a fantastic

article by Mac rumors that goes over a

lot of what is dubbed Apple GPT as well

as their overall AI strategy now with

the release of Apple Vision Pro which I

believe is the perfect vehicle to

deliver AI to the masses apple is likely

to make their presence known this year

so let's talk about what we know about

Apple GPT first Apple's AI Chief is John

gianandrea and if you don't know who he

is he is an incredibly important figure

in Silicon Valley he has been in the

industry for a long time and been a

contributing member to incredibly

impactful projects this this is him SVP

of machine learning and AI strategy at

Apple and funnily enough you will never

see apple use the two letters AI they

rarely if ever say artificial

intelligence so the fact that we see it

here is pretty interesting John has been

in Apple for almost 6 years but if we

look at his experience he was at Google

for nearly 8 years but if we go all the

way back he was actually the chief

technologist at Netscape and I'm

probably dating myself with the

reference to Netscape but Netscape was

one of the first internet browsers

period and Netscape really changed the

face of the internet so just imagine

that Jon has been working on projects

all the way back to the birth of the

internet now he's working on something

that is likely going to be bigger than

the internet so going back to the Mac

Rumors article John reports directly to

Apple CEO Tim Cook and he has a team

that has been working on conversational

AI for 4 years and now it's been leaked

to that apple is testing Apple GPT

internally and previously it was code

named Ajax but in perfect Apple fashion

it is highly secretive what we know

about it is that no employees can use it

without permission and its output cannot

be used to develop new product features

for customers it is used for product

prototyping and is able to answer

questions about the data that it was

used to train on here it says Ajax is

said to be more capable than prior

generation chat GPT 3.5 and it's trained

on 200 billion parameters but as of

September 2023 opening A's newer models

are allegedly more powerful than Ajax

and that wouldn't surprise me open AI is

definitely at The Cutting Edge but you

all know I'm extremely bullish on open

source obviously apple is not going to

be open source here or at least I would

be incredibly shocked and it wouldn't be

the first time meta's contributions to

the open source AI Community has shocked

me every single time but what I'm most

excited about is bringing artificial

intelligence to Siri the idea that I can

use Siri for much more than just setting

a timer or reminding me of something

later is so exciting imagine a Siri that

is essentially a fully capable

artificial intelligent agent you can

give it multi-step tasks you can give it

sophisticated tasks it can start

predicting things that you need in your

day even before you ask it this is all

the promise of what Apple can do with AI

now here's something interesting apple

is said to be spending millions of

dollars per day on conversational AI

research as training language models

requires a lot of hardware and on the

topic of Hardware we're going to touch

on that in a minute but apple is

probably the most well-positioned

company in terms of Hardware maybe

besides Nvidia and they're on track to

spend more than $4 billion on AI servers

in 2024 now here it says Apple's work on

generative AI could eventually be

incorporated into its Siri voice

assistant now that is the most obvious

statement I've ever heard I don't

believe apple is ever going to call it

an llm a GPT or AI it's going to be Siri

and in apple fashion they are going to

use completely different terminology to

describe their artificial intelligence

very similar to how they call their

apple Vision Pro spatial Computing

instead of what it really is augmented

reality now here's a quote from a former

Siri engineer John berky and he told the

New York Times Siri's cumbersome design

means that adding new phrases requires

rebuilding the Siri database which can

take up to 6 weeks each time while more

complicated features like search tools

can take upwards of a year I'm going to

guess that they're probably working on a

complete refresh of the Siri

architecture and if they're not that

would be quite surprising because I

don't know how much mileage they're

going to get out of the existing

architecture injected with artificial

intelligence and here it says the

information suggests that apple is

aiming to create a feature that would

let Siri automate multi-step tasks

automatically performing tasks that are

accomplished with shortcuts today this

makes a ton of sense to me very similar

to how we've seen open source SCE

projects like open interpreter be able

to control your computer with just

natural language this is exactly what

artificial intelligence can do now I

believe Apple sees the future and

they're thinking that there's going to

be less and less Reliance on physical

screens and you're probably pretty

surprised to hear that I'm sitting in

front of a massive screen and I use my

laptop every single day and my phone

every single day but let's think about

things for a second as Computing moves

more and more towards large language

models and the device form factor

changes such as the rabbit which of

course still has a screen but the

primary input and output is voice then

all of a sudden we're just using natural

language to accomplish tasks and if we

look at the Apple Vision Pro and

augmented reality it's the same thing

now of course these are little screens

in front of your eyes but really it's a

very different form factor than what

we're used to here it talks about Apple

adding AI into their apps and of course

that's going to happen but I truly think

that all apps need to be reimagined from

the ground up with AI first and that

typically means a natural language

interface so here are some very basic

examples which seem like they could

probably just come out tomorrow and

honestly I'm not super excited about

what I'm seeing here I think Apple

really has something cooking that is

going to blow us away that is not just

adding artificial intelligence into

existing products so here Apple music

for example Apple could use AI to create

autogenerated playlists I mean that is

the most basic underwhelming feature

I've ever heard while an xcode AI

support could help developers write in

troubleshoot code we already have that

it's incredibly powerful but still not

revolutionary in pages in keynote Apple

could be used for writing and creating

slide decks while Apple's internal

customer support apps could be updated

with generative AI to assist with Apple

Care all of which happens today this

sounds like Windows co-pilot to me and

what Apple does incredibly well is

partner with thirdparty media companies

you can look at the iTunes Store with

music movies magazines everything they

do an incredible job of bringing

companies into their ecosystem and that

just might be the Apple gorilla throwing

its weight around and they are reporting

that Apple has approached Condon Nast

NBC News and IAC about possible AI deals

and that would make a lot of sense apple

does not want to get into the same hot

water as open AI is with the New York

Times and why would day apple is the

Beast Apple everybody is going to work

with apple because they are the primary

player and Apple employees have been

banned from using chat GPT GitHub

co-pilot and other AI tools and they are

concerned that AI tools would leak

confidential information and that is not

only something that Apple is very

concerned about internally but that's

actually something that they build into

all of their products they really think

about privacy first many of you might

disagree with that statement but I truly

believe my Apple device is probably the

most secure device I own compared

compared to other devices around my

house and here both the information and

analyst Jeff Pooh claim that Apple will

have some kind of generative AI feature

available on the iPhone and iPad around

late 2024 which is when iOS 18 will be

coming out who said in October that

apple is building a few 100 AI servers

in 2023 with more to come in 2024 Apple

will reportedly offer a combination of

cloud-based Ai and AI with on device

processing now let's talk about that for

a moment because that is the most

exciting to me I have a MacBook Pro M2

Max and it is insanely powerful at

running inference when all of these

large language models started coming out

Nvidia was the main player I have an RTX

490 and it does it rips through large

language model inference but I still use

my Mac most of all and with tools like

LM studio and olama natively supporting

Apple metal my little laptop in front of

me runs large language models hyper fast

in fact let's look at this guide right

here here by Andy ping and quickly thank

you to the sponsor of this video M mate

M mate is the most advanced AI platform

for creating and connecting lifelike and

fictional AI characters visit mate.io to

experience the future of digital

interaction now back to the video A

Simple Guide to local llm fine tuning on

a Mac with mlx mlx is the library that

allows you to do fine tuning on your Mac

and it is very very fast and not only

that there seems to be something about

the Apple silic chips that make running

inference extremely efficient Apple

silicon chips are very different from

traditional GPU and CPUs because they

basically combined both of them into a

single chip and that makes the

communication between the CPU and GPU

very very efficient very very fast if

you want to see me do a tutorial on

fine-tuning with mlx using a Mac let me

know in the comments below so the idea

of a completely local Siri is not Out Of

Reach I know that my MacBook Pro could

do it and I know the chips in my iPhone

are very very powerful as well and I

wouldn't be surprised if they could run

Siri completely locally now in my

opinion apple is most likely to roll out

some hybrid of local and cloud-based

artificial intelligence they're going to

run as much as they can locally for the

sake of privacy and security or at least

that's what they're going to say and

then they're going to connect to the

cloud when they need to do more powerful

processing or when they need to pull in

third party information that can't be

stored on device alone and for anybody

thinking that apple is far behind in the

AI game which I've seen everywhere take

a look at all of their published

research which only seems to be

increasing in velocity here's acoustic

model Fusion for end to-end speech

recognition coml collaborative machine

learning model building for developing

data set design practices here's

flexible keyword spotting based on

homogeneous audio text embedding I just

saw one that helps reduce the size of

large language models here's one about

training found ation models for

wearables so again if you're wearing

your Apple watch it can start analyzing

the data even more effectively than it

already is so if you haven't seen all of

these research papers I'll drop a link

in the description below and so in the

future in this brilliant future what I

imagine is wearing an apple Vision Pro a

much smaller form factor Siri built in

with all of the AI capabilities that

we've come to know and Beyond and of

course it's multimodal so from all the

cameras on the Apple Vision Pro you can

ask it about anything in your

surroundings you can ask it about any

audio in your surroundings as the AI is

generating output it could put it

directly in Your Vision so let's say you

want to cook something you open up your

fridge you look around and you say what

can I make with what I have in my fridge

it highlights the different items that

you should grab in real time you take

them out it pops up a recipe it

literally shows you on your kitchen

table take this item put this much in

the pot and so on I mean the

possibilities are truly L and I cannot

wait to see what comes if you liked this

Link:  [This VS Code Killer Just Went Open Source (Written In Rust BTW)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOYp6-k9HhE)
Transcription:

Zed's looking cooler than ever. Still has a ways to go, but open sourcing such a big project is always impressive. Genuinely hyped for the team and can't wait to see where things go. Will this help me stop missing Sublime Text? Will my search for the perfect IDE stop here? To be determined.

VSS code love it or hate it it's become the norm for quite a while now I still remember working at twitch being the one

person who just would not give up on Sublime Text when I started writing more unit tests for weird typescript

functionality I was introduced to the VSS code debugger by a cooworker which was a huge help in me running the tests

and playing with things as I went along and ended up slowly making the shift as a result that all said I missed the

performance while I could sit here and defend electron all day I'll admit the performance is something you feel in a

text editor while vs code is way faster than Alternatives were like Adam you definitely feel that it's a browser not

a native editor and when you use something like Sublime Text or even things like Vim the speed at which a key press results in a key being on your

screen it's small but you feel it and I definitely understand why people miss a native IDE this is why I'm really

excited to talk about Zed today Zed's a really interesting editor because it's trying to find the balance between native performance you would expect from

things like vim and a plugin UI focused ecosystem similar to vs code where you can kind of get the best of both worlds

it is not just being cre cre by some random people it's actually being built by the original creators of Adam and those Adam creators didn't just invent

one of the first modern text editors they actually built electron just to make atom possible in a lot of ways you can almost see this as an undoing of the

damage that electron did where this team wants to make a much better performing editor that doesn't compromise on the

user experience the same way other things might do Now Zed is open source

this is a huge change that I honestly didn't expect because Zed's a startup they have to make money somehow open sourcing the editor is a bold to make

but not only are they open sourcing they actually rewrote most of the code in the process so why the big rewrite last week

was my first week at Zed I joined right as the team was preparing for this week's release which they referred to as zed 2 big things in the air this release

marks the end of the team's multi-month rewrite of zi framework GPI from V1 to V2 all hands on deck everybody fixing

the last bugs polishing Zed and I the newcomer had so many questions why the big rewrite how'd you pull it off what does this get you how do you organize it

this is really cool that they're like publishing this type of stuff about why they're doing these bold rewrites and

that the whole video is on YouTube as well I'm not here to talk about the rewrite though I'm here to talk about the open source release and actually

play with z a bit if you want to hear more about big rewrites like this let me know in the comments and maybe I'll make a whole video just about this rewrite

we're excited to announce that Z is an open source project the code for Z SS available under a copy left license to ensure any improvements will benefit the

entire Community GPL for the editor a GPL for serers side components interesting that they went with standard

GPL for the editor and the Apache modification of it for the serers side stuff makes sense for them to make sure they a business they can sell but

fascinating to see this type of like split licensing for a product if you think I should talk more about licensing for open source let me know cuz it's

thing I have a lot of weird opinions on they also mentioned the GPI rewrite that they are Distributing as well under Apache so anyone can use it to build

high performance desktop apps and distribute them under any license that's huge that's really cool good open source

why are they doing this most importantly they believe that making Z open source will make it the best product our mission is to build the world's most

advanced code editor and get it in the hands of millions of developers there's a ton of surface area on the platform

and will need all the help we can get considering that all of Zed's users are programmers it makes the most sense to open Zed to the maximum pool of talent

this is a really good point since everyone using Zed is going to be a developer letting them contribute to it makes a ton of sense makes a ton of

sense really cool to see them thinking in this way on a more selfish level we also think going open source will be a lot more fun one of our favorite aspects

of software is connecting with people we're not only proud of what we've built but also how we've built it we want to share Zed's inner beauty with all of you

and we're confident we'll learn a lot from you in the process to make it even better they're also introducing this idea of Fire hacks where you can hang

out with people in The Zed channels talk with other developers people contributing people not and they'll be running Fireside hacks in them where

they work on Zed live and a public Channel this is super cool I love these like Community opportunities to hang

with people really nice stuff and then they talk about the money aspect cuz this is important too CU they're a

startup they need to make money eventually and they say specifically that they strongly believe the best way to build and maintain the world's best

editor is by associating it with a sustainable business model it's the only way they can continue to invest in a full-time team to spearhead Dev some may

wonder if making it open source undermines that objective but they thought about it a lot and they don't think the openness is at odds with the

commercial success rather than selling you a proprietary editor we'd much prefer to sell you services that seamlessly integrate with your Editor to

make you and your team more productive said channels is just one example it's free for anyone today but they intend to begin charging for private use after a

beta period of experimentation providing serers side compute to power AI features is another monetization scheme they're seeing getting traction and I've seen

this more and more with companies recently where they're trying to become a standard first and then monetize later

I think it works really well I'm curious to see how it goes for an editor nobody's really tried this at this integration level usually editors either

charge or don't make money charging later to make money is an interesting strategy that requires more investment

for them to find success but seems like they're building something really special here and I'm excited to see how it goes for them they're not at one point oh yet though so know this is

still early but it is a really exciting rewrite I want to play with it so I guess there's nothing else to do other than click this download button so let's

do it download for Mac OS one more thing of note at this point in time Zed is Mac only they do plan to support other

Platforms in the future but let's be honest with the things that they're targeting Mac devs are going to be the majority of users anyways and they'll

certainly be the majority of potentially paying users in the future so as a business tries to figure out if they have something with traction that could

possibly make money in the future it makes a ton of sense that they're not supporting windows and Linux just yet anyways here is Zed one of the cool

things they actually have a Vim mode built in does that mean this is officially Prime agine approved to be determined I don't have Vim bindings in

my head anymore so I'm not going to check that they really thought of the setup process here where you can pick a theme doesn't seem like they have the PO

Manders theme I don't know you could install custom ones or not but they don't have my preferred one which makes sense it's a pretty Niche theme so let's

go with the default for now choose a key mapping vs code yes please don't make me learn new things it's cool that they let you take the mappings from other

programs and the default is vs code where they're just copying the vs code keepy bindings really good idea don't make me learn all these other new things

when I'm just trying to play with a new editor and then install the CLI we'll take a look at the upload thing public

code base so cool here's our project it is very minimal I've seen people saying that already but I do like how how muted

things are I don't love the lack of color in the icons cuz like I can mentally map things when they have color

but it's also like almost everything's just TS TS TS TS in blue so how much does that really matter debatable I

don't know if you guys know this but the VSS code CLI is slow as [¬†__¬†] so if I type code period we're going to press enter right now and that took like a

second plus to switch over I actually have a custom binding that you might have seen me use C that is an alias that

just calls the vs code application directly and when I do this instead I'm going to press enter right now it's

literally instant and as seems to care about that this lets you load the application way faster and the specific

CLI thing they're using to get those ARs and parse them is just not very fast let's start by playing with the hot

keys that worked great is there a Hut key for hiding and showing the sidebar command B that's

Snappy scrolling feels a little Jank I don't know how much this will come up like in the recording because I'm

recording 30 FPS even though my screen's running 120 but the scrolling feel

less good this is actually something I noticed when I first played with Z is that scrolling felt a little

weird yeah a ton of inertia that's a good way to describe it Vim Tim in chat so love that a vimmer has opinions on

this one thing that really annoys me in vs code is when I'm trying to delete like a section of text so let's try and

delete here up to functions CU When I go here it Scrolls too fast this is way

better for that already it's a small thing but these are the things I want to test CU I want to see what my day-to-day is like in this editor let's say I want

to delete everything from line 122 to like 200 something let's say to 205 how

easy is it for me to get to exactly 205 that was pretty easy versus in vs

code we'll start at 122 and I want to get to exactly 205 and it Scrolls way too fast no

matter how far you go and it's a good bit harder I've had a lot of annoyance with that why not scroll down to the line and shift click cuz I don't think

that far ahead probably a good call oh look at that they light things up bright green when there are changes in git okay

am I crazy or does that icon look like Source control to you cuz this icon looks to me like Source control not like files I might be insane but that looks

like a source control icon with the branching how fast does the git update that's a good question too and let's see

what happens that was instant that was instant good [¬†__¬†] yeah vs codes is not

anywhere near that fast now all these things are staged you can't even see it in vs code commit DM init

commit and vs code doesn't update these things in the background in order to see the update I have to go back here and

then it will update but I bet some older files oh no it updated everything I'm sure all of you that use VSS code really hard have had the problem where it

doesn't see certain things have been commit some things haven't been commit and it just yells at you the whole time

didn't do it there I've experienced it a lot I know y'all have too it's really cool that Zed does not seem to do that

and is like weirdly immediate I don't love this icon what is this move to a new file I don't love

that UI don't know what this does or is for it seems like probably one of their weird AI things but can I see if Zed supports Auto rename tag interesting

thought let's first off test the typescript go to definition here's our trpc proxy client let's rename symbol to

internal API rename no there's no like confirmation button or something I would

assume there' be like a button at the bottom here that says go nuts what is this Mt about why why is this upset

about the type definitions oh it's the es lint I think the es lint is out of date but the types script isn't because

you can see here I have the type definition but eslint is saying it's an unsafe assignment of an any because eslint didn't get the change that we

have a different name for this thing internal API now very interesting very interesting I have saved the changes

they've been saved in all the files that I did them in so they also get this sync issue in VSS code I get the issue where

I have to reset the typescript server but usually the es lint server catches up es lint being broken separately is new to me is there a reset there's

restart language server it looks like while I was doing that this corrected itself interesting it might have been because I hadn't opened this file since

the change and it was caching that editor level I can't know any of this for sure the goal here is just to like

play with it and see which quirks it does or doesn't have if I should actually commit to using this editor for a bit again let me know in the comments

and I'll give it a shot for a little longer other people are saying they often have to reset es lint more than they have to reset the typescript server

very interesting someone else pointed out it's cool you have es lint support out of the box I absolutely agree having es L to typescript in all of this

without any plugins CU like I don't have any plugins installed on this I don't have anything installed right now like here are my settings there's nothing

let's try some other fun things more typescript quirks I should be able to command click hello and get to the trpc

function in the server folder and it works dope having that type of deep type inference is essential for any editor

that I use so if I'm in some client or like user facing code and I want to quickly do anything like I want to just

figure out where this is coming from or like make a change to what it's returning having command click working

here is huge and the last time I played with a zed this was not working previously it would bring me to weird places in like my type definitions for

trpc itself now it actually goes properly all the way to the place where this is written hopefully it still does this on client components one way to

test that it still does good stuff should I actually try typing now cuz thus far I have avoided actually editing

in the editor let's see how this feels this is a test to see how typing here feels overall I'm impressed the auto

comment continuation is also a nice touch I don't know if you guys saw that it's hard see cuz I don't have my key

presses on screen but when I press enter it continues the comment for me that's really nice it's doing some type of Auto

formatting here too not quite as much as I would have liked but let's see if I tab this out that looks like it's doing

pretty your stuff properly Mark pointed out there was a lot of pop-ups when I was typing here when I wasn't typing it in a comment there was but it seems like

when I'm in a comment it chills out but when I'm typing here this is a test typing yeah the um the spam of like it

trying to autocomplete [¬†__¬†] is a little annoying because it's so fast that it does it quickly but it just it flashes

all over the screen when I'm typing like do you see how annoying that is that would piss me off so much I would just

add a debounce to that so when I type a letter you don't prompt me with that until I've waited for at least a few milliseconds that I also find this

really annoying ESP when I'm making content because I'll be typing something and just my screen's flashing all over the place and it makes the video super

distracting so for me in particular that's kind of a no-o yeah also the dialogue should be smaller people are saying it's pretty big I will say I I'm

on a 720p effective screen when I'm doing content so I don't know if it's less bad in other cases but now it's

taking up a ton of my screen that said VSS code sucks about this too and I type trpc like it still starts to do things

but it's nowhere near as brutal about it the jsts server immediately crashed five times great sign responsive test this is

me getting a gut feel of the responsiveness in vs code this is me

getting a gut feel of responsiveness in said I'll be honest guys doesn't feel

much better just typing like that does that come off in the video does this seem

faster because it doesn't feel very different to me curious if that Quirk

was still happen in comments what happen here I am adding cool it does not so when I press single quote or double

quote double quote it will automatically double up but single quote it won't

because a single quote might be a contraction but a single quote here doesn't necessarily know that and it

always doubles it up so when I'm doing I'm now m is surrounded even though it's in a comment so kind of annoying that

when I'm typing a comment I have to go through and delete a bunch of things it's randomly adding for me I'll be honest I've always been annoyed when you

make a tag and it autoc closes it for you I don't want that on single Pern in

a comment ever but in general I've never been a big fan of it so I am biased there one of the really interesting

things that Z's trying to do different is focus on collaboration most editors have some crappy plugin where you can

share an instance and I'll be honest every time I tried it was a Jank experience I've never had a good time using VSS code with two people on

different computers and usually I just prefer to screen share and Discord or something I am curious how this works with multiple people working in one

thing together first off there's a chat which is actually really nice to have a built-in live chat they have a concept

of channels where I can create a channel if anybody has Z let's try it we're going to make a t3g channel it wants my

microphone is there a way I can mute that oh there it is it's in the top right corner very interesting to have AV

built into the editor also a share screen option so I can share my screen Beyond just the editor so if I want to

showcase like what I'm actually working on like I want to showcase what the the browser does in the background while I

make changes really cool that it supports that can people join the t3g channel is this public or private how

does this work cool I trust you Yash I don't want to call you no I sorry I do

not think just clicking your name would call that's uh unintended I am sorry I don't know how to stop calling either

there's no way to do that remove contact yeah just on a call yeah the UI for this is a little Jank I do not like that I

can accidentally call somebody by clicking on their name like call things should should at least have like a

separate button for it there's no rightclick Behavior at all like I'm right clicking on people and doesn't do anything I just don't get this join

Channel none of these things appear to be doing anything it still has me calling Yash and I don't know how to to

stop that does revoke right access do it no share leave call okay that was dumb

on the channel invite members oh I can just make it public and now you have been invited aore there's join Channel

and open Channel notes okay the channel notes is this thing in the middle here so we can save like a markdown dock

notes hi friends aore are you able to edit those notes is this safe though can you run a terminal command fantastic

question oh hi from aore hi aore do you have access to my terminal here let me try can't open my terminal can you see

what I typed in it though you have your yours open cool um yeah I'm very curious how much you do and do not have you

can't even see it interesting I have mixed feelings on this on one hand it's

actually pretty cool to think about your coding environment as a a shared

collaborative place can you see that you're on your project you already did Z clab at work it's fun oh interesting I

have mixed feelings on this it's a really cool idea to have good collaboration tools baked into your

editor it gives you a ton of Opp opportunity to innovate in ways like a plugin simply can't and I like the idea

that it's not a plugin for this like the vs code live share plugin despite being somewhat baked in is pretty Jank this

despite being early and Jank feels like it has more potential to integrate deep in and I am excited to see where it goes

but the ux is rough like the fact that when you click someone's name it starts an audio call with them in my editor is

terrifying to me I hate that that's that's not something I can support like ever and I will probably be disabling

this feature until there's like a major update I want to better understand what the AI autocomplete experience is like

oh I can sign in for co-pilot here cool co-pilot is enabled look at that we got co-pilot

working dope pump that even though they have aspirations to do their own AI stuff that co-pilot is already built in

and working as I would expect that's dope it's nice that I don't feel the need to run and grab any plugins there

are little things that I've been using a lot in vs code recently that I like I go through my extensions obviously having

language things like um Astro and such is really nice I love cloak for hiding Secrets Dino is nice to have support for

directly they already have es lint built in they have co-pilot built in haven't played with their git stuff I'm not a big G in the IDE person but a lot of

other people are so that'll be missing which is notable the things I've been thinking about though obviously my

themes I love the PO Manders theme it'd be really nice if they had a way to import VSS code themes because it's like a standard-ish syntax somebody will

probably hack that or at least make a converter in the future it seems like it's doing all the prettier stuff for me already so that's cool the two I was

thinking of the that I'm going to miss are pretty typescript errors and quick lint JS these two plugins are very good

I already have a video for pretty typescript errors the typescript just got so much better if you want to know more about the pretty typescript error

plug-in check the video out it required a ton of hacks by the dev to make it work but the results super cool and I rely on it a ton you can see here that

it will actually make you this nice printed out formatted error thing instead of the absolute mess that

typescript normally gives you super super cool and then quick lint if you're not familiar I haven't made a video about this yet it checks for a bunch of

basic JavaScript typescript things like using an equals accidentally in an if statement awaiting something that isn't

async little type errors that are pretty common and it's super super fast so you

get feedback like immediately which is really cool that like on each character you're getting feedback I've been

enjoying quick lint quite a bit and again let me know in the comments if I should do a whole video about quick lint because it is a pretty cool project but

in order to care about those things we first need to see how Zed handles when you do something wrong so let's spell

post wrong how quickly when I add the T will I no longer have a type error pretty quick and if I have the type error and I

hover over oh no it's the super unreadable type errors also if you notice I get

different type errors depending on how far in I am because these are all accessing an unsafe any I don't know if

vs code is smart enough to not do that but there's only one way to check so have here we get the nasty tyri error

but then we get the much better formatted error from the Pretty typescript error plugin but over these

further down things now this is all the unsafe any yeah so equally bad there but

at least I can use my plugin here which I cannot use in Z in my opinion if Zed's goal is to make something better enough

than vs code that we all start switching these types of ux wins are a really big thing if you can do them because if you

produce enough of these wow moments for a developer that might not know about these plugins might not know about these other things this can be a huge huge win

for building like positive sentiment and getting them to go shill it to their friends and getting me to talk really positively about it in a video all those

types of things seeing if there is do they have any plugin system at all I don't think they do not upset with it in

any way one more thing we should probably test is auto importing what's the I can import okay we have the create

post deleting this component deleting the import for this component let's try

mounting it now the flash of that is so annoying and

also that all these mdn references come up before my own code like I have to press arrow down how many times to get

to my thing and also the width of this changes that's Jank that feels not good

that all like this UI shifts around as I try to get to the right thing and that what I'm here for is so low priority I

have to type the whole word create and even just type in create it still has credentials container canvas capture

media and all these other things that don't start with create because the fuzzy search sucks create all those

letters are in order in credentials container it has the letters for create in order but something that starts with

create should be first for sure this is [¬†__¬†] these are the little things that like are hard to get right that will be

fixed over time but feel Jank right now and if the goal of something like Zed is to offer a meaningful user experience

improvement over vs code these things matter way way more so that's a little

disappointing if I click it did it Auto Import correctly it did cool so at least the auto importing works but the ranking

there was terrible I'm happy I checked that one good one is EnV this is a new project so this won't leak anything but

it looks like it would have if I hadn't like been sure that it's good ahead of time is that a that's a no co-pilot icon

something I have to rely on is the ability to hide secrets with something like cloak because there's nothing worse than accidentally exposing your secrets

on stream if I go to here I can turn on cloak and now you'll see all the secrets are hidden very very useful and I try to

turn this on before I stream code so that I never accidentally leak environment variables again these things are small but enough of them add up and

one of the things you need in order to win with a challenging new product like this is you need to win sentiment from

the people who can sprad spread that and share that sentiment so I as a a creator with reach as dumb as it is that I'm

saying you should prioritize my quirks and my needs because most users won't benefit that much from having their secrets autohide it makes me more

confident when I use it to make content which then reaches the users you want to potentially have this is the thing I've been talking with a lot of companies

about especially when I'm Consulting it's the idea that targeting creators despite their weird needs that might not overlap with your users it's actually a

really powerful tool to hit product Market fit earlier and get your product in front of others earlier there's two

reasons one we have the reach so if we can use the product we'll reach that audience but two and arguably more

important if you can't win us you can't win our fans creators and influencers in these spaces especially nowadays deeply

understand the things that their viewers and Their audience want to use and work with we might be pickier but we're also

more understanding and we're more willing to have these conversations and hear these things out and I've regularly been surprised at how much value I and

other creators can bring to companies by giving feedback on the product and why we would or wouldn't use it we are kind of a representative minority of the

space because in order for us to get people to watch our videos we have to understand what they like and what they resonate with and with that deeper

understanding we're often positioned to to give better feedback and also we spend more time thinking about what our

audience would like so if you can't convince us to use your thing despite us having that mindset where we can think

kind of the way all of our different viewers think and all the different groups and if you can't convince us that it's good enough for one of those groups

it's going to be really hard to convince them yourself so again I feel bad saying make the things creators want but if

your target audience is the people who watch those creators making them happy can help a ton I will say I'm impressed

especially when you consider that they don't get to lean on much existing work here like they have treesitter in fact the treesitter devs are some of the core

team for Zed they have the typescript language server running in the background and allowing them to get all the data they need here but they are

missing a lot of the pieces that exist because of the size of the existing VSS code and JavaScript ecosystem like

another thing people just brought up is the Tailwind auto complete oh wow looks like they

hardcoded the Tailwind auto complete in it's PT this I don't love like weird things

get mixed into the autocomplete but at least that works does it have the hover to see the actual CSS that applies it

does not interesting and does the prettier organizer organize things correctly it does not okay so this is

again like because they can't lean on the existing tools they have to build their own versions of it so we do get a

lot of the Tailwind autocomplete help here which is really nice like I can Tailwind like group or Tailwind like

lgp whatever and it's smart enough to know what that is but it doesn't let me hover over to see what these things are

versus in VSS code I hover over one of these and tells me the exact class there another thing it doesn't seem to support that I push really hard is the auto

sorting prettier plugin for tailin which makes your tailin code way more readable because everything's in the same order I intentionally put this padding too far

forward because now when I save it's going to get moved to the right spot which is in this Chunk in either the

middle or the end depending on which classes you have that has all the padding behaviors I've learned this order it's really good the prettier Auto

sort Tailwind plugin is dope and I genuinely think everyone should be using it if they're using Tailwind so not having that sucks because they didn't

Implement prettier bindings they implemented a bunch of prettier functionality into their editor they

didn't implement the Tailwind plugin they implemented a bunch of Tailwind functionality into the editor this is also why open sourcing is so important

because if they didn't open source building and maintaining all of these things becomes really really difficult

really really quickly and I'm hopeful that the choice to open source will make it more likely the community supports these things going forward that said if

the Tailwind stuff is written rust I'm curious to see how that goes we can check the source code quick

though interesting they have the tail and prettier plug-in package it should work then although if you think about it

it's pretty wild to see tailwind and prettier in the source code of Zed especially when you compare to like the

vs code GitHub if we search in here for Tailwind nothing search in here for pretty a they might use it but it's not

part of vs code itself because these are all plugins that are external extensions whereas with zed these are all built-in

features and rust I don't necessarily love this but open sourcing is a huge step in making future extensions that

are more usable also how hilarious is it that Tailwinds considered a language the point stands having to support things

that deeply in your editor is a scary thought and the amount of work that the poor Zed team has had to do to create

all of these bindings is a little terrifying oh no oh no I see what

they're doing since Tailwind is a subset language not a proper Lang language which obviously Tailwind is not a

programming language in order to get their auto complete in their adapter working in all the other places you

might use Tailwind they had to manually bind the Tailwind parser to every language you might use Tailwind with

including we not limited to CSS Elixir heeks hex I've no idea what heex is TSX

JavaScript HTML Erb spelt PHP and more referen coming up there but yeah the

fact that they have to bind Tailwind hardcoded to every single language for it to work is incredibly not extensible

and again with like not having plugin support for other things like Tailwind to exist or for Tailwind changes to

happen or God forbid Tailwind version 4 has different classes than Tailwind version 3 you're [¬†__¬†] the fact that

these language parsers have to have such weird additional assignments made for it to work is scary also like the first

line in the language in nit is an Elixir settings register so Elixir has to do some special things and they always run

this code even if you're not using Elixir so these types of hacks are necessary when you don't have a plugin

system and they're a little scary that said they did just open

source this code and I'm not here to just [¬†__¬†] on people's code like this isn't bad code it's scary to maintain as

an open source project and that's a thing we should think about and be honest about they do have a plugins directory interesting for child and

children if okay path child path config read language config if it matches then

they register it enter interesting yeah and they're registering it through a wasm layer too that means they can safely run rust code in like a

virtualization layer and also they can run other languages including JavaScript and typescript this is very interesting

how this is architected I'm even more excited about reading through how that rewrite worked so again let me know in the comments if I should make a video

about the whole rewrite the file for all the language support including loading plugins is under 300 lines of code

that's not too bad and enough you pointed out that GPI is cool that I'll quickly touch on it it is actually really interesting the goal of GPI is to

do a GPU accelerated UI framework written in Rust so that you have rust code that runs native UI there hasn't

really been anything like this before at least that I know of they've stated a lot of their goals here and actually really surprised the quality of what they've written here they point out

there three different registers that they've created depending on the way you want to build this UI interesting this

is Swift UI I know most of y'all aren't Swift UI users but this is Swift UI this is the Swift UI sytax look familiar yeah

that is fascinating to me I haven't talked much about Swift UI and I have a lot of opinions but I think they they

took the right lessons from react and it is interesting to see other things doing it I am very curious about the decision

to use div here as the example is Zed using a web container that's rendering

divs or are they rendering native UI wasum is not a UI layer it has like if

this is running in a browser shell this is would be wum doesn't I don't care about how where it's running I care

about what it's rendering to does this render to some type of extension of a canvas or a dawn or is this making

native UI with like GPU calls cuz they pointed out that it's GPU accelerated a GPU accelerated UI framework for rust

create a new window with app context open window and register your first view there is nowhere near enough info here

seems like it's running native I'm very confused by the choice of using a div in their example because if you're deep

enough in web that you don't know this divs are a web concept even react native doesn't have a div like if you write

react native code you cannot render a div in it you have to render a react native view or text element leveraging

rust in the GPU to render user interface at 12 FPS they're calling out my concern if like divs are slow because you're doing the web layer good old Evan

Wallace code if you don't know Evan Wallace he also created es build this dude is like the JavaScript and

JavaScript accessories performance wizard yall remember in my recent video where I said game devs don't appreciate

the web and US finding new ways to render and render because they're still trying to get text to render and a bunch

of people in the comments were like you don't know anything about Native devs and like performant Dev if you think we don't know how to R text or you think

that's hard to do here's a five page section on why it's not that easy to

render text you stupid [¬†__¬†] I'm sorry but like if you're building native stuff and you're trying to build native

stuff for performance reasons you do have to care about how text renders and as you see here it is not easy to do

they also cited the Pathfinder crate which seems to be the existing rust UI

rasterization layer that they didn't think was good enough for their needs fascinating this is proof they're actually doing native code code they're

not doing things in the browser which makes me really confused about the choice to have like div and flex all in

their example because div and flex are both very Web Concepts as well as justify Center item Center all these

things are very Webby if you have the opportunity to build something new from scratch I'm a little confused why you'd bring the web Primitives somebody said

they just picked the name div instead of View kind of but they also picked Flex they also picked justify Center and item

Center they're taking a lot of the way we do things in web which is very interesting and not necessary react

native took very little from web they took a bit but not a lot and even things like Flex they they tried to take but

they they built them differently like it's a silly thing but a really interesting example of how react native

differs from react for web by default react web Flex boxes are horizontal and you have to specify B vertical react

native Flex boxes are default vertical you have to specify horizontal it's a small detail but these things add up as

you swap between platforms a lot I'm interested in why they chose to go the web Direction here there's a lot going

on in this project and I'm really curious to see where it goes from the Native layer and rust for the GPU stuff to everything they're doing with collab

and AI there's an interesting thing going on here and I'm really excited that it's not just happening but it's

now open source I don't see myself leaving vs code anytime soon but I am excited for a future where there's more

competition and more Innovation happening within our editors what about you do you still use vs code have you made the switch over to Vim or are you

one of the few remaining Sublime Text holdouts that just won't move yet I'd love to hear what you're using if you want to see me make vs code even worse I

have a great video in the corner here where I let chat decide what I would do to my vs code and I promise you it's

terrible see you guys in the next one appreciate you all a ton peace NS

summary:
The video discusses the transition from traditional text editors like Sublime Text to VS Code, emphasizing the performance issues often associated with VS Code due to its Electron framework. Despite its performance, VS Code's extensive plugin ecosystem and features like debugging have attracted many developers.

The main focus of the video is the introduction of Zed, a new code editor. Here's a summary of the key points discussed about Zed:

1. **Performance and User Experience**:
    
    - Zed aims to balance native performance and a rich plugin ecosystem. It's designed to offer the speed of editors like Vim and Sublime Text while providing a UI-focused, extensible platform similar to VS Code.
2. **Creation and Open Source Nature**:
    
    - The team behind Zed includes the original creators of Atom and Electron. With Zed, they're trying to rectify some of the performance drawbacks of Electron-based editors. Zed is open source, a significant step, especially considering that Zed is a startup.
3. **Zed 2.0 and GPL Licensing**:
    
    - The video discusses the major rewrite from Zed 1 to Zed 2, focusing on the Zed framework GPI. Zed's code is available under a copyleft license, specifically GPL for the editor and an Apache modification for server-side components.
4. **Focus on Collaboration and Business Model**:
    
    - Zed introduces innovative collaboration features, including built-in chat, channels, and AV capabilities, aiming to enhance the collaborative coding experience. The monetization strategy includes selling integrated services that complement the editor rather than selling the editor itself.
5. **User Experience in Zed**:
    
    - The presenter tests various features of Zed, like typing response, git integration, auto-complete, and collaboration tools. While impressed with some aspects, they also point out areas needing improvement, such as the user experience around auto-complete and collaboration features.
6. **Zed's Technical Architecture**:
    
    - The video delves into the technical side of Zed, discussing its GPU-accelerated UI framework, the choice of Rust for performance, and the interesting decision to adopt web-like elements in its design.
7. **Closing Thoughts**:
    
    - The presenter expresses excitement about the potential of Zed but also recognizes the challenges and the necessity for further development and community involvement. They remain a VS Code user for now but are keen to see how Zed evolves.


Overall, the video provides a detailed introduction to Zed, highlighting its aspirations to combine native performance with a rich feature set and addressing the need for better performance and collaboration in code editors.

Advantages of Zed:

1. **Native Performance**: Zed is designed to offer the speed and responsiveness of native editors like Vim and Sublime Text, addressing the performance issues often associated with Electron-based editors like VS Code.
2. **Rich Plugin Ecosystem**: Despite being a new entrant, Zed aims to provide a plugin and UI-focused ecosystem similar to VS Code, enabling extensive customization and functionality.
3. **Innovative Collaboration Features**: Zed introduces built-in chat, channels, and AV capabilities, aiming to enhance the collaborative coding experience significantly.
4. **Open Source Nature**: Being open source, Zed can tap into a large pool of developer talent for contributions, ensuring continuous improvement and community-driven development.
5. **Focused on User Experience**: The editor is designed with attention to user experience, offering features like immediate git updates, intuitive git interactions, and a thoughtful setup process.
6. **Technical Architecture**: Zed's use of a GPU-accelerated UI framework and the choice of Rust for performance indicate a strong technical foundation aimed at efficiency and speed.
7. **Integration with Popular Tools**: Zed includes built-in support for tools like ESLint and Co-pilot, ensuring that developers have access to necessary functionalities without needing additional plugins.

Drawbacks of Using Zed:

1. **Early Development Stage**: Zed is not yet at version 1.0, meaning it's still in the early stages of development and may lack stability and feature completeness compared to mature editors like VS Code.
2. **Limited Plugin Support**: While Zed aims to provide a rich plugin ecosystem, it's still new, and the range of available plugins might not match that of VS Code.
3. **User Experience Quirks**: Users have reported issues with the user experience, such as the auto-complete feature being too aggressive and distracting, and some UI elements being unintuitive.
4. **Limited Language Support**: The necessity to hardcode language support for features like Tailwind CSS into the editor might limit the flexibility and extensibility of language-specific features.
5. **Mac-Only (for now)**: Currently, Zed is available only for macOS, which limits its accessibility to developers using other operating systems, though there are plans to support other platforms in the future.
6. **Collaboration Feature UX**: While the collaboration features are innovative, the UX around these features, like the ease of accidentally starting a call, needs refinement.
7. **Complexity in UI Framework**: Adopting web-like elements in its native UI framework might lead to complexities and performance implications, which could be challenging to manage as the project grows.

In summary, Zed brings a fresh approach to code editors with its focus on performance, collaboration, and user experience. However, being in the early stages of development, it faces challenges in terms of feature completeness, plugin support, and refining its user experience.
