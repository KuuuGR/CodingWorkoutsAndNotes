Link: [# Agile Project Management - Is It Stopping You From Being Agile?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCtdh7Oa8hE)
Notes:
#### Advantages:

1. **Agility**: Agile project management enables companies to adapt quickly to changing customer needs and market dynamics.
2. **Flexibility**: Embraces uncertainty and allows for more flexible and responsive project management.

#### Drawbacks:

1. **Misinterpretation**: Misunderstanding the essence of agile can lead to "agility theater," where traditional project management techniques are wrongly applied to agile projects.
2. **Unrealistic Expectations**: Relying on tools like Gantt charts in agile environments can create false expectations and lead to a lack of genuine progress.
3. **Estimation Challenges**: Estimation in agile projects can cause confusion and wasted time, leading to unmet expectations.

#### Tips and Advice:

1. **Embrace Uncertainty**: Accept that embracing agility comes with a trade-off of reduced predictability.
2. **Let Go of Control Illusions**: Understand that strict control and detailed long-term planning are less applicable in agile development.
3. **Focus on Customer Value**: Prioritize delivering valuable features to customers over merely completing tasks efficiently.

#### Lecture Content:

The video discusses the misconception surrounding agile project management and the ineffectiveness of traditional project management techniques like Gantt charts in agile settings. It emphasizes the importance of flexibility, continuous feedback, and the readiness to adapt to market and customer needs.

#### Main Challenges:

1. **Understanding Agile Principles**: Ensuring that all stakeholders, including executives and customers, grasp the implications of agile development.
2. **Balancing Agility with Predictability**: Dealing with the trade-off between the desired adaptability of agile methodologies and the traditional desire for predictability in project outcomes.

#### The Importance and Usefulness of the Topic:

Understanding the true nature of agile project management is crucial for companies to effectively adapt to market changes and customer needs. It highlights the importance of value-driven development and the need for a shift in mindset from traditional project management approaches.

#### Accomplishments:

The video effectively communicates the potential pitfalls of misapplying traditional project management techniques to agile projects and offers insights on embracing the true essence of agile for better adaptability and customer satisfaction.

#### Summary of the Content:

The video addresses the misconceptions about agile project management and the importance of letting go of traditional project management practices like Gantt charts for agile teams. It stresses the need for a shift in mindset towards embracing uncertainty and focusing on delivering customer value.

#### Interesting Quotes or Insightful Sentences:

- "Software development companies don't profit from being the most efficient at building software; they profit from delivering the most valuable features to customers."
- "Why be agile if you're not going to benefit from that agility?"
- "We need to have conversations with our management to help them understand if we choose as an organization to do agile, we're going to lose a whole bunch of upfront planning."

In summary, the video sheds light on the common misunderstandings of agile project management and advocates for a genuine understanding and application of agile principles. It emphasizes the need for continuous interaction with stakeholders, responsiveness to feedback, and prioritization of customer value over rigid planning and control.

Transcription:

Hi Jamie Edwards Again from Jamie
Edwards docom and today I want to talk
about agile project management and some
of the mnom associated with it you know
when some companies start doing agile
project management They Bring in someone
Who's a traditional Project Manager and
apply Them To an agile project now What
Do I mean by this well If we think about
Waterfall Projects Which were Prior to
agile coming The Scene the team all the
planning up front for project So you
have a product
Mons a Year Years May even to come to
market and Because of how much money
Being invested in that There Was A Lot
of process work that was done up front a
lot of teams would actually get Together
and do a lot of documentation They Might
write Their entire test plan Ahead of
writing Any code and They would also use
traditional project management tools
such as Microsoft project for building
gant Charts If You're Not familiar with
gant charts I'll include a link in the
videos to a Quick video Where You can
Kind of see what they look like But The
Big Thing Around gant charts was you
would visually Look at your project
usually from left to Right And be able
to see a Vertical Sorry a horizontal
line that would represent How long a
given task on project Might
take
enden Might have t related to developing
a software product that needs to be
completed Before Another tas can start
now in Projects like building a coliseum
or a bank or a large architectural
building a project management approach
like this makes Sense usually You're
Working with materials that Have Been
used many Times Before People know about
How long it takes to build certain
architectural structures and even though
we know you you probably seen in the
media some High Profile cases of large
skyscrapers and buildings taking much
longer and costing a lot More Money than
people to build it tends to be somewhat
accurate in software development however
One Of The problems with Waterfall
development was that by the time a
project was released to customers when
you would it This Way so much had
Changed First of all the team usually
discovered
orig had
chant was du to showing Early prototypes
to the Customer and Finding Out that
what they Built meet Their
expectations Often Times and People
don't like to talk about this especially
Developers It Was Simply that Developers
were using a Technology They weren't as
familiar with and by figured Out
Ed is take Long we and
Hades so many Projects worked on in the
P very Early iner and also When I got
into Consulting some of my clients
Demand That We to use Waterfall
unfortunately When Those Projects would
move forward it was really Often that
right in the Middle of the project we
would find That We had to actually
update
esat
we would some tool some time tracking or
Time planning tool or you know Microsoft
project Chart we would we would update
How long that task was going to take And
then Everybody would have to communicate
that Sometimes There would even Be A
status meeting Where Everybody had to
get into a room and Talk About Okay This
one task is Changed
make
me or Tell others Look we're Different
we're a Different Type of business we
need more predictability we need to use
Those Same tools on AG Projects Let me
Talk to you a little bit why I strongly
disagree with that stance and I think
Just It Doesn't make Any
s So if you my PR video on you know Lean
software development I talked about How
Today's market is so uncertain you know
There's things Changing in the market
all the time and customers Needs Change
all the time and this is Why we want to
introduce agile development
methodologies to account for that well
One Of The Things that we're Trading
When We choose to do agile development
is we're Trading flexibility and
adaptability Something we want for
predictability something that typically
a lot of kind of Classic traditional
management approaches want So if a
company or if a team is going to do
agile software development they have to
actually be Okay with the fact that
predictability is not gna be as
High so one of the things I Often work
with companies on when they Start to a
job adopt agile development is when you
begin to do project management
It's Less useful to try to map Out
Everything the team is going to do over
an extended period of time and then you
know do all the dependencies Figure Out
How long all the tasks going to take
you're really doing Waterfall project
management At that Point And then take
that su of work Which May be you know a
Year Worth of work and try to find a way
to sort of shn It into a backlog a
product backlog So You anybody Who
worked on Pro is familiar with a product
backlog
basically Big list of all the features
that will be Built It can be described
using you know requirements it can be
described using user stories There's a
lot of Different formats For Those
requirements but typically What some Of
The More immature agile companies I work
with tend To Do Is They Take Everything
that they Built in a traditional project
plan Which is Again usually visually
It's horizont stres All barent tasks and
They try to slice It Up some and Fit
into a Back so They can sort of say Okay
We Get this agile development Thing
we're doing agile we've Got A
backlog The bummer with that is the
mindset It then creates for management
is There's No difference between agile
software development and Waterfall We
Just the team is using some Different
tools you know they're using Different
terms
Real really see much difference got a
list of tasks I have to complete they
have hard
estimates list of what's going to be
Built we to week or you Sprint to Sprint
doesn't really Change much in the
backlog
And
I
one of the things I work many Cents on
is to help Them
understand if you want truly Be An AG
Company if you want to benefit from the
Agility that Comes with Letting Go of
some of that predictability then you
need toly Embrace The fact that
Everything going be in that product
backlog May be a candidate for not Being
delivered So What Does that really Mean
what that means is if Let's say a
management committee gets Together or
product owner a set of customers and
They Come up with you know 50 features
that they to Deliver in the product They
talked To customers All really Great
ideas Once we put Those in the backlog
If We Follow Lean principles for
delivering value to Our customers We
Need some of
Things
themer If We Meure you How Often iser
actually going in and using feature x
that I Built out of 50 features There's
a High likely that several If not many
Of Those features will not be used by
users or you Might have a user that Goes
inas Tos It Out that cool and never Goes
It Again
is Why would we continue to More aspects
Of that
Fe valuable for the Customer we really
shouldn't ky so When I talk about AG
software development and I talk about AG
project management and I talk about Lean
you know what I Want To Make sure teams
do when they start doing This Type of
work is have the conversations with your
management to help Them understand If We
choose As An organization to do
More have Whole Buch of upfront planning
And then Give us a list of work and put
it in a backlog And then you know you
just basically check in Once Every we or
two weeks When A Sprint is complete and
go yeah you guys are making Good
progress No you know an agile software
Development Team actually need the
business
TOV All The Time because otherwise Why
do AG software development Why be AG If
You're Not gna benefit from that Agility
the whole purpose Of It is watching The
Industry closely releasing to your
customers at the end of you do two weeks
of work You put it in front of a
Customer or put it in front of a Limited
audience or put it in front of all your
customers you get in
fronted
to Keep More likely The feedback is
going to be that's not really what we
Wanted Or What If You Did This That's
When AG software development Becomes
incredibly powerful because then you you
know in Of It You have to go back to him
and Go oh that Sounds Great We'll Get To
that in six Months because we've got a
big
no when you do AG software develop you
do Lean project management Lean Lean
software development
Rather One Of The Things It Buys you and
the whole purpose Of It Is You Can Get
that feedback from a Customer And then
immediately that Becomes your highest
priority work Let's fix What We Just
released to meet Their Needs Before We
Go Down the rabbit hole of building
Something New
grow Way
compit Keep this in mind software
development companies Don't Profit from
Being the efficient at building software
They Profit from delivering the valuable
features to customers I mean think about
if you as
eff
tak longer having to things a little but
deler that It's complete thousands or
Maybe Millions of People want to use I
mean This Is The mindset that software
development companies need to contin
keep themselves in If they're going to
be competitive in the marketplace So
What does this really Mean to project
management well It means a couple things
I'll probably Do a whole video On
estimation And On tasks and things like
that Because I think That's Another
Thing That a lot of teams really
struggle with and a lot of management
struggles with understanding um I'll
Give You The short answer though I think
less estimating is better There's
variety of Reasons but the Less Time You
can Spend trying to think that you know
how long Something Will Take the Better
Chance you can actually Spend your time
Finding Out How long It really takes So
I'm also Big proponent ofb but We Get
into that in a Future video mostly in
this video I just Wanted to expose you
to some ideas that I have Again after
working on many Projects That are you
know agile in one form or another and
really just Get You To Kind of Think a
little bit
about When I start a software
development project and we're gna use
agile methodologies How can I have
conversations with My Pro managers My
product managers My vps my stakeholders
my
customers and get Them To und that
cultur as a company we Chosen to commit
ourselves to Being responsive To You and
so we're going to use AG methods what
that means is we're No longer To commit
To You Hey Two Years from now or a Year
from now we gna Have This
exes instead The Conversation Becomes we
decided to become extremely flexible and
responsive we're going to start
releasing stuff to you Every week or
Maybe Every Day and we're going to have
a formal process for you to Come In And
Give Us feedback and we're going to be
able To Act on that feedback
immediately so in that Kind of
environment project management in the
traditional s of a and making People
estimates
so much as managing the product The
features What what the value Is For The
Customer so hopefully that was helpful
again I really Looking forward to
Sharing a lot of these ideas with you in
these videos This Is Just Be First
videos toel You
little methodology
onin to NS and bol of Okay Jam you know
you told me about your philosophy your
philosophy on Lean software development
What Does that really Mean Now When I
actually go to Put A user Story Together
What needs to go in that user Story you
know What's Different About A user Story
on agile or Lean Pro than One Calling AG
and it's really Waterfall because This
is
So You Know Stick With Me If you like
this video please Give me a thumbs up
and subscribe And I'll be having some
More videos coming to you really soon
Thanks Again foring
