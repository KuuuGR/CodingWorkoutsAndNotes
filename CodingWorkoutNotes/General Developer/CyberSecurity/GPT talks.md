Q: 
How can I start learning cyber security in a positive way, so I can use my knowledge to build better mobile applications and understand more about the security?
A:
Starting to learn cybersecurity in a positive way, especially with the aim of enhancing mobile application security, is a great goal. Here are some tips and advice to set you on the right path:

1. **Understand the Basics**: Start with the basics of both cybersecurity and mobile app development. This includes learning about how mobile applications work, the common programming languages used in their development (like Java for Android and Swift for iOS), and the basics of internet security.

2. **Focus on Secure Coding Practices**: Secure coding is crucial in developing safe mobile applications. Look into best practices for secure coding in the specific language you're working with.

3. **Learn about Common Vulnerabilities**: Familiarize yourself with the most common security threats to mobile applications, such as insecure data storage, weak server-side controls, and insufficient transport layer protection. The OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) Mobile Top 10 is a great resource for this.

4. **Participate in Online Courses and Certifications**: There are many online platforms offering courses in cybersecurity and mobile app development. Some offer more general knowledge, while others might focus on specific areas like ethical hacking or app development for Android or iOS.

5. **Hands-On Practice**: Practice is key. Try to develop small, simple mobile applications and apply what you learn about secure coding and cybersecurity to these projects. You could also participate in CTF (Capture The Flag) competitions or ethical hacking projects to test your skills in a practical, real-world environment.

6. **Stay Updated**: The field of cybersecurity is always evolving, with new threats emerging regularly. Stay informed about the latest security trends and threats by following cybersecurity blogs, attending webinars, and joining relevant forums and communities.

7. **Networking and Community Engagement**: Engaging with the cybersecurity and mobile development communities can provide support, insights, and opportunities to learn from experienced professionals. 

Remember, the journey to understanding cybersecurity and applying it to mobile app development is ongoing. The field is always changing, so continuous learning and adaptation are key. Your efforts to build secure and robust applications will not only enhance your skills but also contribute positively to the broader digital ecosystem.
