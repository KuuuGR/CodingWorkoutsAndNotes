Q: 
Okay, so we can go back to our project. What simple project I can do to use something like cyber security or mobile? Can I use some database online or I don't know how to start? I know the basics of object-oriented programming. I can write simple offline applications, but I don't know what to start to make some application online. What should be good to, for example, show for my future employee, employer, that I understand cryptography, for example, or even I understand how to make online something.
A:
For a project that combines mobile development, cybersecurity, and online capabilities, creating a simple, secure note-taking app could be a fantastic choice. This project allows you to demonstrate knowledge in object-oriented programming, understand how to interact with online databases securely, and apply cryptography concepts. Here's a simplified breakdown of how you can approach this project:

1. **Project Idea**: A secure note-taking app where users can create, read, update, and delete notes. The app will require user authentication, and the notes will be stored online in a database. To showcase your understanding of cybersecurity, you can implement encryption to secure the notes.

2. **Choose Your Technologies**: Since you're interested in Swift and Flutter, you can choose either for the app development. For the online database, Firebase is a user-friendly option that integrates well with both Swift and Flutter. It also offers authentication and storage solutions.

3. **Implement User Authentication**: Start by implementing user authentication in your app. This could be through email and password or via third-party providers like Google or Facebook. Firebase offers easy-to-integrate authentication modules.

4. **Database Integration**: Learn how to use Firebase's Firestore or Realtime Database to store user notes. Understand how to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations securely.

5. **Apply Cryptography**: To demonstrate your understanding of cryptography, encrypt the notes before they are stored in the database and decrypt them when retrieved. This can be done using libraries available in Swift or Dart for encryption, like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).

6. **Security Best Practices**: Implement security best practices such as securing your app against common vulnerabilities, using HTTPS for network communications, and ensuring data privacy.

7. **Documentation and Testing**: Document your development process and test your app thoroughly. Ensure that the authentication works flawlessly and that the encryption and decryption of notes are secure and efficient.

This project not only helps you practice your mobile development skills but also allows you to dive deep into cybersecurity practices by implementing encryption and understanding how to securely handle data. It's a great portfolio piece that demonstrates your skills to future employers by showcasing your ability to build a functional, secure mobile application with online capabilities.
