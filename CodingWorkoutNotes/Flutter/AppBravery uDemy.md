The Xcode error you're encountering is a sandbox violation, which can occur when a script attempts to access or create files without the appropriate permissions. A straightforward solution is to disable the sandbox for user scripts. You can do this by going to your project's build settings in Xcode, searching for "ENABLE_USER_SCRIPT_SANDBOXING", and setting its value to "No". This should resolve the permission issue .
