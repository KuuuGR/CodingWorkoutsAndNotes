Collecting various materials in text files can be very helpful. 
## Here are a few steps to organize it:

1. **Create a Directory Structure:**
    - Organize files by categories, such as documentation, tutorials, code examples, etc. This will facilitate navigation and content management.

2. **Syntax and Code Examples:**
    - Save code examples along with comments explaining what each part does. This can be useful for quick reference and learning.

3. **Notes from Articles and Blogs:**
    - When you read articles or posts, save key points, tips, and code fragments that seem important.

4. **Summaries of Documentation:**
    - Read the official documentation and create summaries or cheat sheets of key functions, methods, and best practices.

5. **Tasks and Projects:**
    - Save ideas for projects or tasks that will help you practically apply your knowledge.

6. **Forum and Discussions:**
    - Save interesting discussions, questions, and answers from forums or discussion groups.

7. **Using Knowledge Management Tools:**
    - Consider using tools like Notion, Evernote, or obsidian.md to manage your notes, allowing for better organization and quick access to information.

Remember to regularly review and update your notes. Practical application of knowledge through writing code and implementing small projects will significantly speed up the learning process.
